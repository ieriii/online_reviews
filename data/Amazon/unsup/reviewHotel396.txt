This is the first place I ever stayed in Chicago, and I'd love to stay here again! I checked in the first night and shared a regular double room with a friend. We noticed that the room smelled a little funky, like wet horses or something. Turns out the air conditioner was leaking water and the dampness had made the sheepskin mattress toppers start to smell a little... sheep-y. We reported the issue in the morning and they very promptly and apologetically offered to switch the room. I was able to check into my own room at the same time, so they gave us two adjoining rooms. I'd booked one of their "junior suites," which turned out to be AMAZING - a huge corner room with a murphy bed, a full living room, a bar, and a kitchenette. Add in my friend's room next door and we basically had a two-bed, two-bath living space that was bigger than a typical apartment. The corner room had a breathtaking view of downtown Chicago, and I snapped a lot of photos at different times of day and night of all of the iconic tall buildings. The murphy bed was pretty cool and actually quite comfortable for something that also folds into the wall! I've stayed in fancier hotels, but this place takes the prize for a truly fantastic room. I had breakfast every morning at the Weber Grill, which has a pretty typical buffet to offer. The hotel is close enough to a variety of convenience stores and supermarkets that you can stock up on some basics and keep them in the room. I really liked the location and got a great deal on that suite when I stayed there. I always check the prices when I'm coming back to Chicago.
