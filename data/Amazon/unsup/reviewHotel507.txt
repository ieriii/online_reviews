By far, one of the best deals on a nice hotel in Chicago. My mom stays here when she comes to visit, and after seeing some of the other hotels she has stayed ta in the city this is by far my favorite. The rooms are two room suites, which give you tons of space. Free breakfast with made to order omlettes, yum- I tried them and they get 5 stars for sure! Free open bar from 5 to 7 I think. This hotel is blocks away from Navy Pier and blocks away from Michigan Ave. I think the average price for a night is about $115, which is super cheap for downtown. Very clean and all of the staff seemed very pleasant. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a nice hotel on a budget right downtown.
