So I just went to book a hotel for the weekend of Lolla and when I called I was quoted a decent price so I booked it on the spot. Well..... then I went to see what went through on my credit card (they run your card for the first nights stay) and it was more than what I was expected. When I called to see what was up with the total, the rude lady working the phones told me that the girl who helped me must of messed up and gave me the wrong rates. She acted like it WAS MY FAULT. My room went from being $239.00 plus tax per night to $299.00 plus tax per night. I'll spend my hard-earned money on a different overpriced hotel.
