You know what? It's been almost a year since I stayed in this hotel, and as time has gone by, I realize I miss it. I was sent to Chicago for a week for work and this hotel was recommended for being relatively centrally located and cheap...and it is indeed both of these things. The style of the hotel could be called "tired" by some, but I would call it American Traditional. Wood is dark, ceilings vaulted, etc. I've stayed in the "Ice Room" in the W in Hollywood, but I actually enjoyed coming back to the Congress every evening more than I enjoyed the modern ultra-hip vibe. There was something cozy about it, and that's important to me because I travel for work fairly frequently, and often on my own too. The only con was the service. Workers aren't very friendly or helpful, and the room service food is overpriced and downright bad. I went to Panera for breakfast every morning as it is located around the corner. Also, the fact that you had to pay for internet was annoying. You pay by the 24 hours and they are consecutive, meaning if you use it for 10 minutes and then use it for 10 minutes 25 hours later, you pay twice.
