I stayed at the hotel last year for a business trip. It was also my 1st time in Chicago. I kinda like the hotel tho. The good: The hotel is clean, decor are not bad, located right off public transportation, downtown setting, great view from my room (don't know if this goes for all rooms), closed to everything with walking distance. The bad: Lobby is kinda small. The people talking next door and I could hear. (thank god I didn't hear anything 'else' at night.) Hooking up internet was a pain. Overall, i would go back again.
