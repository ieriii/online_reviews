This place is very sexy, modern, artsy and much more laid back than most River North hotels - all at the same time. The rooms are actually ... very .... interesting and different. Like ... the room we had, had a glass wall that separated the shower from the rest of the room (of course there was a curtain that could be closed to hide the shower.) Kinda kinky, no? If you are a young, hip person (at least at heart) who appreciates a little upscale swank or classy-kink, you would like this place ... a lot. I also hung out at the rooftop bar. It wasn't completely al-fresco as it was enclosed with full length windows, but no roof. The seating was cushy and there was a huge fireplace in the middle. Again, cool, artsy and different, with amazing views, but also practical. BTW, the shrimp and fried rice I ordered from room service was delicious.
