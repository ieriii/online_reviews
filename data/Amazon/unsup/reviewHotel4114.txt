This hotel was located in an amazing prime location. Cross the bridge and it's the magnificent mile. Go 3 blocks south and it's Millenium Park. Just a block to the left of the hotel, you can catch a bus to anywhere you want.  However, this place was insane. I don't know if it's cause of the bar or what but people were trashed all over the place... boyfriends clinging onto their girlfriends who were trying to run off slurring things to strangers walking by, stumbling around in their heels. This place was a madhouse. The walls for my room were really thin- I swore to god I was in the middle of a hallway but when I got up in the morning I realized I was at the end of a deadend hallway. It made no sense!  This place was ridiculous. If you're a rowdy college aged kid looking to meet other people, this is the place to be. I was here for a casual anniversary weekend with my boyfriend, not to get all liquored up and slobby in a tubetop dress with a bunch of girlfriends, so this wasn't exactly the atmosphere working well for our "romantic weekend".
