Great location. Great views. Great rooms. One star for each. Where does the 4th start come from, you ask? Well, my room had not one but two bathrooms. Two full bathrooms? Three cheers for needless excess! I really like the Hiltons in Chicago. This one in particular offers a great proximity to Grant Park, the lake, downtown, and all the museums. Excellent for people out of town that are looking to be in the thick of things. It's also great for a nice stay-cation.
