We stay here every year in May for the NRA show. (National restaurant Association) Great location, right downtown. The lobby is huge - lots of activity with people socializing, etc. The rooms are a bit small, but not bothersome. Work out room is good as well. The bar has great appetizers and drinks. And the staff is all very helpful. The Federal Express office could of been better. We had a package we were waiting for, we walked down to see if it had arrived. nope. We tried a few times, nothing. Finally we said we need to put a trace, they said they would. They didn't. So we did. We went back down to the office - a regional fed ex guy was there, heard our story and started to help us. It got delivered to another hotel next door. So he walked over there with us. All is good. we got our package. But then we got a call at 3:00 AM, from fed. express saying they were still looking for our package. So apparently after he left us - he didn't finish up with his own company and let them know we found it. (Maybe more training is needed - all the way up the ladder.) But they are apart from the Marriott - so for this review. We will stay again in this Marriott, just as we have been for the last 10 years.
