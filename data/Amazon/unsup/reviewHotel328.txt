I knew when I booked this place I was not getting someplace fancy, so my review is based on that knowledge going in. I paid rather more then I would for a room like this anyplace else, but it was still the cheapest place in downtown Chicago for the night I was in town. The lobby is very pretty and well taken care of. The upstairs floors are dark and rather worn, but still fairly well cared for. The room was small but it was just me and my suitcase so I didn't care. You could hear the trains from the room, but they weren't disruptively loud. The biggest complaint I have about the room is that despite it being a non-smoking room starting about 10pm the room started to smell very strongly of stale smoke. Running the fan/AC didn't help and the windows were painted shut so there was no way to get fresh air in the room. It only got stronger as the night went along to the point where I started to get a migraine from it - needless to say did not actually get much sleep. It was a fantastic location for me to go out and wander from though, and they have a secured and guarded parking garage across the street for those that drive in. Alo free and surprisingly good internet service! Staff for the most part was friendly, except I was looked at like I was from another planet when I asked about the possibility of early check-in. Overall though a decent budget place if you just want a place to crash for the night.
