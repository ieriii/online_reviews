if you like really small and i mean small as 2 people cant walk at the same time, book this hotel !!!!! i was't expecting a dorm room to be that small, i mean a hotel room... sorry but the customer service is great their and the people are nice that they credit us for the other night as i paid less what i paid over there and moved to a better hotel with higher star rating / Hilton and it was few blocks away , i believe they are over pricey and expensive for that type of a room....
