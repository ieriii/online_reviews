US Presidents have stayed in this hotel. This is a good place to stay if you're more interested in going to Grant Park and the Museum Plaza. We chose this hotel because of its location to be close to the museum but far enough from the hustle and bustle of shops in the Magmile. This hotel is part of a history and the decor was dated but I think that's what makes it a little bit charming that its not all linear and too modern on the public areas. I loved the view of the Lake. One thing, they need more concierge on their staffing. They had one concierge on a Friday evening and I thought it was just annoying that we had to wait for over 15 minutes just to get a small map of downtown. Our stay here was great and we always had service in our room so there wasn't much to complain since we were out most of the time.
