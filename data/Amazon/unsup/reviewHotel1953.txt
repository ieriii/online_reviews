I only stayed a night but it was a lovely hotel. The staff was very nice and prompt. It's very swanky and the decor is very hip. Overnight parking is what you'd expect in Chicago. I felt like I was in a nightclub in the elevator, I guess they really cater to a young crowd. The concierge however gave us incorrect information about reservations at a restaurant so that was annoying but I'd still come back.
