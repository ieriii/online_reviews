This hotel is BEAUTIFUL! It has the most beautiful lobby and check in area I have ever seen. Also because of this and the fact that it's historic.. it's incredibly expensive.  When you first walk in there is staff ready and waiting to help you. It has an elegant entry way, 70+ foot ceilings, plenty of luxury seating, chandeliers, and golden elevators. Even if you aren't staying here it is worth a visit.  The staff is incredibly helpful and the front desk is more than accommodating if you forgot something or need directions.  It is located right off the L and the parking is incredibly expensive. What I did was park by Loyola University on the street for free (the campus outside of Chicago) and then took the L downtown.  The restaurants provided in the hotel are very delicious but expect to pay for what you are getting. It's quite expensive. There is however a Starbucks located on the ground floor that has normal pricing. But it is packed in the morning!
