I booked this hotel through http://Hotwire.com at a rate of $81 a night when I traveled to Chicago for the weekend. For this price, everything was great. The staff was incredibly nice and the hotel lobby is really pretty. The room was really quiet and I had no trouble sleeping. Additionally, the location is really convenient.However, if you are going to pay full fare, I recommend making your reservation elsewhere. The room and bathroom wereTINY and the tube TV was from 1992. In this day and age, every hotel should have wireless internet, but at the Palmer House Hilton we had to go downstairs and get a "wireless tower" at the bargain price of $15/day. We had breakfast at the hotel restuarant and it was just ok. If you are short on time, I recommend going downstairs to the corner bakery and having breakfast there instead. If you have time, then it is definitely worth it to make the trek to Tempo!I recommend this hotel if you find a great deal, but otherwise it is worth it to stay somewhere a little more updated.
