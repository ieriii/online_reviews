Events that have transpired since: - Was hit on and invited into the room of a robot impersonator (while in costume) who made up a basketball contract story. He lives there, the door on the second floor with finger swipes in silver paint. - Have found the wireless extremely impossible to access, only way to attempt it is late at night when said "tin man" is up and around which I am forced to awkwardly encounter. -Watched a drunk guy break a lamppost in the parking lot. -Have an old TV now that gets a grainy 3 channels. -Screamed from burning water in irregular shower pressure. -Seen an offering of diet coke made to plastic shrubbery. -Found out "Bistro 90" (named after the interstate) is closed. -Etc. Whatever that may entail. It's a combination of entertaining, frustrating and disturbing.
