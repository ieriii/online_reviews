Excelllent as all westins are! While their beds are the best reason to come here, I also enjoy knowing that the rooms and entire property are going to be spotless! Cant beat the location! We had our 6 month old son so taking public transportation was out of the question so we walked everywhere, which is not hard since you are right in the middle of it all. I didnt like that parking was so expensive, we parked around the corner at some gated lot for 1/3 the price. Other than that i would stay again. We would be staying again during this trip but we decided to check out the omni, i'll let you know how they compare!
