Before arriving to Chicago, I had called the front desk to ensure that there was a shuttle running from O'Hare to the hotel. The employee who took my call assured me there was a shuttle and that it ran 24 hours - although this was contrary to the hotel's website, I took her word for it. Flash forward - I land at 11pm, am outrageously tired and navigate the terminal to find the shuttle service (which is quite a trek). No shuttle there. I call the hotel to ask if there's a schedule or something, and the woman on the phone laughs and says "the shuttle stops running at 7:45pm." Needless to say, I was not happy. Sheraton must have a sixth sense that involves knowledge that I like to write about things on Yelp, because when I checked in, they upgraded me for free to one of the fancier floors with a view of the lake. No free internet, though AND I still had to pay $12 a day for the gym (are you serious). Unlimited membership throughout your stay will set you back $20. The bed was very comfortable and climate control (aka making the room nice and toasty) was intuitive and functioned properly. As a New Yorker, I am pretty used to walking everywhere. Even by my standards, the walk to and from public transportation was a little bit long - 10 to 15 minutes depending on which L train you're taking or the Metra. Good thing is, quite a few L lines are in the vicinity of the hotel. Downtown gets pretty dead at night, so it's not the place to stay if you like to party or enjoy nightlife. 3.5 stars.
