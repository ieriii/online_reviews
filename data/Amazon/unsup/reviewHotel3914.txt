This review refers to the Congress Lounge hotel bar. Our bartender was visibly sloshed. Flies were circling the bar. We asked for B-52s. He didn't know how to make them, so I explained it to him (I'm a former bartender). HE CHARGED US $14 PER DRINK. THe justification was there was three kinds of liqueur in it. EXCUSE ME? I can get a top shelf cocktail mixed by an expert at the Violet Hour for $11, and this incompetent douchewad charges us $14 for a drink he didn't even know how to make. If this wasn't bad enough, filthy glasses and empty bottles littered almost every table in the bar. It's nothing short of a miracle that they have customers in here. I don't normally go out of my way to give scathing reviews but I highly suggest you save your money and avoid this dump at any cost.
