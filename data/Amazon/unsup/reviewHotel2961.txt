Terrible, just terrible... just came back from a conference there.. and it was literally two days of hell.. I mean bad enough i had to be in a meeting for 2 days, after the meetings i have to come back to my nasty little room. Well let me back up for a moment here and give you a little background. I registered for a Deluxe ..something room at $160+ a night.. when i checked in they didn't have any of those available so i got a little room. Since i didn't have a lot of choice and was hard-pressed for time i though well how bad can a little room be? and i took it.. thinking they will adjust prices accordingly. Well it turned out that by "basic" room they really do mean basic. When i finally got up to the room there was numerous issues with the room one of which was that the refrigerator was open and stuff missing from it and it made some awful noise. I asked them to take care of it and they did not so i had to deal with them taking off all the charges from my account for all the boose that i didnt' drink... then lights were not working in the bathroom and stuff like that... I would love to go on for more but i dont have much time. So in short don't stay here!!! I made this mistake once and i will not do it again. Stay in Westin across the street or something.. this place is bad!!!! !!!!
