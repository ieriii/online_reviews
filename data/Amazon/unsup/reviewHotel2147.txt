I enjoyed my one night stay here, but I have one question and one question only... WHAT IS UP WITH THE SHOWERS? Who designed this. If you haven't been it's a huge walk in with a curtain you draw. You could probably fit a good 7 people in that shower, which hey, could be fun, but I can't really see the Intercontinental being "that" kind of hotel. Anyway, here you are in this second room aka the shower and as you are going about your business you pull the curtain and walk back into the bathroom to find the entire floor soaked. How was this a good idea? First of all it's dangerous. Say you were drinking heavily in the hotel (not that I would know anything about that kind of behavior), but then say you took a shower and walked out to Lake Michigan Avenue on the slick marble floor. That just spells danger to me and a waste of towels since it took all but one of the supplied towels to mop it all up. Other than that, the room was HUGE and the views were great. i stayed in the historic tower and it was nice. Also the beds. WOW. I have trouble sleeping, but man o man, did I ever wake up with the best puffy eyed face and out of control bed head. In my world, that means I actually beat insomnia for one night and won! Other than those things it's just a nice hotel that I think a business traveler would enjoy. They do charge $9.95 a day for Internet which seems lame seeing as how you are already paying over $200 for the room, I mean come on, would it kill ya to comp that, but overall a fine place to rest your head. For a romantic romp however, I may stay somewhere else. Again, not that I would know anything about that ;)
