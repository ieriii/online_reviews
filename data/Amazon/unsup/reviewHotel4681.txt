My girlfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend vacation in March. It was $80 bucks a night, which we thought was a great deal. The negative reviewers here need to suck it up. The rooms are small, but big enough for me to work at a desk while my girlfriend watches TV, and big enough for us to dance around the room after consuming several bottles of wine. No coffee machine in the room? Waah, waah, you actually have to WALK TO AN ELEVATOR for free coffee. We loved the Hotel Felix and will be staying there whenever we visit. Here are things we liked: -The hotel seems to have a real commitment to sustainability -The bed is extremely comfortable -The black-out curtain is AMAZING -The entire hotel has a consistent and appealing visual style -Free Wifi -Friendly staff -Good location, close to the Red line and many buses Things that weren't so good: -The fitness center is small and lacking some equipment -The bathroom sink is really hard to use
