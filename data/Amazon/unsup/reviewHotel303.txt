Being a bridesmaid is a rough life. Drinking, party games, pretty dresses... I know, I know... you should all cry for me. There are some hard parts, including staying in a hotel in your own city which boggles the mind a bit, but with a lot of out of town ladies, you roll with the punches and have a blast.  The lobby was small and odd, and for some reason the glass case full of examples of minibar goods cracked me up, but the stay was really a pretty good one. Our room was big enough for five overnight ladies and a few other pre-dinner party game participants and all the gifts and luggage, and other junk that comes along with a mostly out of town bridal party.  There were many nice touches from the bellman's offer of wine glasses when he noticed we had champagne with us, to the heated bathroom floor, to the extra mini-fridge, not just a minibar full of overpriced crap. The other great thing was the free continental breakfast which was perfect as we had a long day ahead of us, and many hours before the rehearsal luncheon.  We chose this place for its proximity to our other bachelorette destination and the comparably reasonable prices. I'd recommend it to people trying to avoid the hubbub and high prices of downtown.
