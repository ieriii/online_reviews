We enjoyed the Chicago South Loop Hotel quite a bit. It wasn't the greatest hotel ever, of course, but it wasn't the crap hole that many reviews suggest. The location is great...yes, it's a little bit away from the main part of downtown but you can drive there in minutes or take a bus up State St. It's really, really easy. Plus you can take a 10-minute walk to the train from here. You can also walk quite easily and quickly to Chinatown. We were staying on the South Side to go to the White Sox game and it couldn't have been much easier to get around and the proximity to stuff we wanted to do was great.  The service at the hotel was somewhat indifferent but certainly not rude. When my card did stop working (due to having it near other cards), it was fixed quickly. The room was quite huge and even had a lounge area in it. That was really nice. The bathroom was utilitarian and perfectly fine. The TV was newer, which was nice. The room had AC, which helped due to the hot weather. Overall the hotel is pretty solid; there's a little breakfast joint in there and some other stuff. It was great not to have to pay for parking. When we were there we didn't have any issues trying to find a spot. I would certainly recommend the place.
