I'd recommend asking for a room on floors 9 and above. These are the newly renovated rooms which are very modern. They also have rooms with two bathrooms so you could request these if you are sharing and prefer your own bathroom. The hotel is across the street from Millenium Park, a few blocks from the Magnificent Mile and close to tons of restaurants and bars.
