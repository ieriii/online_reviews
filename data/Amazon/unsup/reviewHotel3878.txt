Attended a small conference at the hotel and stayed there for three nights (extended for long weekend of sightseeing after the conference). My colleague and I were in total agreement that this was a stellar hotel experience -- on the flight home we tried as hard as we could to find something to criticize and couldn't come up with a single thing! The modern design of the building was wonderful (new construction) and the interior design very contemporary but classy -- just the style we both like. My room was a huge suite with great decor, a huge bathroom with gigantic walk-in double shower and two balconies. The make or break with any hotel room really is the bed and this one was fantastically comfortable with beautiful fine linens. You know, so many hotels have a trendy design aesthetic and decent beds, but what really made this experience supreme was the staff -- they were all young but on their game. Everyone from the clerks at check-in to the room service attendee, to the waiters in the restaurant, to the concierge, to the doormen, to the manicurist, they all just had that special something: a friendly quiet confidence in their manner that made you feel comfortable and taken care of. Bravo to them and the manager who knows how to hire for keepers. Bravo to all! I would stay here again without a moment of hesitation.
