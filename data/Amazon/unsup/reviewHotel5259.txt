We just got back from Chicago. We stayed in the Best Western River North. The service was excellent and we even got upgraded to a Suite for no additional charge. It was a nice modern place, we even had a balcony.I enjoyes the amanities like Indoor Pool,Fitness Room/Health Spa,Pizzeria Ora. I highly Recommend you to visit the hotel once if you go for vacation in chicago. for more information visit http://www.rivernorthhot.  Posted By: Mary Ames, NZ
