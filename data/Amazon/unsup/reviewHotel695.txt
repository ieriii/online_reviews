Very nice courtyard Marriott located in a very easily accessed area of Downtown Chicago.  The staff was super friendly and the room was clean and very attractive. The hotel itself is attentive to individuals in wheelchairs as my wife is in a chair. However the beds in the handicap rooms are extremely tall making it difficult for anyone that is wheelchair bound to gain access to the bed by themselves. The onsite parking garage is a nice option and is centrally located making it easy to get around the Michigan Ave. area of Chicago.
