Just opened but you'd never guess it. Great staff, great feel and look. SERVICE WAS FABULOUS during my business stay for a week! Although i do like modern and busy hotels. If you are a light sleeper it may be tough...the walls are a bit thin and it is a hot spot for nightlife activity, but i enjoyed the accommodations, service, food and staff very much!
