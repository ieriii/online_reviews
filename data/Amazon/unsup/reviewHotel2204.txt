I've stayed at the Intercontinental many times and have had almost universally positive experiences. You absolutely cannot beat the location - it is super central and the higher floors have a great view of Michigan Ave., the Chicago river and the Wrigley Building. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms are nice and spacious.
