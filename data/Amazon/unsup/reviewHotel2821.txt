This hotel definitely caters to families and big groups. The rooms are well-sized and well-appointed (furnishings new/recently updated). The common areas are generally well-kept and clean. The pool is small, but nice, as is the fitness area. There's an "office" services (printer, computer, Internet) which is available (apparently) free for guests.  We've never tried the Manager's Reception (the food doesn't look that great), but the breakfast buffet is substantial, and pretty high quality food. GREAT location - walkable to shopping, eating, museums, etc. You'll save a lot in taxi fares if you stay here. Some of the downsides: a. Front desk staff is pretty perfunctory in how they deal with you. Check-in and check-out can take a long time, and if you want to store your bags (after you check-out), you might wait a long time. b. There aren't enough elevators at peak time (which is pretty much all day during the weekend). Long lines for the elevators, which seem to stop on the lobby level only one at a time. c. Valet parking is very expensive ($46). d. Because of the hotel layout (all rooms face a courtyard), the rooms can be pretty noisy.
