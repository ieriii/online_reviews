I came here for a pre-night event on the top floor (like in the Dark Knight). The view is FANTASTIC. The drinks and the appetizers were alright. But, oh man, the view was just out of this world. I was supposed to be networking and mingling but I kept grabbing another drink and just going to stand-by the windows with a few friends I had met that evening. Such a magnificent view always brings up great conversation and I had a fabulous night. If I could someday afford it I don't think this would be a bad place to host an event.
