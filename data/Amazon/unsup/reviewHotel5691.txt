I had my second stay at this Loop hotel last weekend and once again, the service was solid, reasonably priced for the area, clean, contemporary rooms with free bottled water and wireless internet. I also apprecaite having to use your hotel key to operate the elevator preventing strays from roaming the hotel halls. This time I was given a room with a river view on the Club Quarters side (sister hotels, same building, one reservation, could end up at either) and overheard a front desk agent tell someone that usually CQ is for their corporate/business travelers and the River Hotel for the public. Recommended.
