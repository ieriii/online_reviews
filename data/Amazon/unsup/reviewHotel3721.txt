We had a romantic weekend here once we were trying to get some stress off.Our experience was so good.You feel like you are walking into a piece of history, with its decadent and richly decorated interior,the pictures of a few famous people on the walls on the way up to the Lobby.We spent the saturday looking around this hotel and grabbing lunch on Michigan avenue and then on sunday we went to the hotel restaurant for the Sunday buffet and that was excellent.Best location,being near the Lake and next to shopping.Overall, it was well worth it! We left stress-relieved!
