Great hotel in a great location (right on Michigan Ave.) The only drawback is the hike from the Clark/Lake El Station was pretty long. The price though (my roomate and I paied $180 for 3 nights) was great for the type of hotel. Rooms were cozy and well decorated. Would definetly stay here again if ever in Chicago.
