Wow. Really amazing room. Amazing. Ordered the room through a hotel website. Asked for a corner king with two walls of floor to ceiling windows. What I got was an unasked for upgrade to room 701. Stunning. One bedroom, plus a living room, plus two balconies, plus a spa bathroom with dual sinks, and a shower of epic proportions. The shower was easily bigger than my full bathroom at home. It had two plate sized rainshower heads. One was accompanied by a hand shower wand. The other was paired with 3 aimable heads lined up vertically below said shower head. The shower also had seating at opposite sides of the room. When the glass door to the real world was closed, you could turn the heat up and sit sauna like. It was the best shower experience i've ever had. It will be my inspiration one day when we move out of our condo and into a house and re do the bathroom. Truly, succulent goodness. I guess there was other stuff in the room. Well priced in room wine bar, with no wine over $25 bucks, save sparkling. 40" TVs in the bedroom and living room. Affordable snack bar. Zeppelin iphone dock in the living room which sounded incredible. Why 4 stars? The bed wasn't very supportive. I like a soft bed, but this one was a little too soft. And I suppose the point of a hotel should first and foremost be to get a good night's sleep. Not all beds are alike, i'm sure, and we may have just had a dud. Besides that quibble, this place was incredible. Will definitely have another staycation in the spring when we can take advantage of the beautiful balconies.
