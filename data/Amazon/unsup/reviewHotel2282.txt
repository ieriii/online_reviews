I stayed at the Chicago Marriott Downtown on the Mag Mile during a recent business trip to the Chicago area. The lobby area of the hotel is very nice and a wonderful mix of modern and classy. The bar is pretty nice and for a hotel restaurant, the restaurant within the hotel was pretty good. Plus, there is a Starbucks in the lobby. Additionally, the location almost cannot be beat. It's on Michigan Avenue in the heart of almost everything. You have a great view of the city, you can walk just about everywhere, and it is possible to have a lake view as well. The rooms are an average size, but the bathrooms are tiny. And by tiny, I mean European tiny. Look I'm a guy and I don't really need a lot from a bathroom, but when I can barely stand in the bathroom and close the door... then the bathroom is way too small. Plus, the shower was super weak in water pressure output. The sheets and bed were comfortable and a nice size. i'm only 5'9", so I don't need a king bed... and probably couldn't tell you whether I was in a king bed or queen. They're both more than enough bed for me. Overall, I had a nice stay.
