I stayed at Hotel 71 in November of 2008 for a few nights with the girls. The hotel was very nice. The wi-fi worked well. The room was spacious and fit 4 ladies comfortably. It was so cold outside that we were able to chill a bottle of sauvignon blanc on the window sill! But the room was nice and toasty! The view of the river was outstanding. We were within walking distance of many places. Great location!
