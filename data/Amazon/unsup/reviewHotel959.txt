This place is a wonderful value in the middle of a city that rivals New York in cost. Amalfi is a small boutique hotel that was probably previously owned by a larger chain. I say that because there are a few features that scream "generic chain" namely the bathtub. Beautiful granite countertops greet you only to turn around and see a blah tub with a shower curtain that looks much like my Aunt Ethel's (well if I had an aunt Ethel I think it would look like that). Point being...it is a boutique hotel without 100% execution. Don't let that deter you though...there are plenty of positives. They offer an evening reception with an Italian spread. Fabulous cheeses, meats and olives line the buffet. There is an open bar with a wonderful selection. Try the Amalfitini. Even my non-girly drink consuming husband liked it. They also have a continental breakfast on each floor. I loved the fact that I didn't have to travel far to get my donuts and yogurt. The employees were hit or miss. The bell staff was incredibly friendly and helpful!!! Most of the front desk staff was very kind and outgoing. There were two women that were a bit on the snotty side but we didn't let that detract from our stay. The amenities were fabulous! Aveda bath products and they even offer body wash and not the standard bar soap cheaper hotels have gone too. I really liked that. Internet is fast and free! Parking is valet only but we were able to find self parking down the street a bit. Their valet rates however, were the cheapest I had found. Overall, this hotel was a wonderful Italian gem in the middle of the windy city. We will definitely be back! Oh,,,and if you are bringing your pooch they will welcome him (or her) with open arms!
