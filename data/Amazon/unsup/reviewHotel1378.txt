DO NOT STAY HERE. I chose the Millennium Knickerbocker for my wedding hotel block. I chose it because the rooms were reasonably priced, the location was perfect in relation to where my reception was and the coordinator was very easy to deal with. We signed the contract in January and that was the last good thing to happen. Here are some highlights: -management changed and the new wedding block coordinator had no idea what was going on. she was not timely in her response time and made everything very confusing -on the tuesday before our saturday wedding i called to confirm what time we would have access to the Burnham Suite where my soon to be husband and i were staying but where the groomsmen were also going to be getting ready on Saturday during the day - I was notified that the Suite had been given away!!!! -so the groomsmen had to get ready in a less than appealing conf room, we spent our first night being married in the same room i had stayed in on friday -it gets better -my room was not cleaned, we had arranged for champagne and a fruit tray for when we got back after the reception. the fruit was moldy -oh and it took over 20 minutes to check-in I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE
