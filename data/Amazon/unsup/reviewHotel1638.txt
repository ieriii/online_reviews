A-OK. The reservation desk is on the second floor. Confused the hell out of me, especially when I arrived during the manager's reception, which was crowded as hell. The room was cute but the walls paper thin. Also, the bathroom was claustrophobically tiny. There was unused space in the room so I think they could have redesigned to make the restroom slightly larger. Free wi-fi if you sign up for their loyalty program. All they want is an email address.
