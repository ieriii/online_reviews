Hotel 71 was a decent hotel. Rooms were nice and large and we had a great river view. The hotel was in a great central location as well. Could have used a few more amenities in the room such as a fridge (since, come on, what are you supposed to do with your leftovers!!). Also, room service would come in VERY late, which we thought was very odd...we had a DND on the door and had come back to the room at 5pm and left again at 6pm. when we left, we did not put the DND back on the door since it was so late, well, when we returned late that night, room service had been in...odd they were there so late. The doorman was very pleasant and so was the staff. Oh and I do have to say, the beds were not very comfortable, very stiff and the pillows were too big and awkward. And the WiFi, while free, was S-L-O-W!  I probably will not stay here again unless we get an awesome deal or something.
