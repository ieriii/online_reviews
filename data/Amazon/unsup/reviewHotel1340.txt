During my stay the hotel was under renovation. Overall the service was good and the room was spacious with a great lake view....personnel most of the time attentive. The restaurant quality as it relates to price is not worth. One night the seafood was undercooked and they never took it out from the bill. Three times i had dinner there, and all three times the food quality and dish execution was different(Good to poor). Not my first choice next time that I am in Chicago..but I would consider it as a second or third.
