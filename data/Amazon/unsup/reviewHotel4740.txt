Not a place i would be staying again .. when i come back to visit chicago.. Employees seem to be miserable and hate there jobs .. rooms the size of a closet room service doesnt meet standards for the price .. ammenties are good.. valet parking 45 a night but can park in the garage down the block for 25 a night .. also found ants in the drawers under the bed.. so had to be moved ..
