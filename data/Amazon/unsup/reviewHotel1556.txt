My Friend's Bachelor Party Review #7 Considering the prices of all the places nearby, this place is a spectacular deal. $350 for a suite to house 6 unforgivably drunk 20-somethings comfortably, giving enough room to sprawl out, pass out, and play game of asshole until the former occured. The views of the river were spectacular, and the interior was extremely well appointed, with the exception of a small couch which didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the plush decorations. A few knocks were a gigantic walk in closet which really would serve no purpose unless and extremely compulsive packer stayed here. And the lack of a fridge or ice machine, maybe it was best there wasn't a mini-bar, but c'mon, the beer was getting warm. Did we deserve a place this nice? Can I really write a review based on the purpose I used the place for, a drunken crash pad? Probably not. But I think this a great relatively cheap spot for anyone who wants to stay downtown
