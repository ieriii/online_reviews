Nice hotel, its a little on the older side, but they keep it very clean and the staff is extra friendly. I was especially impressed by the door men and bell-hops. They were not looking for tips, which actually incited me to tip higher ;) Also the house keepers were very accommodating and even checked up on us to see if we needed anything. We were very impressed by their staff.
