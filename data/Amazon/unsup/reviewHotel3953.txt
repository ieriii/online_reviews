For the price and location of the hotel it is decent. Though as other reviews have suggested. The hotel does need to update its image completely. Stepping into the hotel it will remind you of 1940 opulence but without the glamour. If you are in a pinch this is a decent place to spend a night. Also make sure to get a room facing the park otherwise you will be looking into somebody else's room or into the middle of nothing. If you can afford a little more money I suggest you spend it and get a more comfortable place to stay.
