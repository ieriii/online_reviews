Last fall I was at the Palmer House Hilton for a law firm awards dinner in the Grand Ballroom. The service was speedy and well choreographed, the food was good, and the room itself was ornate and beautiful. It's a great traditional old-school hotel. Potter's Lounge at the Palmer House is also a good lounge/bar to go for drinks and appetizers after work.
