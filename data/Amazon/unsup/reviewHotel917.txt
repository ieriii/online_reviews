This was one of the best hotel experiences of my life. A green hotel, everyone is extremely friendly, it has personality, a great location, great beds and decor, and they constantly have Jazz on! Our room on the 6th floor had a lovely view of the Chicago Theater sign. We didn't even really care that there was a construction site across the street. Once that place is done, this will be an even better location! By the way, a great thing to do while you are staying here and you don't have a bathtub at home.... Go across the street to Lush (In Macy's) and get a bath melt and a bath bomb. Amazing. Will stay here again, absolutely!!
