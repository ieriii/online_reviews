Traveling on a budget is what brought me here. If I was not I would have been at the Sofitel or the Grad Hyatt. Location, location, location is the draw here. Located near North Michigan, and Rush is very convenient. Initially we had a queen and requested to upgrade to a Kind facing the front. They did this without any extra charge. Kudos to the staff for being accommodating. I have to warn you though, the carpet mixed with the burning candles they have throughout the lobby was nauseating to me. The carpet needs to be changed in the lobby as well as in the elevator. The floor and the rooms were fine thought, Thank God! This hotel has so much potential to redeem it's old world charm, but it seems like money may be tight.
