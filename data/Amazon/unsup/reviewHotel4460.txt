The hotel lobby is beautiful, and very historic. We really enjoyed hanging out here after hours. The staff is generally helpful. The location is great, and with the shops and the starbucks just down the elevator on street level, it's very convenient. Oh, and the bathroom was also very beautiful. However, we found our room to be too small - there was really no space at all to even walk around. The bed was so soft my husband opted to sleep on the floor one night. The concierge helped us out a lot, but you can't reach them by phone - it just keeps ringing. And for some weird reason, the stores cannot give you any change - they are not allowed and you HAVE to ask the hotel staff for change. Weird. I think the price is too high considering the cons.
