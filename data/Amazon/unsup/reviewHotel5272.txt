Indeed all the negative reviews below are correct. I was always skeptical about reviews, but this is the first one I am writing! I HAVE to tell others not to come to this place! I stayed on 2-star hotels before and my expectations were as such. But this one was atrocious! The carpet was so old it is paper-thin in places and holes are about to show up. All the color was gone. The window curtain was broken on one side with a corner hanging down and some metal sticking out. There wall paper was peeling in the bathroom and some wires were visible too. The room was heavily parfumed (I guess it would stink otherwise) I could not breath. I left after I checked in and got another hotel, forget the money I lost. I felt like I was in a hotel in a third world country like Uzbekistan.
