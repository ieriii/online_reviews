Hotel Felix differentiates itself on style. A self-professed "eco-hostel," the zen interior isn't limited to the spa - it's everywhere. In the lobby, there's a pool of water and a stack of logs (along with the requisite modern furniture). The rooms are also styled in a clean, almost Japanese style. Overall, very stylish. It's in a great spot, too. The hotel is close to Gold Coast shopping, River North galleries, and - should you choose - the tourist traps near Lasalle and Ontario. But, while Felix managed to differentiate itself through style, it still hasn't distinguished itself in service. In fact, service is pretty poor. Whether it's the nonchalant staff at the front desk or the ambivalent cleaning staff, customer service could use some help here. Upon arrival, the hotel lost (and then found, without apology) my reservation through http://hotels.com. Upon entering my room, a dirty towel and used soap remained in the shower. I checked in at 6 PM, giving the cleaning staff plenty of time to tidy up. The room is also pretty small and the oversize furniture doesn't help the situation. The saving graces are there, though. First, there's price. For the location, the price is unbeatable. My total bill was still only in the double, not triple, digits. The business center and gym are convenient and well-equipped. The restaurant - Elate - is first-rate. The bar's not too shabby, either. But, the question remains: what's the point of a few perks when you drop the ball on what you're supposed to do best: serve the guests?
