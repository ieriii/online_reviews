This Holiday Inn Express used to be the Hotel Cass. My friend and I are currently staying here for Lollapalooza and so far our experience has been great. We arrived at around 10:30pm CT on Thursday due to delayed and re routed flights but no biggie. When we got here the concierge already knew my name and was waiting for our arrival. We were upgraded to a King suite. Rooms are nice, clean and modern. Small in size but they remind me of hotel rooms in Europe. I like that. Free breakfast every morning with, eggs, sausage or bacon, cereal, fruit and cinnabuns. Yum. Free high speed wifi with an excellent connection and a business center. Super comfy beds. Lots of pillows labeled soft and firm. Sleeping here is dreamy. Right across the street from Trader Joes and loads of yummy restaurants. We got a great deal on this hotel because we booked months in advance. If you're planning to come to visit Chicago, this is a great and affordable place to stay.
