You can't beat the price! I was traveling alone for a conference and didn't want to over-spend my funding. Travelodge was referred to as the "ghetto" hotel by all the other conference attendees, but I was the only one who GOT FREE INTERNET. Plus, my room was AT LEAST 1/2 the price of what they paid. While not luxurious, it definitely was not a sink hole. I stayed for a week and got to know the staff fairly well. They were friendly and always promptly responded if I needed assistance (like extra coffee or an ironing board). I felt COMPLETELY safe in the hotel and in the surrounding proximity. The hotel is half a block from Lake Michigan and Buckingham Fountain. It's close to the red line, major cta bus routes, and Lou Malnati's pizza. If you call the headquarters to book a room and then find a lower rate, you just fill out a form online and they match the rate PLUS give you a 10% discount. GREAT for people wanting to be IN the heart of Chicago without paying 150-200 dollars per night. With taxes and charges, I spent 7 nights for $600 (on Memorial Day weekend, no less).
