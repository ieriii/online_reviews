I booked a room in this hotel for my friend and myself for the night before her wedding. My idea was to get a great night's sleep and be able to get ready for her wedding day in a beautiful setting. The Intercontinental lived up to all of my hopes. The Intercontinental takes classic hotel charm to a whole new level. The lobby is magnificent and the entire experience makes it worth every dollar spent to stay there. The rooms are beautifully decorated, and the bathrooms are huge! A definite benefit when getting ready for a wedding. 2 things I really loved about this hotel: When our mini-bar fridge started wheezing and whining at 12AM, they sent a repairman up immediately to fix it. Instead of fixing it in the room and keeping us up for the 45 minutes it would take, he actually brought a whole new fridge and switched the broken one out in less than 10 minutes. Sleep lost: none! Second, there's a Starbucks in the lobby. As any Starbucks addict will tell you, being able to get your morning coffee in your pajamas is a wonderful, wonderful thing. Location is great if you're an out-of-towner, rooms are comfortable, service is excellent, and the decor is beautiful. If you can afford it and are looking for more of a classic hotel vs. a modern boutique hotel, definitely stay here on your next trip to the city.
