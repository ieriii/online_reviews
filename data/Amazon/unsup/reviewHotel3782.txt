Pretty cool. Decent rooms, but very pretentious. Odd system of going to the upstairs club, even for hotel guests- take the elevator downstairs and ask to go back upstairs, ask the hostess to let you go to the club, walk through a shady coat check room to the same elevator you just got off and go upstairs again. WTF? Anyway, pretty people and pretty cool rooms. Overall not bad, but not as special as they would like you to think they are.
