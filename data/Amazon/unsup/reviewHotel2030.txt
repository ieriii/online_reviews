Good thing this was not my first time..... We stayed here again on a recent weekend visit. I have to say, if this were my first time here, I would not stay again. We arrived early, but luckily our room was ready so we could get settled. We were "upgraded" to a suite. I say "upgraded" because although the room was big, spacious, and clean, the room was right next to the service elevator. This made for a very loud banging most of the morning. As soon as I would fall back to sleep, BANG! another set of doors opening and closing. The bathroom in the suite was awesome as was the quasi living room, but the desk was kind of banged up and the wi-fi password changed between check in time of noon and 7:00 pm. What's up with that? I will stay here again because the location is convenient and the staff could not be nicer, but I will be specific in my request to not be next to this elevator or any other room that ends in 48.
