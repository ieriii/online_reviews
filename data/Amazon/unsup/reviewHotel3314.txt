My husband goes on business to Chicago, and he asked me to come along last year, and we have been three times this year. I love the HR. Very co fortable, cool vibe, feels relaxed. We will stay at the HR next month in Vegas. It's starting to become our home away from home. Excellent concierge service, sexy bar, great water pressure in shower. And great rate.
