We stayed at the Hard Rock in July, so this review is a little late coming. It was a great place to stay in a fairly central location downtown. The train from Midway has a stop very close and within easy walking distance, so it is easy to get there without having to take a taxi if you do not mind the train ride. We were there for 3 nights and would definitely book this hotel again; we had great a deal, which averaged about $140 a night. The room was clean and huge; at first, we thought we had the worst room in the hotel. The room was located back in a corner by the ice machine and housekeeping closet, yes, it was a tad noisy, but it was a corner room with 6 windows, 17th floor and one of the biggest hotel rooms I have had in a very long time, especially in Chicago. The view was worth a little bit of noise. The beds were great as was the bathroom and the shower was wonderful. We did not visit the bar or restaurant, with so many other great options in this city why stick to your hotel. We were also in town for a surprise party and were on the go quite a bit. Our friend used the parking valet, great service with those astronomical Chicago parking prices. You might be able to find a cheaper parking spot looking on your own, but the convenience of in/out valet was worth the price. The work out room was small; it had maybe 3 elliptical and 3 treadmills with some free weights and 3 or 4 circuit machines, not to bad though. I would definitely stay here.
