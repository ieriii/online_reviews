Very dissapointing from what I thought it would be for a four star hotel. We got this place at an incredible price on Hotwire. Then they wanted to charge extra if we requested double beds... (who does that by the way).. and so we upgraded to a double bed and got a suite.  A suite means you get a couch and some extra space. Totally dissapointed. I thought it meant you get a separate room... right? The valet is okay.. takes about 10-15 minutes to get your car out unless you really call ahead of time. At least there was a place to make your makeshift minibar.
