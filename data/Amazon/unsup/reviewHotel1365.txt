We stayed here for 3 nights. Great location as it's right off Michigan Avenue that you can easily walk to all the shops. If you don't care for the hotel amenities, then this is is a decent place to stay. We were on the 10th floor, but right near the elevator which was annoying at times because we could hear people talking. The room was smaller than expected, but I liked the modern decor and the 42" TV which was the biggest I've seen in a standard hotel room.  Bathroom was clean and up-to-date with a rain shower, but the toilet was surprisingly too high for me that it was a little uncomfortable. The coffee and the coffeemaker were cheap and terrible for this hotel. I think they need to upgrade both.  Internet was $9.95 a day, but we opted out as we did ourselves a favor by not doing any work. From our window, we were able to see a glimpse of Lake Michigan. Overall, a decent hotel.
