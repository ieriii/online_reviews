Very nice boutique hotel in a great location. The room was very comfortable with a great bathroom. Good shower water pressure and lots of counter space. Plus a magnifying mirror and even a little stool that was a nice touch. Much more space than I expected for an urban boutique. Bed was comfortable and the linens were good quality. I like that they desk was a little lower so you could actually put your computer on it comfortably, and it rolled around so it was nice to position it where you wanted it. I could have used a few more outlets near the bed so I could plug my phone in, but overall, the room was very well put together. The checkin was efficient and the staff very helpful. The doormen were really friendly and didn't make me feel like their hand was constantly out for a tip. They do a breakfast buffet on every floor and it was MUCH better than I expected. It was great to just walk out and grab something. They have a cocktail hour that I never made it to - but will next time. I ordered room service from Harry Carreys across the street. This is a great idea since they don't mark up the food, and it's great. They do add an 18% gratuity and a $2.50 service charge, but that's totally reasonable. And it was very fast. I think more hotels should do this, everyone does what they are good at!
