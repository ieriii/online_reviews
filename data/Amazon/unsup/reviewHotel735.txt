This hotel has a great location but the rooms have a subpar ambiance. Clean (despite the mold in the shower), worn out furniture, terrible view, but conveniently located. Good if you don't spend a lot of time in your room and you get a deal on Hotwire. Also very close walking distance to Oak Street Beach. We were allowed to check in early (9:00 am) on a Friday, so that's a definite plus. Call the night before to see if that's possible. 3 stars because of its location and price, despite its flaws.
