OK so to start things off, we stayed there during "Leprechaun Season" which was a mistake on it's own. Me and 3 others got a couple of rooms on the same floor and upon entering my room I noticed some weird things... (1) the pictures behind the bed was missing one (of the two) (2) it looked as though there was supposed to be 6 pictures under the TV (all missing) Personally, when you are paying $250+/night for CHICAGO you think you would get all the fixtures...The rest of the room was ok, very clean. Bed was nice, and big enough for 2 or three ;o The only other complaint I had was, our room didn't have a comfy foot rest for the "red leather deco-chair"... I really could have used that to prop our feet up- guess we should have gotten the room next door!
