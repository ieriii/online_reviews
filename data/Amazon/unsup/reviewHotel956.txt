Ah, the Amalfi Hotel. I love this place. It is bang smack in the center of Chicago, a stone's throw away from tons of great restaurants and the Magnificent Mile shopping area. We got married in Chicago in May and we worked with Dan Wheeler and Moji Akinde as we had about 50 rooms for our friends and family booked here. Dan and Moji were great to work with ... very flexible with our numerous requests and always willing to make this experience easier as, with any wedding, it is one of the 100 things that we had to sort out but this was one where I was happy to leave it to the experts. Thanks Dan and Moji. The hotel itself is great. It is a boutique hotel which was what we wanted rather then the blah-ness of the larger chains. The foyer is amazing (and great for wedding photos). The rooms were large and very modern. The gym has lots of equipment and was seldom busy. To top it off there is also a breakfast buffet on every floor which was great for the morning after the night before when my heart (and head) was not into going out for breakfast. There is also a happy hour which complimentary cocktail and appetizers ... my friends and family did not miss a night here and it helped to make the hotel even more affordable. In summary the hotel is great ... central location, very reasonable rates, friendly staff, clean and modern rooms, complimentary breakfast and happy hour, free WiFi. Highly recommended.
