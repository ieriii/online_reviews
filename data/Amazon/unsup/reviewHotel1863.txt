I stayed at this W on haloween saturday. First when we got there they put us in the wrong room.we had booked a double and got a single. The single room was ridiculously small. So we called down and they put us in a double, it was much larger and the room was decorated fairly nice. When It was time to shower though, i think they may have given us handicapped room, im not sure, because the shower was kind of just on the floor thhere was a curtain..it would make the whole floor wet and youd get really fricken cold because there wasnt a good place for the heat to build up. We had ordered room service, and the food was really good, but they forgot steak sauce for my steak..i waited, and waited, finally they got it to me but by that time my food was cold. They atleast compd me a free martini to make up for it. Finally when it came time to check out, our bill was just under 800 bucks for 2 people...just because we didnt want to take cabs around on drunk haloween night, and thought it would be nice to stay at a "posh" hotel. This hotel would have gotten more stars if it wasnt so expensive, because I can understand and accept mistakes, but for this price I should have gotten much better service, and a much better experience.
