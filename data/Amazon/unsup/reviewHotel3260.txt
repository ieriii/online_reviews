I have never actually stayed here, but from what I've heard from people who have, it's awesome. The decor is very modern and chic, which I love. Although it is pretty expensive, but what can you expect in downtown Chicago. My friend and I ate a light dinner at their Base Bar a few years back (we were seniors in high school and were downtown to sing at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for a school thing that night) and thought we were hot because we were chilling out in a hotel lounge (yeah, that's what us suburbanites like to do on Saturday afternoons to make us feel awesome). Anyway, we each ordered the sampler appetizer platter, and the little mini-hamburgers are fantastic, as well as the artichoke hearts - there were two other things included, but I don't remember (it was over 3 years ago). I'm assuming they still offer it. Additionally, the hotel donated an awesome overnight package to Northwestern's Dance Marathon (a huge philanthropy event), and I know they work with a lot of local and suburban businesses, so they get mad props for that. And, when my friend and I went there, the bartender was a former contestant on Big Brother (I think like the 2nd season maybe? The one when they brought everyone's ex-boyfriends on...I think her name was Amanda?)
