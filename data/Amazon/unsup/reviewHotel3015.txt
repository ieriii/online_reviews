Have you ever met a drink that just changed your world?? The mango mojitos are just to die for! These babies can probably bring world peace and end all wars after one sip or gulp. They are made right in front of you with fresh fruit and mint. (Thanks Mitchell now I crave mojitos! haha) They do come in other flavors as well, but who doesn't like mango???? You can take your fabulous mojitos and sit out side on the warm nights or days...there is lake michigan in front of you. Word to the wise it can get quite packed on weekend nights, so go a little early. The hotel its self is not too bad. Good views over all. Great guest service. Bliss soaps, shampoos and lotions in the bathroom. Its also a great way of trying out Bliss products instead of shelling out the 30 plus bucks. I am not a big fan of the whole wooden window thing that seperates it from the room. Couldn't they just use frosted glass like aloft??? Overall, the rooms are good. There is a pool upstairs, but it is small and not heated in the winter...bburrr!!! The W also has a bar on their top floors. Before it used to be open to who ever, but now you must present a key to get up there. Nice for their guests safety. Since it is now just for guests, the bar can be a hit or miss with the crowd and music. Recap: Bar upstairs (meh) + hotel room and stay (good) + lobby bar (good)= we will give you a 3
