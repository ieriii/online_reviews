I arrived here at about 11 PM on a Sunday night exhausted, grouchy, and a little irritated after a 4 hour flight from San Francisco. I had a 7 AM meeting and work to finish before I went to bed. The lobby itself was beautiful, low lighting, candles, modern furniture but a little small but still very chic. A lot cooler than the one in my hometown of SF. Sorry. :-(  My room was nice, big king sized bed, flat screen TV, desk, the usual amenities for a nice hotel.  Things I didn't like: - $20 plus breakfast of oatmeal and coffee. WTF? Is it organic oatmeal? Is the coffee hand delivered by Juan Valdez? I know there is a premium for room service but it's just oatmeal.  - Ugly views, really, my window faced another brick building and was located near the train.  - Pretentious front desk staff. Do I sense a little snobbiness? I can tell when you're being rude, and acting catty, I maybe sleepy, tired, but I'm not STUPID! I would appreciate it if in the future you didn't give me certain looks. You know which one, "I wish you'd hurry up..." or "This smile is fake, but I'm doing it because my manager is watching me."  A ho hum experience, nothing spectacular.
