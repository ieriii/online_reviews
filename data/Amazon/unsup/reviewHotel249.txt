We stayed for a week and were very pleased with the location of this hotel. Easy to get to anything we wanted to do. Lots of places within walking distance. The train is within a couple of blocks and is easy get anywhere. Convenience stores, restaurants and night life close by. Hotel is located in a nice, safe residential neighborhood . The staff was very attentive and helpful. We did not even bother with a car the whole time as it was not needed.
