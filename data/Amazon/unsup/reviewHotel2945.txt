I got my first view of this place today at a one-day conference... and while the copious amount of food and drink the hotel provided us throughout the course of the day was nicely presented, interesting, and fresh, when we arrived in the morning we were mis-directed to our target location on three separate occasions; apparently my event never made it onto the docket, so rather than owning up to not knowing where to send us, the different employees figured it would be fun to send us on a snipe hunt. The mitigating factor was that all the conference rooms we checked out were very nicely decorated, and all the various escalators we explored were in front of the river-view side of the building, so we were all treated to a (dreary, overcast) view of the river.
