I stayed in the Burnham while I was in Chicago for a conference. It's a small, boutique hotel owned by the great chain Kimpton. All the Kimpton hotels I've stayed at have been lovely and the Burnham is no exception. Rooms are decent sized for such a small hotel. I happened to get the handicap accessible room so my bathroom was oversized (NICE!). Good water pressure and and nice toiletries. Big flat screen TV and a mini-bar. Towels and linens were good quality and the bed was very comfortable. My room faced the street and you could definitely hear the city sounds so if you don't like honking and such, ask for an interior room. But interior rooms have no view and I was able to watch the city speed by, which I like. There is a restaurant attached and while I didn't eat there, I did get a glass of wine both nights. The menu looks very nice. There is also a nice manager's happy hour in the evening if you would like a glass of wine. I would recommend the Burnham highly. It was in close proximity and walking distance of the river, Miracle Mile, and Millenium Park and museums. A great location!
