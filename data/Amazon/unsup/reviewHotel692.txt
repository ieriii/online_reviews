This is really a very solid property just off the Mag Mile, which means things are quieter. In fact, I barely heard a sound in my room, and turns out there was a young family in the room next to me with noisy kids (according to them). Property couldn't be more convenient to many dining choices in Streeterville, River North, and Mag Mile. If looking for a quick sandwich, Timothy O'Toole's is a below-street sports bar with good burgers and salads, albeit noisy. Ask the hotel concierge for a 20% coupon. Multiple convenient Zipcar locations nearby as well. My room was smallish, but very clean and comfortable. HVAC was quiet and easy to set. Yelp check in special at Viand next door (enter through hotel lobby) was very nice, and I recommend this place in the evenings for a quiet drink in a nice space. I also recommend the breakfast buffet in the am next door at Viand. Great waitstaff and good food, clearly there were a lot of regulars and the employees loved their jobs. Only complaint about the Marriott is that at check out time the wait for an available elevator may take a while. The hotel is very popular, and for good reason. Very reasonable prices and a great location make this a very good choice.
