I concur that 3.5 stars just about nails this place. It was just ok really. i will give kudos to the bellman as well as the helpful concierge. As a matter of fact, I really liked our waitress in the wine bar too, so maybe I will give SERVICE a 4 star and the hotel room itself a 3 (nothing too special). the location was great, smack in the middle of anywhere you want to go along the "Magnificent Mile" and easy enough to grab a cab anywhere else.
