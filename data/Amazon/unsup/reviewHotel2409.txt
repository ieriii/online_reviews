Although I did not stay at the Chicago Hilton, my employer had two galas in the ballroom in late October. All I can say is my oh my, do I wish I had the cash to have my wedding in this place! Stunning from floor to ceiling, with glitzy gold and mirrors everywhere to reflect the shimmering light. I could do without the disco ball, though; odd decor choice for such a beaux-arts-type venue.
