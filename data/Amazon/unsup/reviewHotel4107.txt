The hotel is enormous, and there are A LOT of conventions and people do deal with walking through the enormous lobby. The staff is generally friendly and the Hyatt Club Lounge is a very nice perk (with drinks and snacks). The rooms on the Club level are renovated and have good views. It's not a "cozy" hotel, but it's conveniently located and you can often get a good price for a hotel with these amenities.
