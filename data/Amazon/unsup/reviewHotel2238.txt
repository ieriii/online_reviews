i stayed at this hotel a couple weekends ago with my family (who were in town visiting)... my mom thought she would splurge for a nice hotel on michigan ave to make their visit extra special. she bragged that she found us a four and a HALF star hotel- fancy from where i come from. we got in the room- bleh. the a/c barely cooled the room on a warm/not even hot summer day. bathroom was a little outdated and 'used'... not the cleanest ive ever seen. and the staff- like robots. location is great, yes, but there are cheaper and nicer hotels in the city.
