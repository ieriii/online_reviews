I'll have to start off by saying that my friend knew a person working there, so I may be a little biased. My initial impression of this place was definitely "where the heck am I going." It is located in a fairly desolate area in the west loop and we entered in through the back door. Mix the signage on the front and I thought to myself that it should be called "Victor Motel" instead... Inside the place exponentially raises the bar on style and has a definite club/lounge feel. The area itself is very open and had a nice feeling of not being crowded even though we packed it in. The crowd itself was about 50+ of people I knew, so I can't comment on that as everyone was friendly. I did have a few complaints. The first was the requirement that we be stamped for free drinks. This forced me to fight my way back through the crowd even though I had already had a couple rounds without being asked to show anything. Also, they stopped the free drink promo 10 mins early, which ticked off alot of people. (myself included) Otherwise, we did end up getting bottle service and it was by far better than I've been treated elsewhere. We were told upfront that it was $200 and the service was great.
