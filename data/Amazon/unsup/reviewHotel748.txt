I love staying here whenever I come to Chicago. The service is great, the rooms are fabulous and I have never had a bad experience. We got a room at the last minute after hating our room at the Omni hotel down the street. They were able to get us two adjoining rooms, one for my parents and one for my brother and I to share. The rooms were spotless, the beds were fabulous and the staff was fantastic. Plus, it is a dog friendly hotel! How great is that? We had breakfast in the morning downstairs and were regulars at the bar in the lobby! Can't wait to go back soon!
