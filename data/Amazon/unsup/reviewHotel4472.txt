+ less than a block from the red line, two from the blue, and the wabash exit puts you really close to the adams/wabash stop on the loop + we lucked out and ended up getting a huge king room on the honors floor for crazy cheap - there were dirty glasses in the room and it took them a long time to get us replacements - on a busy saturday there were two people working the lobby (1 at concierge and 1 at check-in). wtf?  - there are charges for everything! consider asking for a room that faces state street, you might be able to use some internet. + the bed was huge, the sheets were nice and clean, and the thermostat worked
