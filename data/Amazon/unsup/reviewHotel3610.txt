The lobby is very nice and ornate. It's "historic" I suppose, and it should be respected for being a landmark, but it's too old and tired for me. The room was a little bigger than a shoe box, and the bathroom didn't have enough room to change into the robes hanging on the door. The view was nothing more than the windows and concrete of more buildings. I'm sure if you get something overlooking the lake, it's better, but the TV was tiny, the bed was hard and a wee bit sagging, and the staff, pretty snooty. Again, the lobby and stairs are really nice. Too bad the rooms aren't more like that.
