Upon entering the hotel, I knew that I'd found my home away from home. It wins the prize for best lobby- you'll actually want to hang out there and with rooms decorated in creams and whites, I easily conjured heavenly and celestial images. The express lunch offerings are genius- I recommend the beef brisket sandwich. My husband declared that the morning coffee offered in the library is the best he's ever tasted. The freshly baked pastries, specifically the blueberry muffin, is a must for getting your day started. The gym, though small, is well-appointed and had everything I needed. The staff is warm, friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location nestled in a pristine residential area but close to the beach, and in walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park and the action on State Street. If you're looking for a fun yet relaxing place to stay where you'll feel comfortable but not miss any of the Chicago's energy, stay at the Public Chicago. Wins the prize for best lobby- you'll actually want to hang out in it.
