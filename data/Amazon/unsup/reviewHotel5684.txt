Stayed at the River Hotel Thursday night for a quick two trip to enjoy some Chicago fun with the wife. This is a great little boutique hotel on the Chicago River, just a block off Michigan Ave. Clean, modern decor room - all interior was pretty new with "step up" quality. Shower only, but I like not having to step into a bathtub. Pretty decent room size, too.  Fantastic access for the price, right off the Magnificant Mile, and only a couple short blocks from the El. Surrounded by other pricier places wanting your money. Nice touches - elevator only allowed access to the floors with your room key; filtered water dispenser on every floor with new bottles for you to fill and go, great for us summer tourists. Front desk personnel very pleasant and helpful. During checkout, manager directed me to self-checkout machine, and guided me through entire process. Not necessarily more efficient, but showed their willingness to make the process easy. Price was incredible. $112 ($130 with taxes) through Hotwire, for a summer night right in the heart of the action. Past stay at similar time cost $150 + taxes at a tiny, tiny Red Roof Inn off Michigan Ave. Or you go you big and drop a few hundred at the name hotels.
