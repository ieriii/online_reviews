I always wondered what is so special about Ritz Carlton until I happen to stay there. As far as location is concerned, this particular Ritz is located in close proximity to the finest dining and shopping boutiques of Chicago.  As soon as I entered the hotel I was greeted by staff member who escorted me to the main lobby. The lobby has marble floors, thick carpet, lots of pillars, a fountain and chandeliers which gives it a very grand look. After the check in with friendly staff i headed to my rooms. The bedroom had dark colors like most of the European hotels with colonial style furniture giving a very majestic appeal. My bed room had view of the art museum and park across the street I received exceptional service during my 2 weeks of stay. They offer complimentary shoe shine everyday .I gave my clothes for laundry one morning and upon my return, I found two cane baskets on the bed with Ritz Carlton wax paper. My first thoughts were, hot fresh bread but when I opened it, it was my laundry, ironed and folded. I was totally blown away. they have a pretty decent gym/work out room with very courteous staff. they even provide Personal trainer service upon request. the locker room is even better than a country club with mahogany lockers, wool carpets and leather chairs. Honestly, I have never seen a locker room so nice. All in all, i was impressed by the personal attention i got . the hotel staff was extremely observant and seemed like the policy was never let the customer ask for it twice. Every evening upon return i use to find bottle water by my bed side, favorite music playing and bath robe placed on the bed. Perfect way to unwind after a long day. Not to mention having a cab ready at 8am sharp with out asking. As i mentioned, all the hotel staff is very attentive.
