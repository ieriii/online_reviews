Oh, Omni, I expected more from you. I stayed here for 5 nights and was satisfied with most of what I saw, but not wowed. The bed was one of the more comfortable beds I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on in a hotel. What staff I interacted with were very polite and friendly. Plenty of channels on the TV. Valets were prompt and helpful, but parking was a little more expensive ($49/day) than most of the other hotels I researched in planning this trip. Location is great, close to plenty of shops and restaurants as well as an El stop (red line). And they take the government rate, which is always a plus in my book. However. Two major problems: 1) Internet service is a must in any hotel nicer than a pay-by-the-hour motel. Omni has wi-fi, and it's free if you join their free loyalty program. If you don't join the program, you can pay, and that's fine. However, about half the time I was at the Omni I couldn't connect. I called their internet service line, and the guy told me that their servers were full and to "keep trying." I usually had to "keep trying" until the next day. To effectively not have internet available is not acceptable, especially in a hotel that gets so many business travelers. 2) Weird smell in the bathroom accompanied by a toilet that wouldn't completely flush. I'll spare you the details, but somehow there were always, uh, "leftovers," no matter what I was flushing. As for the smell, it was not overpowering but kind of reminded me of the poor plumbing you find in Europe. The internet thing bars me from staying here again if I ever come back to Chicago for business. If I ever come back to Chicago not for business I will probably not stay here either, knowing that there are better, cheaper hotels in the area.
