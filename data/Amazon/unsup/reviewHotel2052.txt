Five stars for the incredible views of Chicago and the river. Three stars for a very average Holiday Inn room with cheesy decor. Three stars for the food. Meh. Four stars from a location that, if need be, allows you to get off a plane at Midway and barely go outside to the winter air to go into the Merchandise Mart where you can look at faucets on your way to the Holiday Inn. Some people care about that. Did I say five stars for the view of the river?
