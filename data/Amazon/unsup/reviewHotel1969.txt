Stayed here over Labor Day weekend. Loved it here, clean, gorgeous, convenient location close to everything in a safe part of town. I went jogging down the street and by the marina, which was absolutely beautiful. You can walk to most everything or take a short cab ride. The bar and restaurant are also excellent; the food was delicious. My room had very clean, simple and modern lines (7th floor). My family rented one of the condos on the 44th floor with a wrap-around balcony, the views were absolutely amazing. The door men were exceedingly helpful and friendly! I especially loved the outdoor pool, track, and garden area. My only disappointments were that this area closed to guests -- you couldn't even walk around! And the hot tub was not as hot as I would like, and a little too small. Although there was free WIFI I did not always get a good signal. But other than that, fantastic! I would definitely stay there again! :)
