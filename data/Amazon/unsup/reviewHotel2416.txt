For starters - we got a great deal on this hotel from Hotwire. The location is ideal - close to Grant & Millenium Parks, 2 blocks from Dunkin Donuts, close to shopping and a short cab ride to Rush Street. The hotel itself is beautiful, although the rooms are dated. The biggest blow, though, was parking. $55 for valet and $45 for self. At that point I made a mental note to never complain about parking in LA ever again, and then went down the street and parked for 24 hours for about $20. What made me absolutely the happiest about our room was the fact that it had TWO bathrooms. We had a room with two double beds and TWO bathrooms. Be still, my beating heart. Also, all the hotel staff were helpful and accommodating (except with late checkout they said they'd have to charge if it were past noon.) Also, I had some sort of an allergy attack and benadryl at the gift shop was $17. Yes. $17. So I walked the half a mile to Jewel-Osco and it was all good.
