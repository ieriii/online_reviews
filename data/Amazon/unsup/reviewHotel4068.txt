What a huge hotel which has both its benefits and downfalls. We had such a great deal on a hotel suite here and the rooms and beds are very comfortable. Service is friendly but takes a while. I understand that this is a large hotel but waiting an hour for a rollaway bed was frustrating. Also, parking is super expensive here and took us nearly 1.5 hours just to get our car out of the parking spot. Look around for other public parking lots and park there for half the cost of parking at the Hyatt.
