The problem with this hotel is that it is a piece of Americana that has gotten OLD in a country obsessed with NEW. I LOVED the charm of the hotel and would give 5 stars without a thought....EXCEPT hotel experiences always boil down to the bed. The Congress Plaza beds must be original to the building. I'm talking 6 inches with crazy springs and no box springs. Cheap mattresses thrown down on wooden slat platform beds just doesn't cut it. When they get new mattresses- I'll put every one of my out of town visitors here;) EVERYTHING else is great- I felt like I was at Daddy Warbuck's house but he was penny pinching on the bedding.
