BEWARE BEWARE this hotel charges for everything!! Internet, fitness center, parking and badge storage. Not only do they charge you but the fees are out of control. After paying $1700 for a four night stay I had to pay $45 a night for parking $16 a day for Internet, $15 a day for the fitness center this is completely out of control. Oh but the wifi is offered for free in the lobby but really when staying on the 18th floor and going up and down to do work is ridiculous. I could understand if the hotel nightly rate was cheaper to charge all these additional fees but it's not. The trump hotel and the W has the same rates and provide Internet and fitness center FREE to its guest and their location is far better placed than the Hilton. I stayed at the Hilton for a conference but next time I will stay someplace else and take a taxi to the conference. Also The Hilton is about a forty five minute walk to all the good shopping and dining so if your not a walker you will be paying about $20 bucks a day for a round trip taxis ride.
