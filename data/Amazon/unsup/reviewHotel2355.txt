I've stayed here a couple times and had good experiences. That said I've only stayed on the HHonors floor which is almost like a mini hotel inside the big hotel. It even has a separate check in area on the floor itself so you don't have to deal with the main check in area. The only thing I don't like about the HHonors floor is that the free breakfast is continental only while you usually get a free hot breakfast at most Hiltons with the HHonors floors. The hotel itself is in a great location and has all the usual amenities you would expect. The rooms themselves are average sized but look to have been very recently updated. The views from the lakeside ones are great although I don't think they are worth the extra money they charge.
