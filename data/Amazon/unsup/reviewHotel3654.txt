OK, I'm bummed about this because I just gave them four starts. But it turns out they double charged me for some of my mini bottle drinks and I have had duplicate charges on my credit card since April 27th. 3 phone calls and 2 emails later, no one has helped me. They keep telling me they are going to resolve it, but its getting a little tiresome. I mean - its $35 dollars from the Drake, but dammit, I booked through Priceline. I'm not a big spender and I just want my money back. :(
