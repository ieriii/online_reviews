Got cheep rates here at the last minute on one of the .com hotel sites. The rooms were nice nothing amazing though but the location was great. They concierge was helpful but we got some lip from one of the valets who said we couldn't bring in alcohol. They were in the middle of some renovation so there was some construction but overall the place was clean and pleasant. I would stay again if I get the same cheep rate.
