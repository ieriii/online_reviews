This review is for the hotel cafe/bar and parking -- I did not stay here but visited friends who were (and forgot to check in on Yelp... #amateur). Coming from a Chicagoan, the location of the hotel could not be any more central; it's steps from all the major spots in the city. The lobby at the Ritz is lovely, but getting there can be a bit confusing as it isn't actually on the ground floor. I had my car valet parked (the prices are much higher than any garage), and then I was instructed to take the elevators to the 12th floor. Once I arrived, we went to the cafe for drinks. I had some of the best cappuccino I have ever had. I have no idea what it cost, but they were made with good espresso and had proper foam. I don't think I judge anything harsher in life than cappuccinos, haha, so if I say it was good, it was GOOD! They are 1/3 of a Starbucks tall (read: size of a real capp in Europe) but so good that I savoured every molecule vs. the mammoth Starbucks size which I gulp down in a few minutes. If it was $4-5, I would gladly pay that here because, although a fraction of the size, the quality was worth it. It also came with a wonderful biscotti that had cranberries in it, I believe.. Yum. Just yum. Our tray of pistachios was constantly replenished as were glasses of water; the servers were very attentive. There is also free Wi-Fi. My only complaint would be that there is no bathroom at the bottom. I didn't realize that I had to go until I was waiting for my car, and from there I discovered that I would either have to go back to the 12th-floor lobby or up to the food court at neighboring Water Tower. All in all, a pleasant experience. I wouldn't go back on my own, but if you want to invite me, I won't say no. ;)
