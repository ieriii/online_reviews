Loved the Drake burger. A sizzling patty of corn-fed Midwestern Black Angus beef that was perfect after a long flight from SF. I also loved the sense of history, the location and the immensity of the rooms. The Manhattan I downed at the Coq D'Or was a serious concoction. I hated that my girlfriend and I ended up in a smoking room after explicitly requesting a non-smoking room and I really hated that they lost/hadn't moved our bags from the smoking room to the non-smoking room on day two of our stay. It took multiple calls to the front desk from our new non-smoking room and a visit to the front desk to get this resolved. We got a coupon for a free breakfast for having to stay in the smoking room. For the lost bags they offered another breakfast coupon. Pathetic. I informed the staff that I would stay at the Peninsula on my next visit as a result of the lost bags and the subsequent coupon offer. They ended up giving us 25% off the stay, which was thoughtful, but the damage was done. I recommend visiting the Drake for a drink. Try a modern hotel for your stay.
