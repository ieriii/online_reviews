The design and over-all look to the place is fun and refreshing from your standard generic hotel fare -- sure to attract many a hipster. But it seemed like it was mostly old ladies in town to see Tommy Tune in Dr. Dolittle or some other show, as this place is smack dab in the theater district. The price is right, and the staff are actually pretty helpful. We had a tub that wouldn't drain and by the time we got back from breakfast it was fixed. Not bad. The TV is the sadly the same 2001 fakey flat screen Toshiba that I have at home -- and it had a bad hissing problem until I figured out the volume settings were all wonky. But still, not bad. The wifi was working and the Chivas in the wet bar was only 5 bucks so I was happy. Then came Monday morning. 9 am. It sounded like a guy was having a wrestling match with his vacuum cleaner outside our door. Tried as a might to sleep through it, I just couldn't. The guy was yelling, banging around, vacuuming up a storm, seemingly in the same square foot of carpet right next to our door for at least a half hour. And right as I'd given up all hope of not having to get out of bed and calling someone -- he moved on. Not the way you'd want to be woken up after a long night. But aside from that incident and the small nit-picky things, it was a good place to stay. It was too bad we weren't around for the free wine services -- that seemed like a nice bonus. I can't say anything about the restaurant or the bar that are next door, they looked a bit over-priced and well, not the kind of places I'd go to. But those places probably have their own yelp pages.
