I had been here before years ago and was only here for one night this trip. Back to my usual how can you screw up one night. The hotel and location are great. Of course love the heavenly beds. I had a very nice room on the Starwood Preferred Guest Floor. They had coffee on the floor in the lobby area in the AM, would be nice if they threw in some snacks too. My view was of the building next door so that was less than to be desired, but my room was spacious and recently renovated. The dual shower head was nice as well as the toiletries. The place was pretty crowded since there was a convention of sorts in town, I didn't get a chance to check out the facilities because my trip was packed and very short. My only question is why do the stores in the Bloomingdale's' shopping center close soooooo early. I went over there a little after 7pm and it was a ghost town (nothing against the hotel) - just a note for people visiting expecting to get a good shopping experience in. In fact most of the stores nearby looked closed. A bummer because sometimes after a long day of meetings you need some retail therapy.
