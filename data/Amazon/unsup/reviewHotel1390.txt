Review only for the bar. Staying nearby, tired, just looking for some Silver Patron, an olive flight and some chard. $63 later, we were happy and full. I certainly would not make a special trip here, but I can't complain a bit. ps: The bartender, David, is one of the coolest guys ever. I enjoyed his slightly antagonistic approach to the suits venturing forth for a glass o' merlot n' some fried pickles (very authentic, according to David)-- an actual quote we enjoyed "Naw, we GOT Memphis here in Chicago!!!" in response to some fool trying to say that Chicago was NOT the best midwestern city.  pps: we saw David making something that looked like a Frappuccino with a kick. Vanilla ice cream plus some other fun stuff-- you might want to get this...
