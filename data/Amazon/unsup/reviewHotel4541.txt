The Palmer House was very nice to me and my compadres when were in Chi-town for the Associated Writing Program's (AWP) Conference in February. I fell in love with Chicago, probably because of how well we were taken care of here. We had one of the fancy pants suites, so we had two beds, a couch, two bathrooms, our own TV, a lot of nice things. We did not get BRAVO though, which severely hampered our ability to watch Top Chef. No matter, the complimentary breakfast and late night snacks made up for it. All the cranberry juice I could drink! The location is wonderful, in the downtown of Chicago, just a short distance from The Art Institute of Chicago Museum. I am certain there are cheaper places, but I really liked where we were.
