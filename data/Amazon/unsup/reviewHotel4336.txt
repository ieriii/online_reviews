The Palmer House is a worthy destination if only to spend time in it's magnificent lobby, which resembles more than anything, the most opulent and bizarre of Masonic Lodge interiors. Sadly, the current management of the hotel leans totally on it's great historic beauty; it in fact exploits it. What should by all rights be a "luxury hotel" (which one expects when reading about it's historic beauty), fails miserably; the experience can be characterized by mediocre service and a noticeable lack of amenities; it is a wasted treasure, misunderstood and poorly managed by it's current overseers. On a specific note, we were very irritated by the terribly inconvenient internet situation, they had NO wireless and charged $14.95/day for a direct cable connection at a desk in your room - this means you are chained to the desk for all internet activities. This was a real inconvenience. (but do see my photo of my handsome husband, Jon, chained to the desk by a short DSL cable!). Having said all this, the location (in the heart of downtown) is great - very convenient to public transit and taxis, centrally located with easy access to museums and many interesting neighborhoods and with several excellent restaurants nearby. And honestly, the huge, spectacular, historic lobby, in all it's splendor, makes it all worth it. The rooms are clean and acceptably appointed, if not inspired. The price is reasonable and it's a far more interesting place to stay than the cookie cutter hotels one tries to avoid. In a nutshell you will be sufficiently comfortable and you will get your moneys worth from the sheer character of the place.
