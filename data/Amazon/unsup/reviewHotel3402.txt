The Allerton is a lovely refurbished hotel situated on Michigan Ave in the middle of the Magnificent Mile shopping district. It is an independent hotel, so no loyalty programs for you to rack up points or miles! The rooms are quite spacious and comfortable. My wife and I shared a suite with a king size bed. The bedroom had a 36" flat screen LCD TV and the living room had a 50" one! There are 5 elevators, so you never wait too long. The room WiFi signal was strong and the bandwidth throughput (download AND upload) was much better than most hotels at which I stay. The restaurant is pretty nice. I enjoyed breakfast with a made-to-order omelet. No complaints there. What impressed me the most was the rate: $99/night. Seriously!! We'll be back, no question!
