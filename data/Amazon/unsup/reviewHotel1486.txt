This was another deal snagged by boyfriend on Priceline. The hotel was very centrally located and everyone working there was extremely nice. We had a room perfectly suited for 4. Two of us got the closed-off bedroom and the other two got the (comfy) sofa bed. The flat screen tvs were a great addition to our room. Although the room itself wasn't too spacious, it was perfectly fine for our 3 night stay.
