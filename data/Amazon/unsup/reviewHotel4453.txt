I went to a wedding reception at the Palmer House and the Empire room was the perfect setting. It's old school with black and gold decor and it's just beautiful. Elegant and very fun.  My one complaint was that the food was pretty bland - which I guess is to be expected when you have 200 people eating steak and chicken at the same time. The initial course - butternut squash soup was awesome and it sort of went downhill from there. Don't get me wrong, it was still plated beautifully and it tasted ok, it just wasn't awesome. And the cake was way too rich. But overall, a beautiful setting for a happy event, good service, well thought out and nice presentation.
