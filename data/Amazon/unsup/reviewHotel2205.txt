I always recommend this hotel to my friends and family when they visit Chicago. It's not as trendy as most of the hotels I like, but the rooms are very nice and it's an amazing location (especially for those who love to shop). My parents have also found hotel rooms here for as little as $159/night, which is quite a good deal for a nice hotel in Chicago!
