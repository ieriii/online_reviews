This boutique hotel has a very personal approach to your stay here. The bellman, Perry, was so helpful and asked questions not just to ask them, but he truly carried on a conversation about where I was from, how my flight was,and took such great care fo make me feel welcome. I love the staff because they have such a warm, friendly approach, not stiff and uptight. The apartment I rented across from Talbot had such a horrible dirty place when I showed up, and came back to Talbott after discovering my apartment had mold( yes, 25 E. Delaware) and the stove in kitchen leaked gas. I had no help from my apartment people at the condition of my apartment. When i came back to Talbott to stay, they came across the street to this place I was staying and brought my bags over, put me in the same room I had before I went to the apartment from hell, and were so kind and understanding. I ate dinner in the bar that evening,and George gave very excellent service,and this hotel feels like home... I have stayed many other places..five star hotels,and there was always some crotchety person that made it not so great. But Talbott...with their huge bath towels,turn down service, timely room service, excellent concuerge, fabulous front desk girls make this Chicago hotel my number one choice, hands down!! Love it.,,love it...will be back very soon.
