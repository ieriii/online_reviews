Okay, unless you throw down a lot of money for a room, you really are treated like lower class. Even my upgrade didn't net me a nicer room. The hallway had scrapes and scratches on the paint and doors. The carpets looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the building was built and the hallways and my room smelled like dust.  Granted they were remodeling the restaurant downstairs but still.....my allergies went nuts and I ended up leaving early because I couldn't stop sneezing.  Also, nickel and dime you do death because they list themselves as a luxury hotel. Well, again, if you aren't throwing down some major cash on the best rooms you'll pay 15 bucks for access to the fitness facility and have to pay for internet access. boo. Good notes, the bathrooms are beautiful. The air conditioning works well. Will not stay here again.
