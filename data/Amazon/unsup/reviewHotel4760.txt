As I said in previous review for their spa ,wow...i couldn't ask for more..got my self an upgrade to the exec level and it happen to be a huge suite..did not expect that..was thinking of a 1 room but no...huge living room with a nice bar, 12 chairs dinning room table..i know right? 2 baths ....i felt like a king , there was a slight view of state street but because i was in meeting all day long didn't had time to enjoy as much as i wanted. went to their gym with my free pass from my massage they i had and i was in shock..boy do they have a huge gym..i have been in many hotels..this one is one of the most luxurios..i liked their treadmills, you have a tv on each machine and i think they had like 20 treadmills mixed with elipticals bikes and some other cardio equipment. like the spa , the receptionist got me a tour and explained all the details , etc..i must feel important for those. anyway after fitness i asked the concierge where can i go for some drinks and she gave me some good options and good discounts too ...overall as you can see my experience was a WOW FACTOR one..
