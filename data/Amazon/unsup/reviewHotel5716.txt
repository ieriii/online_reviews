It wasn't hard to find this hotel when I emerged from the train station: it's a tall building with a big "Crowne Plaza" sign at the top. Three stars is the average rating here, and that seems right to me. My room was not outstanding in any way, but it was comfortable enough and I slept well. The bathroom was small; "narrow" is the first word that comes to mind. The counter is a thin piece of moulded plastic -- not something that suggests luxury. Here are a few positives: the folk at the front desk were perfectly friendly; the elevators were fast-moving and fast-arriving; the hotel is well situated if you want to visit UIC or hang out in Greektown. The gym is a room with a couple of Precors, some treadmills and even some free weights. It looked OK but I skipped my workout to write yelp reviews.
