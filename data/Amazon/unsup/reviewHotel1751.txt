Not my first time in a Kimpton and I can't complain because I booked 2 king rooms at $105 a night! Crazy deal in the summer in Chicago. This hotel was in a great location and we walked most everywhere or took cabs which were about $8 plus tip to most locations.  Hotel Pros: Great Location Cool old building updated to modern features Really fun lobby Free wine at 5 (my favorite) Clean rooms Quiet location Great deal Kimpton Points and free internet with my rewards membership Good water pressure in shower Aveda products (don't have to lug shampoo) Free coffee Hotel Cons: Door lock broke and engineer had to come replace it (but gave us a $30 comp) Power blew with hairdryer use (took 30 mins to get power on - building is old) Slow / busy elevators VERY small rooms (but we expected this in the city) THIN walls (you can hear your neighbors) Bar downstairs sucks - tried to use our comp there and the cocktails were HORRIBLE (but they gave us something else b/c we told them so) In the Loop - ideally would have liked to stay river north but this location was worth the price savings Restaurant ACROSS the street from the Cadillac theater is awesome - but closed on Sat and Sun Hotel restaurant was overpriced and not that good for breakfast Would I stay here again? Probably if I got as good of a deal. Not necessarily a 4 star hotel though, more like 3 1/2. I still can't hate on Kimpton though.
