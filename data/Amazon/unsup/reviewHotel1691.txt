Stayed here on my birthday one year after seeing Aida at Cadillac Palace. Two seconds into the room I turned around and headed back to the front desk. Being located directly outside of the El was not on my agenda, and I live only 30 minutes away so for that price I would have drove home. They upgraded us to a 4 room suite. Large at least 10 person tub, elegant sitting room, wonderful robes and slippers - and one of the most comfortable beds ever. The room service was ok - I liked ordering from on screen, but the food itself was so-so. Again being a vegan I was limited to a bagel, fruit, and juice. Very friendly and accomodating staff, I would not stay in anything less than a suite here though, the regular rack rooms are tiny and not worth the price being so close to the El
