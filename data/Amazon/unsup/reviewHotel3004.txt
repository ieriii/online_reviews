First time staying @ a W and if they are all like this one, probably the last. Booked a 2 night stay here over the holidays to take advantage of their indoor pool and take the family out to downtown restaurants for a change. The room was tiny and so was the bathroom. Unlike the Renaissance on Wacker which has 2 queen size beds and plenty of room, this place can only squeeze in two doubles and barely leave enough room to move around. It's so bad, that they do not even have a luggage rack: no place to put it. So basically you put your suitcase on a shelf just below where all your clothes would hand in their wall mounted organizer. The bathroom also lacks a real door. We had a sliding bamboo door and shutters. I shit you not! There are wooden shutters in a wall separating the main room from the bathroom. Front desk service here is a hit or miss as well. Checking in, I said I did not have my Starwood card with me. In most places they volunteer to look it up or provide some guidance to earn points after the fact. Not here, she just ignored me. Not a big deal, as I seldom stay @ Starwood properties; prefer Marriott and Hilton brands. Parking here is $53 a night, which is steep even by downtown standards. If you are heading to Navy Pier, the location is great. If you want Michigan Ave or the many restaurants 100E-500W, then you have a nice hike ahead of you.
