We loved this place. Yeah, I know, it is a theme hotel and we originally selected the hotel because my son (15) loved the music theme and we got a good deal for downtown Chicago over Thanksgiving.Sheila, the concierge, was amazing. Besides helping with suggestions for places to go and how to get there, she was genuinely friendly and made us feel at home by greeting us by name every time she saw us and remembering what we had planned for the day. I know it is her job, but it did not seem like she was putting on an act. She asked questions how we liked the attractions and listened to my son's feedback.The hotel itself was clean, felt safe, and we had fabulous views down Michigan Avenue from our room. The room was very clean, well kept, and spacious. We were surprised the Hard Rock Cafe was a hike away. It happened to be a warm November night and the streets were filled with shoppers so we did not mind because we were window shopping and people watching all the way there and back.
