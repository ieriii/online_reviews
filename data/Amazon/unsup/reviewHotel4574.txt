While strolling around without any agenda, we decided to see what the Palmer House had to offer in terms of bar/restaurant. A very charming young bellman escorted us to the restaurant, which did not open for another 30 minutes. I was excited because the place is opulent and sophistocated looking. I immediately began to daydream about the steak I would soon be eating. We took a seat in the bar, with the promise of a table the moment the restaurant opened. 5:00 PM came and went and no one ever came for us. The server in the bar seemed annoyed that we did not want alcohol, but did order cappucino and 2 large bottles of Peligrino. He hovered, and not in an eager to please way, but was intrusive until we finally got the hint that we were taking up space meant for big spenders. He left a check and came back to open the tab book several times before we actually put money in there. Then, he rounded the change DOWN, leaving $4.00 even instead of the $4 and coins that would have been accurate. We left without a word, and had dinner elsewhere. And yes, we left a tip because, alas, we are NOT cheap. Shame on us for not speaking up at the time, but shame on them more!
