This hotel has a very European budget feel. However, we are in America. I can handle an old building. What I cannot handle is elevators that do not run properly, are extremely stuffy and slow, and GET STUCK, requiring you to press the call button to be rescued from the elevator by the maintenance crew. This hotel has 2 modern elevators and 1 manual elevator. Why they still have a manual elevator is beyond me, but thank god for that thing because during my stay only 1 of the modern elevators was ever running, and when we got stuck in it the manual elevator aided in our rescue mission. Only staff can run the manual lift, so that meant that all guests across 12 floors were using 1 elevator. This created a big hassle and long waits to get to and from your room (we were on the 12th floor - stairs not really an option). I also just did not feel safe in the elevators. The location is great, staff are nice and competent (expect for the housekeeper - she was rudeness to the max), wi-fi is free, and luckily our room was quiet. But the furnishings are very cheap and outdated. The double beds are just doubles, not queen size. And housekeeping would only give us 1 roll of toilet paper at a time. We had 4 people in the room! Needless to say we ran out of toilet paper each day of our stay. Also, we had a suite with a "kitchenette," but there was really nothing that you could do in this kitchenette other than store leftovers in the fridge, heat them up in the microwave, and then eat them with your bare hands. There was no silverware, plates, glasses, nothing - just some paper cups. So if you want to take advantage of the "kitchenette" you'll have to bring the same type of gear you'd bring on a picnic. I expect more from a national chain!
