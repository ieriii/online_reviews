Eh. I wasn't impressed during my recent stay at the Hotel Indigo. Oh sure- the location is great- just blocks from Old Town, and the lake. And the bed was comfortable. And the price was okay at $172 for a king room. But this place, while it calls itself a "boutique hotel" lacks the service and amenities of a true "boutique hotel". The front desk check in was a hassle, and the staff was unconcerned about the wait and as I stood there- I watched them deal with other guests in a nonchalant way that a true "boutique hotel" would not. Hotel Indigo looks it was decorated from Ikea with it's bright blue walls and green and white striped accents with simple wood furniture. I don't know if they were going for a beach theme but that's what it reminded me of. The room was tiny- so much so that the bed took up all the space and you bumped into the wall to get into the even tinier bathroom. Maybe there are better rooms in the hotel so if you go- don't get room #514! But the real kicker here had to be the tiny bar in the front lobby. I went down to have a drink and the bartender told me that they didn't have much liquor. What? She then held up the vodka bottle and swished it around so I could see that there was barely a shot left in the bottom. When I asked her about it (knowing I was staying at the hotel with people who like to drink) she just shrugged and said an order must not have come in. Really? And there is no where in Chicago to buy some liquor to take care of your guests? Parking runs $36 per night at the garage next door (that's another review but the headline is- if you can find another place to park you should go there) All in all- I guess Hotel Indigo is fine for a basic hotel stay but I hate that they promote it as a "boutique hotel" for along with that label comes certain expectations. I won't be recommending it to any of my friends who come to town to stay. For the price- there are lots of better choices.
