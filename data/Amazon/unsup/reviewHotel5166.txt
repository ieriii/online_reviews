What can a say? What a let down. I have stayed at the W Lakeshore and enjoyed the contemporary design but this place is laughable in comparison. Thank god they didn't destroy the beautiful ceilings and marble with tacky furniture and design. The room was quiet and we had a narrow outward view. Bedding was cheap and the bathroom felt dated with a paint job. Another thing I noticed immediately upon entry is that the front desk is hidden away in a corner. I probably won't stay here again unless there is some sort of mega-sale. NOT a fan.
