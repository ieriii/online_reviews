Business center my A$$...I chose this hotel because of the location, price, and because it purported to have a business center with a fax machine, copier, etc. The "business center" was a tiny tiny room with 2 desktops, one workstation with an Ethernet jack, and a printer. NO fax. NO copier. If you wanted anything faxed or copied you had to ask at the front desk and although the staff was reasonably accommodating about it. It was a PAIN. Talk about false advertising. This is the exact quote from their website:"Our business center is equipped with all the comforts of your office - computer workstations, high-speed Internet access, printers, fax machines, copiers, and supplies - and plenty of quiet workspace. It's conveniently located on the first floor and is open 24 hours a day."Straight. Up. Lie.
