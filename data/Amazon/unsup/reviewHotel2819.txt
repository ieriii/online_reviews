This is one of two Embassy Suites in downtown. This blocky red brick building contains rooms surrounding a central atrium. Guests enjoy a widespread breakfast buffet that is included in your room rate, plus there is a free cocktail hour in the evening. Each of the sizeable rooms is built like a suite, so families love to stay here. The new Italian restaurant on the main level seems more popular than the former Greek restaurant here.
