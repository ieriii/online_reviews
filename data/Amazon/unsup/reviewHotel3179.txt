I've now stayed here dozens of times and it seems to be a staple property for my team when we work in Chicago. Overall it's a great property, but the location is a bit inconvenient. Aside from the proximite to Navy Pier, it's a bit out of the way from the downtown area, or the uptown nightlife. The bar area is very cool with tons of space for people to spread out on a variety of different chairs/couches. On each of the floors, there is a little telescope that allows you to view Navy Pier from an elevated view, which is a nice cool touch. The valet guys are very helpful- they'll waive down cabs that are lined up around the corner of Lakeshore drive. However, the design of the drop-off/pick-up circle is very odd. Sometimes you have traffic going in both directions, and in the busy mornings, it's not uncommon to get stuck between a few cars going in different directions. Note: I am on a personal mission to stay at every W Hotel in the USA (and then hopefully branch out to worldwide!)
