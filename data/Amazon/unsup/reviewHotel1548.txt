This hotel is alright. It's in a good location if you're looking for a place to crash on a girls night out. It's clean, the service is friendly, and the rooms are large and nicely decorated, but there's nothing "special" about it, ya know? In the trendy hotel market, I definitely prefer the W, although the prices are much, much lower at Hotel 71 (especially if you check the online hotel brokers). Also, I've stayed here twice and both times booked a "city view" room, but was able to switch to a "river view" room at check in, for no extra charge.
