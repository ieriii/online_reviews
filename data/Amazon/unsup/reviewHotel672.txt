Extremely nice hotel with a great staff! The only drawback and the hotel cannot help this are the constant sirens. There is a hospital nearby so any hotel in the area will have the same problem. The rooms were not as big as I thought they would be but the view was gorgeous. The lobby was really small. For 220.00 a night you would hope for a huge bar, big restaurant and all of that but things were just a little smaller compared to the Marriott down the road. I would recommend the hotel but be weary of the sirens.
