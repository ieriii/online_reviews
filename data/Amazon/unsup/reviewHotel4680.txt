This place is amazing. I stayed here for a week and I didnt want to ever leave. I had to go for work and luckily had the freedom to choose my own hotel. I read about this place on the Chicago Visitor website and it got great reviews. I love little boutique hotels and this really exceeded all of my expectations. The beds are the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on in my entire life!! My view was pretty great too. It is walking distance (6 blocks) from Michigan Ave. The lounge is perfect and I spent probably every night here. Every night I would think of going down for just a night cap but ended up staying until they closed. They have quite the intimate setting with the fireplace and the cozy bar corner. The bar tenders are all charming and were a pleasure to be around. Housekeeping even went the extra mile to hang up all of the clothes that I had scattered all over my room after leaving for work and leaven them everywhere as if a tornado had just ripped through lol. I would definitely go back here and will recommend this place to anyone.
