Checked in late, got upgraded to a penthouse suite so I assume this is as good as any room in the hotel. VERY tires hotel, the decor is 80s mod but sourced from an low end office supply place. Formica counts, white fixtures, floor lamps all but falling over. It's not dirty, and the bedding is clean and comfortable. But I would not want to spend any time in the room despite the deluxe two level suite. I've stayed at other Sutton Place properties and they are a solid 4 star. This one is a shame to their brand, could be nice if they would put some money into it, superb location.
