This was a great location for what we were doing in Chicago, and they take pets (although ours wasn't with us). The rooms were nice, and it was a nice property. This definitely isn't a high-end Hilton, but there was nothing wrong with it. It felt a bit stale - like some of the downtown hotels that you experience in New York.  That said, we enjoyed our stay and the price was right.
