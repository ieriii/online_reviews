Had high expectations given the location and price, but the service really let this hotel down. Our platinum king room was nice, thought it was located in a dark grey, poorly lit hallway.Ice Machine- Couldn't find ice, so we called the operator. She insisted every floor had an ice machine. We spent 5 minutes looking, and called back. This time, she told us because of the business center, we needed to go up a floor for ice. Spent 5 minutes looking on that floor, and again, no ice. We called again, and she put us on hold until she finally found out ice is only on floors 5 and up.Guitar rental- Cool idea,but the first guitar didn't work, Took an hour to get one that functioned. They took 500 dollars off my card as a guarantee, and promised it would be back within the next day after departure. It's now day 3 and the money still has not returned. It took them 5 minutes to put the charge on my card, it's shady that they're holding on to my money, especially when they told me it would be back by now. Had I known how long my money was going to be tied up in the whole thing, I would've steered clear of this offer.Valet service was a mixed bag. Some of the staff was helpful, but one got argumentative with me when I told him I just needed to get some things out of my car. I called down and they told me they'd have my car ready in ten minutes. I came down ten minutes later, and they had no idea I'd called and I had to wait another 15 minutes to get my car.
