We were not able to check in until nearly 4 pm but they held our bags to allow us to wander around before check in time. This place is very family friendly, which means there were a lot of young children running around and splashing in the pool until late in the evening. Unfortunately, we were looking for a quiet place to stay and this was not it. Our room door was on the atrium and our window was on the street so we either heard the screams of young children in the pool or sirens, car, and pedestrian noise from the street the entire time we were there. In fact, I rarely got any sleep from all the street noise. The floor was very dirty and had some stains on it. The Wi-Fi, which you have to pay for only worked about 25% of the time. And their tech support was no help for that. On the plus side, while the bathroom is snug the shower pressure was awesome. The king size bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. There was an evening manager's reception with a free drink and snacks (chips and veggies). And the breakfast buffet was included in the price of the room. The drawback to that was if you did not go first thing, the breakfast area was overrun with mobs of young families. This place is only about three or four blocks off Michigan Avenue, which is great if you're looking for a place close to the Magnificent Mile. There are tons of restaurants around within walking distance. And there's a Trader Joe's a few blocks away. Not sure I'd return due to the noisy room and so many young families.
