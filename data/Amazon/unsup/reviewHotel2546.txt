I wish I could give a place zero stars.  First off let me start off by saying I hate clubs. My very good friend wanted to celebrate a milestone birthday but didn't want to go to a bar because she wanted us all to get dressed up. So last minute she decided to set up a party here. We get there and get to skip the line. We were suppose to have a table reserved because bottles were being bought. We get there someone else is in our spot. We end up having to get another bottle to get seated somewhere else. Super shady.  We get seated by the super busy main area. With a party of 20+ that didn't work out so well. So they had to move us to the back. Whatever. Good times were had. Until I go to bar to get a drink because I wanted something else. The bartender was being a scumbag after someone took my friends drink and I told her. She was being such a douche about it and I wasn't even asking for another one free. I had to explain to her so many times to give my friend his card back and we'll pay cash. She refused a few times. Saying we haven't met the limit. Which we had. She really gave us a hard time. But finally gave it back.  Then at the end of the night while my girl was paying for the bottle they bring her the slip to sign but tell her they had just lost her card! They just had it and lost it in 5 minutes?! What the?! My girl refused to sign until she got her card back. This went on for twenty minutes. The birthday girl happened to know one of te bouncers, she told him what was going on. He comes back in five minutes WITH her card!!!!!! What the hell is that? She was so mad, they did nothing to apologize or take a little of the bill for the hassle.  Do not give these people your credit cards. I know there is something fishy about this place...
