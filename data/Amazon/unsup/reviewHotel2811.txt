Good hotel, great location. You're right in the middle of things at this Embassy Suites, around plenty of shopping and public transit and sightseeing possibilities.  The suites are pretty typical fare. The front room is a combination dining room-living room-kitchenette, with a sofabed, fridge, and microwave. I was happy to see that the front wall of the suite was an actual wall and not a curtain-covered window like many Embassy Suites properties. The bedroom had its own vanity with a sink and mirror, which was a very nice touch. If I'd been sharing the room with anyone, that would've made things a little easier. The bathroom was well-lit and very clean, and the toiletries smelled nice enough that I actually used them instead of the ones I brought.  Breakfast is free but can get pretty mobbed. There's also a free happy hour, though I was never around for it. For all of the freebies, though, it's disappointing that the internet access is over $10 (with tax). I think in 2010, internet should be an amenity provided to guests and not a pricey luxury service. Can I trade the extra sink for some free wifi? If it were free, the bad connection and crappy speeds I experienced would be more excusable. I'd stay here again, though I'd be tempted to return to the Hilton Garden Inn that's across the street instead.
