Huge huge hotel. I love the hyatt beds... so soft and comfy! Coming from a smaller city, I forget how much walking around you have to do in a big city. Vegas hotels are worst! So much walking just to get to your room. Anyways, the check in process was smooth and easy. Great service. Valet was expensive but that was expected so no surprise there. The day we left there was protesting done outside the hotel area so we had to go get our car from the valet garage... not really valet service. On nicer days, it's a good walk to the shops on Michigan Ave. In the cold winter days, I would recommend bundling up or getting a taxi. Overall, good hotel and location. We always get a deal on priceline!
