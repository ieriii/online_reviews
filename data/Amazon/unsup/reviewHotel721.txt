We recently held an event here. The hotel is great, and the staff very helpful.There was a bit of a disconnect between the sales office and the front desk, but they figured it out quickly. If you every need an embarrassingly large, nicely appointed suite, get the presidential suite. I'd live in Chicago, if I could live in that suite.
