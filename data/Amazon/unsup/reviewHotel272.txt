I recently stayed here, mostly due to a fantastic deal I found on hotwire. For the price I paid, it was certainly sufficient, but the rooms definitely could stand to be updated. Beds were very uncomfortable, especially the pullout sofa bed in the king suite. Tiles in the bathroom were coming off of the wall, and all appliances in the kitchen were very outdated. The service, however, was excellent. I interacted with 3 or 4 different people at the front desk during my 2 night stay, and every single one of them was courteous and friendly. They don't offer extensive concierge services, but they are able to book architecture boat tours through Wendella, which is nice to save you the hassle of getting to the ticket office early and booking a tour. Overall, it's a fairly no frills place but with a very friendly staff. My main goal in booking was to get a cheap hotel near the mile but without visible bodily fluids or rodents/cockroaches. Thankfully, I avoided that, but the rooms still could use a face lift.
