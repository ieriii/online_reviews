You know that show Boss playing on Starz? It's about the mayor and the aldermen of Chicago wreaking havoc in the city. Well it's based on true circumstances. I saw it first hand at City Suites.Boss has the mayor's henchmen do the dirty work for him but the aldermen have to do their own dirty work. It's true. And here's the proof. I was there for the Urban Assault Ride (biking) and I guess one of the aldermen came in the hotel and as a true gangster, he started yelling at everyone right there in the lobby. No pulling anyone to the side. No letting anyone speak or explain their side. He went from 0 to 60 faster than my BMW Z4. For 10 minutes, we were his bitch. It felt like a hurricane hit an earthquake that hit the City Suites Hotel. I didn't really understand what he was saying but I guess the hotel towed his car away. I can't really describe the situation. The best I can do is show you a reenactment of the whole thing herehttp://www.youtube.com/wWho said that there are no gangsters in Chicago.If you find me dead tomorrow morning with a suicide note next to me, it's not true. There was a hit placed on me.But the train next to the hotel is more noisy than the alderman. You hear "Ding dong. This is Belmont station. We are at Belmont station." They have free WiFi and a free continental breakfast. The rooms are clean and updated. All in all, it's actually pretty good.
