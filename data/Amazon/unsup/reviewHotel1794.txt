Hotel Allegro was recently one of the featured spots on Jetsetter (http://jettsetter.com, a discount travel site featuring high end hotels) and was available for a weekend when I was planning on being in Chicago for a friend's wedding. We got a fantastic rate and I am probably being more forgiving than other travelers may be based on the fantastic deal that we received. The hotel is located in the Loop, Chicago's main business district. As a one time Chicagoan, this location worked great for me, but other people may find that a property off the Magnificant Mile is more ideal. Upon check in, we were given complimentary drink vouchers because we had missed their nightly complimentary wine happy hour in the lobby. Our room had a very retro feel and was clean, but was also very small. Most of the room was occupied by the very comfortable king bed. We had some small issues with both the safe and our AC, but the hotel sent people up very quickly to help with both and they were easily resolved. I would absolutely recommend this hotel, but only to people traveling for business, single travelers, or those who plan on spending very little time in their rooms.
