Nice hotel in a good location, very close to everything.  I liked that they provided free wi-fi and breakfast on every floor, there was a good variety of food and it was nice to not have to go far. Staff was friendly although the lobby setup was weird, I liked that they provided free copies of Time Out Chicago, which was useful. The room was very large and spacious but Amalfi loses a star because the view out our window was just a brick wall. Hey, at least we had privacy.
