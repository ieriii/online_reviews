The W Chicago Lakeshore is the ultimate in hip hotels. I stayed here over spring break of 2007 with a few buddies. I'd originally reserved a room elsewhere, but a reservation mixup with Expedia landed me here - and in hindsight, I couldn't have been more lucky! The hotel itself feels more like a hipster lounge than a hotel. Upon entering the lobby, you will be greeted by smiling faces set in an ultra-chic club room of sorts, complete with dark wood and metallic tile materials, falling water and fresh baskets of apples (a part of the W founder's tradition). The entire hotel smells of a light, almost floral cologne - it's delightful. Soft house (read: electronic) music flows and adds to the air of "cool". The room we stayed in was not terribly spacious, but it was satisfactory enough. A great view of the lake combined with W's legendary matresses made for a fine stay. My wakeup call I had scheduled the night before even included a recommendation to bring my sunglasses, as it was quite a sunny day. The Bliss Spa is also a luxurious indulgence, I received an awesome manicure there. At night, the lobby turns into a full-fledged lounge, complete with cocktails, cool furniture, a bar and a DJ. Very cool! Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the W. Extremely comfortable beds, helpful courteous staff in an ultra-hip environment is the name of the game. Don't bring a car, you'll pay heftily for parking.
