My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Allegro for my birthday weeked. It was wonderful. Check-in was smooth and the clerk was very nice and accomodating. We had the standard king room but the bed felt more like a queen. There wasn't much of a view but the did have plently of sunlight. The rooms are so cute. They are small but there is a lot of detail put into them to make you feel like you are in a much bigger space. The bathroom is super small but the french style doors added a nice touch. While my boyfriend and I were getting settled in there was knock and the door. It was room service. The hotel sent us a bottle of champagne and a small box of chocolates as a birthday gift. That was a very nice touch. I joined the Kimpton InTouch program (which is free) before we arrived and for an added bonus we were given free wifi and $10 credit for the mini bar. The valet service was super fast. Everytime we called for the car they had it waiting for us when we arrived down stairs. Our stay was prefect and for an added touch we were given bottle of water for the trip home. All in all this is was a great stay and we can't to go back.
