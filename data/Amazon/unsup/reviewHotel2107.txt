We had a wonderful experience!  Our check-in time was 1:00 a.m. (late flight in to O'Hare) and check-in was a cinch! When we arrived at our room, we learned that they upgraded us to a suite with two full bathrooms. I had left a small note in the reservation that it was an anniversary trip and they impressed with the experience--beautiful room and cold champagne with strawberries & champagne & chocolate.  The maid service was excellent and it was a quiet room with a peek a boo view of Michigan Avenue. They allowed us a late check-out of 2pm for no charge. We left our luggage with the bellperson and it was secure and untampered with. The only thing that wasn't over par was the time it took to pull the bags from storage--it was a little disorganized. Otherwise, it was a wonderful experience and I recommend it.
