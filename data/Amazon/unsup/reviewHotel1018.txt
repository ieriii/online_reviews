i gotta be honest, my bullshit detector was twitching when i learned that the folks at the front desk are not 'clerks' but 'experience consultants'. think of the amalfi as a 'mini-w hotel'. it's hip and comfortable and (unlike the w maybe) an incredible value considering the location. it's right across the street from harry caray's so I can look out my window anytime i want and see a huge cartoon of harry practically ordering me to have a beer. ah, harry, the master enabler. strangely, i find comfort in this. in the room, i like the cd/dvd player with assorted jazz and blues cds, some novels and magazines (gq, instyle and others). i didn't particularly like the robe they provide. it's made out of strangely uncomfortable materials and was on the small side. hotel robes should be soft terry cloth. period. and large. i think in the effort for maximum hipness, they erred. nice FREE happy hour (not just wine and beer. well drinks, skyy vodka, jim beam, etc) and continental breakfast. interesting to note that the breakfast is on every floor...so you can run out into the hall in your odd robe and grab a chocolate croissant and fruit and scamper back. i will happily stay here again!
