The building is very beautiful and the rooms are upscale and comfortable...albeit a bit pricey. The woman who checked us in was helpful and friendly but that was the last time we saw anyone. You need to check into this hotel by 6 pm and are given a key to enter the building and your room. Breakfast is not served until 9:30 am (no special requests) and once it is put out it is not attended to, so after a few folks came down to eat it was all gone....and not replenished. The maid pulled the covers up over the bed and gave us new towels but did not refill kleenex or toilet paper, empty the waste cans, or sweep. There was never anyone at the front desk, so if you want an intimate weekend where you never see any staff...this is the place! As pretty as it was, I won't return.
