Do not believe ANYTHING on their cozy little website.... this place is a dump in a marginal area of town. In spite of what is published, almost ALL bathrooms are SHARED, without any sanitization efforts. They were never cleaned the whole time, and have no hand sanitizer, soap dispensers, toilet seat covers or paper towels. Fixtures are dirty, moldy, outdated and in poor working condition. Rooms do not have adequate door locks, floors, closets, furnishings are in dis-repair. Noisy!! Dark, dank, mouldy, depressing!! Narrow hallways and squeaky floors- you can hear everyone, and they can hear you. Outdated televisions with only a few channels. Horrible!! AVOID!!! Also, the bus stop on Belmont that they direct you to from the BL from ohare is very dangerous....esp. for tourists with suitcases!!! Do not go there!!! Dangerous!!!
