I was pleasantly surprised at this hotel. Very cool updated interior design and fixtures. I'm sure this is an old building but you wouldn't know it by the looks. I was super happy to find I could strut around my room in a cheetah, yes CHEETAH robe while my man wore his zebra robe. These are also available for sale along with a set of cheetah PJs (his and hers) and some cozy socks which were in our closet, just in case. The mini bar is extensively stocked with not only beverage and snacks but also things you may need like toothbrushes, razors and even a "love kit", all for purchase if needed. These items were quality brands and eco-friendly in most cases which was nice. The shampoo and lotions were Aveda which also made me happy, they just smell great and have great products. I actually liked their towels, most hotels even some of the better ones have inconsistent and possibly scratchy towels that make you paranoid that you might get stuck with the itchy one. These were consistently plush and didn't reek of bleach. My only negative would be the lack of counter space in the bathroom. The chic table-top sink on a granite counter just doesn't lend enough space for your toiletries but we managed by shuffling the hotels accessories around and using the back of the toilet. I must give kudos to the front desk for upgrading our room to a slightly larger room for free, we booked as a package deal on Orbitz. We tried to purchase an upgrade for the jet tub room but they didn't have any available. Didn't eat there so I can't speak to that, but the area is in the theatre district and close to some good eats. We also had a great corner view room and could see straight down one of the streets (??) and not just at a window of another building which is often your view in a big city. Great hotel, great service, helpful nice people, elevators were fast. I'd go again!
