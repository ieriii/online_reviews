I agree with the many reviews here. Location is excellent, service is personal and attentive, complimentary wireless a big plus for internet addicts like me, modern decor, ultra comfortable bed, turndown service, and kiehl's heavenly products are just icings on the cake! The only thing it was really lacking is the view. I really love the views that some of the hotels near the water offer but they are usually farther away from the action. Irregardless, this is an A+ hotel.
