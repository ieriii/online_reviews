We chose this hotel based on Yelp. Highly recommend this hotel. All employees were very customer focused. Emily checked us in and since we were early they stored our luggage until our room was ready. We asked Emily to give us a city view as high up as possible. At first she had us on the 32nd floor and when we returned to check in she had booked us on the 39th floor which is the highest floor with rooms. The pool and breakfast lounge is on the 40th floor which is top floor. The view from room 3909 is fanastic. This room is a king suite which has a leather couch witha pull out bed which is where our two kids slept. The mattress was awesome and so comfortable. Nice flat screen TV, closet space, and did I mention the excellent view. The waterfall shower head was nice but water pressure was not the best either because of the age of the plumbing or it was equipped with a water reducer or both. It was fine for me, but the wife wished it would have had more pressure. Not a deal breaker though. We would definitely stay here again. Very close and centrally located to about everything we wanted to do. The roof top pool was awesome. The views from there are excellent as well. Since it was 90+ degrees it was busy during the day but in the evening it was manageable. The first night which was a Sunday we had the pool to ourselves for awhile which was nice. I thought the $250 per night average including taxes was very reasonable for all things considered. Free wi-fi and they did not charge a seperate fee for the pool which alot of places do. They have parking on site for $50/day but we took the train. Cab ride to the train station is about $15.00 including tip. Navy Pier, Chinatown, and Willis Tower is all $15.00 or less each way too. All the shopping, Hancock, and tons of excellent restaurants can easily be reached by foot. This will be the only hotel we stay at for future visits to Chicago. Highly recommend the Avenue Crowne!
