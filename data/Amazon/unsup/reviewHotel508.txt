We had a wonderful time here. My husband, I and our almost two year old son took the train from Kansas City to Chicago. This hotel was just what we needed to spend 4 days in Chicago. The hotel itself is pretty. The room was beautiful. It had a separate bedroom that can be closed off. It had a little fridge and a microwave which was perfect for milk and snacks for our little boy. They also provided a crib. In the morning, there's a build your own omelet breakfast. It was really nice. it's not your typical continental breakfast. My favorite was the happy hour. Every night from 5-7 or so, most of the drinks at the bar are free! Yes! I said free. You can just lounge around the bar/eating area sipping a cosmpolitan martini munching on some nuts or chips and salsa. The best part was that this hotel is close to everything. I mean walking distance to the The Miracle Mile, the Pier(which was awesome)Childrens museum... For the price we paid, we definitely got our moneys worth at this great hotel. And, would recommend it to anyone staying in Chicgo.
