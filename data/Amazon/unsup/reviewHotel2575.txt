This is the letter I sent to the club based NYE 2010. It was terrible. Don't ever go during NYE! fianc and I attended your New Year's eve celebration and left feeling frustrated and disappointed. We arrived at the club at 10pm and ended waiting in line for 45 minutes. I even came to the club the night before to pick up my tickets so I could avoid the line. It wasn't until some guests waiting in line complained to Cameron that we were finally moved inside. Once inside, we ended up waiting in another long line for the bar, which took at least 45 minutes to get drinks. It was ridiculous to see one bartender on the side bar and three bartenders at the main bar serving over 700 people. The club was extremely crowded; there was hardly any space to move. Numerous times I shoved violently by other guests at the club; My fianc was worried for my safety. The floor was wet and had assorted broken bottles and glasses on the floor. I understand it is New Year's eve and the place can get crowded. What added to the disappointment was the number of people talking about getting in the club without buying tickets. I saw Cameron at the door handing out tickets without checking a list of people who had purchased them. I spent $150 for a set of tickets expecting to get according to your advertisement: "complimentary passed hors d'oeuvres and appetizers...a midnight champagne toast...party favors and noise makers". None of which was available once in the club. Based on my experiences, I will never visit the club again. If anyone asks me my opinion of the Victor Hotel, I will tell them adamantly not to go
