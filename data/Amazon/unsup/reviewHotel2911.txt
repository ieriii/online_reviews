This hotel was very nice! It seemed like mostly business-people here, although I was on vacation with my sister. The room was a nice size and the bed was so friggin comfortable. I had so much trouble getting out of it. The gym is a ripoff at $12, but I guess since most guests are on the richer side, they can charge it. Also, if you need a cab, the dude outside blows and whistle and TA-DA! Cab. How convenient. I don't like how this hotel doesn't have a candy bowl. The first thing I looked for when I walked in was a candy bowl. What a bummer.
