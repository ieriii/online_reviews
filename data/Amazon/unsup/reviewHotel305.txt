It's great for cost-effective, clean accommodations. A few annoyances though. We were right beside the elevator, so we'd hear the tone of the Elevator arriving at our Floor at all hours of the day/night. If I was ever doubtful of Obesity being a problem in America, I certainly don't now. There were 3 individuals with a combined weight (roughly) 900lbs staying directly above us. We could hear them waddling around quite frequently. Fortunately, they all couldn't move very quickly at the same time, so it wasn't that much of an annoyance. But I did hope the Building was up to Code, for fear of being crushed in our sleep. The Continental Breakfast was pretty shiete. Coffee terrible in the lobby. But, that's really not why you stay at a Hotel. For a Clean, relatively quiet, fairly cost-effective place to sleep; it's great. Next time in Chicago, I'd probably stay here again.
