OK for a few days, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to stay here again. There are plenty of other hotels nearby. Cost is certainly less than some others nearby, but I might be willing to pay a little extra for a better experience Highlights -Convenient location -Argo Tea located right downstairs, with an entrance from the hotel. Plus additional restaurants & coffee shops nearby (Note: Many of restaurant close early since they mostly cater to the business lunch crowd) -Modern style -Continental breakfast -Free wifi Negatives -I'm certainly not a clean freak by any means, but the room wasn't nearly as clean as I expected. The housekeeping team would stop by at 8:30 to ask if I wanted my room cleaned. I would say yes, in hopes that it would actually be cleaned, but not so much... Some of the towels were stained which was pretty gross. -Like another person mentioned, the Keurig coffee maker didn't work. It was covered in dust, so that probably should have been my first inclination that it probably hasn't been working for awhile.
