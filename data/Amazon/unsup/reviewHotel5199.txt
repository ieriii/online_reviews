This was a suprise! Valet parking, Omni has an off site company to park our car in a unsecure lot after paying them 50.00 a night for parking. My IPad II was stolen out of our vehicle and Omni takes no responsible for the stolen IPad. I asked the manager if he knew that our vehicle was being parked in an unsecure lot and he said no. Our car was not broken into, therefore the off site tenants stoled the ipad or they did not lock the vehicle. Omni does not have secure parking for your vehicle or belongings.
