I was staying at the Marriot for a conference in October 2011. I brought my wife along for a little mini-vacation. Checkin was smooth. Our room on the 15th floor was clean, small, but quite serviceable. The bathroom fan was either missing or inoperable. That was the only thing I found 'broken'. The bed was quite confortable and the blackout drape very welcome. There were really no complaints about the room... but for this: Being a geek I was surprised that wireless was only available on the first few floors not in the rooms. Instead there was a hardwire. The conference comp'd the internet access but I must rant anyway: YOU BLITHERING IDIOTS! In case it had not occurred to you, this is the 21st century. Internet access for most of us is not an 'optional' luxury. WTF is your problem Marriot nickel and dime'ing people for net access? I'd trade the f'in TV access straight across for the net access. No mini-bar, not that cared. We requested a fridge for my wife's medications and it was in the room when we arrived. Very nice. The front desk staff, concierge, and bellman were all well trained and cordial. The bar downstairs was reasonably priced for a 'hotel' bar. The catered conference food was really not very good. No matter, we ate out most nights as the location of the Marriot is IDEAL for a foodie looking for Chicago good eats All in all a solid 4 star performance. Not super luxury, and still pimping net access, but a solid establishment.
