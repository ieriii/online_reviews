This hotel is suuuuper nice and in a super convenient spot to everything. Walking distance to millennium park, the pier, sears tower, bars, clubs.  $10-15 cab ride to lou malnati's, united arena, and sh*tloads of the tourist spots. Doormen and concierge are super helpful. Heard the bar goes off on Thursdays, but was only there from fri-mon. I'd stay here again the next time i visit chicago.
