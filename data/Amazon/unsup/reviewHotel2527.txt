this beats holiday inn any day! probably the most bling ive seen at a hotel...ever! its huge and its no wonder why they hold large conferences here! the rooms were rather basic, but from our window, you could see the "married with children" fountain...and you wont even have to walk far to get to buddy guy's blues bar...its within walking distance and yes, he hangs out there, so you will most like be able to take a picture with him...
