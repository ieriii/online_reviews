I...wanna rock n roll all niiiight...and party every day!! Come here if you want to pretend you're a rock and roll star! Don't worry, the dark hues and gold trim will hide any evidence of partying too hard into the wee hours. In fact, if hookers in the lobby at 1am is any indication, this kind of behavior is encouraged! Seriously. I saw two of them. Overall, great hotel. It's like the Sheraton's cooler, funkier, more colorful cousin. All the hospitality and amenities are there, just rock and roll! I think my favorite part had to be the bathroom. No sliding shower door or curtains. Just a slab of glass covering the shower part with a side entry. Totally something this mod girl would love having in her house. Beds are pretty comfy. What they lack in comfort is made up for in size. I could spread out without worrying about kicking the bf off the bed (which I am prone to doing on a standard queen)! Request a high floor because the views are stellar. I could see the Bean from our window! Oh, and that spiders note by the windows during warm weather is totally true (those of you who have been know what I'm talking about), so keep the windows closed! If there is one reason to stay here, it's the location. You can't beat it. Plus it's way affordable if you "rock" Hotwire or http://Hotels.com. I hope I see someone famous next time!
