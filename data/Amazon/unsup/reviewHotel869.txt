I left a marvelous hotel to come here and I am overjoyed at the choice. A natural pick for architect buffs,it's on the tour! The staff is unreal in every way. Suze is a standout! U of m grad and rower loving the Midwest values. Apparently the manger is a Michigan guy as well but State oh we'll :) The rooms are perfect! Elegant,unique,comfortable,lovely. All the way down to the hand sewn blanket with velvet. They even have footies! Free Starbucks in the AM. This is where I will stay on all upcoming visits! Pet friendly and interesting guests. It's a small place and private.
