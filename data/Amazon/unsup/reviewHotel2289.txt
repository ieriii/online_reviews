This one goes out to Chicagoan, Caroline A... Who may soon become a New Yorker. Thanks to JetBlue delaying our flight from 8PM to 3AM, we finally arrived at our hotel by 6AM. Although we had reservations, we were told we were lucky that 2 rooms were still available due to the Air & Water Show that weekend. Minutes later, we walk into our room... Seriously? No, really?? Yes, I'm tired... Is this dream? C'mon now! Our entire Marriott Downtown Chicago, Magnificent Mile room, including bathroom & closet, could have fit in the master bathroom of our J.W. Marriott Summerlin room in Las Vegas! See review & photos: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ In fact, our bathroom in Chicago is smaller than most of the bathrooms I've seen in Manhattan! The door cannot swing open more than 45 degrees because the bathtub gets in the way! *Split second flashback to my hotel in Japan* Well, the view has got to be good, right? The window spans the width of the room & measure approximately 5'5" in height. The view isn't breathtaking & it certainly helps that we're more than 20 stories up. The glass only slides open about 2". You guessed it. We're paying for location -- Step one foot out of the hotel's revolving doors & you're on Magnificent Mile. Yay: Spacious, tasteful lobby. Nice curtains & sleek lamps. Nay: Tacky hallway carpeting. No fridge, mini-bar snacks or safe. The lone, liter bottle of Evian in the room will cost you $5. 24 hours of internet will run you $14.95 The outdoor roof area is under construction until October 2007. We decided to extend our stay in Chicago past the weekend, BUT I could not tolerate the lack of space another minute! We moved to the Sofitel nearby, but only after I inspected our room first.
