First off, I really like smaller, unique little hotels as opposed to giant chains as a general rule so Hotel Felix definitely fit the bill. The biggest plus for me with this one was the location. During my stay, I pretty much walked everywhere and only needed to take a cab once because it was late. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. And the bed...ah the bed. The bed gave me the best sleep ever! Ordered breakfast as well a couple of times and it good both times but really big servings (I underestimated so I ended up with more food that I can eat. Ooops.)  The room itself was super small but for one person, I didn't think that it was a problem at all. The bathroom was teeny tiny as well but hey, I wasn't going to go be doing any jumping jacks in there anytime soon. I would have rated it higher except for the fact that the toilet overflowed with a lot of stuff on my last day. A tad gross even for someone like me with a strong constitution. I did notify them right away but I was on my way out already so I am not sure if they fixed immediately. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and I wouldn't mind staying there again.
