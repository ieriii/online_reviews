Came to visit Chicago for the first time for pleasure (actually celebrating Nana's 90th birthday) and the last night in Chicago- I got to stay at The Allerton Hotel. The family heard that I love to shop which made this hotel perfect because its near everything which is great! It's on Magnificent Mile. Upon entering into the hotel, I was greeted with friendly customer service and the decor in the hotel was really nice. When I checked in, went to my room... I was stun on how spacious my room was. I thought it might be small but it was pretty nice size. This hotel might be my favorite place to stay when I visit Chicago. Love everything about this place. Two thumbs up!!!
