I've been to a few get togethers and parties at this hotel, as well as have stayed the night. It is beautiful lobby and great layout. the staff is amazing, probably one of the most professional in the city. Great group of people. The rooms are nice too. Great place for a wedding or reception. Starwood (who own the hotels) have specials from time to time so check their website. otherwise just check out drinks in their lobby (called the Living Room)
