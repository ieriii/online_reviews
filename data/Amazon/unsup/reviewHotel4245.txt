We held our wedding reception at the Hyatt Regency in the Crystal Ballroom. We also had a brunch the next morning for guests. Both were excellent. The staff was very professional and helpful at both events. And we really, really loved our reception. The coordinator there, Rebecca, is fantastic. We did not have the budget to hire our own coordinator so it was really nice to have most of the reception details covered because we were pretty overwhelmed with other details. We looked at a lot of hotels for our reception and we thought the Hyatt was very reasonable - and the Crystal Ballroom is very cool [it was one of the few hotels with a ballroom with a view that could hold 200+ guests]. In addition, they had a promotion where you could get several nights free at hotels across the country after the wedding [we ended up getting 5 nights free at a Hyatt Regency in Hawaii for our honeymoon - such a great deal ]. We would have loved our reception without the honeymoon promotion but that was a very nice touch.
