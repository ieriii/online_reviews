The amalfi hotel is great. I've only stayed there on business so I don't usually hang out in the room all day. I do alot of traveling and have to admit, the rooms are small though so try to get a corner room, they're bigger.  The amenities in the rooms are great, love the robe and slippers! They have THE BEST continental breakfast on every floor each morning. They also have an awesome happy hour every day with FREE top shelf alcohol along with some antipasto. The staff who works the happy hour is great!  I literally choose to stay in this hotel when i'm in chicago just for the breakfast and happy hour, love it!  Although, Amalfi if you're reading this, what happened to the vendor you used to get the flakey, buttery chocolate croissants from??! The new ones taste like a roll or bread? Love that you added other new stuff to the breakfast mix, but bring that old croissant back!!!! I see people complain about the food, that they don't have room service, yes I agree that it sucks to have Harry Cary's as the only option. But they make up for it with the free breakfast and happy hour,,,,,so that is totally fair. Plus there are some really great places in Rivernorth to dine at so there are many options.....I would suggest Rockit or Havana.  THe only thing i can't give rave reviews about is the people at the front desk, never had anyone really give me great service and at times they have even ignored me while on the phone. Everyone else at the hotel makes up for them though, even the door dudes are nice. So I used to come here for years and loved looking at the photos of the amalfi coast and said "i'd love to go to the real amalfi one day"! I got to do that this year! Stay here when you can get a good rate and if you like boutique hotels.
