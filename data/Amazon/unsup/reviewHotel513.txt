We had our wedding here and it was perfect. For a downtown location, it is very reasonable. We worked with Thelma and she was so wonderful. The room is a little narrow and long, but that is my only issue. The staff was so nice and they dealt with many of our annoying family members with tons of grace. They did have a light malfunction that no one could fix, but our dj set up a make shift lighting arrangement with his equipment. It actually looked pretty cool! Overall, our wedding was wonderful and The Embassy Suites had a lot to do with that!
