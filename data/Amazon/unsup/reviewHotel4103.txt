We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a week while visiting Chicago. Overall our stay at the hotel was pretty good, but there were a few things that really kinda sucked about this hotel. The hotel itself was pretty decent, the rooms were fine, nothing amazing, but fine. My first complaint was that the entire time we were there we consistently were hearing this banging noise, almost like someone was hammering on something. We made a comment about it to the front desk and they told us it would stop and they gave us a $15 coupon for food/drinks. The noise continued throughout the entire week. A second complaint was the TV. No, we were not in Chicago to watch TV, but whenever we did it was terrible. We had about 5 different news channels, 1 channel that showed a 24 hr. infomercial on prosthetic hands, and Russia Today. Really? My third complaint was the lack of wifi. Our first day there we called downstairs and found out that wifi was $13 per 24 hours. Eek!! The entire time we were in Chicago we made daily visits to the Corner Bakery for internet. Don't get me wrong, overall we really enjoyed our stay here, but there were a few things that were less than stellar. The staff was really nice and helpful and although I probably won't stay here again, I'd recommend someone else to stay here.
