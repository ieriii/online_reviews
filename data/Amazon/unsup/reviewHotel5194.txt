When I first stayed here 2 years ago, I would have given Hotel 71 a solid 4 stars, but now they get 2.5. It has all the signs of a property they have stopped investing in. I was under the impression 2 years ago that all the rooms would be renovated. I guess that is not the case. I switched out of the first room, because it was one of the old ones and during my last half-dozen visits, I stayed in the newer ones. The rooms are still nice and spacious, but they are not up keeping them. There are dings in the furniture. outdated sound system. There was only one bar of soap in the bathroom, and the cool "rain forest" shower head was corroded and the awesome big shower reeked of mildew and bleach. Worst of all, when I came back to the room today the door was wide open. I guess housekeeping forgot to shut it. This has been my go to hotel for Chicago travel, but I am going to look elsewhere next time.
