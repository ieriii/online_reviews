It is okay. Definitely not the nicest Ritz Carlton. Actually more on the lower end of the ones at which I have stayed. The decor needs updating. Went to a wedding here...it was okay....somewhat nice for a wedding but bad for a Ritz. The food could have been better. The ballroom was full of peach and was felt very old. There are not a lot of great photo opportunities in this hotel (it is in a mall...which also cheapens it a little), so keep that in mind if you want to have an event here.
