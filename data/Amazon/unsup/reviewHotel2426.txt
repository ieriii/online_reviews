I was fortunate enough to stay here for my birthday back in December. It is located right on Michigan Ave across from the Lake and the parks! Great location for a view, but in terms of things around it, there are not many shops or restaurants. The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holidays. One thing I didn't like was the ceilings of the lobby were really low, but there was a beautiful area with a huge Christmas tree. I got this hotel on Priceline and when we checked in, we were able to get a room with a gorgeous view. I was so happy! When we walked in, there was a computer that was playing musiak and had a personalized greeting on the front. Everything was nice and clean and I considered the bed to be comfy. Also, do not come to Chicago with a car. Parking is ridiculously expensive. 40 bucks and up each night. I would love to stay here again next time I'm in town.
