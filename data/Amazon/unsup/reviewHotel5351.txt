We stay at this hotel several times a year as a quick overnight getaway. The rooms are not the most luxurious, but are well appointed. Can't beat the location - easy walk to catch a movie, do a little bowling, grab a bite to eat. The downside? The afternoon complimentary cocktail hour is always just a long line of waiting. Breakfast is always great - though the gal getting the omelets ready to cook needs to lighten up a bit. overall great value! One note - scour the website for the parking package...it makes the $40 valet much more palatable!
