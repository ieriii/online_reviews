This hotel had helpful staff that were pleasant and welcoming. The lobby and rooms were contemporary and trendy. The rooms were small, but had a nice layout for the space. I loved the brand of amenities in the shower & was hoping to snag some before leaving. The parking is across the street, but I would still recommend doing it yourself, even though they have valet. I would come back here again if in the area.
