This hotel is okay for what it is, but it lacks basic amenities, like a hairdryer, which I found strange. The location is great, the prices are reasonable I guess, and the people working here are friendly. The beds were comfortable, but the sheets were stiff. And just a tip - don't eat breakfast here through room service. It's not very good, but it is very expensive. A bonus is that they do have free wireless Internet if you are traveling on business. You simply have to agree to the terms ever 24 hours. I believe they also have free wi-fi in the lobby if you're looking for a place to work in the area.
