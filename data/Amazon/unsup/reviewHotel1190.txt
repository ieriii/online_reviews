I came to this hotel to meet my fianc upon his return from service. Our first night together since he had come back home. Complete disappointment for his return home. We were given 2 double beds. They didn't explain this and when we made it to our rooms and discovered this and asked for a switch they said no that they were booked to capacity, didn't even offer a chance to upgrade to a suite.  I have worked in the industry for a bit and no hotel is ever booked to capacity without a major even happening in the city. No one was helpful at all with anything, housekeeping or front staff. The only redeeming quality is the parking attendant.  The lobby was ok. But the rooms were dated and the beds were not comfortable.  For a few bucks more I could have stayed at a better hotel in a better location. When I say better I meant the HOJO or Red Roof. This says it has four stars but there is no way that it does.
