meh. it's a landmark, but it's an old, small landmark. great view, but tiny digs. i've stayed at the drake twice for business and the room has been teensy each time. room service food was pretty mediocre and the pay-per-view didn't work (but i wanna watch step up 2!). great location, that's for sure. i needed to buy a nice top to wear to a bachelorette party one hour before it started, and all it took was a quick jaunt across the street to j.crew. problem solved in under 30 minutes. what really knocks this place down into two-stardom is the cab line. it took an hour to get a cab in the morning! someone at the drake needs to make friends with some cabbies, so they're not tempted to pick up only from the westin around the corner.
