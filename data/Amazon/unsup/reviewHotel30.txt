For the money.. it was a great hotel. Clean, great location, comfortable and fabulous staff. I enjoy older hotels with character.. The Tremont fit the bill. Great views, There weren't an abundance of tv channels, but the picture was clear and I sure didn't travel to Chicago to stay in the room and watch tv. and would prefer not to pay higher rates so others can. I would so stay here again. I wish I could remember the desk clerks name .. she was awesome in answering questions about the area.
