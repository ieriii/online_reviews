five stars for the location - heart of the Loop and just a short walk to Millennium Park, the Art Institute and shopping.  one star for noise insulation - wanna be awakened to the sound of someone showering or flushing a toilet at 3AM? Stay here.  The staff is friendly enough. and the rooms are drably but comfortably furnished. but for over $200 per night, I expect a robe - a necessity when answering the door for room service.
