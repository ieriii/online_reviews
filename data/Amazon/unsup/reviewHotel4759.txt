Went here last summer with a group of friends. We got a great deal on our room rate... $99!!! Our friend is a travel agent so she hooked us up.The hotel inside is very nice, but the rooms sucked. They were small and quanit and felt old. I hope they do some remodeling soon, it needs it. If you don't mind the old cozy room feel, you will be just fine.Location wise, great spot to Millienium Park and walking distance to most other places. We went during the taste of chicago and worked out perfect, because it wasn't too far from Grant Park.
