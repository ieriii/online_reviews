************* REVIEW 156 **************** I've been staying here a few times & the service has always been wonderful, especially the door men, always notice how many outfits I change in a day & compliments my shoes! Got to love that! What can I say about this hotel - the REAL CHICAGO - that hasn't been written before? This historical landmark hotel was the home of many royals, celebs, & in the known people from the Queen to princess Dianna, from many of our former presidents to celebs. So if it was good for them, it's plenty good for small people like me. What I love about this hotel was the perfect location, a few steps to the beach, a short walk to the Oak Street shops, & to the Magnificent Mile. Plenty of restaurants inside the hotel, especially the afternoon high tea, offer plenty of sandwiches, scones, breads, and desserts. Did I mention the insanely gorgeous Chanel Boutique that I drool each time I stay here. Not to forget the beautiful flowers shop with the cutest dog ever looks just like my late dog. & how can I forget the crystal chandeliers & fresh flowers through out the hotels, simply classic elegant real Chicago landmark. P.S. I also earn points with Hilton Honors too!
