I just have to give this place 5 stars. I met a couple friends visiting from out of town at the bar, and downstairs there is such a nice lounge. It was only 10pm or so and there was no one else down there so it was like our own spot! They had really comfy yet modern furniture and the bartenders were cool too.Oh and before I moved to Chicago I did used to stay here when visiting, the beds are very comfortable and the rooms are always clean!
