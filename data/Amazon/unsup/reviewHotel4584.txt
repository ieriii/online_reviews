Hotel Felix has managed to make a small hotel room stylish. My room was only slightly larger than the queen bed in it, but by using creative lighting and utilitarian design, it felt comfortable and hip as opposed to claustrophobic. The hotel front desk attendants were a bit stand offish, and they ended up screwing up the bill a bit, but all in all it was a very pleasant stay. We booked on Priceline, so the price wasn't bad, but the list price of booking through the hotel is a little steep for the space and amenities. If you can get a deal and want a trendy hotel experience, I recommend giving it a try.
