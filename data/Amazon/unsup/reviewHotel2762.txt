got a really good deal for a 'staycation' - my friends and i are from Chicago but wanted a break. well decorated, swanky lounge. room was nice, really loved the nook with couch/desk, the robes, the Kiehl's products. felt out of place though, we are in our early 20's and the staff seemed confused by our presence or something.
