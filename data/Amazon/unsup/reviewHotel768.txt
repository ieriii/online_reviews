I recently stayed at the Westin Michigan Avenue for a business trip. As always, tend to be impressed with Starwood hotels. The room was clean, the bed was cozy and the hotel had a good-working Starbucks. I loved the location of this Westin as it's next to great shopping and Rush Street (loaded with great restaurants & bars). Lastly, the bar at the hotel, The Grill, had a fabulous selection of wine, including a couple favorites - J Vineyards Pinor Nior & Grgich Hills Fume Blanc. I'll be back!
