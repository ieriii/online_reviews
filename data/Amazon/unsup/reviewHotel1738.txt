Yukon XL with a full tank of gas? Check. "In the Heights" tickets for the Cadillac theatre RIGHT next door? Check. Your teenage daughter and a whole group of your girlfriends? CHECK! We stayed here at the Hotel Allegro due to its close proximity to the theatre. We drove from Madison WI to take in a show, go salsa dancing and treat ourselves to an over nighter in the Windy city. While we thought we left in plenty of time we were still stuck on the Kennedy at 7:15 while curtain was said to go up at 7:45 that evening. Crap! No worries; I got off on Cumberland and took the streets into downtown. We pulled up to the Hotel at 7:38PM. Yeah - I know right? The doorman and bell person were ON POINT. We simply hopped out, opened the trucks hatch, they took my last name and our bags, gave us 2 tickets; one for the valet and one to pick up out luggage upon check in.  Nice! We walked 7 seconds to the show next door with NO worries. Upon arriving back at the hotel to check in; we were given double bed rooms on a high floor as requested; small rooms but hell it was efficient. We ordered room service, laughed loudly with no repercussions from the neighbors or the front desk, and when we went out dancing it didn't take forever for them to bring the wheels around. We all had a great time and would return.
