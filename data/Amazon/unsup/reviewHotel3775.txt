Er its OK but for the price I would expect the furnishings to be a little better. Detail Detail, the place has a bit of a worn feeling to it. Room was Ok, lampshade stained, bed super comfy. Shower only - no tub, and get this glass to the bedroom so your lovely can watch you in the shower or on the potty . There is a curtain bedroom side but still...kind of tacky. Grouting and painting in need of overhaul. Minibar - lots of snacks, and a selection of wine and champagne but no spirits. All reaonably priced. We went up to Vertigo - it was OK nada special. Hotel Location was good for our needs and staff were fine, rustled me up some safety pins for a wardrobe malfunction. We did not partake of any food or libation.
