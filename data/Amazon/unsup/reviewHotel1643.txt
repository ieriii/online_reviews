My best friend and I were going to a concert downtown (July 28, 2012). I live in Chicago and she lives in the suburbs but we wanted to book a hotel room and make a night of it. We tried for a week to get a room but literally all the hotels were booked, as there must have been a convention in town or something. So, we waited until the day before and tried again. The cancellation policy for most hotels is 24 hours. We got lucky enough to get a room at the Hotel Allegro.  It was a really great place to stay. I've read all of the other reviews and people have complained about silly things like the fact that the lobby is on the second floor.. no big deal, there is an elevator. They also complained about the rooms not being very big. That didn't bother me because they were SPOTLESSLY clean. The bathroom and closet were tiny but for us, it didn't matter. We were only staying overnight. The only challenge we had was that we both couldn't be in the bathroom doing hair/makeup at the same time. That's a small sacrifice for a great hotel and super friendly staff! We got vouchers for complimentary drinks to use at any time since we checked in after their free wine party. That was really cool!  I also "LIKED" their page on Facebook and there was a secret word that we were to give upon registration for a free gift. We got a $50 food voucher which we used for breakfast the next morning.  Overall, I was VERY satisfied with our stay there and I would stay again FOR SURE!
