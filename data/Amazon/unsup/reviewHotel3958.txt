I know that there are bad reviews of this place but I actually enjoyed my stay. staff was very friendly, and I enjoyed the victorian styled rooms. they are also very spacious, cheap and very clean. good cable, high speed internet and strong drinks in the bar also conveniently close to everything. this is a good place for people on a budget that don't wish to sleep in an expensive filthy cramped room but still want to be in the middle of it all. this is not a good place for a "huppie" that is used to the five star life.
