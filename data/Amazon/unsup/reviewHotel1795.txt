The company I was interviewing with at the time set up reservations and whatnot, so I cannot really comment on that. The front desk was very nice and helpful about checking in. I can't complain about the room. Everything was comfortable and well decorated. The view from the 5th floor was a brick wall, but that happens in Chicago. I suppose my only complaint was the bathroom was pretty cramped, but it definitely wasn't a deal breaker.
