Small rooms. My wife and I had a room with two beds and it was still criminally small , AND both beds were less than a footfrom each other. The bathrooms are barely bigger than the laundry closet in my condo. Elevators are slower than Paul Konerko(we were here for Soxfest, hence the slow ballplayer reference), and hotel staff was clueless overall. Overpriced rooms, overpriced parking, overpriced room service, overpriced....well you get the picture. Dont bother. While it's 'pretty" inside the lobby, it's a dump when you go to your room.
