As I approached this hotel on foot, I lowered my expectations. The surrounding area is not the most exciting part of Chicago and the exterior of the building is drab - I can't think of a better word to describe it. However, once I stepped inside, I started feeling better about my hotel selection, as the interior had the updated pseudo-euro feel to it. This property is part of the Intercontinental chain, so you know it has to be pretty good. By the time I got up to my room, my spirits were high - clean rooms with updated furniture, bathroom and electronics. What more could a guy and his roller bag want? Pros: * comfortable, modern feel (on the inside) * tv and clock radio were great, including one of those relaxing cds that plays nature sounds, if you're into that stuff (free to buy, $$ to buy) * Greektown is a short walk for food that is....Greek * Metra trains stop nearby at Oglivie and Union stations Cons: * not a great location, unless your imagination allows you to substitute the flow of traffic on the highway below you for the Chicago river (sits right at the Madison St. exit) * dining options limited in the immediate area
