Decent enough hotel for the price, maybe a tad rough around the edges. I wouldn't normally have chosen this place, but I won 2 nights in a silent auction, and I spend another night here during a long weekend trip. Conveniently close to the Red Line, but there's nothing in the immediate area that I found particularly compelling or fun - unless college dive bars are your thing.  I didn't eat here, so can't say anything about the food. The hardwood floors aren't such a nice selling point in the middle of winter. Housekeeping skipped our room one day, but the front desk graciously refunded 50% for one night to make up for it.
