It's kind of hard to find reasonable boutique hotels in the city. Or do I not know where to look? Got married last Saturday. Down to the wire, we decided to stay in a hotel the night of rather than schlep back home. Hotel Felix had been written up in Time Out and the look and location fit what we were looking for. Made my reservation on Expedia, but called to say it was our honeymoon so we wouldn't get stuck in the musty room by the elevator. The rooms ARE small, but when you have an awesome king size bed with a fluffy down comforter, who cares? What are people doing with all this extra room? I was worried about noise because of the tight space, but we didn't hear anyone all night. Had a drink in the hotel bar, which is always funny, because, well, hotel bar. Blackout curtain is fantastic. We stayed in the cave until a couples massage at the spa on the 2nd floor. Great atmosphere and we were treated very nicely there. Easy check in and check out. Only thought it was a little weird no one said anything about it being our honeymoon when we arrived. Despite that, a good experience.
