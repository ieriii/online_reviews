I'm more of a boutique hotel kinda chick but I happen to like this hotel. This place is gnormous but it serves its purpose--accommodation only. Don't expect the doorman, the concierge, the front desk agent to go out of their way to please you. They will do their job and do it well but nothing over the top. The best part of my stay here was our upgrade to Executive Level which entitles you to free entry to the Lounge. Woopdy-doo right? Heck, it's free appetizers, drinks, nice view...what's there to complain about?
