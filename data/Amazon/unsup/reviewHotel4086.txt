I think the location is a huge perk for this place. Great access to the Mag Mile, Millennium Park, Navy Pier, beautiful views along the river of classic Chicago landmarks...Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower, etc. Our room was nicely appointed...contemporary and clean, plus they feature plasma TVs, and ipod alarm clock, so that ups the cool factor. We stayed in the West wing, which was a blessing because a convention was throwing a rager in the atrium, and from what other reviewers have said, Big Bar can get noisy as well. If you stay here, I might recommend requesting a room in this wing.
