I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency for five nights while attending a conference at the hotel. The good: - The hotel was clean, the room was nice and surprisingly quiet, with great views - Great location. Minutes to Millennium Park and the Loop. The bad: - Internet costs $14/day, and even if you pay for it, it doesn't work on the levels where the conference is being held. Ridiculous. No, ridiculous isn't a strong enough word, but I don't think Yelp allows me to use stronger language. Because the conference rooms were all in the basement levels, cellphone and 4G service for your laptops/tablets was also sketchy at best. - I never ate at any of the hotel restaurants, but I did eat food provided at conference functions, and was thoroughly underwhelmed by all of it. - The Hyatt is currently having a labor dispute with the housekeeping staff. If it makes you feel uncomfortable to walk past picketing workers, or to support a company that doesn't properly compensate their workers, you might not want to stay here (my room was booked before I was made aware of the labor dispute).
