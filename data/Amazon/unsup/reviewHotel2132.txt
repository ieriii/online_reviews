Lovely, well-presented room. Small-ish but very nice bathroom (with a nice big counter!). Room was impeccably clean and everyone we interacted with was so kind and accommodating (especially the bell-men). The hotel was very quiet, even though our window overlooked Michigan Avenue. Beds were super comfortable. The only thing to complain about is the BS internet fee ($15 a DAY?!).. but that's all nice hotels these days. Perfect location; convenient to the lake shore path for runners :)
