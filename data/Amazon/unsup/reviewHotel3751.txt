I work as a third-party hotel vendor, so I get the privilege of staying in a lot of hotels in several cities. Most recently in Chicago, I stayed the Palomar, which was lovely, and the Best Western, which was atrocious. Trumping them both is the Dana, however. From the moment you arrive outside the door, you know you are in a great place. It's trendy and comfortable, that's smart. Doormen greet you immediately and show you to the concierge, which is a 1-2 person desk. Very humble: smart and casual, if you will. Keys are needed to ride the elevators, so as to avoid the squatters who just want to check out the visual delights of this boutique hotel - which definitely don't disappoint, mind you. Rooms feature hardwood floors and floor-to-ceiling windows offering a view of the city. They are modern and inviting. There are robes and slippers, a full work-station, complimentary wireless Internet, a television and big, comfy beds. Complimentary fitness center, a full-time business center, air travel kiosks, a chef-driven restaurant (free breakfast vouchers if you book direct with the hotel), and a swanky spa compile some of the fabulous extras. Don't forget one of the hottest, best-kept secrets: Vertigo, their sky lounge. Absolutely loved this place. Huge fan.
