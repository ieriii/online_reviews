Great hotel to use as home base if you're in Chicago.  The nightly rate is very reasonable and the hotel and rooms are very modern. I just hate the stuffy, cookie cutter look of the chains. Service is excellent and there is free WiFi. 4 stars instead of 5 because the fee to park a car is exorbitant ($48.00).  That is just crazy! Also, though I enjoyed the hotel, my bed honestly wasn't very comfortable. I didn't sleep well the whole trip - but I wasn't really in Chicago to sleep. The bathroom door is a sliding door and there is no soundproofing so there can be some awkward moments if someone is in the room with you... Overall a great, centrally located hotel.  I will return.
