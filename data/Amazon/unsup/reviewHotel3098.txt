I love this hotel. The big W outside the hotel made it for me and then some. Altho our room was not overlooking the lake, we had a good view of downtown Chicago.  The room was pretty amazing and I love those plantation windows they have for the bathroom. You can opt to open them if you are just doing your makeup while having to talk to whoever was with you in the room. It was nice and different. Even the bathroom door was not your usual door but a sliding one instead. The lobby bar/lounge was a comfort. I ordered a sampler dessert and I didn't want to share it. Drinks were okay. I was also able to use the pool once, warm and big enough for laps. They had threadmills and weights if you feel like working out. We made a good choice as this was walking distance to the Navy Pier. We were able to make trips back and forth to the Pier, Michigan Ave etc. and our hotel very conveniently. And it was close to almost everything. I'll stay at W again, anytime!
