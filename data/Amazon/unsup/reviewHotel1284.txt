Deca Bar is very nice for a jazzy time in Chi! IJazz Radio has free jazz at the Deca Bar on Friday nights. So you know I had to try it out. Though the bar did not start on time, the place was great, the food was gos food, and the wine was tasty. I tried a new wine line, Dr. Hermann (white); it was sweet, wet, and smooth. The price was a little above what I usually pay for wine ($9), but this was ok. I then tried something on the menu; the pork sliders. This was really good and I enjoyed each bite. I also like that nuts were served with the drinks...thanks for this! The space is so pretty. The were lots of seating around (comfy too). The sound for the music was also good. I liked that even though this bar is close to the hotel restaurant, you really can not hear them on the other side. Staff was good, service was ok. My only improvement would be for the hotel to have some professional signage about were the event was taking place. A few staff members did not know that the even is placing place nor its time. To my knowledge, it is open to the public, so we need to be aware of where we are going. Deca Bar was not listed in the ads by IJazz, so that is something all parties can work on. Other than that, I had a great time here at the Deca Bar and I can still taste those pork sliders...yum!
