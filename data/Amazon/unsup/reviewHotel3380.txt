This hotel was great. The bellman, Javier, was excellent too! He let us know where to get great pizza (expect a review sometime later), great bars around town, and how to get around the city. First, to start off with a few complaints, the bathroom was ridiculously small. I know if some of my friends would have been with me, there is no way they could have shut the door without standing in the shower to do so. But, not a big problem. Second, the pool and sauna closes at 10pm, that sucked, especially since it seemed like such a great idea after drinking at a football game all day. Now onto the good stuff, there is a mini fridge (empty) in your room! I don't know why more hotels don't understand that I want to keep my own things in my fridge, I don't want to buy your overpriced snickers bars or one ounce shots of liquor, when I can buy something at the local 7-11 for a third of the price! Next, the view was incredible! My friend and I could see as far as we wanted onto Lake Michigan (we were on the 9th floor), we could see Soldier Field, and Navy Pier. The view was worth the price (about $150 after taxes and fees per night). The bed wasn't the greatest bed, but it wasn't horrible either. My last complaint, because it felt like they were just trying to charge us a few extra bucks, was to hold our bags Sunday after we checked out but before our plane left, they charged us a few dollars. I thought that was cheap, when we would have just tipped the Bellman instead (but we decided to, only because it was Javier though)! Regarding the price - our friends on the trip told us they got the W. Chicago for $100 the week before they left, when we booked two to three weeks ahead of time and paid $150 per night. I looked at the W. and it was definitely nicer, so that was kind of a let down, but not the end of the world.
