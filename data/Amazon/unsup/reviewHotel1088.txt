Its ok. The good: Pretty lobby. Smells like fresh flowers. Great location. Big bathrooms. Great bath amenities. Friendly staff. NY Times delivered bright and early. The not so good: Small rooms. The lobby is very pretty, but the rooms are super boring. Thin walls. I could hear the alarm clock going off next door. The towels weren't very soft. Great place to watch drunk conventioneers.
