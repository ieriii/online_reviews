I stayed at the Allerton on a Friday night recently and despite the other reviews about not having enough space in the room, I found the room to be perfectly sized for 2 people. We were not in the room long enough to have a problem with confined spaces, as we stayed only for the night. The staff was great here and very attentive to our needs and wants. The only complains that I would have (personally) is that the elevators are INSANELY slow, and its frustrating to wait for an elevator for 10 minutes. Also, though the pedestal sink in our bathroom was very nice, I am a girl and have a decent amount of products and appliances that didn't have anyplace to be stored. I would definitely stay here again, but only for 1-2 nights.
