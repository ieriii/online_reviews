There really isn't any other word to describe the Fairmont Hotel other than classy! It is such a fantastic hotel with a beautiful lobby and great rooms. I've been to parties here and the ballrooms are wonderful and the guest rooms are very nice as well. They also have Aria inside the hotel which is a bonus also! If you are looking for a really nice hotel for out of towners, this is it!
