It's been a few years since I stayed here. But I recommend it frequently to friends and associates based on the positive experience I had. I prefer the small boutique hotels in general because they tend to be more accommodating and offer cool extras. Like the wine reception, or how they sometimes have a DJ spinning in the lobby in the evening.  I will say the decor is a little funky and the stripes in the hallway made me feel like I was Alice in Wonderland in that hall that seems to go on forever getting smaller and smaller *lol*. But considering how great the location is and what the median rates are in the city, they're actually quite affordable. You can (usually) get a room around $199 and considering the Hampton Inn charges more than $200 and doesn't have half the style or amenities I much rather choose the Allegro if it was available.
