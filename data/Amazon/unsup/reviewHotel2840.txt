I'm only judging this place based on it's conference space. I came here for the recent APS conference this past may and it was extremely well organized. The place feels so clean and the location is great; it's near major bus lines and shopping areas. The place is also near the Navy Pier, which was a great plus. The doormen are super polite & service in general at the lobby seems very welcoming and friendly, not to mention there are so many places to lounge around! The interior decor is nice as well. What I love best are the bathrooms. They keep them so well-kept and it smells nice and not disgusting despite so much foot traffic. I know that's kind of random, but hey, nice bathrooms are nice bathrooms.
