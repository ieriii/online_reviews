So I guess I was definitely paying for location since the website made the rooms look majestic - plush beds and gorgeous views of the Chicago skyline at night. Unfortunately, for $199 a night internet deal (back in 2003), my room I rented for 4 of my friends to celebrate my birthday was super tiny. Also, when I set up reservations, they asked an odd question where I had to put another person down for the credit card hold. So when I checked in they requested my card and my friend's card which didn't make any sense since I was the person who was paying the whole bill. Anyway, it didn't really matter since we only needed a place to crash. Afterwards, the billing was screwed up and I noticed on my bank statement that I was double charged for the room so I had to call my bank for them to withhold the charge and speak to a Marriot resident regarding the billing error. Marriot didn't give me much of a hassle regarding the fees but a little attention to detail would be nice.
