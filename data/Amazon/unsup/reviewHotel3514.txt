I was in the city with my significant other to visit a friend and celebrate my birthday and after doing a little research on Expedia we decided to try out the Allerton. I am SO glad we did. We were put in a very nice, unique room that looked right out over Michigan Ave. and the lake. The room was "unique" in that rather than being square and wide it was long and narrow, which I had no problem with. Narrow and on the small side is how most of the hotel spaces are constructed (particularly the elevators) and I can see how, as some posters have complained, a standard room may be smallish and the narrow hallways and elevators were annoying (especially at check out time when everyone is using them all at once.) However, it is not a secret that this is an old hotel. If you don't appreciate the history, age and building structure that go along with an older building stay someplace else. Everything about our stay was A+. Friendly staff, super comfy bed and linens, a bathroom stocked with L'Occitane bath products and room service that was delicious and not priced at heart stopping rates. (We had a delicious full breakfast that cost no more than we would have paid at any standard restaurant on Michigan Ave.) You can't beat the location, the room price was extremely reasonable for the area and we will definitely be back again!
