I think we got a good deal here $600 for 3 nights...we fit 6ppl in a room and it didn't feel too crammed. We 2 full/queen beds and a sofa bed. The sofa bed was not comfortable so when it was my turn to sleep on it, I just slept on the floor. The hotel is very conveniently located. Almost everything was a 10-15 min walk from where we lived. When I had to buy a pair of shorts (since it was blazing hot all of a sudden), I was very grateful that Express was right next door. The hotel itself is a bit old so you have to go up two flights of elevators to get to your room. There aren't many of them and they are slow. You can't even take the stairs if you wanted to since they are for emergencies only. Also, I hate when you request more blankets, they give you those janky, light blankets...how are you supposed to keep warm?? Other than that, the housekeeping was very nice. The blanket thing isn't their fault....she did give us tons of towels. The pool is small, but it's nice to play in if it's raining outside.
