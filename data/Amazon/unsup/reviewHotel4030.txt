I'm a big Marriott girl but was tagging along with a friend for a convention so she was in charge of booking the locale. I have to say I was very happy with her selection! The HR is in a great spot right off the river with amazing views of the river and Michigan Avenue. It's centrally located between the loop and the mag mile -- you really couldn't ask for more. I also like that it's very self sustaining with several restaurants, bars, etc. all in the hotel.. not just one selection but several good choices. The rooms were nice and the service from the front desk to the maid service was all well above average. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat and would highly recommend to anyone! :-)
