I went this past week for a holiday tea--total let down. The atmosphere is nice and it's decorated beautifully for the holidays. I enjoyed the harpist, but found the roving carolers slightly annoying. They were good, but I would have appreciated them more if they didn't sing over my table every 15 minutes. The tea selection was nice and the service was very good, but the food. Total waste of money. Probably one of the worst teas imaginable. The scones were ROCK hard, totally inedible. I had a similar one on United Airlines recently. The sandwiches were ok, but nothing to save the overall selection. I only tried the strawberry tart among the deserts. I LOVE strawberry tarts, so I was totally disappointed when they managed to mess this one up as well. The strawberries were good but the crust was hard and stale tasting. Also, the champagne they advertise is $30 a glass. They also have one for $11, but they promote the $30 glass--I'm sorry but that's ridiculous. We asked for the wine list and had a glass of wine instead. If you're not picky about food or have not been to a proper tea before, it's a nice experience but for such a first rate hotel I expected more.
