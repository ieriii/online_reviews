I stayed here last summer after booking a room for $89 on Hotwire. I've come to be a little wary of using Hotwire for booking nice city hotels, as you occasionally get crammed into the tiniest room on site - but in this case, they offered me an upgrade to the executive floor for $20 or $30 and I jumped all over that. For the small cost of an upgrade, you get to ride the fancy schmancy executive elevator and have free snacks, sodas, and appetizers in the evening. It was money well spent.  Overall, the hotel is stunning. It's one of those grand old hotels where the building is sturdy and glamorous, even if a few things seem slightly outdated. The service was great and I didn't notice any significant amount of noise during the stay. The only minor flaw in the whole experience was the breakfast. It was fairly pricey given the quality of food served, but it was still good - and the atmosphere of their restaurant is very opulent, too.  Although I love sampling lots of different hotels in every city I visit, I would definitely return to the Palmer House on a future trip.
