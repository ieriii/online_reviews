I stayed here for two nights over the July 4th weekend, and I was very impressed. The decor is kitschy but not over the top, and the rooms were great. For the price we paid (I think it was about $300 for two nights, so about $100/person), it was a fantastic value. The rooms are pretty big and look like you're in some tropical resort. The beds are really comfortable and you couldn't hear noise from outside or other rooms at all. We got there much earlier than the posted check-in time (we took a 7 am flight from Boston) but we were able to check in, go to our room, and leave our luggage with no problem. This hotel is in a nice neighborhood, and it's really convenient--walking distance to many attractions, a few blocks from the Red Line, there's a grocery store and drug store (the drug store sells alcohol) a few blocks away, and there' s a Starbucks right down the block. Bonus points for that, I need my iced mocha in the morning!
