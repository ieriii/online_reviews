The Palmer House is wonderful, majestic, and historical. From the moment you enter through the doors, you almost feel as if you walked into a different era. It is beautifully decorated and even the smallest details in the decor, show what an elegant hotel it is. It is one of the oldest hotels in the city, but it truely captures Old Chicago essence.
