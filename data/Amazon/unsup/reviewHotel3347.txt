Basically the room look nice and the housekeeping does a good job, although the sign says if you leave your towel hanging we won't replace it for good Eco friendly habits. They replace them everyday anyways it seems. Maybe they just refold them fancy but I think they replace them. My biggest complaint is that you can't control the temperature of the room. We sweat at night, sleep with the covers off, and make up melts right off our face while we're putting it on. It has several restaraunts within walking distance and one block. A sushi place, a blues bar that serves dinner and an Irish pub that serves meals.
