The room I stayed in on the 13th floor was quite comfy. 2 of the 3 nights I passed out in the king size bed with various items (ie room service menu, cell phone, etc) scattered around me. The sheets were clean and cozy, the pillows aplenty & satisfactorily poofy. The room appeared recently redone in an art deco style. I can dig. No peeling wallpaper to complain about whatsoever, not even in the bathroom. Yes, the bathroom is compact to the point that closing the door is awkward. Not so great for couples hot hotel seduction, but I was here for a conference. The raised sink as literal wash basin on counter was obnoxious. Also low. I'm tall, quit annoying me with sinks at my knees please. I did not find I was lacking for towel-hangage space, though yes the toilet is like a space rocket. So, too, are people next door if you happen to be so lucky. Very thin walls. Like, hearing people's entire conversations over HBO at midnight thin. All that is redeemed by the Food. The Palmer club is turkey, tomato, Gruyere [chorus of angels], bacon, and a black pepper mayo on multigrain bread. With truffle potato chips. The Sweet corn soup has chorizo, is light, tangy, carries a touch of heat. And, oh, yes, Bertha's brownie. I know not who she is, but I am proud of whoever created this dessert in her name. The brownie, with its fudge syrup and nuts, was good. Maybe not as good as the chocolate ice cream that accompanied it. Definitely not as awesome as the chocolate mousse. Omg. Also, eggs benedict. Not absolutely mind-blowing, but pretty near perfect. Only downside to the room service is that the 'late night kitchen' closes at midnight. At first, I did not realize this when I returned much later from my romp around the city.
