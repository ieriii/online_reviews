Frankly, I got the short end of the stick at Hotel Felix. Three day trip, late September. Roughly $200/night. (not that cheap!) Word to the wise, when you book via the hotel engines (Hotwire, Expedia, etc) you are typically filling up the most...err...undesirable rooms. Not always, but sometimes. You might end up in a great hotel, but be forewarned that you might get the "blah" rooms no one else wants. In this case. Most definitely. If you get assigned an "01" room at the Hotel Felix, try to get reassigned. it is DIRECTLY in the elevator bank basically. My boyfriend checked the floorplan and most definitely they carved an entire elevator out of this room, leaving it roughly at about 100SF, if that. It is TINY. Not just small, but terribly uncomfortable for any length of time. Impossible for two people. Claustrophobic. No closet space. Other than that this hotel is fine... Pros: *above average hotel restaurant: Elate. (and decent room service!) *great location, non-busy street. (Huron) in River North. *easy metered parking exists, 2 hour limits. *Staff is quite nice. *Free wi-fi Cons: *Room size *The coffee is always empty in the morning in the lobby *$42 valet All in all fine, but was not totally comfortable in that size room with an elevator dinging ALLLLLL day/night.
