As a wedding gift a friend who couldn't make it got us a room for the 4th of July. In a city where it's next to impossible to get a room on that night, we thought this was a neat idea! And the reservation aid lakefront view. Nice! When we checked in we got a 'congratulations' and a 'let me see if I can find you a good room'. Oooo, thanks! Good room apparently is NOT a lakefront room. It's facing Michigan Avenue. And it's under construction. Boo. But it was in the corner and the silence was wonderful!  Nice staff, sloooow elevators (but hey, it's old!) and very vintage rooms made for a nice vacation in our own city. And walking down to the end of the street for the fireworks and then back - all in our PJs wasn't too shabby either! ;)
