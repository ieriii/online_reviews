Ok so i only yelp about restaurants, but i see other people yelp about hotels, so i had such a pleasant experience at this hotel i had to review it. We booked a flight and hotel deal with this hotel,and we seriously paid like less than a hundred bucks a night for a week. This place come with a 17th floor balcony, a gym, everything u can wish for. also our room came with a kitchen, and they even wash your dishes for you. I cannot wait to go back.
