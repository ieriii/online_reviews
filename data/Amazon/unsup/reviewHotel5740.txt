At first I thought this hotel was ok. But I had to stay here for two weeks because of work. The best thing I can say about this hotel is that it's clean, and for me the location was ideal. However, customer service wise, I have never had a worse experience. You have to park valet, although most of the time the parking lot is not full. And, parking is expensive. I was sworn at by the valet because he couldn't find my keys. The desk staff has a way of making issues with check in seem like your fault, and when I had a problem with internet connection, I was told to deal with it myself. So anyway, if I had a choice I would not stay here.
