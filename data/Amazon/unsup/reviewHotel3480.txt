My boyfriend and I stayed here for a short weekend getaway last month. The hotel is beautiful... a perfect mix of vintage charm and modern convenience. The rooms, as noted in other reviews, are on the small side - but this really wasn't a concern for us as we spent most of our time out enjoying the city. Hotel staff was top-notch - very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is situated right on Michigan Avenue - location could not have been better for us. We were in walking distance of everything we could possibly need and more. You just can't beat the value and quality of this hotel... we would definitely stay again next time we visit!
