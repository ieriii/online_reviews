My husband and I live in downtown Seattle and went to Chicago for our 1 year wedding anniversary (and to visit family in the area). We stayed at the Whitehall and LOVED it. It was perfect. We stayed in a nice room that had been recently renovated. We bought the room through alaska airlines and it was a very good deal. This place was cozy, unique, fun & the staff were friendly. We also enjoyed the lounge downstairs. We'd stay here again for sure.
