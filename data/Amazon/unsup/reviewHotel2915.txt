The Sheraton is a cool old, giant hotel right in the heart of downtown. It over looks the river, some rooms over look the lake, and it is a quick walk to everything: ~400 yards to the lake, 20 yards to the river, lots to do near by. Rooms are decent, normal hotel rooms. Beds were wicked comfortable and the room was cold.
