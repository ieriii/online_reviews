I don't know if I have anything new to add- I agree with almost every statement here to some degree. The lobby is luxurious and even nicer with Christmas trees in it, the location is great, the room is a bit small but the beds are comfy, the bathroom was a good size. they do get you with the extra charge for internet and no breakfast. Total bill was around 400 for 2 nights including parking, which is not bad for NYE in downtown Chicago, although we probably could have done better. We stayed in a renovated room so the furnishings were fine, and we could hear our neighbors and the El go by, but very quietly, so I didn't think it was an intrusion. The view wasn't breathtaking, but I could see some skyscrapers and we were high up. I would have liked a mini-fridge to keep left-overs in. It was nice that we could stay in the parking garage until 5 even though check-out was at 11.  All in all, a fine place, probably a 3.5 more than a 3.
