This place is a cut above the rest. From the moment that my wife and I arrived to the moment we left we had nothing but good things to say. They have everything; we had plans in the city and scraped them for a night at the hotel. The entire staff was smart, friendly, and warm. From the exquisite customer service at the front desk, to the kind doorman and everyone in-between, this team knows how to treat their guests. It is obviously a meticulously run location. The room was unlike most in the city with an amazing view, hard wood floors and a modern bathtub and shower. Our room was brand new. It is also conveniently located next to a CVS, if you need to grab few random things, for the room. However if you are looking for some place good to eat, stay in for room service or eat at the wonderful restaurant on location, at Filini. The head Chef Christian Fantoni creates food that makes you feel like a judge on the food network. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a great time and food in a perfect location.
