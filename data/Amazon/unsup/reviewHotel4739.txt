After a long flight in from Philadelphia, I expected to arrive at a four star hotel that would accommodate my every need. When I first arrived at the hotel, there were three hotel staff smoking in front of the building swearing left and right about how much they hate their jobs and their management. I tried to shrug the rudeness of the staff off and continued to the front desk where a woman seemed to be annoyed by my arrival. She had been speaking with a gentle man at the front desk for my entire entrance from the front door and did not excuse herself from the conversation once I was in front of her. I checked in fairly fine besides the awkward silence from the girl at the front desk who didn't seem to understand that I was more important than her previous conversation. I arrived at my closet of a room and could not believe how small it actually was. I had no space to unpack and definitely no space to do my morning exercise. I am usually a very easy going person, but I expect to get great service when I decide to spend a little extra money on a four star hotel.
