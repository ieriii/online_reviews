Our stay at The James was great! It's a smaller hotel than I'm used to staying in, but it was fantastic. The room was a nice size. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in away from home. Very clean. Very quiet. Great customer service. If we needed new towels, they were rushed up. Every night they have turn down service where they offered to turn down your bed, get you ice, and they bring you cookies. Only a few negative things during our 3 night stay: The room service was pretty average, but expensive per usual. The valet parking was $48 a day which is nuts!! We were on the top floor, and our room was always crazy hot. We had to have the thermostat at 55 degrees so that we wouldn't sweat. The whole place only has 2 elevators, and at 2am after all the New Years parties were coming to an end we came back to the hotel to find a HUGE line to get in an elevator.  All-in-all, I'd stay here again.
