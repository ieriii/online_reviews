One of my favorite hotels in the area. This was my second stay there. Very cool place and I love the spacious size of the rooms and the river view rooms! Great location. The staff is great, friendly, professional and welcoming. However, was really disappointed this visit. While clean, our room was less than perfect. Very dusty light and ventilation screens in the bathroom, and ceiling in disrepair. Used K-cup left in machine from last guest. As much as I love it, very expensive considering some of the somewhat run down condition. At almost $200/night even with a discount, unfortunately not worth it with SO many other great choices in the area.
