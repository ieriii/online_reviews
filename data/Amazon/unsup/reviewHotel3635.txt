This hotel offers possibly the best experience in Chicago! The staff here treat you as a foreign dignitary and are always offering to help. I've only stayed here twice, but I go to the high tea every time I'm in Chicago. The hotel has a fantastic location.  The hotel rooms are very both sumptuous and comfortable. Some of the rooms have wonderful views of Lake Michigan and Michigan Avenue. The high tea is great, and should be on everyone's list when they visit Chicago. It is an experience which will not be regretted!
