Definitely one of my better hotel experiences in Chicago (relative to the W Lakeshore). Staff is friendly. And even though I was only at Gold SPG member at the time, they upgraded me to a junior suite. Everything's within walking distance (Michigan Ave., Navy Pier, etc.) so that makes things convenient. A good experience overall.
