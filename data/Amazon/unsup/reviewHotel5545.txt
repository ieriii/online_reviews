Excellent hotel in the Loop, Chicago. Friendly and attentive staff. Clean and well decorated in a modern and hip style. Free breakfast and internet. Since this area of the loop is primarily a business district, it was surprisingly quiet during the evenings and weekends. If you want a more frantic environment stay in the Mag Mile area. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the Sears (watchoo talkin about Willis) Tower where bus/trolley tours depart . Don't pay $70 for a cab from O'Hare. Simply lake the blue line to Washington exit. It costs $2.25 and took about 40 minutes. From the station to the hotel was about a ten minute walk. Exc - Decor, cleanliness, free wifi, location Good - Breakfast Ave - None Poor - None
