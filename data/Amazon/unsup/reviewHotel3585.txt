This review is only for the tea.. been here twice for afternoon tea, and it's fantastic. What's better than an afternoon sipping bottomless tea and eating scones and miniature sandwiches with the sound of a water fountain and harp music in the background? It does cost something like $38 per person, but you get what you pay for - the ambiance, European made China, service, and a perfect hangout place with good friends for a few hours.
