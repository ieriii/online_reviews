We stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday. The hotel is clean, clean, clean. Loved the robe in the room. The staff is friendly and the location is great as we walked to Michigan Avenue shopping and could walk to Whole Foods to grab a piece of fruit or drink. The rooms are well appointed (just a shower, no tub) but our room was VERY small. Sink was incredibly shallow. The view out the front was poor and we were awakened at 4:30 a.m. by a very loud garbage truck that stayed for a very long time. No room for a coffee maker in the room, so we had to go the 1st floor for coffee, but at least it was free from 7-10 a.m. We had no trouble with it being empty and the coffee cleanup lady even set it back up quickly when we arrived at 10:10 a.m. Wi-Fi was free, so that was a plus.
