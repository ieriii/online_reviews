I will just make a list of the awful experience we had- 1. The doormen ignored us as we struggled out of the cab with the luggage. 2. The hotel did not have our reservation (that was paid in full through Hot Wire. Luckily I had my confirmation e-mail.) 3. We were not told we had to use our key card to work the elevator and stood there looking very foolish. 4. Wall covering was peeling off and taped up with scotch tape-very tacky 5. The room had no information about the hotel (nothing telling us about restaurants, if there was a pool, if there was room service, etc.). We never ate at the hotel because we could not get information about what was offered. 6. Had to call at least four times for 1. a second bathrobe 2. a coffee maker 3. hotel information (which they never brought) 4. bathtub flooded and the repair man had to come 7. The bathroom door/shutter allowed people in the room to hear EVERYTHING-very awkward! 8. Ice bucket was the size of a coffee mug-had to make several trips and eventually just ended up using the trash can 9. Leaving for dinner the doormen would not help us. They made comments to us like a bunch of construction workers but never got us a cab. We ended up walking to the cab stand across the street. 10. Terrible service on all levels. Even though our second night was pre-paid we moved to another hotel for a much better experience.
