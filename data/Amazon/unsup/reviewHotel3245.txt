This hotel is in the historical Carbide & Carbon Building and has a great location right off of Michigan avenue. The top of the building was actually featured in the movie Wanted, and I think that's pretty neat. The overall stay at the hotel was good with a nice clean room, fun decorations, and a neat overall feel. I enjoyed a drink at the bar and overall had a satisfactory visit. The price is fair for the location, but it is just neat to stay in a Hard Rock Hotel with all the cool memoribilia all around. I've stayed in quite a few hotels in the Loop and most are all comparable. Summary Good Location Good Rooms Fair Price
