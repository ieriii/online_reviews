Got a deal on Hautelook for this hotel for my best friend and I who were having a girls weekend in Chicago. The hotel is cute and the location is great if you want to be near Michigan Ave. Rooms are on the small side, like other reviewers have said, but they were still fine, not like oh my god I'm staying in a closet. The staff wasn't too attentive to problems: we mentioned twice that the phone in our room didn't work (we had wanted to buzz down for late check out and wake up calls) and nobody ever did anything about it, even though they said they would. Things we didn't mention that still didn't work were the ipod dock, and the AC system woke me up numerous times throughout the night. That sucker was LOUD. Would I pay full price to stay here again? No, but for the deal I got, it was more than adequate.
