Stayed here for 2 nights and absolutely loved it.  Would go back again. Nice, big comfortable rooms with nice beds. My daughter loved the "sweet dreams" pillows on the bed. We were on the 21st floor and had a great view, and could even see Lake Michigan.  Very nice! Plus there is a restaurant, an Einstein Brothers bagel place, an indoor and outdoor pool.  Great location also -- within walking distance of the Magnificant Mile, Navy Pier, etc.
