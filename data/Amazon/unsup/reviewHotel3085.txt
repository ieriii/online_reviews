Much better than the City Center W Hotel if you are trying to decide. I stay at many W's around the country, and here, the rooms had are pretty standard, fairly good sized bathroom, rainwater shower and a great daybed. I was on the 32nd and my room had a great view of the Navy pier. They also have telescopes by the elevators for viewing. My flight home was cancelled and I had to stay an extra night in Chicago, so I moved to from the City Center to the Lakeshore - HUGE difference. If you want to pick an SPG property in Chicago I'd pick this. Also they have a cool top-floor bar (Whisky Sky) which has a nice view over the city and some solid drinks. Carly took care of me :)
