okay, it's a pretty hotel. pretty pricey though and for what reason? i caught on right away - we were paying for all the pretty things! last year i had a free hotel stay at a much better hotel (embassy suites) and i decided that me and my guy would have an annual pre-christmas local getaway from now on. the sheraton seemed like a good idea at the time, but in fact it was not. the bed was the best thing about our stay - very comfortable, no complaints.  the room was clean. but there was evidence of wear and tear. i expect that if i'm paying a higher price i get better quality. not so here. location is decent also if you're a fan of looking at the river. although michigan avenue is a couple blocks away the hotel's location doesn't make you feel like it is accessible. it's in a crazy little spot. i do NOT recommend eating in the lb bistro - way too expensive. we paid $25/person for the breakfast "buffet" and it was nothing more than a regular buffet set up in a "fancy" way, and a "fancy" chef who makes omelets and scrambles eggs. the food was not even that great. i don't mind paying $25 for food that tastes great. but this was not great food. also, there is a shuttle that will take you to macy's - on state or michigan. this was not well advertised. i found out by accident when going to catch a taxi and another guest informed me of the shuttle. all in all it wasn't the worst place to stay, but for the money spent i would NOT do it again, not at this sheraton.
