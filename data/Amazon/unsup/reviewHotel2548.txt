I was there for the Black/White party that someone else's review mentioned, if not for that I doubt I would have even thought there might be anything over here. We paid a $10 cover for an hour of free Absolut drinks, but much to our surprise after the special was over... $11 for a vodka soda? We didn't stay long. Very cool decor, especially the freezer doors and nude photography on the walls, but this place sure think's they're big shit. Come on. It's not like there's a shortage of "upscale" nightspots in Chicago. If this place wasn't a pain in the ass to get to (Hello, this is a Transit-oriented city!) and/or was in a neighborhood that didn't always smell like rotting meat/produce, you might be able to pull it off. As is, you're only getting 2 stars because of the decor.
