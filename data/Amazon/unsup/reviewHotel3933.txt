Just don't do it. Even if you'll save an extra couple of bucks and even if you think that the more recent positive reviews are a sign that they've made some improvements.  Mattresses sag, stains on the tile ceiling are just two examples of the general shoddy-ness of the hotel. The only reason it gets two stars is that I had a lake view, the location was close to the convention I was attending and the folks there weren't complete assholes.
