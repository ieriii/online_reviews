Awesome hotel!! Stayed this last weekend with my fiance and couldn't have asked for anything better. As per priceline's 4 star rating, it had everything I could have wished for and the beds were amazing (I slept so well)! Perfect location also...right by the best restaurant in Chicago, Frontera Grill!
