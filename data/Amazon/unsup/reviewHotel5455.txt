Huge bed. Loved the shower and tub. Great for relaxing in after getting drunk. I had driven from California and didn't feel like risking my car out on the street so I paid $45 for each night of parking. =/ Front desk was friendly and didn't seem to mind me being dressed in just a t-shirt and jeans.
