This has got to be one of my favorite hotels in any city. Perfect location and great views of the lake, looking North, it is special in many ways. The front desk and all the staff are first rate, and the rooms are the right blend of "old world" charm, but with all the required modern touches. The food in all the hotel's restaurants is excellent. From the fancy "Cape Cod Room" to the "Drake Brothers" restaurant, and the "Coq D'or" bar (with a more casual menu), you really can't miss. The lobby is very impressive with an amazing central flower arrangement and be sure to spend some time in the "Palm Court" with its' own water feature and flower display. "High Tea" is served every day from 1 to 5PM. Tip: it is worth it to get an executive level room as you will then have access to their executive lounge on the 10th floor. Very good selection of breakfast food and evening appetizers with an amazing view of the lake and the bustling North Lakeshore Drive.
