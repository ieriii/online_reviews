Wow. The bathroom alone in these rooms deserves 5 stars, then you can add in the cleanliness of everything, the service, and of course the view. So the bathrooms are beyond modern. The showers don't even have doors, just a strategically placed wall of glass that separates you and a view of the lake. This is the only place I have stayed where I feel they clean the duvet cover between each guest. Yes, I actually felt like I could lay my head on the bed without smelling the last 50 people that stayed in my room. I would definitely stay again.
