Stayed in the motel part of the hotel, but attended a marriage ceremony and reception in the main building. The motel is a real throwback, with multiple versions of patterned wallpaper, bright colored bedspreads, and drapes all mixed in with a combination of carpet and contrasting tile. It's a good thing I could give a s**t about decorating. The bed was comfortable and clean, and overall, the place is very nicely kept. Bathroom is tight for two (really, it's tight for one), but a nice, hot shower. The accommodations for the marriage ceremony and reception were top notch, and everything from the bartenders to the hors d'ouevres were excellent. And the dinner was incredible -- not sure I've ever seen a kitchen send out this much food -- and complicated food (beef wellington), no less -- and have it come out hot, crispy and delicious. Kudos to all for being spot on! TIP: Don't forget to ask for the WiFi password when checking in -- and the WiFi password expires in the middle of the night, so don't waste too much time trying to figure out why your network connection is gone in the morning...
