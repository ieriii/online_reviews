The standard rooms are small but make efficient use of space. The modern decor compliments the hotel's modern design and materials. Despite much glass, cement, and metal, it still feels very intimate and warm. However, if you are easily awakened, bring some sort of white-noise device, as we were constantly disturbed by car alarms and sirens a full 20 stories below. My only complaint was the bellman tried scaring me into using the hotel's overnight valet service for $38 by saying I'd be towed if I parked overnight on Erie Street. Minutes later, I asked a parking enforcement officer, who informed me that overnight parking was legal and free, but that I'd need to begin paying again at 8:00 a.m.  Despite that, I'd definitely go back. The location is great, and the hotel is very unique.
