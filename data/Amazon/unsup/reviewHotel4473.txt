Let me start by saying we got our room for free for the weekend because I had free night certificates from Hilton. Upon arriving, we valeted the car but got no assistance with our bags or the door for that matter. There was plenty of staff waiting to help us at the desk. They let us check in way early for their policy, but put us in a room where I could touch the tub, sink, toilet, and door all at the same time. Maybe I don't quite appreciate the history of the place, but this was ridiculous. I called and they moved us to another room in about an hour. Not too shabby considering it was free; however if I were a paying customer I would have been disappointed. The executive lounge was great and we enjoyed snacks and breakfast there, but I didn't appreciate the pretentious lady at the desk up there who looked at us like we didn't belong when asking for a map of the area. GET OVER YOURSELF! The second day we waited for over 30 mins for the car- only to figure out that they had forgot to go get it! No biggie if it's nice out, but quite a different story when its 20ish. We did enjoy our stay, but like I said, if we were paying the normal rate, we would have been disappointed.
