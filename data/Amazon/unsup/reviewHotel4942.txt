Stayed here for a week for business. Pros+ Excellent location. Safe and right in the heart of the Magnificent Mile you are walking distance to everything. Millennium Park, Navy Pier, all just about a mile away. Infinite food, bar and shopping choices all around you. 24 hour Walgreens just a block away for any incidental purchases. + Rooms are clean, comfortable, functional and modern. + Facilities. Business center and gym. Which should be expected.+ Sky Lounge has excellent views. Had breakfast here every morning. Very friendly staff.Cons- Warning, if you have a car, the valet parking is pricey. But this is Chicago. Big city, big city prices. Be reasonable, this is expected.- If you like to swim at your hotel, the pool isn't huge or anything to write home about. But it's not the worse.Not really a lot of cons here. The sheer convenience offered by the location of this hotel is worth the stay. Highly recommended.
