Great stay. We were in awe over practically everything in this hotel. Well decorated. Modern, but still warm and inviting. Room was clean, which is always a good feeling. Loved the complimentary coffee & tea maker. Definitely came in handy in the morning.  It's obvious that they are still working out some kinks, though. We tried to use our complimentary drinks with our breakfast but after we placed the order they called us back ten minutes later to say they couldn't serve alcohol until 11am.  It took 3 visits to our door to get us some honey that we asked for when we ordered. Also, they would do well to expand on their room service breakfast menu.  Otherwise, it was a great time. I'd definitely recommend it!
