My boyfriend and I met his mother and her friends here. They were staying for a girl's weekend getaway. Their room was fantastic. Perfect for the four ladies to enjoy themselves. Two queen beds. A very large bathroom with an awesome tub. The front room had two couches to relax on while watching tv. Very nice and clean. The bar area was open with a loud waterfall. Guests drink for free during certain hours with their room key. The ladies were happy about this. There were tables set up and it was great to catch up with everyone. They claim they will always stay at this location due to its close proximity to the sites in the city. Bike parking on the street (street sign poles).
