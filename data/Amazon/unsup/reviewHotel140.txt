I'm going to start this review by saying that I really do despise boutique hotels. To think that for almost the same money I could stay at the Westin or Four Seasons and have all the ammenities I desire makes me wonder why I ever stay in boutique places at all. I don't care what anybody says, boutique means old. This boutique experience was a work necessity. They picked the hotel. It actually wasn't that bad. The staff when I got there was friendly. The staff when I left was friendly. I was the staff in the middle I didn't really appreciate. I also didn't appreciate the ancient elevator or the fact that I did end up in a lovely penthouse with a view only to wake up in the morning and realize the shower didn't work. After five calls to the front desk asking for a maintenance person to come up they sent the bellman instead to move my bags to another room. ??????? OK.... Anyway, when he moved me had he had the nerve to ask if I'd pulled the knob out! Of course I did! I'm not a freakin idiot. I do shower regularly. And in my showering career, I've definitely used a few different types of faucet. I've got it covered, I think. The bed at this place was actually really comfortable though and the mini bar was well stocked. This spot is walking distance to the best shopping in Chicago and also some great eats. I really enjoyed the close proximity to the Miracle Mile and Viagra Triangle.  The rooms were clean and well appointed. It was also nice to have the bar downstairs even if they did have last call at 11:30.
