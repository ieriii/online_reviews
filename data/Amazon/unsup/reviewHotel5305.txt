Through a connection, we were able to get all of our wedding guests (over 40 rooms were reserved for our family and friends) to stay at the Silversmith Hotel. IPrior to the stay, due to a lot of personnel changes, I was very skeptical about how our time at the hotel would be. But I shouldn't have been so concerned.The hotel staff were very courteous and did everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and seamless. They even assisted with the limo and charter bus pickups. By the end of the weekend, all of the staff knew my face and name. It was fantastic.
