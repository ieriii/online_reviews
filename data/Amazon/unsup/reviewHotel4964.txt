WON'T BE BACK!Booked this special trip through Priceline and it turned into a very bad joke! When we got to our room we opened the door to what we believed to be a closet, we could barely turn ourselves around in it. Our great view was all of the boilers and air conditioner equipment. Internet connection was barely there "that is if you could even stay connected". I'm wondering where the rooms we see in the pictures for this hotel are because what they try to sell you in the picture is not what you get when you check in. So much for thinking this was going to be a special place to stay. Just my experience people but stay away from room 511.
