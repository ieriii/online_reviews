Don't go this hotel. This hotel is never worth 4 stars.First, room size is super small. It recalled me a $200/month efficiency room of my first univ year.Furthermore, because of its abnormal floor plan, you can see some other rooms' inside at night. I never intended this, but when I looked outside through the window, ooops... I could see other rooms' bed.You may be watched. Don't go there.
