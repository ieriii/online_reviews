We went to this hotel, primarily for it's locale...we were taking our daughter for a special birthday weekend, to the American Girl store (which is just 2 blocks down the street from the hotel) and then to Shedd Aquarium. Unfortunately, we didn't get to the Aquarium...:( In a nutshell, the room next to us was "rented" to a younger couple that used it for party central. In and out, people in and out, laughing, hollering, smoking in the room and in the hall . The smoke crept in, under the ajoining door and was quite strong smelling in our room. The worst of it was the "relations" that the couple were in engaged in. For over an hour, 1am-2:15am or so, we were regaled with the happy couple's "fun". We thought we were granted a reprieve after that...but no...THEN they were hungry and THEN they decided they wanted to make some calls on their respective cell phones...loudly. As other posters have said, the walls must have zippo for insulation, I could hear people opening a soda down the hall for goodness sake. Calls to the front desk and operator to complain went unanswered (did we catch someone on a break? was there a party? were they in the room next to ours, perhaps???). At 4am, with no hope of sleep and a strong thunderstorm overhead, we gave up....packed up and checked out. Only then were able to voice our frustration to someone at the hotel. He expressed sympathy and asked us if we wanted to speak to a manager. We said yes and then after a few minutes, with a manager a no-show, we opted to leave. They compted us our parking, which was helpful, but ya, in the grand scheme of things, it's a drop in the bucket. As the other Yelpers have mentioned, service charge for room service is whacka-doodle and we were to get free Wi-Fi for being "preferred members" which we did not. All in all, not something we'll want to re-visit.
