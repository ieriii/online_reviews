I've stayed in a few W's, they've all been very good but the staff at the Chicago W put them over the top. We just 5 days and all interaction with W staff from the front door, check-in and any staff encountered in halls & elevators was wonderful, any requests we made were answered with "sure, no problem or we'd be happy to" We were upgraded on arrival and our room was spacious, very well appointed and had a super comfy bed & pillows. The location was perfect for the Marathon, and the hotel really catered to the participants with goodie bags of Gatorade & bananas as well as laying out food & coffee for all in the lobby at 5am the morning of the race. I have to mention the Concierge staff and particularly Vanessa, she was instrumental in making our stay in Chicago a wonderful experience, we really can't say enough about how well we were taken care of. The hotel has a great vibe one of the better W Living Rooms and the location allowed us a few block walk to catch the CTA Blueline to and from ORD. A shout out to @WHotelsofChi we will see you again soon.
