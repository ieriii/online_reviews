The hotel room was big and comfortable. The beds were incredibly comfortable. I always fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. Great view of lake Michigan. The service was wonderful and the concierge people were very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also, it was nice knowing that there was always a line of cabs waiting right out front in case you needed to go somewhere in a hurry.  Only downside is there's no free wifi.
