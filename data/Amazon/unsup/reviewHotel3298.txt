FAB metropolitan hotel... LOVE this place !  Gorgeous space, gorgeous rooms, gorgeous people.  The Carbide and Carbon building is my favorite in Chicago & I have a birds-eye view from my office windows...Base Bar is the best modern lounge spot in the city if you are looking for a spot of chic - the whole feel of Hard Rock is comparable to the Opus in Vancouver, which is one of my absolute fave hotels in the world.  Would recommend the Hard Rock to anyone coming to Chicago looking for a memorable stay.
