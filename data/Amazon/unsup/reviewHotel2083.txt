Can you believe we booked this hotel room for $81 on a Saturday night?! I never knew a place like this existed in such a good location. No complaints at all...friendly front desk service, very nice hotel, clean spacious room, good (but pricey) breakfast. This is place is the exact opposite of the Holiday Inn in Peoria (see my review). Can you believe it was cheaper too!!?? They even have a list of all the bars in the area at the concierge. Gotta love Chicago. If you have family or friends coming in, suggest this hotel....you can't beat it - especially for the price!
