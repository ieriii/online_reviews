My best friend and I were celebrating our birthdays recently. Having made reservations at the Palm Court for tea, we went ahead and booked a room so we could leisurely go about our weekend. It ended up being such a great idea! We checked in a little early before our tea service reservation at 3pm, so that enabled us time to freshen up. Not only did we have a giant bathroom, we had TWO giant bathrooms. Quite perfect for two twenty-something girls to get ready for a night on the town.  The decor seems dated, but it is maintained very well. Our room was very clean and, again, the bathrooms were great! It was really quiet at night, which was great because we were tired from a long day of being fabulous.  It wasn't cheap! One night ran us about $300. It was a great splurge, but be sure to check Orbitz/Expedia for better deals.
