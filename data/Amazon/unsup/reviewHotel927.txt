Oh Red Roof... thank you for providing a somewhat cheaper place for me to stay... But other than price, NOTHING about my experience was pleasing. Lured in by the cheaper than normal room rate, the pictures that I saw of the room actually weren't too bad! I reserved the room and noted that *some rooms had refrigerators and microwaves. Upon arrive, NOT the room pictured nor were there any appliances as were listed. Not only that, but the room LOOKED dirty. Even after it had been cleaned. The door to the bathroom wouldn't latch (crooked door frame), and the windows were bolted shut with the air conditioning non-functioning. Add to it the wifi here was slower than dial up, and I was one unhappy person. Lucky for me I didn't spend a ton of time IN the actual room, but seriously... Spend the extra $30 and get a room across the street at the Marriott.
