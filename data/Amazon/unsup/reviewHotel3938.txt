We stayed at the hotel on the following days: August 20 - 22 2009 and August 24 2009. We reserved the rooms on http://priceline.com and pain $129 for lake view rooms on Aug 20 -22 and $99 non-lake view rooms on Aug 24. The lake view rooms had gorgeous view of the Buckingham fountain. Their age does show though, but it's charming. The lobby was gorgeous and the employees were extremely friendly. The first night there, there were very loud hotel guests who came in around 4a.m., however they quietened down immediately after we placed a call to the front desk. The non-lake view rooms has a view of the lobby roof and they were very small with no bath tubs (they had standup showers.) As noted on other reviews, there were picketers outside the front entrance, (very depressing) but didn't really take anything away from our visit. The location was awesome, and the bellhops were extremely knowledgeable. Parking was $28 with unlimited in and out. Overall, I'd say this was a descent hotel for the price we paid for the accomodation. Keep your expectations descent and you'll be pleaseantly surprised.
