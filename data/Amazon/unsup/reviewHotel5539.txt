Be prepared to be jarred awake by the super loud noises of emptying dumpsters at 3-4am every night on the two sides of the building facing the alley. The mattress was below average quality. There are many other much nicer places in or very near the Loop at this price point. The "breakfast" is only served until 9am. There were a few nice attributes but not worth mentioning in light of the extreme noise.
