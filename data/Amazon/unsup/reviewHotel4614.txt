I did not love this place, but it was a fine hotel to stay at for my conference. The location was within walking distance of most places I went and/or a short cab ride. Staff was friendly enough, although I wasn't uber impressed with their restaurant recommendations. And the rooms were a bit of a let down. Small, cramped and not smartly designed. Outlets weren't where you needed them, there was no rack for the hand towels- those sort of features that can make a stay easier or annoying. In addition, we had to switch rooms because the AC unit made very loud rattling noises the first night. It was less of an issue in our second room, although the problem did still exist. In short, it was a decent price (thanks to priceline) and a decent location- otherwise, I wasn't impressed.
