I really enjoyed my stay here. The entire staff was so friendly, and really went out of their way to accommodate my special request. I work nights, had caught an early flight in, and was standing in their lobby by 8am. They gave us an excellent suggestion for breakfast, took our luggage, and called my boyfriend on his cell to let us know they had our room ready (by 10am). It was a relief to say the least. The bed was super comfy, and we have a great view on the 36th floor. I guess it was a city view room, but we could also see the river. The room was super clean and fresh, and I really enjoyed the citrus injected bath products.  The only thing I can fault is how loud the doors are. They really make quite a loud banging noise no matter how gently you close them, and not everyone is concerned about gentle door closing to not interrupt the neighbors. I absolutely would recommend this to anyone traveling to the area, especially given the location right in the middle of the popular destinations.
