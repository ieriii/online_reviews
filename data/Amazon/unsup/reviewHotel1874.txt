The lobby is beautiful. Have you been in there at night (like 3am), when it's almost empty, dark, and the disco balls are lit, so it looks like stars in the sky? It's amazing.  So romantic, and beautiful. The room was so nice, wonderful bed, huge TV, pillows to sink into. I loved it. Free wifi in the lounge, cozy seating areas that make it feel private, free workout gym. I love the gym. Every time we went, there were alway other people there. The machines had TV's and they had headphones for you to use. There was also face wipes, towels, water, and apples. I also love how it is part of NWA/delta's vacation packages and you can use your miles to pay for part of the hotel room. What a great deal!
