A great location for your trip to Chicago. The service was great and the room was impeccable. I was very excited that I was able to coerce room service to make me breakfast despite the fact it was very, very past the official hours of eggs. The bedding was like a magical cloud I never wanted to get out of. The only downside was the computers downstairs that charge by the minute. One froze on me, kept charging me all the while, and once I finally got a manager to come and help me, she was incredibly rude, and tried to claim it was my fault. It was a bad way to end a nice stay.
