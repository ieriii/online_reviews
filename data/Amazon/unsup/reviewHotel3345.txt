I stayed here a few weeks ago on a whim 'cause I wanted to stay downtown and go for a jog in Grant Park in the morning. I was quite impressed with how modern this place was considering the exterior and my previous experience with the Congress Hotel just down the street. The staff was very polite and bent over backwards to make sure I got a view of my favorite city. The lovely concierge even told me I could come back down for another room if the view wasn't to my liking. +1 you lovely concierge! My room was very trendy and up to date with modern fixtures and very clever use of space. Chicago has itty bitty hotel rooms in the older buildings but the Essex does a great job of utilizing what it has and the ceilings are tall enough that I can continue my tradition of jumping on the bed to christen the room. I love the view of the city from my room, the fantastic water pressure, the peace and quiet I get in my room and the awesome feel I get when I walk down the hallway. I feel like I'm in Quentin Tarantino's "Four Rooms" and feel glamorous when I spin around in the halls, the beautiful pool and my room. The best part is that they're close to public transportation if you're not the rental car kind of person, a Jewel-Osco, and a CARIBOU COFFEE! Ah, Chicago...how I've missed you.
