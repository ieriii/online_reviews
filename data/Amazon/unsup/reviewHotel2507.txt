Its a great location away from all the crazy loud gold coast street noises and massive amounts of people. The hotel's architecture is amazing, from the main entrance on Michigan ave to the corridors or the guest floors. The gym is also state of the art with a great outdoor deck. I hosted a birthday party in one their suites and it was a great success. The catering department does a great job, and Eric our catering manager was knowldgeable and extremely accomodating. The event was flawless. I would recommend this hotel in a second.
