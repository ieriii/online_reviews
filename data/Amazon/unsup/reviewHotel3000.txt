It is a W. And I love W's. Chic. Sexy. Stylish. Super hot staff. . Three reasons it wasnt a 5: - the location has a great view, but it is a little bit farther from the real mix of River North. I found myself in cabs more than I usually do in Chicago (though cabs are cheap and easy to get) - House cleaning is slow. If I leave at 830 and come back at 415- I expect my room to be cleaned. It wasnt - twice in 5 days. Not good enough. - I used their house dry cleaning service to clean and press a suit. The prices on the dry cleaning were what you'd expect from an in house luxury hotel service. The issue? I had a small split by one seam of my suit pants. SMALL. Asked if they could repair it (i could have with a needle and thread) and they said yes. They did, for $61! Sixty one dollars? Give me a break. $10 is standard, so $20 would have been standard for a hotel. They also just did it, and didnt tell me how much it would be. I was floored. None the less, I will stay here again. In the summer, the activity and proximity of the lake are unbeatable.
