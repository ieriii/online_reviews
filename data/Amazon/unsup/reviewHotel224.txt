I have been wanting to stay at Hotel Indigo for quite some time now. Last weekend my best friend flew into town from Scottsdale, AZ - Gave me a great excuse to finally check this place out 1st hand. Pros: 1. - LOCATION! - Could walk to Old Town, State/Rush for night life, the beach, even to downtown if you have your comfy shoes. 2. - Decor! - Loved it! - Very unique! They are so proud of their decor, that even have a page in their hotel booklet of things in the room you can take home with you as a souvenir, and how much each item costs. I'll tell you what, that gave us a good laugh!!! 3. Have Aveda Products in the room, that was nice to use instead of typical generic junk. 4. Staff was great! - Very friendly! Cons: 1. Overnight Parking - $36.00 2. Save $40.00 and book online with Expedia/Priceline. I called in the reservation and they added all these taxes and fees that otherwise would not of been there. So I got SCREWED with the bill at checkout. (That $$ otherwise would of paid for the parking.) Would I go there again? Heck yes! - Great for girls weekend!!!! Partied 'Vegas' style!
