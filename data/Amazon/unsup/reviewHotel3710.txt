I visited the Drake for tea time and dinner before the Symphony. The hotel has a lot of history and it was a pleasure to walk around and experience the feeling of the place. There were many things going on that day and the tea room was completely booked.  We were seated quickly a table near the fountain. The Harpist played as tea was served with find sandwiches and pastries. The selection was good better than Russian tea room but not better that the Peninsula.  The tea was strong and after a couple cups I felt the caffeine. I ordered the scallops and the satay. The scallops were absolutely delicious big and moist and the flavor was one of a kind. The satay was better than average very good dipping selection for the tea time and the appetizers. They offer a variety of flavors with every dish. The service was not as great as we expected. Mario was our server first we waited quite some time before we were tended to. It was very busy that Saturday afternoon. We ordered and then 5 min later he comes back and forgot our order and took it again. Every thing was going well until we were ready to order dinner. We requested the dinner menu we discover this to be the tea menu. Then 15 min later we have to call him over and get dinner menus in total took about 25 min to order dinner frustrating since we had to be at symphony hall at a certain time. I still give them 4 stars the Peninsula didn't have much better service the last time I went. Still looking for a top lever tea service
