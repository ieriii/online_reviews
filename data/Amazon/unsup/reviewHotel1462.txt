The Omni Chicago is a great place to stay on business trips. It's centrally located to everything important-- Navy Pier, John Hancock, Millennium Park, etc. The lobby of the hotel is actually on the 3rd floor which is somewhat weird, you also have to take the elevator from the 1st floor and transfer on the 3rd to get to your room (for security i suppose). I would suggest upgrading to a room with a "City View" as the standard rooms all face surrounding buildings and you'll feel like you're in a prison block. The suites also have a couple large TVs (over 40 inches maybe?). Since I'm an unapologetic snob at times, I greatly appreciated the old fashion turn down service (for those of us who are too lazy to pull back our own bed covers and lay out our own robe before bed). The only con would be the Valet Parking which is about $50/day, but that's more of a Chicago problem and not necessarily that of the Omni.
