Lots of bad notes about this hotel: - The door wall and the bathroom walls are very thin. If your neighbor takes a shower, it's going to be deafening in your room. If the cleaning service is in the hallway talking you're going to be able to catch their entire conversation. - On the rear (south) facing rooms, you might be awoken from slumber for 1 HOUR of trash removal. They seem to queue up dumpsters (about 20) in the alley behind the hotel. The trash day seems to be monday. - For a business hotel the Wifi is horrible. Like 20 kbs/s horrible at times (that's dial-up speed). I suspect that this is because of the volume of people this weekend, and i'll let this segway into... - LUKEWARM SHOWERS. I hate capitalize, but this seems outrageous for such a well rated, expensive hotel. - Clogged showers. My shower wouldn't drain properly... they sent a repairman up who promptly removed a large wad of hair from the drain. The service was great, but I feel that this is something that should be tested between occupants. To end on a positive note: The service was excellent, their staff was friendly and well equipped to handle most problems you might encounter while traveling. I had them fedex home some liquids I bought that wouldn't have made it through security.
