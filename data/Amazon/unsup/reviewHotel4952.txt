I'm not sure if employees are putting up reviews on here or what but the Avenue hotel is way out of their depth. First of all, the people who work there are so stuck up and have zero class. I'm a meeting planner for a very large, top rated company in Chicago and I merely called to get some information on service charges the hotel may charge. This helps me decide which hotels I'll consider using or not and since each hotel varies, I thought I'd call. Knowing the Avenue is somewhat newish on the scene, I figured I'd give them a try - what a mistake! My first attempt at getting someone resulted in me getting transferred back to the operator only to have to repeat to him 5x that I needed to speak with someone in Sales and Catering. He didn't understand what I meant, he only understood if I said I wanted either, sales or catering. Uhh, let's use some common sense guy, transfer me to either. I'm a potential paying customer so the last thing you should be doing is arguing with me. Then I got some snarky guy Rene or something on the phone from the Sales office. I simply told him I was planning a meeting and wanted to know his hotels service charges. Rather than be friendly and answering my question he continued to badger me and ask where I was from, why I needed to know and what type of service charge did I need. He spoke to me as if I had no idea what I was asking. When I mentioned that I didn't want to give my company name and deal with RFPs at this time, I really just wanted the service charges, he just was so snotty and rude. I would NEVER use this hotel for business or for pleasure. I mean, I was even extending myself calling them. No one even knows who or what the Avenue is... get over yourself!
