I stayed at the W City Center for a girls weekend. The lobby is fabulous and sexy, but somewhat disorienting because it is soooo dark and then you sign your bill at a glowing desk - it caused a bit of stumbling around (and that was before drinks at WE). The rooms were a bit of a disappointment - incredibly small, with little room for much else besides sleeping. The appointments were standard, good, but nothing above average. The mini bar was really overpriced. The bathroom was of good size with a great shower and the Bliss bath products were the one "extra" of the room and greatly appreciated. We had dinner and drinks at ristorante we and the food was yummy but uninspired. A real after-work crowd on week nights. Overall, I would recommend the W City Center if you aren't planning on spending much time in your room, or if you are by yourself. Hanging out in the lobby and at ristorante we is a must, but that's something you can do without renting a shoebox of a room.
