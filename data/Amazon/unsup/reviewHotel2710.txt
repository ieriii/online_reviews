Loved the clean, modern setting of both the public areas and the private rooms. It's just a beautiful hotel.  *****My knowledge of The James is limited. I don't know much about the packages and quality of service- because I only stuck around for 6 hrs total (2 hrs to iron my dress, paint my face, shave my legs, giggle, bla bla bla + 4 hours of passing out face down on the crisp white sheets.... i bet the housekeeping dept. hate girls like me) while a couple of my girlfriends were staying here.  Peeve: small bathroom. It's a personal thing- I always look for big bathrooms when I book hotels.
