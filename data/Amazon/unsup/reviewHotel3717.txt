Wonderful 3-day stay at the Drake Hotel. It is a Hilton affiliate, so my boyfriend had a discounted rate. It was the most comfortable bed my bf said he slept on, and he plans to get the same mattress for his home. It is an experience to spend nights in a historic place, where Princess Diana, Queen of England, and other Heads of State also stayed. We spent a wonderful Christmas having a 5-course meal that was $100 per person. It seems extravagant, but it was well worth it. It started with a never-ending bread bowl, champagne, fruit, pumpkin bisque, turkey with cranberries and mashed potatoes, multiple servings of all dessert (creme brulee, chocolate dipped strawberries, shortbread cookies). Santa Claus even came by to personally wish each person Happy Holidays. It was a perfect memory. The gym is also free to use during your stay. The concierge was courteous.
