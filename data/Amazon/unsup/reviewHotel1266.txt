after a 4 hour middle of the night drive from St.louis ( not the brightest idea Sarah) anyhow we were in town 8 hours before check in on no sleep however at like 9 am we stopped by the hotel and were allowed early check in at no additional fee now I know this can't always be done for guests but they were able to accomadate us this time I will be back
