I drove a thousand miles across the country to move to Chicago and brought my mom, brother and sister with me (manual labor help, of course). None of them had been here before and I wanted to find a nice place for us to stay that allowed cats. Anyways, I did some research and found this BEAUTIFUL hotel online and I couldnt have been more pleased with the room (except for maybe the view of the parking garage next door, but I didnt even really care about that). It's soooo nice with great location in Lakeview and the staff is so super friendly and helpful. Funny story - my mom and sister were waiting outside for the pizza delivery guy and my mom saw two guys walk by holding hands. Being from the suburbs in Texas, my sweet mother thought it strange. My sister said "did Carri not tell you about this neighborhood?" and when my mom looked blankly at my sister, she told my mom that we were staying in the gay-berhood. Totally thought she was going to have have a heart attack. She really is a nice lady - I should have just given her a warning or something. Back to the hotel - dont let the name fool you. This is like no Best Western you've ever stayed in. It's elegant and classy, yet comfortable. I highly recommend.
