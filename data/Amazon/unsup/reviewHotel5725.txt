The Crowne Plaza was a decent place to stay for the 4 nights that we were in Chicago. It is within walking distance of the Willis Tower and the surrounding area, if you are willing to cross the highway, which we nicknamed the desert. There are two bus stops right across the street from the hotel, the 8 and the 20, both of which are very useful. Behind the hotel is a Walgreen's, as well as Greek Town. The staff at the hotel was always helpful and friendly, of course we only used them to check in, check out, and find the pool. And yes, they have a pool, well, not technically. But they give you passes to get into a pool in a residential tower two blocks away. When we got to the pool, it was an entire health club at our disposal. One more thing about the Crowne Plaza is that they had one of the best shower heads I've come across in a hotel. It was a rain style head with three points of articulation. Oh yeah, free wifi in the guestrooms was a major selling point as well.
