You know, based JUST only on location, this hotel has the potential of being a GREAT 5 star hotel. I mean, you have the river, the famous bridges, Mich Ave right next door, perfect right? Except my husband ALWAYS decides to request rooms on lower floors claiming that, during conferences (frankly, business is mainly the reason we stay at hotels.. he he) the hoardes of people clog up the elevators, and he doesnt' want to get suck riding from the 34 floor to the lobby with intervals of 1 floor each. Understandable, right? WELL... unless you have the loudest bar/dance club downstairs. SERIOUS noise (ahem, music?) coming from downstairs, and at 3am I don't want to hear that. That the rooms in the lower levels are not soundproofed for this is a major deterent. Also, when you REQUEST a king sized room, I don't care to hear that you're out, you're gonna give me a double. Especially when the double rooms are NOT queen sized beds, but rather teeny full sized beds that make me feel that I'm gonna fall out. There are WAAAAAAAAAYYYYY too many conferences at one given time, and NOT ENOUGH places to just grab coffee and donuts. Please people, conference attendees are STARVING, and don't have time for a sit down lunch... And Houlihans (or Bennigans, or whatever the hell is downstairs) ain't gonna cut it! AND THIRD AND LASTLY, Um.. THE TOILETS???? THEY HAVE NO COVER? It's kinda like the toilets in the industrial/mall bathrooms? I mean, I know you're going for the whole modern industrial look, but I DO NOT want to be in constant paranoia thinking that something is going to fall off into the toilet and have to call someone to fish it out.... Aside from this, it's ok.  And quite hilarious coming back from dinner, and seeing the exhorbitantly long line of youngins trying to get into the already full "club"/lobby bar downstairs. Mainly because at their age, I used to do this... ;)
