This was one of the best Hotel experiences we have ever had in Chicago. My husband and I were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary with a weekend in the city. We were very impressed with first class treatment we received. Upon arrival we were asked by valet if we celebrating anything special that weekend. He told the front desk as we checked in. Emil was welcoming and made us feel like we were old friends. The surprises did not stop there. The room was absolutely gorgeous and the view breathtaking! Within minutes our bags were in the room and we were given a complete run down of the amenities. A few minutes later a bottle of Champagne was delivered to room in celebration of anniversary...WOW! Just when I thought it could not get any better Emil called up to the room to make sure that everything was satisfactory. Not only was the service first class but the Hotel is a visual feast. The historic ambiance is perfect for a romantic weekend get away. We will be returning to the The Hotel Burnham and in the future will be looking to stay at a Kimpton Hotel. A+
