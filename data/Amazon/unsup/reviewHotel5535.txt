We stayed at the La Quinta Inn & Suites while attending my daughter's graduation. They charged a fair rate for downtown Chicago. The suite was quite large, very neat and well maintained. They offered a great breakfast buffet. The staff was cordial and helpful to a fault. This is a wonderful hotel and I would definitely stay there again. A real gem.
