Allegro has a great wine reception every evening and the lobby is very cool. I think the rooms are a bit small, and not as nice as I would have expected for the price $$$. Room service food was really tasty but a bit overpriced, and they tack on an addtional $2.00 delivery fee, plus 18% tip. And BEWARE - the hotel is haunted!
