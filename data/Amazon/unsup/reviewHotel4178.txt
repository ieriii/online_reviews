stayed here during my first trip to Chicago, based on friend's recommendation. when you first see this place from the outside, it looks impressive! the largest hotel in Chi, it makes you feel as you were in the airport, when come in. i was told that Chi hotels were known for its luxury, so my bar might have been set a little too hight. our room felt kind of old and dark. but it had a large tv, iHome, and the beds were pretty comfortable. the bathroom was nice :) the food inside the hotel is pricey. but that is expected. the staff were friendly. they agreed to hold our suitcases after we checked out and wanted to see the cite before our flight. one of the valet guys there recommended us a great restaurant not to far away (Emerald Loop) and even gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. we got a good deal on the room, so can't really complain. however I will try a different hotel next time.
