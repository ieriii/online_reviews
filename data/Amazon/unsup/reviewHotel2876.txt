The good: - The location on the river is great for the scenery, especially if you have a river front room, which I happened to draw. - The lobby is very pretty. - The bellmen are great and courteous, as are the concierge attendants. - The hotel accomodated my early check in on a Sunday, excellent. The bad: - The climate was impossible to control - The nearest CTA station is a fairly brisk walk - The maids were terrible - The restaurants are all impossibly closed for hours at a time - The convention space is limited and spread across several floors The ugly: - The exhibit hall floor was dark and the ceiling was too low - Chicago Burger Company is a disgusting restaurant, way over priced and food poisoning inducing.
