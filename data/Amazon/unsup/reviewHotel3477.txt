The Allerton Hotel was the site for our Civil Union in September. We were the destination wedding and they handled the entire event, ceremony, cocktails, dinner and Sunday brunch. Julia Chovanec the catering manager was great, professional, warm, friendly and flexible. She spent quality time guiding us through the whole process. The hotel staff was also great and so helpful. The catering menu was amazing as well as the wedding cake made by Bombon. The Allerton with its Tip Top Tap ballroom was the perfect place host a downtown wedding celebration, we couldn't have been happier.
