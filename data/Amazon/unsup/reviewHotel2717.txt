I stayed here with 2 girlfriends for a girls night out. Centrally located near the miracle mile, it was a perfect weekend to get away from stress, family and kids. The modern decor and square sinks were beautiful to look at. The Kiehl's body products change depending on the season. (We got the dry hair, but they have diff shampoo styles as well). The service was impeccable and they had turn down service with cookies (diff one each night) before going to bed. Amazing. The concierge was knowledgeable, and recommended some great places to go, and eat, and dance the night away. We made reservations to places we wanted to cancel and they did it for us. The door man is always there to help with luggage and get a taxi.. yet they don't stick around waiting for a tip, so you don't feel obligated to dish out for service like opening doors. The restaurant attached to the restaurant was incredibly delicious, and the wine selection was great. I was so stuffed after eating there. The mini-lounge/club was disappointing. I think the lounge in the hotel lobby was more fun. Drinks were expensive, and not that great in the side lounge, but there was no cover, only mandatory coat check. I loved it here and I'd love to return again.
