The lobby and lounges on the first floor are very nice. We did not use the restaurants so I can't comment on them. The pool was out of service during our visit which was an inconvenience. It is very small so my kids probably didn't miss much. We were able to use the Swiss hotel pool instead. It was nice, but the walk across the river in winter is not recommended. Our room was below par. The bathroom was in poor shape and not well maintained. We booked our visit through Priceline which listed the Sheraton as a 4 star hotel. That rating is a stretch.
