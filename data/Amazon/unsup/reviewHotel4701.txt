Once again I have to ask if the more negative reviews are really about this hotel. Or have people confused Hotel Felix with Hotel Fleabag down a little further on Clark? I honestly cannot say anything negative about this hotel, except that the noise from the late night rowdies on Clark Street made it all the way up to my eighth floor room. The hotel has little control over that. The hotel is eco-friendly, so there are all kinds of nice touches (a small recycling container in the bathroom, eco-friendly bath products, and so on). In keeping with this motif, the hotel decor is simple and elegant with muted eath colors throughout--my room was one of the more restful looking rooms I've ever stayed in. Everyone on the staff from the doormen to the desk clerk to the maids was friendly and helpful, and this friendliness seems to influence even the guests: everyone with whom I shared elevators and hallways was pleasant and chatty. Yes, most rooms are smaller than usual, and the closet is very very tiny--so if you're looking for wide open spaces, move to Utah (as the song goes). Otherwise, Hotel Felix is a very pleasant way to enjoy a weekend in the city. And of course Hotel Felix is home to the wonderful restaurant, Elate--but that's another review . . . . . .
