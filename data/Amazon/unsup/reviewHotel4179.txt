I so lucked out by getting this place through Priceline for my cousin and I! It's right on the riverfront and centrally located to so much. I loved the look and feel of the place as soon as I walked in. The hotel just seems so open and lighted. It almost felt like you were outdoors. The front desk was helpful. The rooms were decent size and the beds were INCREDIBLY comfy! I almost thought we weren't going to be able to get up the next morning! :) They also have this one bar called Big which outlooks on the city. The only thing that was disappointing was that I didn't have time to check everything out. I would definitely stay here again!
