Oh yeah. Now THIS is a hotel. I will dream about The James until I have another chance to stay there. My husband and I stayed here when we decided, rather randomly, to hitch a flight out to Chicago that weekend. It was Thursday, we booked to arrive Friday.  When we arrived and through the whole stay, the staff was friendly, courteous, professional, just fantastic. The room was clean and gorgeous. The bed was absolutely the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. The bathroom, so pretty!  There was a turn-down service that came in after we had left the room both evenings, turned down the sheets, emptied trash, filled our ice bucket with ice and put delicious little cookies on the pillows. We called them our "Room Ninjas". The concierge was incredible. He helped us track down the location of a club that didn't seem to be listed in the phone book or online. He made several phone calls and within just a few minutes he had the address and a cab waiting.  I'm not sure if the bar in the lobby is more affiliated with Primehouse (the restaurant on site, FANTASTIC as well) but I had the best mojito I have ever had in my life in the lobby of The James. I will never forget that, as I am a total Mojito nazi. Our ONLY complaint about the stay is that the room was incredibly hot, and we had to call to have a fan brought up when we woke up sweating at 4 am. Otherwise, this was just a perfect stay. We were treated like royalty, which made us tip like royalty.  I would go back in a heartbeat.
