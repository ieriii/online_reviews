The one and only time we've ever visited Chicago, we stayed here. It was on a recommended hotel list by family of friends who were hosting a wedding outside of town. So glad we picked this place from the list! This hotel is definitely more bang for your buck than most of the hotels in the area that I was also researching. To tip the scales even more in the right direction of price, we booked our stay with a "Chi-Town City Escape Package" that the hotel was promoting (now until 9/5/11) and they give... yes give you a $50 gift card + $20 food voucher per day. SCORE!!! Upon check-in, we were handed the gift card. I had to ask about the voucher process a few times, but I finally cleared it up with a staff member in the know and they said the per day food voucher total would be deducted from any food and beverage charges (room service or restaurant dine in) from your final bill. SWEET! * Really friendly staff and speedy check-in. * Our room was really spacious and looked recently remodeled. * Excellent location and views from the higher floors. * They have HBO. * The Keurig coffee maker is a plus! * No pool, but you're a couple blocks away from Mag Mile -- go shop instead! * There was no fridge, but we also didn't think we could ask for one so we didn't. * The AC was a little warmer than we like and there seemed to be no thermostat control, but it sufficed considering it was a muggy 80+ degrees outside the few days we were in town. * Big bathroom, but the tub had seen better days and didn't drain too well. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be in the middle of everything and have close access to public transportation.
