The Chicago River Hotel is an excellent boutique hotel. The location is outstanding, it's across the Chicago river and about a half block off of all the shopping that is the Magnificent Mile. The hotel is also within walking distance to a plethora of great restaurants, and Millennium Park. If you're taking the "L" from O'Hare, the walk from the Clark/Lake station is about 10 minutes while pulling a suitcase in the summer (no clue what it's like in the winter!). The room was clean, well appointed, and nicely maintained, although the TV was pretty small. A really nice touch is that each floor has a gratis self-serve water bottle filling station; the water is chilled and filtered, they provide the bottles, all you have to do is fill 'er up! We booked their smallest room which was more than adequate for our needs since we were always out, and saved us more than enough money to pay for an awesome dinner and drinks. While the hotel may not have as many amenities as other larger properties, it's still a winner based on cleanliness, location, price, and free Wi-Fi. I would not hesitate to stay here again.
