I would agree with Joe H. on his review. I was checked into a room where the bathroom was COVERED in mold. I stayed in the room about 2 nights and had to request a new room, they upgraded me to a different room, which had a partial view. This is also the second time that I have left something at a Westin Hotel and they have "lost" my lost item. This time I had left behind a $150 Eileen Fisher shirt. I called 2 days after I had left, when I saw I left the shirt behind, and the lost and found said they could not find it. They did not take the description of the shirt down, all he wanted to know was what floor I was on, then proceeded to inform me that there were other shirts found but none matching my description. I got VERY frustrated and explained he never TOOK a description of the shirt, so then he asked what it looked like, waited 3 minutes and said "No, no shirts like that were left behind". I called again today (2 months after the fact) and was told all clothing left behind is thrown away. I was NOT impressed with this hotel nor their service. I have always been impressed with Westin, but not this hotel. Take my advice and others...this is NOT worth the money you will be spending.
