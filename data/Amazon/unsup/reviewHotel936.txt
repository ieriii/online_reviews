Is it cheap? Yes. Is it well located? Yes. Are the rooms amazing? Hell No. This is a very budget "motel" nicer than I was expecting, but still miles away from something I'd recommend to my picky friends. I stay here for a number of reasons, the price is awesome.. around 56 bucks a night for a room in downtown Chicago is awesome. The rooms are smaller, but enough for me... I don't come to Chicago to sit in my hotel room, I sleep here and that's about it. I've never had a problem with check in, the staff has also been very nice, no major issues with the room. They are quick to address anything that is wrong, for instance during my last trip the iron had some residue from previous use.. I called and it was fixed within 30 minutes.
