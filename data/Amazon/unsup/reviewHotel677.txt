I'm a big fan of Courtyard properties for providing top-notch service without being as pricey as say a full service Marriott. This one ups the ante thanks to their position just off the Magnificent Mile. Rooms have been recently renovated and they're nice and comfy. Staff very friendly and helpful. And free Wi-Fi!
