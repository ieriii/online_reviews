I recently stayed here while attending a local convention. The room was okay, but I did not like the fact that they charged $14 a day for internet service. Perhaps this is common in Chicago hotels, but it seems like it should be included in the room cost. So if you are a business traveler, keep this in mind. Also, I found the bathroom and room a little small, although comfortable. Overall the lobby was great, and the staff were friendly and helpful. You certainly will enjoy a beautiful view of the City of Chicago from your window.
