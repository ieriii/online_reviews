Attended a wedding here a few weeks back and overall it was pretty decent. We enjoyed the Cityscape Bar quite a bit, it's a nice layout w nearly floor to ceiling windows allowing for some great views, right at the bend in the Chicago river.  The food from the reception was above average, considering it was wedding food where it's rarely memorable. I think it was a NY strip with potatoes and veggies. The steak a bit overcooked (still v flavorful) but again, to expect a 5 star dining experience when the staff is tasked w serving hundreds of people at the same time, is a stretch and unrealistic. In fact, I would recommend this place as an option to those who would consider doing a wedding reception here.
