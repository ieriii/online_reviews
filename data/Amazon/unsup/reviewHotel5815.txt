I used priceline to get a room at this hotel. I was unsure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was beautiful and clean. The staff were extremely friendly, welcoming and helpful. The retail price of $189-229/ night was a little steep, but I used priceline and did not have to pay that much. For what I paid, I was extremely happy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needed to stay in the area.
