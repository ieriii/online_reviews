You cannot go wrong with a W Hotel. It is stylish, fancy, cool, chic, all in one. In addition, it is in a great location in Chicago, overlooking Lake Michigan. The hotel itself counts with a great swimming pool, excellent fitness facilities and a great restaurant in the lobby. While most of front desk's staff is very friendly, there were occasions that I had to deal with arrogant ones, as if we were doing a favor in staying at the hotel. One last reason for not receiving a five-star is that, on some occasions that I had stayed there, the floor of the room would be wet or the internet would be extremely slow that I would just give up using it altogether. All in all, it is a great hotel. With its brand, we would expect nothing but perfection. That is why, a five-star is not granted just yet.
