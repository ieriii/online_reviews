My favorite part of the W on Lake Shore? The telescopes! Outside the elevator banks on each floor is a telescope so that you can peek across at Lake Michigan, the beach, Navy Pier, the afterwork booze cruises that go by around 5:30 PM...such an awesome touch. I also like how the room design is much more "Midwestern chic" than any of the Ws in New York, with the wood paneling and shutters and whatnot. The lobby decor is much quirkier than I would have expected, too (the only Ws I'm really familiar with are the heavy-on-the-charcoal-gray Times Square and Union Square, after all). I checked in right after the Horrible Apocalyptic Tornado Thunderstorms of '07 that had evacuated O'Hare's control tower, brought flights to a standstill, etc. and there was a chance I wouldn't be able to get in to check into my room. So I called the W in advance and asked about the situation, and they were remarkably pleasant and accommodating: "We won't charge you if there are acts of God involved!" Turns out I did get in, albeit around 1 AM, but the front desk team was still equally on top of things. There are only a few characteristically W-esque things that knock this down to four stars instead of five. No free in-room Web access ($15/day) or coffee or whatnot -- I mean, really. if they can give us holographic postcards, can't they at least have free Wi-Fi?
