As a Kimpton hotel, the service is outstanding. The history of the building and its architecture makes it even better. Location is great because its next to a Walgreens (convenient) and barely 2 blocks from the State street train stop (even more convenient). Ask for a room facing north up State street and you get a great view of the city. The Aveda products in the room are a nice touch. Regular rates can be pricey, but join the Kimpton loyalty program or become a fan on Facebook and keep your eyes open for deals.
