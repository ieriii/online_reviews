We stayed here last weekend for the IGI gymnastics girls meet and they catered to us very well. The staff was great - and I mean everyone I encountered or talked to were very attentive and responsive to any needs we had. They not only answered our questions but they also engaged in real conversations like real people. Very impressive. The three star rating is only because I have been to much nicer, bigger and newer hotels. One thing that really did bother us was that the pool smelled very strong of Chlorine. I know they have to keep it at high levels but this burned my nose and throat just walking onto the floor it was on. It was so bad we decided to not let our daughter swim in it. Valet parking was expensive but then again this is Chicago and it was expected. The Valet service is super at this hotel. I ordered a pizza from room service and while it was not the best pizza I have had it was also not the worst.  All in all this is a nice place to stay. Just don't swim.
