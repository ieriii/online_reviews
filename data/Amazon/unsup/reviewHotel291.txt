The hotel was the best part of my trip up to Chicago. I arrived and had requested a smoking room online, but they put me in a nonsmoking room. Went to the desk and quickly fixed the problem. Gave me an incredible suite with kitchen and great view. The breakfasts were great (and free). My girlfriend and I both absolutely loved the location to everything she wanted to see. There was a problem with the parking garage they had just started using, but the hotel manager walked with us down there to not only correct the problem, but to not use them until they worked out the kinks.
