I am pretty shocked this is a Kimpton hotel. It is sort of like a knock off or half brother of a Kimpton. The room seems run down (wall paper separating, drawer knobs wobbly, base boards beat up, broken toilet). Yes, they had the nice Aveda bath products and nice minibar, but the comparison stopped there for sure. Next Chicago trip, I'll go back to the drake for sure.
