I had to bail outta the burbs for some alone time with my wife and daughter and was pleased to find the River Hotel. The location and price can't be beat. We upgraded from the smallest to the medium sized room and was really glad we did for only $20 more. I'm not a fan of bottled water, but each floor has free, refillable bottled water which came in handy in the summer heat. The rooms are still a bit tight, but we were able to sneak in a roll-away bed for my daughter. The beds were comfortable and the view was awesome. The room had a flat screen, nice desk with some local books and a wonderfully designed bath room. Our room was on the 9th floor with a view of the Chicago river, Trump building and the two corn-cobb towers. While peering out of the window I felt like I was living in Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot album cover. The River is right in the heart of Chi-town with fast access to the "L", Millinuem Park, the Art Institute, etc. It has free wi-fi and access to a PC and printer in the lobby. I'll gladly stay there again.
