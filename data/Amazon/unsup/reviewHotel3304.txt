The Hard Rock Hotel is in one of the best spots in Chicago - smack dab in the Magnificent Mile right on Michigan Avenue. Outside - it looks like an obselisk reaching towards the sky but the inside is very chic and the customer service here was great. I visited a friend who stayed here last year and she raved about how awesome it was. From the vallet attendants to the hotel manager, Hard Rock Hotel staff went above and beyond what is expected of a five star hotel for her - she's a baller so she booked a suite in their private tower and what impressed me is that they only have three rooms per floor.
