We stayed here for 5 nights and my overall experience was great! I booked a room with 2 doubles. When we got there, the didn't have any available and gave me a 1-bedroom suite. The bathroom was huge with a separate shower and tub. The rest of the suite was pretty spacious too. There was a sofa pullout and the bed king-sized. Our room was next to the L-train, but it didn't bother any of us during the night. Everyone that worked there was very curteous and helpful. They greeted us when we would leave and greeted us when we returned. The location was pretty convenient. It was 2 blocks away from Milleneum Park and at the end of Michigan Avenue, which is part of the Magnifent Mile. There were plenty of shops and restaurants around the hotel. A great place to stay!
