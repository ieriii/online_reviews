Stayed here for just one night while my wife and I were relocating cross country. Got what I thought was a great deal on http://Hotwire.com($120). It wasn't till morning till I noticed the $48/night parking sign. 2 cars meant over $100 with valet tip...Ouch. I could maybe understand if the hotel were on Mich Ave but its several blocks off the mag mile. That being said, location was good, close to restaurants as well as lakeshore. Room wasn' t anything special. The bathrooms are ridiculous. Sliding piece of shutter for a door and a nice little window that looks out into the room also covered by a wooden shutter. Every sound gets through unless the A/C is on of course. Would stick to the intercontinental or the Hyatt.
