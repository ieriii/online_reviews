Simple, modern and chic. I can't think of a better hotel in Chicago for business or vacay. The gym is excellent and the staff (especially Stephanie Metler in sales) is top notch. I'll definitely be back! The only downsides are the somewhat loud air conditioners in the rooms and a lack of a rooftop pool (like the manhattan James).
