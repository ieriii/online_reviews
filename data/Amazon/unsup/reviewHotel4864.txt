Stayed at the Congress for one night and one night only!!! That place is really haunted... doors open and close and slam shut over and over again on there own... it feels like you are the only one on the floor and there are two parts to the hotel so that does not help at all, and what ever you do do not stay in room 1363 on that 13 floor... so serious that floor is not right! The hotel is haunted and it has earned its place on Chicago's Top 10 Most Haunted Places!
