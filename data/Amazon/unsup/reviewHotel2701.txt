I am only rating this four stars instead of five just because it's older..It's pretty clean though and very nice. The people that work there are very nice and helpful in the lobby. It's right across the street from Trader Joes which is awesome. The downstairs restaurant is super as well. We have had Thanksgiving dinner there twice and really enjoyed it.
