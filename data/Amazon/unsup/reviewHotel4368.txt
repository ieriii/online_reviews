The Palmer House is absolutely amazing. Because I get a specialty discount, I was able to stay there twice for $110 a night for our anniversary. Living in Chicago, it's important to have a place in town where we can go and just have a great experience and feel like we're on vacation. Whenever a family member from CT is coming to visit, I always recommend them to stay here. In fact, my parents are coming in a few weeks and they'll be staying for just $217 a night which is really great for downtown hotel. When you first walk into the Palmer House, the first thing you are greeted with is a beautiful lobby, high ceiling painted like the sistine chapel. This lobby is gorgeous and I don't think I've ever seen one like it anywhere else. There is a bar and restaurant attached and both are very high end. Upstairs, the rooms are spacious and funny enough even smell really good! I don't know, but something about the whole place just feels rich. The bathrooms are all granite and marble and everything is always clean. The pool and hot tub are immaculate and top quality, but get a little busy with families and small children. The hotel is in a great location, I think 0,0 right at the point where the streets become N and S. Anyway, its right near the park and in the busiest shopping area on State St. also not far from Block37 and the Chicago Theater. Not just a great hotel - amazing hotel. Good enough for even Chicago residents to stay at for a night away.
