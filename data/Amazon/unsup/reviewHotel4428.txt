I stayed here two month ago for work. The entrance and lobby was elegant, and the room was nice. It was a bit small in my opinion and the walls wasn't that sound-proof. I remember waking up to someone throwing up on the other side of the walls. I almost wanted to shout "are you ok over there" but figured I should just mind my own business and sleep. 1 star for location, 1 star for price, 1 star for elegance, 1 star for a nice bed and -1 star for waking me up in the middle of the night.
