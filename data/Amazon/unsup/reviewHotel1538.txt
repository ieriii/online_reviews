There are some renovations going on right now, so I'd say the experience could be hit or miss. My recent 5 night stay was a pleasant one overall, but I can definitely see how it can potentially be much better... On the positive side: * great location - walk to the corner, make a left, cross the canal, and you're in the heart of Michigan avenue with upscale shops and restaurants. Also close to the El and walking distance to theaters, etc. * nice view (if you're on the right side of the building) - I had a corner unit so I could see the Marina Towers, the Tribune building, the Trump tower (under construction), and up Wacker Drive along the river. Plus, there was plenty of light so the room felt a little bigger than it was. * good service - got some extra pillows, a loaner umbrella, and a tv fix * surprisingly decent exercise facility and business center - clean, modern equipment with good views. Both were completely empty all 3 nights I used them. * room amenities - comfortable bed, handy chaise, and Bath+Body Works soap/shampoo/lotion (more of a plus for my wife, but I can appreciate the nice touch too) On the negative side: * room was a bit small and cramped * tv was ancient and didn't work properly * doors slam loudly (I woke up several times at night when neighbors were in and out) * elevators don't give you good feelings * towels were not the cleanest (I'm a little picky on this subject, but consistently found towels that had traces of stains or looked really worn - you can always ask for more) So overall, not bad - I got a great deal on my stay - otherwise I might have given it 3 stars. Should be better once the renovations are complete. I'd recommend checking it out after that's done, unless you can get a really good rate.
