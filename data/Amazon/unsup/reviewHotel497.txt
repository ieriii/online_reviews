I really like this place. I went here with 11 of my friends last weekend and we reserved three rooms. These rooms are suites so they are much bigger than regular hotel room! Pluses included that there was a sitting area (plus a pull out bed in case), plenty of sinks (one in the bedroom, one in the sitting room, and one in the bathroom), fridge, good breakfast, and free drinks in the evening. And we also hd a party in one of the rooms after we came back from going out...and it fit everybody. The location is also pretty good.. two blocks from Navy Pier and two blocks from Michigan Avenue. And it's much bigger than the other Embassy Suites in downtown. The biggest thing I didn't like was the check out time was 11 am. Way too early in my opinion. Also, the check in time was 4 pm.. a little too late. But they have a great concierge service to leave your luggage with them.
