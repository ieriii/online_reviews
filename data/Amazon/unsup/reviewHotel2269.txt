We stay in a Marriott over 200 nights a year and this is by far the worst we have been to! We were checked into a dirty as well as awful smelling room. Then we called to get a new room and it took them almost an hour to find us one and kept telling us to wait in a room that smelled so bad I was getting a headache. Then they only activated out keys for one night so we we went all the way up to our room the second day for the key to not work. We took it down and the manager was extremely rude!!!! The only thing he could say was and I quote "I hope it gets better for you." Everyone here is rude but the manager was by far the worst. we would never stay here again and we would never recommend it. The rooms weren't even that great. Next time we are in Chicago we will definitely be staying at the JW Marriott. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star.
