I stayed here for business purposes in June of 2009, and again in April 2010. The hotel is an older one, the rooms are very small (especially the bathrooms - ridiculously tiny). The location is decent, but the rooms really could have used some updating. I was not pleased to notice that there was no mini-fridge in my room. This would have made a difference in my comfort level. Staff seemed pleasant enough.Basically, the place is just OK. Not great.
