The James Hotel was the primary hotel for our out of town guests for our downtown Chicago wedding and the venue for our morning after farewell breakfast. We would have held our wedding reception at the James because we liked the design of venue's event room, but it was not big enough for the amount of guests attending our wedding. The weekend of our wedding was chaotic due to Chicago hitting record high temperature levels and causing havoc on the hotel's air conditioners. While there were moments of stress, significant praise is warranted for the special events director Sinisa and the head concierge Krista - always keeping their cool and ensuring that all of our guests received excellent service (including moving them to rooms with functioning a/c, and if this was not possible comping rooms at comparable hotels in the Magnificent Mile area). The guest rooms are the size you would expect for downtown chicago and the bed and finishings was extremely comfortable (we are in process of purchasing one for our new home). The amenities were amazing and we found the modern bathroom to be near spa quality. We had a suite on our wedding night and it was very spacious and well designed.  The breakfast catering was superb and the service was top-notch. They were kind enough to let us serve leftover items from our dessert buffet at the wedding reception.  Overall, the James proved to not only be a great hotel for a vacation stay, but also held up to the high-stress of a wedding and Chicago summer heat to provide our guests with a great experience. We would definitely recommend the James to anyone looking for a luxurious getaway in the city or a special event.
