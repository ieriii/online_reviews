Everything but the room was great. I didn't like the room because it was very small. I guess it's because this hotel is old so the rooms have not been refreshed in quite sometime. But lobby and the services the hotel provides are great. ----------------- EDIT: Looks like they did some renovations.. rooms are awesome now.. Definitely a good place.. i upgrade my starts on this
