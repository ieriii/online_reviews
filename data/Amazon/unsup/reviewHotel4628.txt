When it comes to choosing a hotel, it often takes some time because I am so damn picky! After reading reviews online, checking the bedbugregistry (I try to check every hotel I stay in...I'm so afraid of getting bed bugs!), and seeing where the hotel is located, I can finally settle. I am SO glad that I decided to stay here! I loved that you could walk just about anywhere from the hotel, and that it was located only several blocks away from Giordano's (YUMMMMM!). Also, this hotel is eco-friendly, which is always a plus! I have a hybrid and was able to park for free (total saving s of $40 for parking) for the weekend.  Awesome hotel, and I would definitely stay here again!
