Dennis and I stayed here in the Summer of 06 during our stay of the GayGames. The hotel is located at a fantastic location right near Merchandise Mart, which is a HUGE building of grand architectural design, as well as most of Chicago. This hotel is over the Chicago SUN newspaper and has SUPER FANTASTIC VIEWS of the city, river, and we got a small glimpse of Lake Michigan as well. The hotel is attached to the Mart as well as small Mall which is convenient. It is centrally located to Michigan Ave for shopping the local MBTA (T, Tube, Metro, etc), and the the river tours. Not really that many gracious amenities here. No room service, no gym, and a boring evening after hours lobby. The View here is worth over a million dollars from every side. I like to face the river or the lake. Just spectacular.
