Just getting back from Chicago! My second time, I love Chicago. Definitely, go on the Architecture Tour at Navy Pier, it's a 5-star!! The moment I saw the river i fell in love with Chicago :) The Tremont, it was mediocre. We got a good deal on the price, so we can't complain. Which may be why our king size bed was out-dated, not the luxury pillow top style. And no screens on the windows, which you had to open. But like I said, it's not to complain. Just simply my opinion, so you are informed, in the event these features mentioned are your deal breakers! The week we were there, was mid 60's, beautiful. The lobby very cozy and nice but.....HOT, wow. The front desk gal, not so friendly or enthusiastic but gets the job done and answers your questions accurately. One elevator, slow and old, sometime we jumped in the service elevator haha. TV not too many channels, ESPN2 didn't have sound, not a big deal for me the boyfriend begs to differ. House cleaning did an excellent job everyday, much appreciated, always nice to come back to a clean and straightened room after a long day. The air conditioning didn't work and the only option was to open unscreened windows. Why? you ask......it's that time of year and they switched over to the heating system. This was the only downer, everything else we could roll with. With that being said.....if the price is right we would stay their again. It's in a excellent location. Ditka's restaurant is in the hotel, John Hancock building a half a block away, Mag Mile half block, everything else is a cheap taxi ride away a $10-$12 taxi ride hear in Seattle only cost $6.
