My boyfriend and I stayed here for Valentine's Day. The front desk staff was warm and very helpful. The room was very nicely decorated - the Rolling Stone magazine and IPod dock were a nice touch. Rock-star references all around the room included Moby, John Lennon, and KISS. I was very confused by the bedsheets. There was a non-fitted sheet tucked into the mattress that didn't even cover the bottom of the mattress. Then the naked bedspread on top - had two sheets covering it. We were confused and a little grossed out by the exposed mattress/bedspread. I can only assume that the person putting this room together ran out of supplies and we were the lucky recipient of the attempt to make the bed look nice. The bar/lounge downstairs has a great ambiance and we enjoyed the live accoustic performance. Besides the bed thing...great place!
