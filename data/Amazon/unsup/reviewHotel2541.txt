This place is a bit odd. They are one of those clubs where Friday night is Latino night, Saturday is african american night, and then they tend to switch it up every other week or something?  Last night my friend forwarded me the 'get in free' text from the promoters. They wouldn't let me in free because it wasn't from the promoter himself. Weird because word-of-mouth marketing is the best way to go. I couldn't believe the money-takers at the front door that night. I paid $10 to get in there and then I had to put up a fight to go outside for a quick smoke. He said "if i let you out, then I have to let everyone out". I think there should be some kind of law that allows you to go outside for fresh air (or not so fresh air lol). Thought America was a free country but who knows. I think they missed the whole stamp-on-wrist idea that most clubs do to know who's been in and who hasn't. I then had to beg them again to let me out so I could change my shoes. My feet were literally bleeding from my shoes. They wouldn't. So I took my shoes off and started walking through the club barefoot. That got their attention and they let me go out and come back in. WOW! It's odd because every other time I had been there they let people outside. I knew it was because of the dudes at the front taking money. Who the hell hired them? When it's a popular night they overcrowd the place. It gets ferociously hot in there. One time they sent out a burst of cold air through the club. It was the best 20 seconds of the night. Just a tease though because it went right back to being hot. Ill go back because Im forgiving :) But I don't like being disrespected by the front door staff. They are kind of rude to the customers. Sometimes I think people forget that the customers pay for them to have that job. We are the reasons they are there. I don't want them to roll their eyes at me for simple requests.
