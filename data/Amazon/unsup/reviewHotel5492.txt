Very modern, posh, roomy king rooms. Stylish decor. Simple elegance. I was on a higher floor per my request (the 19th floor), and the bed faced a wall that was a complete floor to ceiling..wall to wall window! So cool!! The bathroom was spacious, clean & inviting with a deep full length bathtub and a stand alone glass shower. The modern vanity area was stocked with complimentary toiletries & a sitting chair for primping and grooming yourself in front of the mirrored walls from all corners! The room had a well stocked mini-bar, complimentary, shoe shine service, and wi-fi Internet for a fee.... of which I used none.  The only issue that kept me from giving a perfect 5 star rating was the bathtub needed to be rinsed lightly cleaned before I would get into it. And I saw a hair that did not belong to me or my husband. This let me know housekeeping did not have a great cleaning day that day, (I am very particular hotel room bathroom & bedding areas) but OVERALL the room was clean & neat. ADDITIONAL INFO: My stay was prompted by the purchase of a recent Groupon deal. I treated my husband to a night out to dinner and an overnight stay. It was a very nice room for the Groupon price of $159 (normally a weekend room of that grade goes for twice as much..) My deal included half-off valet parking ($22.50) and a Continental breakfast at the hotel's Whiskey Bar Restaurant
