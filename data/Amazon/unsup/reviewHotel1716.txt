We stayed here 3 nights on our first trip to Chicago, not really knowing the neighborhoods or preferred locales. To our surprise the hotel is in a great location, walking distance to a lot of restaurants. If you need to go further out, a $5 cab ride will get you there. Encore Liquid Lounge was a perfect spot for us to unwind that first night, as well as a good starting point every night thereafter. This is a renovated hotel, so you need to come with proper expectations. You can tell this is a very old building, with rooms that are very small compared to newer hotels. But that's the way it was back then and I've experienced the same in similar hotels in other cities. Given all that, they've done an excellent job on the renovation. The rooms are clean and up-to-date. The bathrooms are beautiful. The lobby is done really well and makes a great place for the nightly wine-hour. The standout for us was the staff. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, everyone was incredibly considerate and polite. We always ask everyone besides the concierge on what to do and where to go. Julio gave us great recommendations and presented genuine thoughtfulness. Definitely seek this gentleman out. We would and have recommended this hotel to others with proper expectations in mind. For the price, this is a great value. *I've seen other reviews with complaints about the thin walls and noisy hallways. Luckily for us, we didn't experience any of that. I know we had neighbors on both sides, but other than a door closing, didn't hear a peep.
