I had Hotel Felix on my radar for a while since it was the first LEED Silver certified hotel in Chicago... or something like that. At first I was a little taken aback with regard to the size and configuration of the rooms, but then I remembered it was just remodeled not built new so it's not really set up for some of what I'd call more 'modern-sized americans.' My issues with the room through were three-fold. First, the air filter hadn't been changed in a while, so it was dirty and would bang back down onto the ceiling after the unit shut off. Easily fixed. Second, the apparent lack of storage. Yes there was a tiny closet, but where do I put all of the other crap I had with me for a week long stay? Then I discovered the dresser drawer hidden below the bed (I had a king room). Neato! Third, and this was the one issue I couldn't correct, the lighting. Argh. It was so 'energy-efficient' that it was nonexistent in certain parts of the room... like on the desk! Not cool when you're here for a work trip. And yeah there are LED task lights on the desktop but it didn't improve the situation any... so I ended up doing most of my work on the bed itself - though not without banging my knees on the wood sideboard a couple of times. I didn't spend a bunch of time in the room, but who wants to do that anyway when you're in another city? Other than those qualms, I really liked Felix, and the price we got through Priceline ($99/night, I think) made it much more manageable. I really enjoyed the location, within easy walking distance from some awesome restaurants, public transit, and whole foods, and just a generally relaxed vibe with nice staff. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll definitely stay here again.
