I stayed here with my wife and her wedding bands were stolen by the housekeeper! Management handled it terribly. They gave us nothing in return except the phone number of their insurance company which gave us the run around and no compensation. Beware, the staff a this hotel will literally rob you blind, while management looks the other way.
