So, I really wanted to love this place and my initial impression was fantastic. The lobby is beautiful & luxurious and I couldn't wait to check-in and relax in our room. And here's where it all went downhill. The front desk clerk was a little on the snippy side. We were given our keys and sent on our way only to find that she had given us a room with ONE double bed which is not what we had reserved. You would think the front desk clerk would have thought something was amiss when she checked us in. My husband was standing right there and at 6'6 would barely fit in that bed by himself, let alone the both of us. I immediately called down only to be placed on hold for an eternity so the manager could be consulted. The manager never even bothered to speak to us to apologize and had the clerk handle it. I had to tell them that I had the printed documentation/receipts that proved we were guaranteed more than that. At this point, the only room available was a handicapped room with 2 double beds. At least one of us wouldn't have to sleep on the floor. By the way, the first room we were given was quite shabby and on par with a "Days Inn" level. The wallpaper was peeling. The furniture looked old & worn. The second room looked like it was more recently updated but still lacked the oomph that nice hotels should have. It was a failed attempt at replicating the look of Kimpton Hotel properties. The TV was extremely dated. No wifi!!!!!! In this day & age???? And, of course, they charge for it. And they charge for the use of the gym!!!!!! Seriously? How can you give your customer subpar accommodations & claim to be a luxury hotel? The only reason they get 2 stars is because of the lobby, friendly bellmen and location.
