I am sitting here with sweat dripping off me onto my glasses blurring my view of the screen in the sweltering lobby of the un-air-conditioned Chicago O'Hare Garden Hotel, perhaps the worst hotel I've ever been to and I used to stay at some GHETT-O places during high school for spring break in Panama City Beach, FL in the "redneck riviera" Back to the matter at hand. The walls in the halls are all scratched up and dirty, half the light sconces are broken and the carpets are dirty and beat up.  Not an impressive property, but it sure is cheap. I was also welcome to some big splotchy stains on my sheets, a toilet paper holder that was barely hanging on for life, and all but one of the lamps weren't even plugged in so I had to plug everything in. Well, I guess this place will make me appreciate every other place I stay at that much more :)
