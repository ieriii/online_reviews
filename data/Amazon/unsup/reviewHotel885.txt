Yeah, this place rocked. It's a small boutique-style place right near the theater district. I walked around happily with this as my home base. There's a great comic store nearby, theaters, all types of shops, and many restaurants. Inside, my room was nice, and they did a great job with my dry cleaning - surprising, actually. Better than my home dry cleaner. One pet peeve of mine is hotels who say they have free wireless access but fail to have enough bandwidth to support the customers. My first day there, I watched a lot of content via their in-house wireless, but the second day I got blocked out constantly. Don't know whether it's their network or the source, but I suspect it was theirs. Still, I will overlook that and still give them a 5, because not having service got me off my butt and outside into the sunshine, which isn't all bad, is it?
