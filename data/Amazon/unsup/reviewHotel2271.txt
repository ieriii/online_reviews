If I would have typed a review for the Marriott a year ago I might have given it 5 stars, but this last trip wasn't all that great. I spent thanksgiving here, and it was just a ok. I was a little turned off being able to hear other guests peeing in their bathroom, the concierge loung was closed for 2 days which REALLY bummed me out, we usually hang out there in the evenings, and play games....but nope not this time, I love the location, but standards weren't up to par. Why is there no free WI-FI???? only downstairs ?? Not cool Over all the stay was so so, I'd like a little better stay for the money we spent to sleep here.
