I found this place through yelp and I am so thankful. This place is really sweet and nice. I was in Chicago recently for a conference on green building. There weren't a lot of hotels in the immediate vicinity of the conference center and we were booking our hotel much too late to get the normal hotel spots. Initially, we were looking at some other places. I yelped these places and saw that they were often no good. Some had mold issues or poor service or whatever. Not this place. It feels like an old apartment complex, slightly worn but cozy at the same time. The service is great. Things aren't luxurious by any means but you cannot beat the location and the price.
