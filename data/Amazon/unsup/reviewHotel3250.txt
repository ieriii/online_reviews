Most of my stars go to the services. I was running late to a meeting and the doorman took my bag and hand my claim ticket quickly. Clerks and room care takers A+. I must say 1. some of the rooms need paint jobs. 2.Ask for a Tub if you want one. 3. Ask or wait for a higher floor level. Nice view 17 or higher.
