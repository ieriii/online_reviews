Hotel Lobby Bar Project Review #8 - Martini Bar Drinking at the Knickerbocker lobby bar is like drinking in the company board room. It's not at all unpleasant but you feel like you're in that awkward little place between old-fashioned charm and new-fanged snazz. In other words, just kinda dumpy. My cohort astutely pointed out that the complimentary bar snack was the exact same cheesy pretzel mix that that have at our local VFW Hall. Plus or minus? You decide! The bartender may have been the best part of the bar. When we enquired as to what the large room was up on the mezzanine level he replied (in the friendliest way possible) that we were just looking it a series of mirrors meant to make the room look larger. Nice trompe 'l'oeil, Knickerbocker. He was friendly, chatty and seemed slightly crestfallen when we asked for the check after only one round. Sorry Martini Bar, we have Chicago Fizzes to drink and toasted almonds to eat up the road. I think Knickerbocker might need to turn in for the evening. It's ok though, Diagnosis Murder is on followed by the evening news. Cheer up!
