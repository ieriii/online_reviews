A very good hotel from a service and comfort perspective. Even for Chicago, they took you for a ride on the parking ($55 per night) and I will never understand "internet charges". Really, I a mean come on .. after all the fees and inflated parking the hotel decides to stick one last knife in you and charge you for the internet service. Just skip it and go to McDonalds.. ride the wi-fi for free. Other than that, the room was extremely nice and comfortable and would clearly stay here again.
