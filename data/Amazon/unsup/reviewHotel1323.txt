We went to the little bar upstairs here for a drink and the bartenders were very nice to us- coming over and giving us a ton of free nuts and olive appetizers to go down with our drinks. Sure the drinks are expensive, but for the Ritz they are actually pretty reasonable. I think a beer is like $6. The building is very cool, it's older but nice. We were able to sit on a cozy little couch and enjoy our drinks.
