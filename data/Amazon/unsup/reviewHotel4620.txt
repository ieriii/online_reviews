Great little boutique hotel in the middle of River North! Got a great deal for the hotel at http://priceline.com -- the only drawback was that the room was near the elevators. Good thing I sleep like a rock and it doesn't bother me, but that might be something to think about if you're a light sleeper. The rooms were really cute, it was a little compact, but overall everything you needed was there. The amenities were great, everything they use is H2O, I actually didn't mind using their stuff. Usually, I have to pack my own bottles of everything but this time the hotel amenities were exactly what I wanted. However, all of that is trivial compared to the two things I use to rate a hotel - mattress and shower. The mattress was the most comfortable bed I have slept on in a hotel, you just kind of sink in and enjoy the TV. The shower was nice, nothing about it that stood out, but it was good. The service was good, and its right next to portillo's and orange. What's there not to love? I would totally stay here again, especially for that awesome priceline price!
