Wow, what a view we were treated to! I chose the parking package and upgraded to a lake view room, which was well worth it! Aside from the M.C. Escher like parking lot, everything else was superb. Our room was on the southeast corner of the 19th floor it had a gorgeous view of the lake and south down Michigan Ave. The room had a 42" LG flat-screen, king size bed, and plenty of space. It also came equipped with a touch-screen computer that acted as a guide to area restaurants, attractions, and hotel service which made getting information easy and convenient. We ordered room service that evening, and as always, the service was impeccable. One little thing that stands out, and it's such a small one, but Hilton Hotels chose Peter Thomas Roth skin care products for the bathrooms and if you haven't had the opportunity to try any of them out, then do so! I cannot say enough how clean and fresh the products make your skin feel. I know, I know, this was supposed to be a hotel review, but hey!
