Great hotel, great service. We got here early and valet checked our bags, which were delivered to our room when we checked in later with no problems. My husband had arranged for a bottle of Prosecco, which was waiting when we arrived. The bill was from a wine shop more than a few blocks away, so I was impressed with the effort they made to get what he wanted. We had tried to book a massage at the hotel spa, but they were booked, so the concierge also booked us at a nearby spa at a discounted price. A+ service. The room decor was great - we had a cozy king, which doesn't have the floor to cieling window, so it was a little dark, but that was fine with us. Having a balcony was really a plus. The shower is amazing, and the beds were comfortable. The room was small, but the space was well-used. I was really dissappointed with the restaurant and the vertigo lounge upstairs (which I reviewed separately), but I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone wanting to stay near the Magnificent Mile.
