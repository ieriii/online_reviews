Stayed here Valentines Night and was very pleased. The rooms are very modern and hip--as is the whole Hotel. We thought the size was just right for a nights stay, or even for a weekend. We loved having the iHome and the huge TV. The bathroom is a bit small, but you aren't sleeping in there, are ya? One of the best accommodations about this hotel was the complimentary breakfast--it is one of a kind. It is not the typical doughnuts and coffee table. It is a little bar area that a woman controls. Each person gets a juice, coffee or tea, a piece of fruit, and some kind of bakery good. Each item was fresh and delicious. And we loved the spunky seating area.
