My wife and I stayed at the Lake Shore Ramada only because our friends had their wedding reception at the nearby University of Chicago. Yes, it was a place to lay down after a night of drinking and dancing, but not much sleeping was done...no, not because of THAT....get your mind our of the gutter. Issue #1 - I found out king size bed to be very uncomfortable. Issue #2 - Either every single guest in the Ramada was speaking through a bull horn, or the walls were paper thin. Either way, starting somewhere between dawn and when I finally fell asleep, I was able to hear conversations, other people showering, dressers opening and closing, and everything else people do in hotel rooms. No not THAT. Issue #3 - Though this is beyond the control of the hotel staff, I must also mention that there was a bird right outside our window who, the very second the sun shone it's face over Lake Michigan, took it upon itself to inform all other living creatures that it was morning at the top of it's tiny, little lungs. Other unpleasantries: -Understaffed front desk. It took a good twenty minutes to check in. -Hookers in the lobby. Not call girls. Not ladies of the evening. Straight up white trash, track marked hookers. The good things: -Relatively in expensive for a Chicago hotel. -"Free" parking. -Right on the Lake. We were fortunate enough to view a regatta race going on in the distance as we checked in. Overall, I don't plan on staying there again unless under similar circumstances in which a night at the Lake Shore Ramada beats possibly killing children because of drunk driving. This place is not horrible, but not favorable.
