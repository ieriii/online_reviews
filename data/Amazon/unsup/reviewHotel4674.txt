I stayed here over a year ago and I should have known better. I read reviews from it but didn't heed any warnings. They were complaining about the carpet being wet. So when I was going through the reviews before booking this hotel I figured, there is no way they would have this same problem, since the review I read was written a year prior to me checking into this dump. Sure enough when I check in, they still couldn't fix this problem. That was complaint #1. Complaint #2, their bed fills up the whole room. I rate this place pricey because no matter what kind of bargain you may find online, it's not worth the trouble.
