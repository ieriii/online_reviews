We had our October wedding at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza. We can't rave enough about our experience with this hotel. Everything was fantastic and our guests really enjoyed the reception. The event planner, Barbara was fantastic and so helpful. Every meeting with her was so pleasant and she really made sure that everything ran smoothly. The Holiday Inn was such a wonderful decision for us. We checked out more than 10 locations but this place was just perfect for us. The hotel is in a great location, and we took great evening pictures outside the hotel. We had a great experience with the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza.
