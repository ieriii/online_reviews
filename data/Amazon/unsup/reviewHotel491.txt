I had my wedding here last month and couldn't have been happier. My contact, Brooke, was a doll. She was always there to answer questions and made sure everything was the way it was supposed to be on my bid day. We booked about 25 rooms for the weekend and everyone seemed pleased. The remodel of the rooms is gorgeous. They are very nice. You really can't beat the free breakfast. Since they don't collect the coupons we joked that we were going to go there every weekend for breakfast.  I deducted one star because we got a free room the night of the wedding. They made it seem like this was some fancy suite and it wasn't much different than the regular rooms and they made a huge deal about getting us into it. Which I still don't understand.
