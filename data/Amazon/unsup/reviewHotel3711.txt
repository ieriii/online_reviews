Took my sister to afternoon tea for her birthday. I made reservations over the phone which was easier than doing it online because online (via phone) I kept getting an error message. The reservation was from 1pm. The reservation deskperson had told me not to be more than 10 minutes late as they don't hold reservations past that time. Each seating is 1 hr and 30 minutes so we were there until 2:30. The Palm Court is in the lobby area and the hotel is beautifully decorated for Xmas. Also, if you have the dough to spend, the Chanel store is attached to the hotel. There is a very tall, well decorated tree when you go up the stairs to the Palm Court area from the lobby. It is definitely worth a kodak moment. The hostess was very polite and seated us immediately. There was only one waiter and at least 7 tables of people seated for tea. With the afteroon tea, they serve 4 types of sandwiches, egg salad, cucumber tomato, asparagus/ham and roast beef. My sister didn't want the beef so we got extra egg salad sandwiches. They were all very good but I would have loved a choice of breads for the sandwiches. Also the tea came with our choice of tea, we each got a teapot. I had the dulce and she had the pear caramel. They allow you to try other teas and so we also tried the chocolate peppermint. My favorite was pear caramel. Also, the tea came with 4 small pastries, raisin scones and banana bread. The scones were soft and still warm. Overall, the service was decent and they constantly filled our teapots with water.The ambious is great but for $33 a person plus tip, it may be more worth it to come for a cocktail.
