I am a stick in the mud. Stick in the muds and the W hotel just don't match. It was a nice room, but I hate everything being a la carte. The sink showcased the bold look of Kohler, but was so tiny I could barely wash my face without splashing water on my feet. The elevators had this bizarre 3D sticker thing going on with a black light shining to make things super trippy. I imagine it must be freaky when you're drunk. Speaking of drunks, this seems to be the place for a lot of clubbers to go out and then come back and spend the night. We were woken up by a group of drunk guys at 3AM who decided the hallway outside our door was the perfect place to hold a conversation.  An extra star goes to security coming up right away when I called to complain. At least they don't expect other guests to reason with drunk people.
