I stayed here for a week while on business. The location is great and the hotel is very clean and accomodating while you are there. There was one incident while I was there, where I came back to my room and saw that the pringles from the mini bar selection had been eaten and the cap put back on. I called down to report the problem and was told that a note would be put on my account. After I checked out and returned home, I reviewed my receipt that was sent via email. 2 cans of $6 pringles were on there that I never ate. I've attempted to call the hotel 3 times, only to be directed to a voicemail that either no one checks or to someone who is too lazy to return calls. I would still stay here again, but I would review my receipt while I'm still in the hotel.
