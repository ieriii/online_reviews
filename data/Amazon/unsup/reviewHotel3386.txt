We hosted our wedding (ceremony and reception) at the Allerton Hotel in August, 2012. We were beyond satisfied with the level of service and hospitality offered. At all stages of the wedding (tour, food tasting, planning, and wedding day), the hotel treated us as though we were the top priority. The event space (Tip Top Tap Room) is absolutely gorgeous with amazing views of the lake and Michigan Avenue. We received complements from everyone at how classy the event space was. The food was excellent: We opted for late night stations which were a big hit. Much of the success is undoubtedly attributable to the extreme hard work, professionalism, and responsiveness of the hotel designated even planners (Beau Buttacavoli and Katie Hultin). They are clearly experts at what they do and understand the importance of quality and customer service in the hospitality industry
