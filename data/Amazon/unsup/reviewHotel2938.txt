Wow, for $250 a night (conference rate, thank you) I would expect so much more. This place is old. Period. And it feels it's age around every corner outside of the lobby. My first room had a lovely view of the gravel convention center roof and within the first 15 minutes of my being there a maintenance worker walked by my window and looked in. I'm out of there. My next room had a gorgeous view of the Chicago River and Trump Tower from the 26th floor. Unfortunately it had a bathroom light that never turned on despite calling maintenance 3 times to fix it. It also featured a bare metal "spoke" where the knob for the heat/air should have been and cracked plastic surrounding that. Nice touch. To top it off, the "wifi" was $12.95 per 24-hour period and in my 72 hours there I was charged 6 times. Not to mention that the wifi didn't work anywhere in the 2 floors of conference areas or in the lobby so basically the only place wifi was available was in my room. Thanks. Perhaps I should also mention that I paided $27 for a breakfast (not room service) in the hotel restaurant that consisted of orange juice (no refill) and eggs benedict. Yes, I know this is downtown Chicago but please...
