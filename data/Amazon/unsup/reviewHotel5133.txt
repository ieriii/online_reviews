We had our wedding ceremony and reception at the Wolf Point ballroom on March 19, 2011. The wedding coordinator Barbara Martin is a true profeesional. I don't think she could have been any better. The view is AMAZING and the venue affordable for downtown Chicago. You will not regret your decision to book your wedding at the holiday inn mart plaza. They even through in free parking for the bride and groom parents, free hotel suites, and free bruch the next day...and the wedding cake is including and that was great too. All in all I can't say enough good things about the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. Our guests couldn't beleive how nice it was
