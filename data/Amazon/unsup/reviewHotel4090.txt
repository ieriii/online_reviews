Every time I spotted a hotel employee, they were always smiling. It's clear that they enjoy making their guests happy. Check-in was easy and quick. It seems as though they don't treat their Priceline customers different than any of their other customers (which is a good thing!) Being on the North end of the loop, the location was great. It was steps away from Michigan Avenue, and a couple of blocks away from State Street. The view from the room was grand, facing the Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower. The bed was very comfortable. There was actually a bathtub in the bathroom, which comes in handy after a long day of walking around. The lobby was both busy and beautiful. There was a great selection of food inside the hotel. It's reminiscent of a Vegas hotel (sans casino). I will definitely stay here again when I visit Chicago. At their price range, Hyantt Regency definitely goes above and beyond of what's expected from them.
