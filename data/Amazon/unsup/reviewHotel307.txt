City Suites is simply awesome. Quaint, friendly, safe and with a delicious and fully stocked continental breakfast, this is one of the most conveniently located and accommodating hotels I've ever stayed in. There are a lot of restaurants and cafes around the area so you're set to eat/buy anything you might need. The front desk people were usually all friendly (especially the guy who works the graveyard shift. We loved him!) The shuttle drivers who were taking us back and forth from De Paul were also so friendly. The rooms are great and the beds come with lots of pillows (not sure why that's so fun to me but it is). The hotel has Wi-Fi (score! though it can be slow sometimes) and fortunately we were on the opposite side of the train station so didn't hear the opening and closing of the doors every five minutes. They have nice cushy bathrobes and nice smelling lotions and shampoos--good quality ones that you wish were a take home size! The only annoyance was that eventually at night the room overheated to feel like a sauna. And because the windows couldn't open I had to turn on the A/C to balance out the Mojave Desert. There's only four floors to the hotel (and only three people to the elevator) so if you want to have a more personalized experience City Suites will suit all your needs. The downstairs common area is so nice and they've got a fire going most of the time. So sweet. And there's always coffee and tea out and sometimes a basket of cookies. I don't think I've ever had a hotel feel so much like a cozy home.
