WOW OH WOW OH WOW! Boy do I love the W hotel chain in general, and this hotel did not disappoint. The hotel has a beautiful modern feel and the rooms are decorated to the nines. This place is just beautiful, and is especially wonderful for the young, or for those that want to be young. If you are in your 70s or older, you might understand the whole idea of "mood lighting" that is featured in this hotel (as my father did not think this hotel was anywhere near fantastic).  The rooms are actually bigger than I expected. The way they were architecturally built allow for the most room possible which is nice to see in a big city like Chicago.  If you are staying at this hotel make sure to ask about the free Acura car service that will drop you off 24 hours a day for free within a 5 mile radius of the area.
