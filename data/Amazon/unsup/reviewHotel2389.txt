I was a guest at the Rainbow Push Coalition Women's Luncheon yesterday. The purpose of the luncheon, the panelists and the guests made it a superb event. However the food was less remarkable. The starter was a warm cream soup which no one could identify but did look like there were shaved pieces of mushrooms but the broth was non-descript - so agreed my tablemates. The entree was a chicken breast salad - breast atop a piece of arugula filled with cous cous, a slice of carrot and zucchini and cubed parsnip with a vinaigrette which I poured over a few greens.  I am allergic to chicken which was fine since the breast was scorched beyond recognition - which my table mate pointed out to me since I was not eating it - I reassurred her it was no big deal due to my allergy. The rolls were quite generic. The saving grace of the meal was the raspberry sorbet and I am guessing the flavor here - cherry ice scoops with a few frozen blue berries. Absolutely delicious! Frozen solid but once melted enough well worth the wait. The banquet staff served the food and cleared in a timely mannor in a robotic fashion - no smiles, no indication I could ask for anything else I might like - like decaf coffee. But all in all it was about the essence of the luncheon and not the food - thank goodness. So if you are thinking of a banquet at the Hilton and Towers I would say that if price point is an issue, this could be your place but be careful to do a tasting and try to keep it simple.
