I think the Palmer House was once a nice hotel. The main level is gorgeous and the hotel is capable of having top-notch formal events. As a place to stay however, I found it lacking. The place just looks extremely tired. The decor is straight out of the 80's and I think the appointments haven't been updated since. The hotel also does not offer free Wi-Fi, which for the price (this hotel is no bargain), is not acceptable.
