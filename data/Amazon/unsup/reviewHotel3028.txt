Nice enough hotel, but not in the W's first string. The revolving rooftop is a great place to crash a wedding, but dress for the part. I was physically thrown out by a couple of large men - with a chicken wing in my mouth and two mini-burgers in hand. As I was flying out the door, a third little guy shouted, "Go back to suburbia!" Good times.
