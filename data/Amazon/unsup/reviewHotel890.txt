The Hotel Burnham lets you step back into a bit of 19th century old world charm while still providing some of the more modern conveniences. The restoration job Kimpton has done on Daniel Burnham's 1895 predecessor to today's skyscraper is truly wonderful. I was much happier staying at this little boutique hotel this past week on my business trip than one of the other big name neighbors. Its ideally located to all that the Loop offers. If given a choice - I'll be back here again when staying in Chicago. From the moment you walk into the dark wood reception area with its quaint little sitting area, you are greeted by smiling faces eager to make your stay a success. Like most other Kimpton properties they offer an evening wine reception and have a generous pet policy. It pays to be a member of their Kimpton In Touch program (free) as you get free internet access, $10 mini-bar credit and free continental breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. A couple of tips for this particular location: - You will get an actual key to your room. At first I loved concept this antiquated concept, hearkening back to a simpler time. But after a week of the key jingling in my pocket and trying not to lose the darn thing - I think I'd rather leave this part of history behind and have the added security of modern key cards. - There aren't hairdryers in the rooms (at least in mine) but they will bring one up to you. - Rooms are a little small. Try to get at least a queen or king room - at 5.4 my footsies were hanging off the double bed unless I scrunched all the way up on my pillows. Issue solved by sleeping diagonally - but the larger bed would have been nice. - Request an upper floor room. I was the 5th floor overlooking Washington and State, but I could still hear quite a bit of noise from the street and "L". Didn't keep me from sleeping well though.
