I spent three months traveling on business and staying at this hotel. They treated me like family and the service was absolutely amazing. It was right aruound the corner from my office but had several different options of hotels to stay at. This was as good as it gets! Throughout my stay, I intereacted was two concierge attendents who on a regular basis did everything to make my stay comfortable - Vanessa L and Laurelin did everything from finding me restaurants, delivery, to even interviewing personal trainers to train me in the hotel gym. That was only the begininning, they called and followed up with me on a regular basis on how they could help make my extended stay comfortable. Even a bottle of wine sent to my room, when I had a bad day. They offered me runs to the store when I was sick or had any other needs. It doens't get better than this. Jeff, Tree and Israel were amazing with taking care of my luggage and other needs. I regularly left my luggage at the hotel when I would leave town on the weekends. To come back and have it back in my room, thanks to this team.  Deborah, was very helpful and kept my room clean on a regular basis. Justin, the hotel manager, set me up wit a suite for a weekend stay when friends were visiting, including a parlor room. This was an amazing experience and while I may be going back for business travel for work, this is the only hotel I will stay at in Chicago. Not to mention, it's super swanky and everything seems brand spanking new...
