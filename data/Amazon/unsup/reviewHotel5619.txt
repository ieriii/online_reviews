I had a business trip here this week and it was a nice hotel to stay at, and I would say what you expect from Westin - heavenly beds, big rooms, good amenities. This location even has massages in-room that you can take advantage of. I really liked the fitness center. It had TVs on all the equipment and a good variety of equipment. There is someone working there too to help you with machines and exercises. I also love that I didn't get charged to use the fitness center (it was supposed to be $10/day).  The location is great, right next to the river, walking distance to a lot including Michigan Avenue shops. It's right across the street from the House of Blues.  I would stay here again. I would say this isn't the nicest of the Westin hotels (Westin Philadelphia for example was much nicer IMO) but it's a good place to stay in CHI-Town!
