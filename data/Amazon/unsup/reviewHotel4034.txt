I stayed here a few months ago for a conference for work. The location right on the Riverwalk is great, and it's an easy walk to many of the downtown area restaurants and shopping. It is about a mile to the Navy Pier on foot, which is a lovely walk if the weather is cooperating. The hotel itself is insanely huge with a labyrinth of conference rooms, spanning two buildings and a network of stairs and underground tunnels. The outside is kind of ugly, and looks like an industrial building out of the late 70s/early 80s, but at least the rooms themselves were really nicely decorated and comfortable. The bathrooms, too, were generously sized with great lighting. The extras were also good quality--yes, I am very picky about the soaps and shampoos that are in the room. Not only that, but they also supplied a travel sized toothpaste. A nice touch for travelers who may have forgotten one of the essentials. There is a coffee counter with snacks (serving Starbucks) in the lobby which was nice to have. Regular hotel coffee does not cut it in my opinion. ;)
