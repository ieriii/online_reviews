It's in the middle of nowhere and the in house restaurants Shor and Forno close at like 5 PM and serve barely edible, over priced food like the $15 personal pizza that's not quite as good as a pizza hut pizza but double the price. On top of that it took nearly and hour and another 15 minutes to run my credit card. Over priced everything including the room because it's a convention center hotel. The room itself was average at best, definitely not worth the price. The staff aren't great either. The front desk staff are rude. The restaurant staff are inept. If you're visiting Chicago and your company isn't putting you up here, don't stay here. You can do a lot better for your money closer to downtown for you'll pay here and you'll get better quality and much better service. The only upside - Toothpaste. Yep, toothpaste. They give you a small personal sized toothpaste in your room so you don't have to ask for it or buy it if you forgot your own.
