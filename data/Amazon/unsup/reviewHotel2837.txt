Absolutely the worst hotel experience I've ever had around the world. They screwed up our reservation by breaking our 4-day stay into a 1-day + 3 day, locking us out. We were traveling with an infant so we specially called ahead to make sure there would be a crib set-up, which we re-confirmed when we checked in, but they didn't get that taken care of until after midnight. We ordered room service but that never showed up. I will most likely never stay at a Sheraton again in the future.
