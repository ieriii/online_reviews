I really wanted to like / love this hotel BUT! It reminds me of one of those places that are trying to hard to be something that they will never be. We went here for brunch. The food was luke warm and not too tasty. The guy that they had fixing the omeletts didn't understand English (what part of the plan was that ? ) the server came only 1 time to bring us drinks and of course due to mothers day brunch, the Tip Added to her ticket was a whopping 20% gratuity when we didn't see her. For almost $200 for 4.. one 12 yrs of age..I think I will do as I always do, spend a little more and head to the Ritz Carlton or the Drake hotel..
