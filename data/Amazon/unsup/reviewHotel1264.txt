Good clean hotel. The only downside was their wireless didn't work BUT they did provide us with an Ethernet cable in less than 5 minutes even though they didn't have one at the front desk. We were able to connect but even with the cable the Internet was slooooooooow. The location is great as you are 3 minutes from The Metra and buses go by every 3-4 minutes right outside the door.  They have a local restaurant on their bottom floor, it is nothing spectacular but it saves you if you get back to your room late or if the weather forces you to stay inside.
