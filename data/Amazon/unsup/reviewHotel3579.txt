Old style Chicago at its finest. Not a detail left unpolished or a pillow unfluffed. Small rooms with every need thought of. Its a warm and cozy decorated hotel if you like smoking rooms in country clubs. There isnt smoking at the Drake but it has that "I bet Al Capone stayed here" vibe. Id say 4 star but no turn down service. Great location, not far from Rush street martini bars and shopping. Highly recommend. My ex even had the dragon from the drake tattoed on his bicep. Its that cool of a dragon carved into the outside front stone entrance to the hotel.
