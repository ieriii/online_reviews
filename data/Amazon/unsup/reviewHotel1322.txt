From the moment we arrived, the reception staff at the Ritz were eager to please (and it didn't seem to matter I scored a discount deal on the room through expedia!). We were upgraded to a deluxe room for free, and within minutes of checking in, we scored a reservation at RL thanks to the very welcoming staff at reception. The concierge enlightened us on Chicago's must-see attractions and nighttime hotspots; she made us a dinner reservation at Mercadito and even arranged for a complimentary appetizer for our party, which was a welcome surprise as we were seated at our table later that night. Our room was sparkling on arrival and the housekeeping staff made sure to keep it that way throughout our stay. Overall great experience.
