The decor is unique. It's out there - definitely clashing wallpapers , furniture, and colors, but it works. As for the rooms..they're tiny. And the bathrooms are tinier. The sink in the bathroom is awkward because it doesn't have a lot of depth...so washing your face means splashing water on your legs too. Some of us actually opted to wash our faces/brush our teeths in the bathtub because it was less messy. A really important note: THE WALLS ARE SUPER THIN. You can hear everything. Let the staff know - they'll probably comp your room for you.
