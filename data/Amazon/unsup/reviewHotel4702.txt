I cannot stress how great the service is at Hotel Felix. I spent a girls weekend here for my friend's bachelorette party, and the staff was helpful, friendly and very accomodating. The staff greet you with a smile everytime. Everything we asked them (extend check out, time, chill champagne bottles, hold our bags, bring more towels, etc) they did without hesitation. The lobby is very relaxing. I loved the atmosphere right when you walk in the door. The rooms are a bit tight, but they are very nice and clean. The beds are very comfortable! The location is great as well.
