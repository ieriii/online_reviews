We have stayed at the Essex Inn twice in the last two years. We stayed there in July 2008, and August 2007. We thought it a very pleasnat, well-run hotel. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The Concierge was a fount of knowledge, got me booked on a couple of trips - The Untouchables Tour which is a must when you visit Chicago.The rooms are clean, and quite spacious. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed both stays at the Essex Inn.
