Close to convention center and driving distance to Chinatown. Decent, but overpriced food. Pros - comfortable and within walking distance to the convention center. Comfortable rooms. Nice work out gym/pool area. Equipped with TVs, water, headphones, towels and fitness magazines. Cons - No free internet access. Check in/ check out kiosk does not work. Often little to no ink to print out boarding passes at the kiosk. Business center is a disappointment.
