This place has a total racket going for students taking their medical licensing exams in Chicago. They are even listed on the test site website. Well for 80 bucks a night, I could've bought two rooms at a motel, and I would've got a better shower. It started with a very strange shuttle ride. Even though there were at least 2 vans in the lot with official logos, the van that came to get me had a makeshift sign that said "Garden Inn" instead of "Garden Hotel". I had my suspicions when I walked down the hallways with green and gold peeling wallpaper. The water pressure was terrible and every 2 minutes it would get really hot and scald me. When someone in another room turned on their shower, it squealed at a horrible frequency in my room. There is a reasonably priced restaurant, but the food is subpar. I tried it twice. The first time I had pasta carbonara with a sauce so runny it should've been called soup. I tried again, this time with a salad so drenched in vinaigrette that I couldn't eat more than a few bites...so I filled up on bread, and it least it was yummy! There is no place like home.
