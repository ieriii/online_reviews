This review is intended for the hotel lobby.. yes, the hotel lobby. Who knew I'd ever be writing a review dedicated to a lobby? I haven't stayed in the rooms and I understand its cramped and shows its age... Came to the Palmer House for a prix fixe Christmas dinner at the restaurant attached to the hotel but was in awe of the history and grandness of the lobby. Pictures don't do justice. I'll be back next time to try the lobby bar.
