Hotel was okay. No pool, rooms are very small and not especially clean or well decorated. No refrigerators in the room, and only one guest per room can get a cup of coffee because they only leave one pod. I paid $125 via Priceline, willing to stay again but only for $100 or less. Don't bother asking anyone at the hotel about parking or public transportation, they actually gave us bad information regarding bus routes and stonewalled us about parking. Parking near the hotel is available at 111 E Wacker for $35/24 hours with no in/out. You can access the hotel via the concourse level (Bronze), so no need to go outside.
