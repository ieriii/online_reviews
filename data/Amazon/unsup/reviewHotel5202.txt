Booked this hotel through the hotel website for $265/night with a AAA discount. Stayed two nights in September. Pros: Location on Mag Mile. Complimentary breakfast beverages and wireless access for Omni loyalty program members. Big selection of complementary morning drinks. Gigantic beverage serving sizes (see picture). Large, clean suite. Quick check-in. Nice exercise equipment. Helpful concierge (Hi, Marcus.). Ample bathroom space. Free headphones offered to gym-goers. Complimentary Sunday New York Times. Friendly doormen. Pretty cloud painting on domed ceiling of main elevator. Received star treatment from restaurant recommended by concierge. Cons: Room dcor was a little dated. Couldn't get a room on a higher floor. Bland view (but at least I wasn't staring at a wall). Not sure if hotel has many double bed rooms (whenever I search for rooms at this hotel, I never see double bed rooms, which deters me from booking a room here). Only two chairs in living room area and no couch. Faint, constant whirring noise in room (not sure if noise was due to elevators or air conditioning). Have to take two elevators to get to room. Long wait for elevators at times.
