Whenever we stay in Chicago we stay at the Chicago Hilton - what a grand old majestic hotel. Across from Grant Park. My family of 4 squeezes into a single room with double beds - BUT that type of room has 2 enormous bathrooms with marble. Rooms are clean and since it's an old hotel with thick walls - quiet. Like the other reviewers stated - staff is friendly and very good, but prices for amenities and restaurants are outrageous. But that's a great excuse to get out and shop and restaurant hop in Chicago.
