PROS: 1)The rooms were clean. 2) when we asked for extra shampoos they were delivered right away. 3) The building is in an awesome location. 4) You could leave your bags in the hotel after you checked out and get them at the end of the day. CONS: 1) Check in/ Check out line is huuuge. 2) Lobby is not the best. Overall, definitely recommended to friends!
