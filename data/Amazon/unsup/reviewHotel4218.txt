My accomodation arrangements become nonexistent while i was waiting for my luggage at the airport. (a friend completely flaked on me). I called home and my husband booked a room through Travelocity at the Hyatt. I showed up, probably looking a little stressed, dishelved, beaten and the front desk guy was really pleasant and upgraded my room to the Club level - you need your room card to get to these floors. I felt special, instantly. And things just got better. The service at the restaurant was great. There was loud noises coming from the next door room, - marching music and a phone ringing, seemed liked they were timed to go off every 5 minutes, so i called the front desk and someone took care of it by the time i went to sleep. Everywhere i went, to ask questions, to buy a snack, room service, everyone was superb! And my room was super comfortable as well. Thanks for ending my horrific day on such a positive note. It is interesting that my room was on the 33rd floor as well!
