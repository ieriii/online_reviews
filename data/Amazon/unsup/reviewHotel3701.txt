Old school elegance! My boyfriend and I treated ourselves to a night at The Drake for 4th of July. From the moment we stepped in, we were in love with this place. Very old school elegant. The hallways are large and the whole place is very, very clean. Our room was quite large, and the king bed was super comfy! We ordered room service in the morning - the breakfast was delicious! I also love knowing that Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth and so many other cool people have stayed here. Love the history! There was a book in our room detailing the history of the hotel. Very interesting. I would recommend this hotel to anyone - great atmosphere, clean, beautiful, historic and perfect location to Michigan Ave and all of downtown Chicago.
