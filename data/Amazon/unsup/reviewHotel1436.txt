This was our first stay at an Omni. We booked this as part of a land air package via Travelocity. Located on the Magnificent Mile, it was a very nice stay. We got a king one bedroom suite on the 20th floor. Other folks in our group were on the 22nd and 25th (highest) floor respectively. We had a view of the Trump from our window. Our bed was turned down every night. Fresh linens replaced twice a day. You can request a courtesy refrigerator separate from the mini bar.  USA Today delivered daily. You enter from the street up to the hotel lobby on the third floor. Then take another elevator to your room. There's a food cart with Starbucks coffee and breakfast items for sale.  You can print your boarding pass at no charge in the business center. Wi-Fi is available at $9.95 a day or free if you're a loyalty member. Sign up for free to join the club. I passed. Hubby worked out at the fitness center.  We also requested late checkout. They gave us until 1:30 pm. I'd stay here again.
