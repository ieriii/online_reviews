I am no hotel aficionado, but I had the opportunity to stay in this particular hotel for my first visit to the Windy City.  The location is awesome. Central to plenty of great restaurants, you are walking distance from shopping, and really anything else you may want or need. I even walked to the shore of the lake, it was beautiful. There is a full bar in the lobby, which seemed cool to me at the time, but I never got a great vibe from it. However, the bartender there was very kind and remembered me from the night before. Very tip-able staff. My room was beautiful, and very clean. Plenty of amenities. Kind of a small bathroom and nothing spectacular, but it got the job done. Downsides... No free wi-fi = stupid! The positive to this was that it forced me to learn how to connect via bluetooth through my cell phone... nerd central.  Like other posts have said the valets were a touch on the inattentive side, but they were all right.  One thing that really annoyed me was that most cabbies had no clue where this Marriott was located! There is another Marriott within walking distance so I think it is rather confusing... but really. That isn't the hotel's fault, but it is something worth mentioning. The ball room was great for the awards ceremony I attended, and again the staff was very accommodating. Worth a shot if you want to stay on the mile, and definitely a great place if you are on a business trip.
