I love this hotel! I'm here for business and found a great deal on their webpage. It's really nice, without being too fancy. My room is pretty big and free wi-fi is nice. The lobby has a really fun vibe and the staff are all really nice, and really helpful - even over the phone; is so refreshing. For the price, this place is way more fun and easy going then some of the other business hotels in the same price range. I feel like I'm on vacation, I'm so happy I stumbled upon the PUBLIC Chicago.
