This hotel has a great location to the magnificent mile and Navy Pier! My wife and I have stayed here 3 times now, for a night out on the town. I have had a bad experience my first time, but the hotel manager gave us a free night as consolation. She was extremely helpful!  I would say that you should try the pomegranate cosmo in the bar downstars adjacent to the lobby, they are our favorite! We can't wait to go back this fall, what a great hotel!!
