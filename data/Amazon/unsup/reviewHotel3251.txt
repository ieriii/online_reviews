The decor in the hotel is great--dark, modern, and sophisticated. The lobby and rooms are well-appointed, with super comfy beds topped with down blankets (a must as far as I'm concerned) and feather pillows. The rooms are reasonable, though amenities in the minibar are overpriced--common in hotels. The service is generally good. I had a few issues with the bar staff, but other than that, I enjoyed my stay. Frankly, though the W City Center feels more rock and roll than the Hard Rock.
