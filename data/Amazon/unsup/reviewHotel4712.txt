This place is not for everyone. But it has a great location ands helpful owners and staff. It is not the most brand new place around. You do have to share a bathroom in some of the rooms. But the free on street parking, the $10 voucher to Trader Todds, the decent price and the willingness to help by the staff make up for it. I've stayed here 3 times and try and stay here when I'm in Chicago
