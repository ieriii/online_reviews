We have had an AWFUL experience at this hotel. Before booking, we were told that the Allerton Hotel lists itself as a "business" hotel with strong wi fi capabilities. This was extremely important to us when booking as we run a company that relies on the ability to upload time sensitive large files while traveling. Upon first arrival, when we realized that the advertised wi fi speed was far below the ACTUAL wi fi speed, we spoke with a manager who gave us the run around, finally transferring us to the internet service provider outside of the hotel. After hours of waiting (and losing precious time), we had gotten nowhere and had to resort to looking into other options with no help from the hotel. Finally, we ran tests via http://testmy.net and were surprised to find that the connection was running 98% LOWER than the average internet connection speed. The hotel staff was clueless, the internet provider couldn't reset the server because their system was FROZEN, and our business trip was RUINED. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU NEED TO USE THE INTERNET. ALSO, there was a PILE of dust in the corner of the room near the television - clearly the staff thinks what you don't see at first glance does not need to be cleaned. We tried to plug in the lamp (which did not work) and saw that the floor in that corner was white with dust. Gross.Totally not a 4 star hotel as advertised on Hotwire and the rooms were smaller than any place we've stayed even in NYC or Rome. And parking is $50 a night. Way overpriced.The ONLY thing it has going for it is location. Location is amazing. But PLEASE don't stay here if you need to conduct any sort of real business! Or if you have a traveling companion (rooms only big enough for one person).
