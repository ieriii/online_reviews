Check into the Allegro for a change from your typical big-name hotel. It isn't a bad spot for a romantic getaway, and since it's possible to hear your neighbors (and vice-versa) hilarity can ensue depending on how mischievous you are. Right in Chicago's theater district, you're conveniently near a Metro stop connecting to many lines, including tourist stops and O'Hare International. The location isn't ideal for breakfast as there are too many chain eateries nearby, and the non-chains aren't open early enough. The lobby and lounge is attractive (dig the eclectic wallpaper), and their happy hour special provides free wine - yes, gratis - to guests from 5 to 6 PM, giving one a chance to mingle, or simply unwind solo. (Besides happy hour vino, we scoured small, pricey bottles of Belvedere from our minibar.) After realizing our dinner plans were a bit unrealistic, a concierge stationed in the lobby (Mark) helpfully found us another place, secured a reservation, and provided us with handy directions. Loved our room's decent view, modern decor, and amenities, like dreamy soft beds, an iPod charger/alarm clock (perfect for having an impromptu party like we did), and a huge flat screen TV - the bathroom's glam, marble counter topped with Aveda products was a nice touch too. (Didn't think the room was tiny, but I don't spend quality time in my hotel room.)
