What a relief...I came upon this sight and started reading the reviews the day before we were set to check in. I started to think I made a big mistake. Well, I am pleased to say that not only did I NOT make a mistake, I couldn't have been HAPPIER with my decision. My daughter and I had a small suite with a king bed. Yes, these rooms are a bit smaller but really people...this is an old hotel! The room was neat and clean and due to the fact that we were staying a week I was able to request a small fridge to keep snacks and drinks. The front desk staff was polite and on point, check in was a snap and requests were fulfilled promptly. I decided to try room service for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised...the food was great and well worth the price for the quantity. The last two nights of our stay my husband showed up to surprise my daughter and we were even able to get a roll-away bed for her. We didn't even notice that is was there since it fit right into the sitting area of our suite. Each time we went out and needed travel assistance the guys downstairs were more then willing to give directions, recommendations and then ensure that we had a cab right away. A BIG thank you goes to each and everyone of you who made my daughters stay ( I say that because all of her friends were at a different hotel for the National Honor Choir) in Chicago everything she could have wished for and more. She loved telling everyone that she was staying at the Allerton and that they should have too!
