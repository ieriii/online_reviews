We got in really late but there was still someone there to check us in. He put us at a room next to the elevator which was not the greatest so i'm giving it a 4 star. And the shower head was contemporary and all but it was an overhead shower. I felt like i was forced to shower and wash my hair. It was like an overhead waterfall. I wish there was a bathtub it being the king view room. We had a great view, grand comfy bed, and even bath and body soaps, lotions, shampoo and conditioner! There was also free wifi , and a nice flat screen on the wall. I am surprised it's a 3 star hotel, it really should be higher!
