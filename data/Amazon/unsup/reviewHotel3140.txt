It's been a while since I've been to the W Lakeshore, but I needed another night of hotel in Chicago and didn't have any desire to give the Westin River North another night of business, so I booked another night at the W Lakeshore. I arrived rather early and was told that my room was not ready yet, but they would call me my room was ready. Did I mention I was upgraded to one of their Fantastic Suites with a Lake View! SPG Platinum status rocks! I was out when I received a call back from the Welcome Desk (front desk) that my suite was ready. The suite on the 22nd floor overlooked Lake Michigan and Lakeshore Drive. I entered our suite to a large living room and desk. There was a 42" flat screen television, sirius satellite radio, dvd player, and CD changer. The bedroom was to the left and the master bathroom was off to the side of the bedroom. The bathroom had Bliss bath products. The nice thing about this bathroom was that it had both a shower and a tub. Let me just say the shower was divine.  The bed is also wonderful too. I swear whenever I'm staying at the W it's so so difficult to get out of their plush signature bed. Another nice thing going on at the W's is the Acura experience. So what the heck is the Acura experience. To sum it up W Hotels and Acura have teamed up to offer hotel guests rides in new Acura's within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. Great option especially when it's time to catch the "L" back to O'Hare. The service runs from 11:45 AM to 9:00 PM at the W Lakeshore.
