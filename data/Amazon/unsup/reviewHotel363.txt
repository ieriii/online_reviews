Never Again! This hotel needs a serious makeover. It is dingy and gross looking. The rooms have old beds, gross looking carpet, and just look old. The only good part about this hotel, was the guy at the front who gave us tips on where to eat. I would only stay here again if this was the absolute last place in the city to sleep!
