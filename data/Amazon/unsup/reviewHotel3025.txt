Location is probably the only thing key about the W Chicago. I didn't have a BAD experience, but it was none the less that great either. I was a little peeved knowing I would be charged $14.95 a day for internet service in my room, for how much it cost to stay here, you'd think it would be complimentary. The bathrooms are another story, I really would like to meet the designer and pick his/her brain over the concept! They are ridiculous and not "edgy" or "modern" or whatever term you want to call it. W Chicago isn't our normal hotel we stay at while on business in Chicago, but we will definitely not be booking here again.
