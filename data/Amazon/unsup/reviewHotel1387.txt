I was attending a conference at the Drake and was a bit disappointed to learn that I had been moved over to the Knickerbocker. My coworkers were all staying at the Drake and I was pretty sure the Knickerbocker would be a step down. Especially when I walked into the lobby. I wasn't expecting much, as it is far more understated than the beautiful Drake lobby.  Boy was I in for a surprise. I soon learned that I had been booked into a suite. When I stepped into the room, I fell in love. It had just been remodeled with beautiful furnishings and...drum roll please...the most amazing bathroom. Brand new, a rain shower, European fixtures and a whirlpool bath. I'm usually not a bath person. At all. But this wasn't one of those scary tubs with the old, gross jets, it was a new bath with the vents in the bottom and an electronic control panel with several different settings. It was awesome. I want one for my house. So anyways, if you get the opportunity to stay at the Knickerbocker, jump on it. I believe they have remodeled many of their rooms, just make sure you get one of them and you will be a happy traveler.
