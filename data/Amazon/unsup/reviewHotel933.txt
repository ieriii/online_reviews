Pros - So super cheap. Amazing location. Friendly staff. Comfortable pillows. Cons - It smells. Legit, like a strong bleach smell that makes you think people have died recently in the room. It is also dingy and claustrophobic. If you are spending no time in your room, it's perfect. If you like downtime in your hotel room, you might want to keep looking.
