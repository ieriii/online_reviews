I saw a LOT of great reviews for this place, so instead of staying at the Westin, where I always stay, I decided to give the Amalfi a shot. And as my Two Stars state, "Meh. I've experienced better. The 'great selection' of jazz disks, consisted of one beat-up easy listening CD. And the books in the room to read were "Night Shift" by Steven King and another title that was obviously forgettable. Nothing like staying contemporary. The room was whatever. No big deal. The continental breakfast was good only because it was 10 feet away from my room near the elevator, but it was lackluster. Although I will say for a place that's crankin' out a lot of coffee, theirs was actually pretty good. Another let down was the free happy hour with cocktails and food (which appeared to be cold cuts) in the 'lounge' -- which in reality was a windowless room with one TV, and a kitchen area cut into the wall. Not much vibe. But the best was that I actually ran out of HOT WATER. In a hotel. I repeat, my hotel room shower, ran...out...of...hot...water. Overall, it was clean, the people were nice and it was close to my clients' office, but it was definitely a let down. Sorry Amalfi.
