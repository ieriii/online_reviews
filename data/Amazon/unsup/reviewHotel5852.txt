The only great thing is location. Rest of the hotel is very forgettable, lacks any character. Decor is stuck in the 90s. Their customer service is extremely poor. After our stay, we checked out and left the hotel for 1 hour. We then realized my husband left his wedding ring on bedside table, so returned immediately to get it. The room had just been cleaned, and I went in and the ring was gone. The person who cleaned it said it wasn't there, but I know exactly where it was, and it was there. So it was stolen. The hotel launched an "investigation" where they determined that they were not at fault, and send me a letter letting me know that they would be doing nothing. So we stayed in a mediocre hotel, and lost a wedding ring. All in all, not a way to treat your customers. If you stay here, hide your valuables.
