don't be fooled by the age of the lobby, front desk, and elevators, because those are misrepresentations of the rooms! rooms are newly renovated with modern decor. nice flat screen plasma in every room. the rooms are not big, but not small and claustrophobia inducing.  restroom came with rain shower, hand held shower, as well as every hotel's must: hairdryer. well-lit and clean!  friendly staff and great service. i would highly recommend the millennium knickerbocker for anyone looking for a reasonable priced place to stay :)
