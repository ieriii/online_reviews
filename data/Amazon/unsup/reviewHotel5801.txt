I can't see how anyone would have anything good to say about the place. I almost stayed here before I moved from Dallas but chose to sleep in my rental car by the lake instead. The rooms were disgusting! The carpet was laid unevenly, the bed felt like a piece of plywood, there were roaches galore despite the powdered insecticide everywhere, the bathroom was a complete mess, and every floor had a distinct and awful smell. I think you are better off sleeping in a park.
