3 1/2 is more fitting. A fine hotel in a good neighborhood. Safe to walk back to if you've had a long night and close enough to the L. Lots of good restaurants in walking distance. Everyone is bitching about the room size but honestly, compared to a lot of other more expensive Chicago hotels, i.e. the Palmer House, the Intercontinental, etc. the rooms were really not that small. The rooms were also modernly decorated, and the bed is very comfy. You can control the thermostat (in some eco hotels this is an issue). The bathroom is big and the shower(water pressure, SPA toiletries, set up) is good too. One of the things I hate about some upscale/boutique hotels is there is always an absence of drink/ice machines. Maybe they feel the machines are too Motel 6y, but when all you're offering is a $6 hot bottle of water I appreciate a $3 Gatorade from a machine. AND, this is just an assumption, but I think there is a drink/ice machine on every floor. NEGATIVES - A shit view. Just a dumpy looking roof and bricks. Elate's breakfast menu on their website is completely different then what they actually have. It is the same old omelet, $8 side of bacon that most hotels have, thats why you should just hike two blocks to either Eggsperience if its late or Yolk any other time before 3pm. But the staff was great and okayed a late check out and its close to Michigan Ave. if you're into that sort of thing. And if you're not, cabs are easily acquired.
