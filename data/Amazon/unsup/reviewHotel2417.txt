My fiancee and I stayed here for a conference that she was attending in the building. I was expecting a certain level of service that goes with the Hilton name. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. Our non-smoking room that we booked over a month in advance was not available so we got stuck in a stinky smoking room. However, we were told that someone would be in within 2 hours to provide an ionizing service to get rid of the smell. Three and a half hours later, no one showed up and we were ready to go to sleep. In addition to this, I was shocked that we were charged for Internet. We had stayed at a Comfort Inn earlier in the year and we got free Internet. Here we were at the friggin' Hilton and we had to pay $4 an hour to use the Internet or $0.69 a MINUTE to use the system downstairs? Ugh. You've got to be kidding me. To make matters worse, our smoking room was to be changed to a non-smoking room the next day. After making arrangements with the concierge, I was told that someone would be up within 15 minutes to bring me the keys to our new room. An hour goes by and no one shows up. I finally storm down to the desk to find out what happened and get it straightened out. The rooms weren't even that great. They were pretty average and still had old CRT TVs. Like I said, I expected a certain level of service from the Hilton and it just did not deliver. If I'm paying this much for a room, I expect it to be worth it. This was not. Needless to say, we'll never stay in a Hilton hotel again.
