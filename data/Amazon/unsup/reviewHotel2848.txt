Room: Nice. View: Very nice Bed: Excellent! Towels: few and thin Location: great Internet: $14/day (unacceptable!) Seems to be a convention oriented hotel which isn't optimum for vacationers (lobbies packed with business people etc.). Short comings could be overlooked if there weren't several really nice alternatives nearby. No free Internet is horrible in this day and age.
