Marriott is my favorite regular hotel for business trips, and I stayed here often before relocating to Chicago. The best feature of this Marriott is its location, in the heart of the Magnificent Mile and so close to great restaurants and shopping. The free Navy Pier shuttle is across the street on Grand and Rush, and the Westfield Mall anchored by Nordstrom is a stone's throw away. I will say the concierge lounge in this location (2nd floor) offers so-so food compared to most other Marriotts. I love the exercise and weight room behind the pool area (treadmills are in a separate room right beside the elevator bank); equipment is state of the art and I have never found it crowded. The quality of the rooms is on par with most Marriotts; this location is a little older and shows its age in that regard, but furniture and cleanliness are good. Wifi is free in the lobby but not in the rooms (unless you're a gold or platinum member).
