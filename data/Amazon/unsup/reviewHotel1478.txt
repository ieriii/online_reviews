I would say the suites are 'cozy', but definitely suit the needs of a business traveler. The beds are comfy, the bathroom is nice. They even give you bath salts. There is a plasma tv in the 'living room'. Most importantly the room has wireless internet access and you don't have to pay extra for it. There's a gym too. Everyone there is so nice. AND you're right there in middle of all the shopping.
