When I booked this hotel on the http://united.com site, they said that this was a 3 star hotel. Yeah right! The room they gave us smell like old people, had a tv from the 70s, holes in the ceiling, paint flaking off, and carpet that I wouldn't walk barefoot on! I requested my money back and had to stay one night. They upgraded me to another room that at least had a modern tv. Don't stay here!!!!!
