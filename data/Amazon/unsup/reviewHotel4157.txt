Let's see ... 1) I was unable to use the Internet, even after I paid the ridiculous $14 fee. I called to report this twice, and each time I was on hold for over 5 minutes. When I did speak to someone (off-location), it took about 15-20 minutes of my time (x2 phone calls) to 'troubleshoot' - which still did nothing. I was told I'd be called back when service was back up. Nothing. 2) The black wiry hairs on the bathroom floor were a BIT easier to stomach than the large broken fingernail on the floor NEXT TO MY BED. I should note it's definitely not mine. These two things put together trump any 'good' I got from the hotel. For the price and name on this hotel, these aforementioned details are NOT excusable. Disgusting!
