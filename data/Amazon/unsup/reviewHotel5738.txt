I am a big fan. The have a good AAA rate. Their rooms are super comfortable. The bed is not the most awesome bed I've slept in, but it's pretty up there. The bathrooms are clean to the point where I was wondering what they used on their grout to keep it so white. Even the shampoo/lotion/eye-mask/etc treats were good. All the staff were nice and helpful. The location is right next to Greektown and UIC so it was optimally situated for my purposes. I'd stay there again for sure. Even room service was extra special. P.S. they have a free late checkout which was awesome.
