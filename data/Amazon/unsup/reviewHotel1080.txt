My stay at the Fairmont in April 2011 was nothing short of wonderful. I booked a King size room that had huge picture windows, a phenomenal bathroom, and a great dressing area. Room service was divine and I was grateful to be able to start my busy days with a healthy locally grown breakfast (smoothies and eggs among many other things). The bed was amazingly comfortable....the shower was heaven. I travel frequently to Chicago (at least 10 times a year) and I will be back again. I also just booked a trip to Bermuda and will be staying at the Fairmont there due to my excellent experience with their Chicago branch. The front desk staff were a little standoffish...I prefer more sucking up when I travel, but the room more than made up for it. The hotel bar had lovely ambiance but I found the drinks to be just so-so.
