When you walk into the lobby on a cold blistery Chicago night, you're dazzled by the warmth of the lights and the contemporary feel of the bar & the restaurants on the first floor. Their rooms however seem a little cramped and for someone of slightly less than average height as I was not able to reach the cord to close the shades for privacy. Bad planning Fairmont. Yet again bad planning in the bathroom. The shower was a rain shower, which meant having to spend twice as long to rinse my hair and with no angle to the shower head, washing was not as easy as one would like. The bathroom is probably the biggest reason for the low marks. Everything in there seemed cramped and less than functional. While there for an event I experienced one of the ballrooms and the Moulin Rouge room. The ballroom needed some serious updating, everything just felt old and out of date. the catering was also mediocre. While in the Moulin Rouge room, there was an interesting layout with some great wallpaper, though the carpet horribly clashes and is distracting from some of the unique features of the room. Food there was much more interesting & satisfying. I've heard that Aria in the Fairmont is supposedly the best sushi in Chicago, though it's good & I loved that they were willing to make my favorite roll that was not on the menu, it is be no means the best I've ever had. The best thing about the Fairmont? The beds themselves. They were very comforting after a long day of traveling.
