You know what? I am a big fan of Hotel Allegro. I'm not in creative writing mode today, so you get a list of why they're great. 1. I think our Hotwire price was about $120, but the regular price is only in the $190-ish range. 2. You are right down in the loop, which is super convenient. 3. You can bring your pet with you for no additional charge. 4. The staff is *really* friendly, and not in the fake, we're-only-nice-because-you-pay-us way. 5. The lobby is decorated in a very eclectic fashion. I'm talkin' hot pink and wavy neon blue velour couches-eclectic. 6. Free wine every day from 5-6pm. 7. Adorable, 1940s-meets-Ikea rooms. They are technically small rooms, yes, but I thought it was very cozy. I mean, do you really NEED an enormous hotel room? Shouldn't you be out enjoying the city or something? 8. Aveda shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizer. Free! 9. Free New York Times. 10. Comfy bed with extremely comfy pillows & linens. 11. iPod dock/alarm clock! And the best two things: 12. Not only can you get a variety of standard convenience items for free from the front desk, but you can also get "fashion tape." Fashion tape! So you can tape up your cleavage! For free! 13. There is always techno bumping in the elevators. It's like a crazy, eurotrash party at all hours of the day. 11 a.m., 2 pm., 1:30 a.m.....really. Who doesn't like to have dance parties in elevators? P.S. Not that I'm defending the soggy nachos that another reviewer had, but I'm not sure why they were charged $28. The price listed for nachos was $11. I only noticed this because my fiance had mentioned that someone on Yelp got $28 soggy nachos. So, I'm not really sure what happened there.
