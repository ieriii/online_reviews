I visited the James yesterday for the first time. I was in the event space where David Burke's Prime house catered a tasty array of meats aged anywhere from 28 days to 55 as well as the sides. I thought the main dining room space was nice (nothing terribly special or unique). I thought the library, a room a few steps away from the main room, was awesome. Multiple tvs, dark hard wood decor, large comfy couch, full bar, and pool table. What more can a guy ask for? Apparently the James has taken the comfy rooms of houses (libraries and dens) and recreated them in their event space for a unique twist to any party one may be hosting. However, for me these rooms, although very cool, did not sell me on the James for events.
