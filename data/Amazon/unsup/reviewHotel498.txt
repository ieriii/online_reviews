This turned out to be the perfect hotel for a spontaneous weekend trip in the city. We got a great last-minute rate on a two-room suite with a lake view, and the place itself is within walking distance from Navy Pier and Michigan Ave - perfect for someone who's just looking to chill out and enjoy Chicago without having to figure out how to commute from point A to point B. The free continental breakfast is okay, but I don't think it's as impressive as some previous reviewers mentioned. Definitely eat there before you start your day, but don't expect a gourmet experience! I would recommend skipping the free happy hour cocktail because everybody bum rushes the little bar at that time.
