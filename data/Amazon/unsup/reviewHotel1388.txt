For the price ($99/night) it was great, especially for the location. Its just off Michigan Ave. where all the awesome shopping.The staff is friendly and courteous. However, this hotel is really run down. The decor is nice but obviously worn. The bathroom is like a motel 6. The shower drain was clogged so that when you showered, it would pool at your feet. eeewwww. The beds are unpleasantly lumpy and uncomfortable. But, you can't beat the price for the location. Worth repeating because it's pretty much the only thing going for it.
