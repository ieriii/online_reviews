My husband and I were SOOOO impressed with the entire InterContinental staff during our wedding in the Grand Ballroom on May 5, 2012. The entire process was amazing, especially working with Budi Tanzil throughout all of the wedding planning. We heard countless positive comments about the actual service during the wedding meal/reception! The food was DELICIOUS. The hotel was very accomodating to our guests, especially considering it was a particularly busy weekend downtown due to the restaurant show. I am so happy we decided to have our ceremony and reception at the InterContinental and will forever have wonderful memories of the weekend.
