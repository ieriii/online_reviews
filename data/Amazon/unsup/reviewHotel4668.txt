Found a great deal through 'name your own price' on priceline, which definitely made it worth the trip. Location is close to major roads and transportation, so you can get around the city when you want to go exploring. The rooms are not huge, but very comfortable (e.g. with the bed linens and the temperature controlled rooms). The lobby is inviting with the fireplace and water feature. The is also a common area on the second floor with a television. They are a green hotel, which people may love or hate--yet it explains the set-up. It is cute and worth the trip as long as you know what you are expecting. Went her on a girlfiends get-away with great customer service and cute quote cards on our way out the door to send us on our merry way!
