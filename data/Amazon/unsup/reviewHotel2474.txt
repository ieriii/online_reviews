* I am basing my review on attending a seminar here, NOT staying in a room over night. * That being said, I think the hotel is gorgeous and was impressed with the ballroom. With the seminar being in December, I was able to see their lovely X-Mas decorations which included a HUGE Christmas tree near the front desk area.
