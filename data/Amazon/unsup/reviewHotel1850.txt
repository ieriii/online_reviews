My company had it's Christmas party in the city; so not to drive drunk we got a room here. I believe the mediocre staff gets paid to be aloof. The house music from 1982 playing in the lobby is a little annoying and what's with the disco ball? The rooms are small, really small. The closets are in the bathroom, you have to close the bathroom door to open the closet door. They DO NOT HAVE FOX NEWS on their cable line-up. This hotel is for the wannabe, "Sex and the City" set. I prefer to stay at the Peninsula. Whiskey Blue bar is cool. If you're a fiddy sumthing rich dood looking for arm candy.
