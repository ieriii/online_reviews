I had my wedding in Hotel 71 Penthouse on April 21, 2012. Views are amazing, staff extremely friendly, food delicious, wedding planners Christy and Chelsey wonderful to work with, hotel rooms great!!I highly recommend Hotel 71 for wedding reception!!! P.S.Lala Rojas from Golden Lief Florist who was recommended by hotel did a wonderful job with the flowers!
