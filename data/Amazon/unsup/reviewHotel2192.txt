This is the first real hotel I've had the pleasure to stay in. I think I've been ruined for life. The room is really nice, and the bathroom is amazing. There is a tub and a glass shower. In the bathroom there are Crabtree & Evelyn products, which is really nice. (If you got the shower with a curtain, its because you've been put in a handicap style room- kind of a plus because of the extra space) We ordered room service our first night in, and while it was expensive, it was the best room service we have had to date. Real flowers on our table? Real silver? Im not kidding. Our server who delivered it even wanted to serve us... but Im just not ready for that level of commitment yet. The pool area is amazing. Its a mosaic tyled junior olympic size swimming pool. They have a great fitness center as well, and offer reflexology and massages by appointment. I dont want to leave.
