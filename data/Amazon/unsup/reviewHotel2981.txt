I stayed here and thankfully I pricelined this place for a fraction of the price. This is a huge convention hotel and if you like crowds or thongs of families and kids, or teenagers attending an event then this is your hotel. It looks like they put ALL their money into the lobby and elevator banks on the main level. Look carefully at the doors on your floor, they are 2 shades of brown! Oh and the bathrooms have clearly seen better days. I would be upset if I spent $200 a night to stay here. The room (at least mine) had a very dark, masculine feel. They charge you $12.95 a day for the internet here and you cannot get a wireless signal so don't even think about it. New LG LCDs are in the room and a decent cable assortment made this stay tolerable. They did put out hot cider and fresh cookies twice while I stayed here which was a nice touch since it was about 10 degrees outside, but thats winter in Chicago. Everyone says this location is off the beaten path...it really isn't unless you are a typical lazy american but I could see how walking back at night could be troubling to some as its a bit empty. All in all, an OK experience. Oh the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed was comfy, room clean so no complaints on that.
