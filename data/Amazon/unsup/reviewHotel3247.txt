Stayed overnight here last week and out of the two hotels I stayed at in my trip, this was def. the better of the two. I was able to check in at 1pm (even tho check is at 3pm) - very cool since I had been traveling since 5am and was pretty damn tired. Front lobby was nothing spectacular - a couple of couches and concierge but they do have some cool music playing there. There are also 2 computers in the lobby area that you can use for free! The room itself is very sleek and modern. Lots of mirrors in this room! The bed was really comfortable - pillow-top mattress and down pillows! Aveda products to use in the bathroom - very nice! There is a sensored mini-bar - so while you can look, the moment you move the item, you will get charged. Whats great is that there is a 24 hr fitness and business center free of use age! Which is great because I love to check my email everyday. Overall, very convenient location - 2 blocks away from Millennium park, Chicago River, near a lot of their subway lines, and many shops and stores. The comforter was a little thin though - but then maybe its because I'm always cold, and thought that even in July, Chicago was cold! Wish there was a complimentary continental breakfast like the Amalfi hotel had that I stayed in earlier in the month, but that's okay. Def. would love to stay here again when I come back to Chicago!
