I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. I loved the decor, and the staff was SUPER friendly.Great bar at the Hotel, which also serves food from the adjoining restaurant, Elate - delicious! Although the rooms may be on the smaller side, it was fine for me considering I was out all day and evening. They're very clean - which is what is most important, as far as I'm concerned.I would definitely stay here again - great location.
