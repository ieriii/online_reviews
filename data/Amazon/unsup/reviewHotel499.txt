As a loyal Hilton traveller, I would rate this the better of the two Embassy Suites in Chicago. Still, I guess I have a thing with them because I feel like there's a cost you pay for having a suite and having free breakfast. The workout room is slightly above average, the breakfast is pretty good and the staff is quite friendly. Big negative in getting a smoking room, though I didn't mind that much since it didn't smell. Also, negatives for not recognizing my status (yeah, I have it so I'm officially that guy) and for making me pay for the internet. The manager's special is a nice touch, though you only get well drinks and draft beers. The food is slightly edible. I guess I'd come back here, but still want to try other hotels in town first.
