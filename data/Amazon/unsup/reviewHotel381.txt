I came here with a group of people for a birthday weekend away. We found a deal where we got rooms here for about 150/night which is pretty good for a downtown hotel on a weekend. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The bed was pretty comfy, although I did have to adjust the mattress a bit. I didn't have a great view but my friends had an amazing view from their room. And the staff were super-friendly and very helpful. The location is really what sweetens this hotel. You can walk pretty much anywhere downtown from here (and I did) but the red line is right outside the front door of the hotel so you can get just about anywhere in town. I will definitely stay here again. ETA: I completely forgot! We had a gigantic bathroom in our room which totally makes up for the "kinda" city view.
