I bleed SPG loyalty blood to the point where I will walk or drive an extra 15-20 minutes to stay at a Starwood property just to get the points, but if the Westins downtown are booked again...I think that I may have to reconsider my tactics, because The Tremont is a dump.  This property is an embarrassment to the brand. Three things come to mind. 1) The room's wallpaper and paint were perhaps current when leisure suits were legitimately fashionable. 2) The hotel doesn't have a gym or a restaurant. 3) I called down to the front desk because someone literally stole the cord off the back of the television and I wanted to watch the news, but there was no answer. What kind of @!#$%!@#$ hotel doesn't answer at the front desk? I ended up calling six times and never got through to the front desk, so I finally just took the one (yes, one) elevator down there. I couldn't find a single person who works for the hotel. Stay classy, Tremont. I won't be back.
