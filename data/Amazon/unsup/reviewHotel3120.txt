I'm as surprised as anyone could be that I'm only giving the W Lake Shore 3 stars. Last weekend was the third time I've stayed at this hotel and I'm sorry to say that it is getting to be about time for some renovations.  The downstairs lounge area is still as W as ever and I love the location, but the rooms were just "eh". Our bamboo blinds were broken so the middle one didn't go up all the way and we had a lamp that was on when we came in the room, but that the switch was broken off of, so the only way we could figure to turn it off was to actually unplug the light bulb. Not ideal. Also I'm not that big of a fan of the rain shower head if it is only used in order to disguise low-ish water pressure, which I had the impression was the case at this W. Under the rain shower head = warm goodness. Everywhere else in the shower stall = BRRRR. My legs were less than thrilled that I had to actually hold them under the water while shaving them because any other action would have been a direct trip to Goose Bump City. Also the walls were really thin. While getting ready for the wedding we went to Sunday night, we could hear every word coming out of the television next door. As though it was in our room (and I don't even think that our neighbors had it turned up past normal volume). Anyway, W, if you are listening, maybe put some money into making the rooms more like new again. The rooms are good-sized and the location and views are top-notch. Easy fixes, I say. Until then, W Downtown might be a better bet. Or if you are feeling silly spendy (or have the ole expense account working for you), stay at one of my all time faves, Park Hyatt Water Tower. Sigh. No Starwood points there though, my friend.
