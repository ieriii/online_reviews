The Best Western River North is basically the only hotel with free parking in downtown Chicago, which makes it very popular with visitors and conventioneers. The exterior does have a motel-look, but the hotel is decent enough, good but not great. The rooms are average in size, and the sink is separate from the toilet and tub in the bathroom. The hotel has an excellent location as you are surrounded by restaurants, shops, galleries and other fun tourist attractions. Pizzeria Ora is a decent place if you do not want to wander too far from your room (try the taco pizza).
