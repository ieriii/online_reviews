Wow, what an amazingly posh hotel! My parents stayed here over the weekend and I got to spend a fair amount of time here. The height of luxury! Nice large room. Two cushy chairs. Mod furniture. Fairly small bathroom, but how much time are you going to spend in there when you're visiting Chicago? I love that they use CFL bubs in the rooms. Also, they have notes about the sheets and that they try to conserve water by washing them only when requested. Environmentally responsible. If I was a visitor from out of town and in search of a very nice place to stay, this is where I would choose.
