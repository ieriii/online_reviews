The place has a beautiful lobby, lounges, and restaurants. Problems...there's nothing specIal besides that. Some rooms are significantly smaller than others but are priced the same. So its luck of the draw when getting a room. I would have given 4 stars but I also asked for well drink at the bar and I was given top shelf. I don't mind paying for top shelf but if you don't have a well alcohol then the customer should be told because I would have rather had a 12 dollar specialty drink than a 15 dollar shot of tequila....
