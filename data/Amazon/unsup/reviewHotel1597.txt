This was my hotel for NYE. I had a comp room, due to a previous issue and them having to "walk" me to another hotel. Overall, it was OK, but only after they moved us to a suite after initially wanting to put us in a room that hadn't been renovated. When I explained that we had the free stay due to an earlier problem, the desk guy upgraded us to the suite (much to the dismay of the guy who was checking in next to me- he was told that even though he had reserved a suite on Expedia, there were none currently available. The suite had a spacious living room, with a large TV, desk and sitting area. There was a non-working refrigerator in the "hospitality" area and a microwave. There was no ice machine nearby (not good for that bottle of vodka which was getting lonely), so I called room service to order two double vodkas, a can of mixer and a bucket of ice. I was told that the ice machine was on the floor below and they couldn't bring ice. After checking three floors, I finally found the ice machine. Returning to my floor, I was greeted by a funky smell. I thought that it was a dead animal.  Walking down the hallway, it struck me that the dead animal smell was actually some of the most pungent marijuana that I've ever experienced (and I've experienced A LOT of marijuana!). After catching the hallway buzz, I relaxed in the room and was quickly delivered my cocktails, though without the mixer- full glasses of straight Absolut. The full effect of the complimentary weed had now permeated both the hallway and my room. The entire floor reeked! In any event, the room was fine. I would have liked a bar, restaurant, faster elevators and newer towels, but overall an OK place to stay. If I get another free suite and another free contact high, I'll definitely do back.
