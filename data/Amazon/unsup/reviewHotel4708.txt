I stayed here the first time I had ever been to Chicago. I came down for a grad school interview. i got this hotel through priceline for $55/night in Feb and I was definitely pleased given what I paid! the hotel isn't bad. I traveled alone so the room was plenty of room for me... it's not huge, but it's not small either. The hotel is very nicely decorated and the staff is very friendly... especially the doormen. I opted to not go to the restaurant downstairs (Elate) because after I looked at the menu, nothing really looked all that appetizing. The don't really have ALOT. But who know, maybe I should have given it a try. There is a fitness center, business center, free internet (which is always good), and free coffee in the morning. Wish I had a coffee maker in the room. My room also has no microwave or mini fridge. For what I paid I definitely feel like i got a VERY good deal. I'd definitely stay here again if I can get another good deal through priceline lol.
