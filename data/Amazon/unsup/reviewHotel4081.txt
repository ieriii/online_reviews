3.5 stars. My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago on Saturday night after getting it on Priceline for $55/night. The hotel is in a very good location with plenty to walk to right near it. If you are coming from Midway Airport, I highly recommend taking the train. It's about 30 minutes, $2.25, and less than a 10 minute walk from the Randolph/Wabash station (we found this to be the more convenient station to the hotel rather than the Lake/State Street one). Even though we got to the hotel at 11 am, we were able to check in and go to our room on the 32nd floor. The room itself was a pretty basic king bed room, but we didn't need anything fancy or special for one night. I did find the placement of the flat screen TV a bit odd as it was on the end of the dresser on the right side of the bed, so if were laying in bed, you could to be on your side to see it. For booking via Priceline, we actually had a room with a decent view. The only amenity we utilized at the hotel was the business center which is on the bottom level. Use of the internet for 15 minutes will run you $7.56 and printing one page will cost $0.83. So only use the business center if you really have to. If you want to use cabs to get around, there are plenty in queue all the time near the hotel, so you won't have to wait to get one. Overall, this hotel is not a bad option especially since it looks like it's pretty easy to book for a great price on Priceline.
