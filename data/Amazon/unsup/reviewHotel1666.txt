Very nicely updated hotel in Chicago's Loop area (near the theater district). Close to the Clark/Lake stop on the "L", especially convenient if youre coming from O'Hare. Rooms are spacious, considering that the place was built probably close to 100 years ago. Beds were comfy, and the front desk staff was helpful to a point. One particular staff member, Katie, was AWESOME. She was totally helpful to our group who was in town for a bachelor party, hooking us up with late checkouts and just being helpful with area knowledge, etc. Also really helpful was concierce extrodinare Anthony, hooking us up with free admission to a couple clubs, etc. (The other concierge never offered this, even though there were stacks of passes in the top drawer of the concierge desk...weird). My only real complaint was that when checking in, the front desk person (not Katie) steered us towards breakfast at the attached restaurant (312), and sort of mixed it in with all the complimentary services offered by the hotel (coffee in the morning, wine hour in the late afternoon, etc), so it sort of made it seem like breakfast was complimentary too. It definitely wasnt, in fact, it was really overpriced and awful. I'd definitely stay at Allegro again, I'd just be sure to steer clear of the restaurant.
