The Hotel is in an excellent location. It is near everything in the Loop. The staff was very helpful. It was a 30-40 minute from O'hare Airport. The hot tub was small but it still served its purpose. I would stay there again. Also shout out to Mike who was working security a couple days. He deserves a raise lol.
