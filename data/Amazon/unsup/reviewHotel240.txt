I truly enjoyed my stay at Hotel Indigo. The staff is exceptionally kind and attentive, very welcoming. The bed was REALLY comfortable, and the space was fantastic - particularly for the price point. Nearby there is a very nice grocery store, a Starbucks, restaurants, and the red-line train is only about 3 blocks away. Plus, it's a simple walk to Michigan Avenue for anything you could ever hope for. The unique decor was much more soothing in person than I anticipated by the photos. It actually works. I liked the fitness center, and the attention to small details. The internet connection worked perfectly and was complimentary! Very quality experience. Definitely staying here again when I'm in Chicago! I'd like to send a particularly warm shout out to Victoria, who was the best of the best and very helpful. To the management: GIVE VICTORIA A RAISE.
