I was here for an Industry Conference (11/6-7/2008) but I didn't stay here since I'm "local". However I will comment on the lunches we were served and the liquor. First day's lunch was actually an amazing piece of work, however, since it was the ONLY lunch option for the day and I don't like eggplant, well, I was really hungry after lunch. After a normal salad, we were served up truly a beautiful dish of Eggplant Parmesan. 3 Medium thick slices of eggplant were breaded and fried and then stacked with a ricotta/onion mix layered in between. Melted shredded parmesan was on top and a spicy marinara was draped on and around the dish. Truly magnificent if that's what you like. Dessert was a slice of Eli's Chocolate Chip Cheesecake. Second day's lunch was much better. We started off with a cream corn chowder soup (it was a chilly day too) and then it was a Cobb Salad with really fresh ham and turkey sliced on it. Dessert was this awesome lemon meringue tart that was to die for. Both our private open bar and the bar in the lobby of the hotel served up a wide variety of bottled beers and extensive wines. There pretty much wasn't anything you couldn't handle. Also, free wi-fi everywhere in the hotel is always a plus, especially when you're a guest for a conference and you're not checked in. Valet was slow as heck, but I parked in the lot just to the northwest of the hotel for much cheaper.
