I'm not sure where everyone else was staying but that was not the same hotel I was at this week. - Rooms were abnormally small, even for Chicago.  - I did not have hot water the first day I showered there. Chicago in October, that is a problem. The following morning, I had hot water but I'm fairly certain it was because I was the only one showering in the building (~4:30 a.m. for early flight) - Cleanliness was subpar. Pretty sure there was mold in the bathroom from what looked like water damage on the ceiling.  - Beds were NOT nearly as comfortable as Marriott.  The only thing great about this hotel is location. If that is all you are looking for, then this is the place for you. If you are looking for a nice hotel, lobby, room, etc., go elsewhere.
