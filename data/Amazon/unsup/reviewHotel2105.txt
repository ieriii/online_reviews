Not good. First room had a broken shower. Second room had a funny smell that never did go away. Walls are paper thin and we were awoken each night by about 12 giggling party people coming in at 3am and continuing the par-tay in the room next door. At one point I could hear someone coughing through the walls. That's right--just a cough. So you can imagine that 12 drunk people effectively shut down any more sleep, even after we called security. The rooms are in severe need of a refresh--dusty and dated. Not charmingly dated--more like udpated sometime in the mid 90s and in desperate need of a facelift. These stars are for the location, which is fantastic, and the lobby, which all marble and really pretty. This hotel is expensive for what you get and next time we're going to stay somewhere more modern.
