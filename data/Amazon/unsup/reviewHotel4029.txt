Stayed at the Hyatt this weekend for a getaway with my husband. Didn't really have any crazy expectations since all Chicago hotels are usually fairly nice. I was completely blown away. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a Junior Suite. Probably the nicest suite I've stayed in to date. BEAUTIFUL furnishings and layout of the room. View from the 26th floor was great. The hotel was very acomodating and even delivered complementary chocolate to the room. Nice touch! Room was joining on both sides and the other occupants were slightly loud, but it didn't bother me because the environment in our room was amazing. I would absolutely stay at the Hyatt in Chicago again and recommend it to anyone looking for a lavish experience.
