Stayed here for 4 days and loved it! The hotel was right in the middle of everything and it was nice to be able to just walk around the city and explore. The hotel was really nice and the people were friendly - especially the guys up front! One of them even chased down a van to accommodate our large group when we were planning a night out on the town. I'd have to say one of the major advantages of this place is the location - you don't really have to go far to dine or shop, and even if you felt like taking a ten minute walk you could go right down to millennium park, the museum of contemporary art, or you could even take the red line which is 5 blocks away if you feel like venturing out farther. I would definitely consider this hotel again on my next stop in Chicago.
