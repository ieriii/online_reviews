Stayed here on a recent trip to Chicago and the location is excellent. The hotel is right in front of the Red Line, a short hop from the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, and Millennium Park. I actually never used public transit once during my trip and walked everywhere instead. I checked out the gym and it's quite small, but there are a fair number of treadmills there. The swimming pool was also small, so don't expect to swim laps. Overall, the facilities aren't bad and much better than nothing. The room I stayed in had 2 queen sized beds and was quite roomy. Some small complaints that I have are that there is no safe in the room, and there is no bathroom fan. The service was wonderful! Upon arriving, we used the parking valet and as the bellhop helped us into the lobby, I realized that I had left my wallet in the car. The bellhop ran outside and chased down the valet, and I had my wallet back within a minute. I don't normally use valet parking, so this was a very good experience for my first time. If I'm in the Chicago area again in the future, I'll definitely stay here.
