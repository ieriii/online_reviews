3 stars for the hotel overall. Minus 2 star for rooms being SUPER noisy, plumbing not working properly, and so-so staff. Upon walking into the hotel it looks like your typical Hard Rock. Very cool musical decor and modern. The rooms themselves are spacious and clean. Noisy though. WOW. I thought my window had been openend but nope....just no insulating to keep the noise from the streets out. Made it very hard to sleep at night. Also, my sink was dripping continually and the toilets flush weird and would not always flush. Overall nothing bad about the hotel itself I just wish they did a better job of noise control. Being close to the elevators didn't help either. I LOVE Hard Rock hotels though.
