No, you're not really close to the center of town. Not within walking distance anyway. So if you know that going into it, then you won't be disappointed. The cab ride into the city is short though. The check in line was long but it moved quickly. I wasn't happy to see that the self check in kiosk wasn't working. Those are relatively new! They should work! But whatever, the front desk guy was fast and really helpful so human interaction was actually preferred in this situation. Our suite was GORGEOUS and everything was perfect. They have great amenities and a HUGE lounge with a little shop for coffee, snacks, reading materials...ect. The valet and bell hop guys are very nice...plenty of room to handle many cars. The cab line downstairs at the peak of "going out" time was sort of long but it moved quickly. I was surprised because there isn't much aroudn there, but the cabs seem to frequent it at the right time.
