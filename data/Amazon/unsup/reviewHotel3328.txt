YouSwoop gave me a $99 deal on this room! We received two complimentary drinks from the in-house bar, discounts at Hard Rock Cafe if we had chosen to dine there, and just overall a fun night. The bed was a very comfortable king, the hotel itself is hold but historic, each floor appears to be themed by a different rockstar/band, and the staff is very helpful with any questions that I had. I live in Chicago, mind you, but not in the loop, and just jumped on this YouSwoop when I saw it. It's like a mini-vacation in your own home city, being pampered a little, so it was totally worth it. The bar was really awesome, too, and we enjoyed our drink and our time there. I really enjoyed my stay at Hard Rock. It's in a great location - in between the loop and River North (restaurant central), by all the shops (maybe someday I'll have money to peruse them)! Just wish they had a pool! But most hotels in Chicago do not due to some city statute or historic building code.
