This is a pretty good hotel for the Loop, but I think I came at the wrong time. It was way too crowded, the elevators took FOREVER, and the gym was packed to the gills. It's understandable that the gym and lobby would be busy with a full hotel, but the elevator problem was a real hassle and very frustrating. I waited maybe 25 minutes to only have the elevator finally come, but so jam-packed that I couldn't get on. (Walking down 19 flights in heels didn't appeal to me that day...) Apart from that, the hotel is in a good location, the rooms are clean quiet, and the staff is friendly. Housekeeping responded so quickly when I called about my broken iron, and the front desk gave me great advice on finding a yummy pizza restaurant. Overall, not a bad stay.
