So the Allerton is the old school hotel on Michigan Ave at Huron the one with the neon sign for the Tip-Top -Tap... The place looks ancient, and I think it is, but clearly the inside has been totally renovated recently and it's really nice. You have to go up to the lobby and there's a sleek bar area there. i didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on any of the food services, but the rooms were great!! Beautifully decorated and well appointed. We had 2 rooms and one was the 2 room suite, which was awesome and huge! The bathroom was nice and there were yummy L'Occitane soaps& shampoos! The staff was also quite nice, friendly, and efficient. Give it a shot...Don't let the exterior fool you!!
