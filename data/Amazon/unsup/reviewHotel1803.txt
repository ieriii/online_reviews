I absolutely loved this place, it was actually my first stay at a W, so they took my W card if you will. Bad thing was the front was going on some type of construction, so some scaffolding was there, but that was a minor inconvenience. The door staff was super nice in getting our bags and doors upon check in and out. Also, do yourself a favor, talk to Vanessa at the concierge, she helped out A TON on our last day there. The hotel was stylish, clean and I'd stay there again based on their music in the elevators. Only weird thing was some 3D art that didn't agree w/ my mind after a few shots and beers coming home late. The Fabulous room was awesome, super clean, spacious and perfect if you need two beds and you've got someone with you. Plenty of hook-ups for charging devices and all that, kind of bothersome that they didn't have free wi-fi for the rooms, and it was only in the lobby. The bar was cool for a random afternoon drink, but I didn't get to experience breakfast or anything from the local restaurant inside.
