Traveling through Chicago for business, they booked a coworker and I a room at Hotel Felix for the night.  When we arrived, valet came to greet us and parked the car (for $44). The hotel staff was prompt, but seemed slightly less then friendly, more like pleasantly bothered? You can tell the building is very old, which is why the rooms are probably so small - two double beds practically took up the entire room - it was pretty cozy...I think it would be better if you stayed here on a romantic occasion with one queen or king. Nice amenities, very clean. If you are looking for somewhere upscale to stay that isn't in the heart of downtown, this is a great option (Not too far from Wrigley Field either).
