i and my friend stayed here for lollapalooza this year. the rooms are small -- i prefer to call them "cozy" -- but the decor of the whole hotel, elevators,bars and all, is gorgeous. you feel like you're *someone* when you walk the halls of the palmer house. as mentioned, the room's small. there really isn't a lot of space to really walk around. it was two steps from the bed to the bathroom. but i'm not complaining. they're clean and they're a place to sleep. granted, not the best decorated, which is strange because the rest of the hotel's just grand. part of the reason you go to a lavish hotel such as this one is the service. and oh, we got served. we ordered room service for breakfast and it was really, really good, and it got up to us quickly. everyone was courteous and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. and when i hung out at the bar, the bartender was accommodating when i asked for drink suggestions. we made nice, it was all good. i quite enjoyed my stay here, and i'd definitely come back, despite how expensive it is to get a room. oh, speaking of which, we were only a short walk from grant park. perhaps about three blocks. so it's an awesome place to stay if you're going to lolla.
