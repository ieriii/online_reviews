Great location, good rooms, but a bit old style. Still much better interior than many of the old hotels in the Chicago area. Just minutes away from the orchestra and Michigan avenue loop area makes it a good place to move around especially during festivals and other park events. A little disappointed when Trader Vic's left as the hotel is trying to update its look and push for a higher (profitable) customer.  The lobby bar had a good pour but was a bit expensive - hopefully not a sign of the times for Chicago hotels.
