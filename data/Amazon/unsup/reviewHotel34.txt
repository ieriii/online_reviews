Great location for walking to any part of downtown Chicago you could want. The hotel was old, but not in any way that caused any kind of problem. The lobby was very nice; I understand it had recently been renovated. The room and other areas were clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. The water in the room was hot and had good pressure! My only complaint was that the walls were a little thin, so I could hear my next door neighbor. Luckily he seemed to be a Japanese business man who didn't do anything other than talk on the phone and watch TV, but a different neighbor could have been a different situation! Overall, the hotel was a great value for the location, and very clean and comfortable. I would stay there again!
