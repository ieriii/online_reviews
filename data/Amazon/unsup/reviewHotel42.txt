Decent price for downtown Chicago over a weekend. Our room contained a air system which only produces heat in the winter and cold in the summer, so if it's one of those 80 degree days in February or March, I suppose you're screwed. Piano in the lobby needs tuning. Lobby is adjacent (attached opening) to Mike Ditka's. Bed excellent, TV above average, bathroom and cleanliness meet the standards.
