We stayed here at the beginning of December after attending a family wedding at the Trump Towers... we should have stayed there instead... our mistake. This was our attempt to stay close by, but to have our privacy.... We pulled up for valet, and a rushed man came over and took our keys and asked if we needed any help with bags. "Yes, we do." was my reply. You should have seen the look on that mans face when he saw we only had one bag.... I was in an evening gown and heels while my fiance was in a tux for a winter evening reception in Chicago. Why would we risk dirtying ourselves for a bag? As if the attitude wasn't enough... we waited... and waited... for our bag to be delivered. We finally had to call down 3 times... The last time I called. I told the rude boy on the other end it was a red bag. He replied with "Well... hmm... we have A LOT of red bags down here.... so I'm not sure.... what... to do..." Finally I said I'd be down there in a short elevator ride to pick up my bag... and suddenly... eureka! The bag was found. WHAT A JOKE!
