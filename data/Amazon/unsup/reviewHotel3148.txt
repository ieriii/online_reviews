This old Holiday Inn and Days Inn has found new life, as the W makes its mark on Lake Shore Drive. It is definitely hipper than its old incarnations, and the Wave is a popular hangout for food and drink. It is very convenient to Navy Pier, but slightly removed from the action of the Magnificent Mile.
