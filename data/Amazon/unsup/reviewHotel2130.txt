Shockingly terrible. I come to Chicago maybe once a month for business and typically have enjoyed the Trump. This place was recommended by my travel people, as close to office, nice etc. What I encountered are rude staff, a tiny room with no amenities, $7 bottles of water, a weird touch screen and tiny TV.  There are no towel racks in bathroom. Turn down service was nonexistent. Internet is $17 a night, shouldn't that be free by now? The hotel is massive and there are no personal touches to make you feel more at home which are essential when traveling for work. Needless to say I will never stay here again and will recommend all my colleagues to avoid.
