We all know travel can be stressful and where we reside upon our travel is absolutely important. I travel to Chicago nearly 7 times a year and choose Amalfi Hotel not only for the convenience and great rooms but the staff and overall experience is worth it. There are endless restaurants and convenient shopping whether you wish to shop State or Michigan Avenue.  Safe Travels to you...
