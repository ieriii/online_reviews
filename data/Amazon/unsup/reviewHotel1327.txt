Just celebrated my sisters wedding here and spent a few days with my husband on the 18th floor. The wedding and reception was lovely. But our room was tiny and had v ery little warm water so taking showers was uncormfortable. I've stayed 5 times but the quality has really gone downhill. I reccomend the westin instead.
