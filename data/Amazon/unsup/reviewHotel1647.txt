Our room was very nice, we had a King bed, reg. room. It was small, but very cute ! We had one small suitcase and no where to put it. It would be nice if the hotel had a folding stand for a suitcase. Yes, the bathroom is small also, but very clean and nice.  The staff was great ! We every much enjoyed our stay !!!!! Great location too !
