I stayed at the Crowne Plaza this past weekend and it far exceeded my expectations. I had driven by the place a million times and it never seemed all that nice from the outside, but all of the renovations they did a few years ago have really done wonders for the interior.  The only downside is that they didn't have any rooms with king-sized beds available and I had to settle for 2 double beds. Beyond that and a few burned out light bulbs, everything was great. The decor was much more modern than other Crownes I've stayed at before. They provide every room with what I guess you would call sleep accessories: eye mask, ear plugs, sleep CD, and aromatherapy linen spray. I guess they really want to make sure you're knocked out. I ended up not needing to use any of them because I was really tired and the beds are comfortable enough on their own, but it's nice to know they care.  The location isn't the greatest as far as things to do except for Greektown, but you're right off the expressway and close to the Loop so it's convenient to get pretty much anywhere in the city.
