IT'S TRUE..    TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE.... Just like people, some Westins are uglier than others. Luckily, this Westin was of the pretty varietal. Smack dab in the middle of Downtown, it was close to everything. As 'Preferred Guests', we were greeted and instantly upgraded to a corner room with a sick view on the 12th floor. We overlooked the Chicago River with the sun beaming into our room.The room had a king Heavenly bed (which can be had for $1695 w/ boxspring..tempting!), chaise by the bow window, these light green leaf soaps, and girly smelling shampoo/conditioner. Artwork with its own artist light dresses the room's walls. A sport bottle of water comes complimentary, as does Starbucks grounds. An LG 32" LCD is placed smack middle in front of the bed. The highlight for me? A Speakman DUAL SHOWER HEAD. The cool feature is that not only do you get a greater surface area, but you can turn off one head by pushing a back valve on the left showerhead. There was great water pressure and I never ran out of hot water. Service was friendly and professional. We were even given an umbrella for usage during a rainy day. $49/day for parking is a tad ridiculous though, don'tcha think? (MINUS ONE STAR) Didn't get a chance to hit the gym, as I was busy pigging out. At $109/night, are you kidding me? GO! Pics: http://www.meetup.com/fo
