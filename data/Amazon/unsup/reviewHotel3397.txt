The Allerton is a well refurished hotel on the Magnificent Mile. I have to say it's a good deal for the price. Everything still looks new and comfortable. Yet affordable. It's not as spacious as it is advertised. I really like the decor, Modern but warm. The elevator are a little strange. It's like they have a mind of there own. lol
