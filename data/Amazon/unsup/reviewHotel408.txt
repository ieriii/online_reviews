Had a small group meeting here. Hilton Garden Inns typically are great properties and really emphasize good service for a very moderately priced hotel. This location is ideal - the Hancock building was visible from my window, Nordstroms was across the street, the Weber Grill restaurant on site was quite good (and fun), and we were within walking distance of many other sights.
