Stayed here via Hotwire for $79 on a Saturday night. We arrived around 9pm and the staff at the front desk was extremely rude. The redheaded woman that checked us in never made eye contact once and didn't bother listening to us either. We were given a room on the 2nd floor at the end of the hall.The rooms are very small and the hallways are equally as small. Our room faced Wabash so there wasn't much we could do about the noise. I would hope higher floors didn't have as much of an issue with noise. Upon checkout the in-room service was not functioning. We called the front desk and the staff was just as rude as the evening staff and abrubtly hung up on us. The only saving grace to the hotel was the breakfast in the morning. All in all - we got what we paid for with a location we wanted. NOTE: Parking at the hotel is $40 valet, you can go around the corner and use public parking for $34 for overnight.
