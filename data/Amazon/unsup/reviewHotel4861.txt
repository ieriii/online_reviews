I just returned from this hotel. I was there from July 2-7th. I booked the hotel for the location of being across the street from Grant Park where the Chicago Food Festival was held and it is walking distance from Soldier stadium, where I had tickets to see U2 prior to the concert being postponed. The hotel is old! Simple as that. But I had no problems with odors or cleanliness. The staff were friendly and I had no unpleasant experience. It was close to Millinium and Grant Park, Walkin distance to the Museum campus, which is where I watched the fireworks for the 4th. No problems with this hotel and would stay again. The room was spacious, had a great view, was clean and I felt safe.
