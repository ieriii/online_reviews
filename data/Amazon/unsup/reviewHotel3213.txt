I did not stay at the hotel, but I stopped in for a private party during Lollapalooza. The hotel looks really nice and the AC was nice and cold (it was really blasting). The atmosphere was pretty cool too. I would definitely stay at this hotel if I was given the opportunity. It seems like a pretty swanky place.
