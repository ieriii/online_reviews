I kept in mind that this hotel is old, and has alot of history, but it wasn't enough to make me ever go back. Upon arriving there was no clerk. Finally after 5 mins she shows up, and doesn't have our reservation on the computer so we have to sit and wait. Again. For 15 mins. Here she comes, we go to the room. It was a hard, lumpy FULL size bed. The tvs are old. The furniture is old. There was an old stained faux fur blanket on the old bed. You can hear your neighbors loud and clear. WORST PART 7am everyone is so loud in the hotel and outside. The windows in the room are right to the street where a cross walk guy was blowing a whistle at 7am for people and cars. The house keepers were talking loudly in the hall and I hardly slept a wink. also Internet was $10. This hotel had 4 stars On Hotwire and I don't understand that. I'm sleeping in the Marriott tonight which only has 2 stars and it's 100% better. All in all, don't waste your time or money on the Whitehall.
