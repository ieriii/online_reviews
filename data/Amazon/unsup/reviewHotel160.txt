I have to say that this is the worst place I have ever stayed at. Reserving a room was a hassle because I had to wait for the concierge to call me back...3 hours later. When we arrived the door man was pleasant and polite. The staff at the front...wasn't even present. We had to stand there for about 10 minutes before the doorman went back to look for the guy. Then front desk staff guy said they "upgraded" our room. We were okay to hear this. When we got to our room...disappointed. The elevators are ghetto and old looking. The hallway to our room is dark and shabby looking. The cups in our room had finger prints all over them. The shower had mold in the caulk and in the corners. The caulking at the base of the tub and the floor was cracked and stained looking. The toilet was dirty looking. They do not have ice machines or a vending machine for snacks or a small hotel store. We needed some ice for drinks we bought to the room and they sent up a guy with an ice bucket. This guy was not professional at all. He came in with regular street clothes and he actually welcomed himself in the room without my okay for him to come in. The ice is from the chinese restaurant downstairs. There is nothing luxurious or hotel like about this place. It is as creepy as a run down motel. Checking out took us 15 minutes before the front desk guy even came to the front. He was very rude. We were only staying at this hotel because we had a certificate given to us. I did not like this place. Do not spend your money on this place!
