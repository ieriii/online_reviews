Sutton place has got it all (except for the CRT Tv). This hotel has an amazingly friendly staff. They will help you get anything you need as fast as they can. The location is unbeatable and the views (wether the lake or the Viagra Triangle) are great. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom has separate tubes and showers. The tube is a little small but it's nice. Some of the best dinning in Chicago is at the entrance of the hotel. I would totally recommend this place to anyone staying in Chicago.
