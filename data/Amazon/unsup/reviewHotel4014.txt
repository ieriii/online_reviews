My favorite hotel in Chicago, hands down! And not just because of the Big Bar... I'm going to go ahead and not take a star off for the room next to me in which two very... aggressive... individuals decided to... how do I say this... what's that song? "Do it like they do on the discovery channel?" Yeah. All night long. FML. They're also heavy smokers and I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to do that here. This morning I woke up to the sounds of them throwing up -- not even kidding. But that's not the hotel's fault. What I love most about the Hyatt Regency is that much like the city it's in, it's so busy all the time. This has to be one of the busiest hotels I've seen and I love the energy, plus the people watching is superb. As I mentioned before, a trip to the Big Bar where you can pick up an oversized drink, is definitely in order. There's also a Starbucks in the lobby which is more than convenient. The room service is prompt and comes along with a great menu... this morning I had the "green and white eggs" which comes with kale, avocado, and sprouts... they have certain things designated healthier than others which I'm always a fan of. The Hyatt also has a late night menu that runs I believe until 6am, for those of you who party your pants off in Chicago. I love the energy of the Hyatt Regency, and when I told the guy at the front desk I was from St. Louis and our Cards just took game 6, he upgraded me to a king size room with a gorgeous view. Highly recommended for a downtown Chicago hotel!
