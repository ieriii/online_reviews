Let me preface by saying - this hotel may not be for everyone - this is BOUTIQUE hotel, not a chain. They just had a some odd million renovation (which is absolutely gorgeous) but it still has its quirks and I like that. Came here late on Valentines Day 09 as the last part of a surprise evening from my husband. Upon entering, someone offered to take my bags, we bypassed because we only had a couple. My husband breezed through check-in while I sat in awe of the lobby (if they the movie "Cool World" was redone for this decade - this lobby would be in it). I'm sure the rooms vary in size, but we got a huge corner one with enough room for me to do if a flip flop ( I would assume if I were a gymnast). The room had the usual modern updates - iPod clock radio, plasma TV, soft robes, etc, sleek furniture and decor. I felt like a princess as I sat in one of the zebra stripped robes they had in the hall closet while I sat back and sipped on a tiny bottle of Grey Goose from the Minibar. We got room service the next day - I had eggs benedict and my husband the steak and eggs - both were delicious - my limited experiences with room service has been questionable at best so I happy to have warm tasty food that didn't feel like it was just cranked out on a convey er belt (because I mean, it was the morning after Valentine's Day - I'm sure 90% of the hotel was getting room service!) All in all - I loved it. Not all the Kimpton Hotels have as much character as this one - so if you're going to go the Kimpton route - go for the Allegro.
