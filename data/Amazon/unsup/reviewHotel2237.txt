The hotel is very nice and the staff is very attentive. We stayed in the Historic Tower and the views were spectacular. We had a direct view of the Trump Tower and the River. My only complaint is that the internet is very slow, but that seemed to be a common theme throughout Chicago when using my iPhone. The hotel is in the middle of everything - shopping, food, some decent bars. Also, the indoor pool was great. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
