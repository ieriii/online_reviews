My review is this hotel is superfluous at this point, but like others I simply had to chime in and spread the good word about The James Hotel. Got a great deal on their website $194 a night and all our requests were met with gusto! Early check in, high floors, late check out, got it all. We also got exceptional service and smiles from poised doormen and even extremely happy housemaids! What a joy to stay somewhere where the staff feel proud as well! Their rooms were very well appointed, we LOVED the minibar with fun extras (naughty ones too!) and who doesn't love Keils's bath products. IF I had to be nitpicky I would note just two things: one of the sheets on our bed had a tear in it towards the corner, which was nothing too freak out over. And the 2nd thing was that the walls in the bathroom could have used a once over, there were lots of short black hairs on the gleaming white walls. I imagine from the person before us blow drying their hair. Again, nothing huge. We were extremely happy with the luxuriousness of the bed, the barcelona chair in room was immaculate. We wish there were more James Hotels in more cities! We left feeling like a swanky young couple in love! Does it get better than that?
