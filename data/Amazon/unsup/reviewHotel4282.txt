The Palmer house is the epitome of posh and outrageous glamour. The 60-foot ceiling lobby is dripping with ornate baroque decor: golden winged angels hoisting chandeliers, lavish elaborate carpets, marble archways, and full-circle velvet sofas at the hub of a bank of golden-doored elevators. The hallways of the rooms promintently display black-and-white photos of the stars of the "golden age" - singers, musicians, actors of all kinds grace the silent hallways. There appears to have been some renovation based on other reviews and the curtains of other rooms I noticed from my window. My room on the 17th floor was quite lovely - art deco furniture, lovely colors, "Hollywood-style" decorative bathroom and closet door handles were a reminder of a past golden age. A few minor annoyances - no coffee maker in my room (big, huge boo for a business traveler.) The buttons on the phone didn't connect to... well, anywhere (wake up calls, etc.) No free internet except in the lobby (which seems to be pretty typical these days.) The instructions for the check out process are incorrect and you can't set a time for checkout. So, I accidentally checked out when I wasn't ready to leave for a few hours (in conference meetings all morning.) The phone operator didn't understand this predicament and kept forwarding me to non-answering numbers. Besides that, the desk staff and concierges were all very nice and professional. I really didn't have a problem with the hotel being on the second floor. With a Starbucks on the 1st and easy access to 3 main streets, I was pretty happy. Having a martini in the hushed, lavish lobby was dreamy... We'll be back!
