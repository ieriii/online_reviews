My friend and I decided to use Priceline "name your own price" bidding war to book our recent trip to Chicago. We bid for a 4 star deluxe hotel, but wouldn't be able to see the actual hotel chosen until our bid was accepted and paid for.  We ended up w/the Knickerbocker. My friend and I ALWAYS murder words so to stay at a place called the Knickerbocker was priceless. We're staying at The Kinkyfker. The Redenbacher. The Betty Crocker. Mutherfker. We looked at how much the room would've been had we booked w/them straight up. We saved more than half the price. Hands over our mouths we were like ohhhhhhhhhh y'all just got priceliiiiiiiiiiiiiined!! Joke was on us, though. We believe the hotel puts the pre-paid priceline guests in the worst rooms ever. Right at about 4 in the morning, we awoke to the sounds of rumbling and slamming and racket that should only be heard at a construction site or a honeymoon suite. We called the front desk and explained the noise. They responded with, "Oh, that's odd. We'll investigate and see what's going on." We never got a call back. So we investigated ourselves. Turns out our room was RIGHT next door to the service elevators (hidden by a door that says "empoyees only" or some sht like that). At any rate, we were rarely in our room because Chicago brought out the rockstars in us so we pretty much just used the room to bathe and change. 2 things to note about their bathroom: 1. Rain shower head. Finally, my chance to reenact a music video of some girl w/long hair under falling rain. But the water pressure was too light, so it took longer to get the shampoo out. And I wasn't used to the soapy water all up on my face. So much for that.  2. Dual-flush toilet. Designed to save water. A button for number 1, a button for number 2. Great. But their toilet was hella high off the ground. My friend was getting tired of giving me a boost. 2 stars mutherfkers. 2 stars.
