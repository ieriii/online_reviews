We LOVED our room and our stay here at Hotel 71. The staff was very friendly and we got an upgrade from our regular king size room to a river view. Amazing view of the Chicago River and Trump Tower across the street.  The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was awesome. there was a standing shower stall in our bathroom with a rainfall shower head in it. It felt like we were at a spa! We definitely took more showers than we needed to just because the shower was so nice! There was even a TV in the bathroom and it was nice and spacious in there. Another great thing about the bathroom was it had a dimmer switch for the lights in there. What was amazing about this was that my early morning trip to the bathroom didn't end up blinding me when I turned on the light. I just turned it on just enough to see where I was going and then was able to hop back into bed without a problem. We only stayed one night so we didn't encounter the housekeeping staff at all. Our room was clean and modern, so no complaints there at all. Valet parking was quick and easy and the hotel was located close to everything we came into the city for. For the price and location, we'd definitely stay at Hotel 71 again.
