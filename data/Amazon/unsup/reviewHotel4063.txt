The Hyatt Regency was perfect for our stay in the Windy City. You can't beat the location. Tons of convention people stay here, so be prepared for large groups of people walking around wearing name tags at all hours. The room we stayed in had a great view of the river and Lake Michigan. We were surprised by a fireworks show out the window Saturday night. The decor was modern, yet comfortable. If you are hungry or thirsty, there are plenty of options for food and drink in the hotel 24 hours a day. There's even a snack stand open all the time selling cappuccinos, pastries, picnic supplies, bulk candy, and cold drinks. Check in at the front desk was easy, and we were assisted with automated check out when we departed. The concierge desk was helpful with directions, plus we were able to print our boarding passes from the computers set up there. I only wish they had free wifi in the rooms. But other than that, the Hyatt Regency had everything we could possibly want in a downtown hotel.
