We reserved a block of rooms at Hotel Lincoln for our wedding weekend in June 2012. We ended up using about 12 rooms. Pros - very reasonable pricing, amazing location (our guests enjoyed the farmers market across the street on Saturday, the hotel rents bikes to guests who want to explore the bike path along the lake and Lincoln Park Zoo & conservatory are right there), newly renovated (just re-opened in March 2012), delivered giftbags with no additional charges (unlike some hotels downtown). Cons - front desk is completely chaotic, they don't seem equipped to handle the number of guests they have. They overbooked the hotel and kept trying to turn our guests away - despite having had reservations for months! And they didn't seem able to cope with guests inquiries and issues because they seemed overwhelmed. If I did it again I would still book rooms there simply because the location was so convenient for our events, but I do hope the hotel improves its operations as things settle in. Also - note that the rooms are small; if you want a sofa or room to spread out, get a junior suite or full suite.
