This review is for the Manager Reception:  Embassy Suites has the best deal in the hotel industry. It is the Manager's Reception. What the Manager's Reception is, is a 2-hour Happy Hour from 5:30-7:30 P.M. With a hotel key, hotel guests have unlimited alcohol beverages at no cost from 5:30-7:30 P.M. plus snacks. The alcohol drinks range from draft Budweiser to Bahama Mamas and Blue Hawaiins (my favorite). All drinks are served by personable bar tenders. And not only are there drinks, there are snacks. My favorite is the tri-color tortilla chips with salsa (served on certain days). I rate the Manager Reception 5 stars. If you are having a bad day, by two hours the Manager's Reception should change your bad day into a great night.
