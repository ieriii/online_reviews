This is a very nice hotel, an I got an unexpected bonus. First off in clear violation of the Hilton booking rules, I reserved the cheapest room possible for one person...with the intent of having about 7 people stay in it. We needed a place to crash after a friend's birthday celebration. They either didn't realize when I led the field trip up to the room, or just looked the other way. In either case...cool. I have Hilton Diamond status, so they automatically upgraded me to a lake view room, which was nice. It also had two bathrooms, which was odd, but nice for all the people. The room was nice - very comfortable beds, good sized and with a nice view as well. The lobby was quite impressive, very plush, and staff were incredibly helpful. i was not able to try any of the restaurants, since I was with friends who had other (liquid) dining plans. There was also an interesting goody in the room - a $50 off coupon (with qualifying purchase) at a costume jewelery store in the lobby. I offered it to a friend, and I went down with her since I wanted to get something to munch on later. (Forget paying for the mini-bar stuff) Who do we run in to in the lobby? Fonzie. Seriously. Arthur Winkler. Nice guy, too - I have pictures to prove it. So. Between good service, very nice surroundings, a free upgrade (granted, not just spontaneous, but due to my history), and a celebrity siting, I highly recommend this hotel. Although your personal amount of Fonzie may vary on your next stay.
