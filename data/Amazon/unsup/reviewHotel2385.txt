Don't stay here. This hotel overbooked and sold our reservation to someone else before the check-in period was over. We called and asked if we could check-in late, Customer Service said no, and that we had to be there before check-in was over to get the room. Our rehearsal dinner went late and we had people to drive home, so we knew we were most likely not going to make it in time. My then-fiance rushed to the hotel to check-in (and arrived prior to check-in time ending), and they had already given the room to someone else. You would think the Customer Service Rep. would have the insight to see if the room was still available before sending us on a wild goose chase, or agree to hold the room for us! After discovering that the room was given away, they refused to give us a refund because we didn't cancel 48 hours in advance!!!  Thankfully, we booked through Expedia and they thought what had occurred was ridiculous and processed the refund. I would give this hotel 0 stars if I could. This reservation was for our wedding, and the Customer Service Rep did not care. We were not pleased - we took a cab home and slept off our hangovers in our own bed.
