Location is really good, the rates are pretty okay, and the design of the room is nice. We got Executice Suite on the 17th floor (as Platinum member) and the room was really beautiful, the washroom was nice and very clean, with lots of items as shampoo, lotions, mouth wash, eye mask, ear plugs, water, etc. and free Wi-Fi access. 2 balconies, nice views to the Sears Toweer and highway (I dont mind). Many restaurants around (many of them Greek) and Starbucks right accross the street! One minus though - they only have walet parking, no regular. So its pretty complicated to get the card whenever you want... However, I am very happy with my decision to stay here. Update: 2 minuses: 1) The heating - it was really loud and blowing in your face all night long, I couldnt even hair the TV (in bedroom). It was also little broken so the wind from outside was blowing inside like crazy. 2) No fridge in the room. I guess I could have asked for it so its no big deal.
