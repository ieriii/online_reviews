Two stars may be a stretch. I live down the street, but my company was having a sales contest where you could stay at the hotel for two nights if you won. So, the room was a sauna and we had to sleep with the window open each night. It gets two starts b/c the front desk was nice enough to give me an upgrade with a killer view of the lake. I was excited to use the Reebok Gym. For those who are not gym rats, these are great gym with TVs built into bikes, treadmills, etc. they have it all. I went down around 6:30 and there was no water! I called and they said they would send it up. No biggie. I get on the exercise bike and there is only one that has straps. For those who bike, you know you need the straps, so I use the one with the straps and the TV does not work. I check the one next to it and the TV does work. I swap the straps. Start riding and there are only two channels. An hour into my work out and still no water. I called again and they said it would be right up. After 1.5 hours and no water I called it a day.  That night, I called the front desk to get a mini-bar key and they were so RUDE! I cannot believe how rude they were. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone until they get their act together!
