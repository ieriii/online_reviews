Stayed here for one night. Not a bad place but the rooms were a little outdated and it was in an isolated area. Since i'm from Chicago, I navigated the area pretty well but for first timers, it may have been a little challenge. It's VERY quiet after 8pm over there. Not far from the nightlife on Hubbard Street and decent staff(except for the one guy who gave me the wrong room and had an attitude). I got a $90 room from priceline but i DO NOT recommend paying $230 which is the regular price. There is a nice bar there with a view but we didn't go there. It's a no frills, decent hotel with slow free wi-fi. It's definitely not high-end. Also, parking is a cool $35 outdoors FYI.
