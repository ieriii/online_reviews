I can't say enough about this hotel. From the front desk staff to the bartender who made restaurant recommendations AND reservations for us to the way friendly (not to mention hilarious) gal who answers the phone at room service, I don't have a single complaint about this place.  Lovely room, comfy bed/linens, indoor pool & spa and they still have old-fashioned bed turn-down service each night (who does THAT anymore?). Within walking distance to almost anything. Everything else no more than a $10 cab ride away. Worth every penny!
