We had our wedding reception here in May 08 and from Day 1 of the planning (Feb 07), Sutton Place went above & beyond my expectations. Personnel: Paula, the catering manager, was amazing. She was willing to accommodate any suggestions I had and worked wonderfully with our vendors. She is so responsive, and truly cared about making the day fun and memorable for everyone. Other hotel staff was very friendly, without being fake (you know the type). Everyone we encountered, from the wait staff to the valet parking staff, was so courteous. Rooms: We had a penthouse suite (bi-level with fabulous city views) that was a great size and easily fit 10 girls plus hair stylists & a makeup artist getting ready pre-ceremony. We also had a hotel block here for guests & all were happy with their rooms (small touches like the fresh orchids in the bathroom went a long way!) Logistics: I love the set up of the space (2nd floor cocktail hour with a private bar and 3rd floor dinner/dancing). The unique shape of the rooms makes it interesting and the floor to ceiling windows offer a great view of the activity on the street.  Food: We received so many raves about our food! I honestly didn't get a chance to eat much of it (although at the tasting, everything was delicious). The portion sizes were very generous.
