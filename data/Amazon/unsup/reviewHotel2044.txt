This place did exceed my expectations. Good location. Its a huge and upscale hotel yet affordable. Its much more impressive than other Holiday Inns and added perk of lots of shops in the same building. Well-dressed people everywhere. The skyscraper city aerial view is indeed breathtaking! The food in the hotel is also impressive and has a good organic selection.
