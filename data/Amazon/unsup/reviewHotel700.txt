I had my wedding at the Courtyard Marriott and it was great. The Marriott hasn't done too many weddings so I was really afraid to put my trust in them, but the end result was amazing. Looking back on my photos just confirms it. My guests can't believe how great the food was. We had our ceremony and reception at the Courtyard, the reception was in Viand (the restaurant in the hotel), which is a perfect set up for a smaller wedding. There is a new events coordinator who came in at the tail end of the planning (mine left with barely any notice- Bride's worse nightmare) but she seems to really "get it" and will probably help build their portfolio of weddings. Michelle and Melissa in Sales were great. The hotel just renovated most, if not all of it's rooms and all of our guests loved it. They gave us great upgrades as well. The banquet captain, Alfredo definitely worked with us to make the day great which is the key thing to find in a venue. The food again...amazing! One of my guests when they RSVP'd wrote "best menu option ever".
