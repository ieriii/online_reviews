Fun hotel, lots of modern furniture, compact, bright, and comfortable. Having David Burke's Primehouse on the bottom floor, with its clubby bar and NY steakhouse feel is a plus. If your company is too cheap to spring for an offsite, try one here in one of their suites. Catering is good too! Haven't stayed here, just attended a meeting, so the four stars does not reflect the quality of the bed.
