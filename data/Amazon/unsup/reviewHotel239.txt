Holy neon colored walls! Five stars for the comfy beds and being a short distance from Lake Michigan and the Magnificent Mile. Three stars for those awful neon colored walls that are supposed to create a "breezy beach" theme (in the middle of Chicago?). Three stars also for the terrible room service food.
