I totally feel my colleagues' pain about the thin walls. Lucky for me, my experience wasn't too bad. And here's why. Ask for a corner room. When I made my reservations, I asked for my exact room I had during my last stay. I was on the 20-somethingth floor with great views and off to the corner--far from the elevator. Unfortch, they did me a solid during my last stay and gave me that room at our corporate rate (it's usually more for a corner room). I didn't have that option this time ... until I worked my charm, and the reservation specialist over the phone went ahead and gave me that corner room for the same rate. I love you Dana Hotel &amp; Spa. Nothing much changed from my last stay: it's still a challenge to get out of those marshmellow-ey, sleep-like-a-baby beds. The shower is heaven; bath products are spa-like ... Only change I noticed was the complimentary breakfast. It used to be laid out on the bar buffet-style, but now you have to go to the restaurant for a sit-down meal. You can still grab and go, but when you're in a hurry, it takes a bit longer. My only complaint is the loud AC. It rattles around when it shuts on and off ... and I do wish the rooms had a fans. When the air is on auto and blows for however long, the room is a nice crisp cold and lying under the covers in bliss. But as soon as it auto-powers off for a bit, the room gets HOT. A fan would keep that cool air circulating for the time being. Just a thought. Other than that, service is five stars; they have some of the friendliest doormen ever.
