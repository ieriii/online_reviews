So apparently Victor Hotel changes dramatically depending on the promoter. Went here on a different Sat and it was pretty empty. BUT, the DJ was still great! And the bartenders were again very friendly (especially if you go to the smaller bar behind the DJ). And the general manager, Mark, is super nice--took care of the problem I had with the RSVP thing. Thank you!! Now, how many nightclubs do you know that actually take care of their customers?
