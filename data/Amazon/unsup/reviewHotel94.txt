We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at the Carleton in May 2011. It was the first vendor we booked, and we have absolutely no regrets. Annie, the banquet manager, is organized, professional, and always quick to respond to any emails or questions. I found their policies regarding weddings much more flexible than other places. The hotel itself is beautiful and provides an entire section for your wedding, including a gorgeous bar area with sitting rooms for cocktail hour.  The ballroom is a smaller and more intimate than many hotel ballrooms which I preferred for our 100 person wedding. In addition, the prices and catering minimums are much more reasonable than any place I looked at in Chicago.  The food is catered by Barclays located in the hotel and was delicious, and we received many compliments on it and the hotel as a whole.
