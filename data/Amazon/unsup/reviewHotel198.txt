We recently booked a block of rooms for a wedding.  The only reason why I did not give them 5 stars is due to the front desk (horrendous) and security staff (unprofessional). Catering 5 stars. Valet and door men/bell men get 5 stars. Wedding block personnel 5 stars. Area of hotel 5 stars. Room 5 stars (was a large business suite). Housekeeping 5 stars.
