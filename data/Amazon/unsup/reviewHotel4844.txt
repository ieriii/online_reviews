Paid more than $200 per night in this hotel with high expectations and after I had heard so much about it in Yelp. One of the most disappointing stays I have had in such a talked about hotel. I had been told I was getting a room with two queen beds. When I checked in, I was told the room is not available so I was given a king sized bed in supposedly a renovated wing of the hotel. After getting into the room, I found out that it was renovated for sure - the room was still smelling heavily of paint. The bed was a king size roll out bed - yes, you got that right! A roll out bed for $200+ per night. There were no lights on the side of the bed so one had to get up everytime and go the the lights at the corner of the room to switch them on/off. All night, there was periodic slamming noise come out just outside my door after every 30 mins or so. I was too tired to find out and just wanted to get a night's rest. In the morning I figured out, it was the ice machine and all night due to some issue, there was a crashing noise coming from it. I would stay at a Marriott Courtyard anyday, at least I know what I would be getting for a much better rate.
