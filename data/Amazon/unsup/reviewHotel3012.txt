This is the standard against which I compare all the other Starwood hotels I stay at. I have been coming to this hotel since 2005, and have only high praise for the entire staff and the complete guest experience here. Some of the highlights: The valets that assist you on arrival (and greet you by name after the first time they hear it), and come find you when your car service arrives outside. Front Desk staff with exceptionally welcoming attitude, demeanor, and helpfulness. +1 for being able and willing to accommodate and change my rooms when I found loud air conditioners or neighbours with barking dogs upon arrival. +1 again for being able and willing to work with me when I needed to cut short my stay due to a hurricane bearing down on my home. A concierge desk that I can happily blame for helping me put on about 10 pounds due to extraordinary restaurants recommended to me during my stays. Most impressive was their willingness to research matters that they didn't know off the top of their heads, and get back to me shortly thereafter. Whatever/Whenever staff that actually respond to orders submitted via the iPhone app (other W Hotels please take note!). I usually "make a green choice", and whenever I've needed things in my room restocked, W/W are very much on top of their game. Great bartenders in the downstairs lounge. I usually only expect my local bar to know what to pour me when I walk in, but after two days, the Living Room had my orders at a glance. Good bar nibbles as well as proper meals on the premises. The high-floor views are unparalleled, but go to Whiskey Sky for the fireworks shows. I know part of it is SPG recognition (some years I'm Gold, some years I'm Plat), but all in all it seems to be the way they do business, and very few other hotels compare. I've strayed to other hotels in Chicago just to see what's out there, which has only served to remind me to come back "home" to the W Lakeshore.
