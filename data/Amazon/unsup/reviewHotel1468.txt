My stay at the Omni Chicago was fantastic during my 5 day 4 night stay in Chicago. The accomodations were all first class and the king size bed was super comfy. Also had a great view of the Hancock building from the room on the 20th floor. Location of hotel is very convinient off Michigan Avenue with a ton of stores to go out shopping and do a lot of sight seeing. Also before my stay here I enrolled in their Select Guest membership. With that I was able to get free Wi-Fi in my room, 2 complimentary beverages every morning, and free Chicago Tribune newspaper. Will stay here again if I'm ever in Chicago. Just had a wonderful time here.
