I stayed here on a stag weekend. The rooms were exceptional. The bar in the lobby was very nice, and the attached restaurant was excellent. The service was very friendly and the atmosphere was classy and social. Parking is kind of expensive, there hotel provided valet service. We used a garage across the street and used cabs to get anywhere we couldn't walk. There is plenty to walk to, so we didn't have to put much effort in.
