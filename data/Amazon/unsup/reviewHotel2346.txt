The service is wonderful here - the room looks like it could be 'freshened up', but they are renovating right now, so maybe that's next. The view is amazing - I'm looking out at the lake right now. Not only are they quick with service, they also followed up to be sure that the housekeeper I had requested came. However, room service menu both very pricey and pretty lame. Far too many good places to eat nearby - no need to waste your time/money inside.
