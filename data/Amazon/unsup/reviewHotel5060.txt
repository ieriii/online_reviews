I used to live in the city, now the burbs, but have to stay overnight in the city sometimes for business. I recently stayed in a standard king room at the James, at a rate of $170. Pros: - Great location for shopping and restaurants/food. You're within easy walking distance to the Oak Street area as well as regular Magnificent Mile shopping. Plus a short walk to the river. David Burke is the hotel restaurant, Grahamwich is around the corner, and across the street are Trader Joe's, Starbucks, and a gourmetish deli.- Overall decor is fresh, modern, clean.- Quiet rooms.- Friendly staff- Parking is expensive but if you go north just a couple of blocks on Rush there's $30/day parking (however it is not easy in/out).Cons:- At 3 pm my room wasn't ready and the staff person tried to upsell me another room at a higher rate. On the plus side, they took my number and called me when the room was ready.- The carpet in the room is odd: it has a higher pile than you see in most hotel rooms, and it's brown, so it appears to be dirty and dingy.- The bathroom was small but easy, modern and convenient. Kiehl's soaps and lotions. The bathroom lacked a fan (or else it was so oddly placed that it couldn't be found), which meant that there was a slightly damp or dank smell to the room. Not a huge deal by any means, but something I noticed.- This one is kind of weird but there's a huge, fluorescent light fixture directly above the bed, placed right above where one's head rests on the pillows. I thought this was so strange! It kind of made me paranoid that the fixture would fall on me. Not that it looked loose or anything. Just the placement - right over the head - was a little unnerving. Your own paranoia may vary.Finally, be aware that the hotel is not completely non-smoking; a few of the floors are for smokers. As a non-smoker, I did not detect the smell of smoke anywhere.Of course every hotel has its quirks and overall I'd definitely stay at the James again.
