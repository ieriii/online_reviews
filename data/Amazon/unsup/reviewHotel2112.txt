My husband booked spur of the moment on a Saturday to surprise me and our little boys. He had heard about the great landmark of a pool and got it for a decent price, for a Saturday night on Michigan Ave. Valet was $57/night.  Check in was efficient & the clerk friendly, however, she informed us that the pool was closed but that we were welcome to go across the street the the Marriott to use their pool. Seeing as this was the first weekend in March, thank goodness the Marriott had showers and provided shampoo and dryers! The room was a very basic, small hotel room with a small bathroom and a few wallpaper peel spots. Days Inn quality, which is fine if that is what you are expecting. (I don't expect this of ANY hotel on the Magnificent Mile, personally.) I won't stay there again.
