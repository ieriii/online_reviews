Me and my wife stayed here during our trip to Chitown in May. A brand-spanking-new place that I believe just opened late last year. Very lovely lobby area...a firepit that extends along one wall, comfy lounging couches, lots of luxury. The room was on the smaller side but very comfortable with a big bathroom and rather large shower. It is in a perfect location, a few minutes south of the Chicago River and a block from Grant/Millenium parks..so you have those attractions plus the Mag Mile and a slew of restaurants within walking distance. I would knock off half a star because room service was very poor as far as replacing coffee..they would give me two decafs instead of a regular, but I am too easy going of a guy to be that harsh and will have to round up to a five star, because I would def. stay here again. Plus, they have their own Andriod app that is actually really cool and benificial for checking airlines, reservations, getting taxi service, checking out there restaurant (which we went to for breakfast twice and was really good), etc. The manager seems very commited to providing the absolute best for the hotels guests as he seems to respond to a lot of comments on here and it is nice to see someone who cares. Great job with this wonderful hotel, see you again soon.
