Hotel is grand and VERY large. I thought the carpet/wallpaper in our room was a bit outdated and on our last day I found out they're starting to renovate. A worker showed us a 'completed' floor and it looked very nice. Beds are soft, tv has a great picture. Only thing is the sink area, at least in our room, was tiny. Had no extra room to lay out my makeup. But no big deal. We completely enjoyed our stay. My husband loved the sauna/hot tub up in the exercise/swimming area.
