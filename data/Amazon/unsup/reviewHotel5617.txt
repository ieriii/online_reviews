I had a very bad experience staying at Westin last week during my short trip to Chicago. The room I had(14th floor) was in dire need of updating!  The A/C wasn't working well and room was so stuffy. To make things worse the heavenly bed didn't work well for my back and neck. Coming to the bathroom ,the toilet flush was broken. The towels were so 'Downy' deprived. All in all, you receive far less for what you pay. P.S Don't presume the small bottle of water to be free it was $7.60 believe it or not!!! . CAUTION!!! Dont get carried away by the location(Downtown) and the hotel's lobby -All that shines is not gold!!! -
