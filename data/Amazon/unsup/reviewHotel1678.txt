I enjoy the Kimpton Hotel chain- I feel like I know what I am getting, and am rarely disappointed.  Thanks to Yelp - I knew in advance that my room would be teeny tiny- and in the Loop, I wasn't expecting much more. The room was fully functional for what it was. The decor was a little interesting - my husband joked that the TV stand/mini-bar looked like they gave a 2 year old a marker and let them go to town. Bathroom was super small, but had everything I needed and was actually the best decorated part of the room. Our bathroom sink had an extended counter where there was room for toiletries unlike some of the other reviewers rooms. We did not have a noise problem in our room whatsoever - I never heard a thing in the hallway or on the other side of the wall. Wi-Fi is free if you sign up for Kimpton In Touch membership. The lobby is fantastic, especially the hidden sitting room behind the fireplace wall. I enjoy the Kimpton's hour long wine reception btw 5 and 6. A perfect starter before heading out into the city for dinner. They also have a Wii in the lobby which is a great distraction for the younger travelers. There is both a restaurant and bar in the building as well. The elevator situation is less than ideal - long waits and overcrowded. I suppose this is to be expected in any tall building - What can you do? Location in the Loop is nice, and located not too far from access to the El and the subway. My husband gets the government rate - so if you book early enough, can't complain for $158 a night. It was also an anniversay trip, so the hotel sent a bottle of champagne up to our room free of charge. The only negative at this point - I made a local call from the hotel room - and got charged $1.50. Not the end of the world, but since when are there charges for local calls??
