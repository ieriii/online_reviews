I am a career event planner and have been planning and operating events for over 13 years. The InterContinental Hotel Chicago is one of my absolute favorite venues. I operated a very high end, high profile event for my (then) employer, and it was executed to perfection. My bosses and attendees were thrilled with the event. The location cannot be beat. This hotel is the only one in the city with a street level lobby on Michigan Ave. The service is impeccable, and the facilities are gorgeous. I would give a full five stars, but some of the rooms in the new tower are a bit on the small side. If at all possible, try to stay in the historic tower. OH! and an insider tip! Be sure to ask the concierge about the self guided ipod tour of the property... it's an open secret that you will love to take advantage of. Another tip, if you need to catch a cab to take you south of the river, cross the street before you grab one. It will save you a few bucks over getting it from the hotel cab stand.
