I'm very, very picky when it comes to staying at hotels. The James Hotel was a great pick! The rooms were very clean and the staff very efficient. I love the location of this hotel...it was literally 1 block off of Michigan Avenue. The hotel is surrounded by a Starbucks (great for morning coffee) and also a Trader Joes (perfect for snacks and waters to stock up hotel room). If you are looking for a modern hotel with a nice staff. ALso love the Kiehls products in the bathrooms.
