After reading some reviews about this hotel I was a bit apprehensive about staying here. But, I must say that the Palmer House was a pleasant surprise! Nice historic hotel with a great location near the loop and the Art Institute. The lobby is beautiful and retains a certain grandness that can't be replicated. Check in was smooth and the rooms and bathrooms were very clean. Housekeeping was quick and efficient...and Holy Margin Erosion Batman, FREE wifi. I would give this hotel four stars even if I had paid double of what I did. Looks like this hotel has deals going quite a bit through various travel sites. I found that booking directly with the hotel got me the discounted rate without prepaying the entire amount. When I return to Chicago I will certainly stay here again.
