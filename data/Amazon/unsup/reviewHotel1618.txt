I was able to book this hotel via smartphone while at the airport just before midnight. I got downtown and checked in without a glitch. I got a 38th floor room with and AMAZING view! The one downside was that my room literally surrounded the elevator bank. The room was nice, clean and comfortable. Room service was adequate (but I think they added $3 extra to the "service charge"). Great location. Great staff. Would stay here again.
