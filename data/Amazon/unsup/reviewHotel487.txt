Just returned from a family vacation in Chicago. I have two active teenagers and this hotel served us extremely well. Great location for a vacation, centrally located to most downtown activities. The staff was helpfull and responsive to our needs. Every employee seemed to enjoy thier job. Breakfast was decent in quality and great in quantity. Rooms were big and clean, great for a family. The fold-out couch was just ok for a teenager but would have been very uncomfortable for an adult. The tv's were difficult to operate. Lots of families and lots youth soccer teams enjoyed the hotel so the noise level was high. Not a place for a quite getaway but fit my needs of a family vacation.
