The hotel is billed as a four-star property. The room I stayed in last week did not have a fridge/mini-bar, no coffee maker or water heater of any sort, an old 23-ish inch CTR TV that could only muster a grainy image. Another great amenity was 7$/hr wifi in the lobby. Also, their famous brownie is not very exciting at all, skip it.
