I just stayed here for work in Chicago. I got a great ticket/room deal on Travelocity for this place, wound up paying about $90 a night which for a Chicago hotel room in the center of everything is a great rate. I had a lovely view of the river with glimpses of the lake, and the always shiny & interesting Chicago skyline. For my purposes this location was ideal, and enabled me to enjoy a bit of the city at lunch and after work, being so close to Millennium Park, the old Marshall Fields, Magnificent Mile, and the Art Institute. A comfortable hotel room with good coffee in room, a nice HDTV with LOTS of cable channels, not just sports & news which is what most hotels seem to offer. Very pleasant staff. My only complaint is that I was put in a handicapped room, which was fine but the bathroom was a "wet-room" without a tub, but just a shower closed off by a curtain and two drains in the floor. It took me a bit of time to get used to how to manage the water flow so everything in the room didn't get soaking wet. I'm sure they would have changed the room but I didn't realize it until the first morning and I was otherwise completely settled in at that point. I think they should tell you at check-in. I ate breakfast in the "bistro" one morning and had absolutely the most delicious poached eggs I've ever had. I wish I knew their secret!
