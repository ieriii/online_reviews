Stayed two nights. Great hotel! The only problem is that there is no easy access from the chicago metro. You have to walk a long way. Its best to get here from taxi. If you are flying in to OHare or Midway, take the train to any downtown location (like Adams street) and then cab to this hotel for like 12 bucks. also, there is nothing much to do near this hotel in walking distance...except the convention center is attached. The room service food was excellent. they were able to make me a delicious vegetarian meal almost at midnight (when i checked in). Paid almost 180$ per night. I had awesome views from my room!!
