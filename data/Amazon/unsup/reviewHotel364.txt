We were seeing a concert at the Auditorium Theater which right across the street. We paid roughly about 90 bucks for this room for one night, and we were very dissapointed. The pictures are very misleading. I read some of the previous reviews about being 'harsh' and 'you get what you paid for' etc...That's understandable with cosmetic issues and outdated upholstry and stuff. But this was no excuse why our TV had one blurry channel, our toilet was leaking the whole time so there was constantly a trail of water, both lights above both beds did not work (yes they were plugged in), our couch was covered in stains and hair, and our view was of a hideous run down building that looked like a murder scene out of 'Saw'. Oh and the beds--oh my God, those BEDS! SOOO uncomfortable!! I woke up feeling like I got beat up from the rock hard mattress, the pillows were about as comfortable as sleeping on a balled up paper towel (and are unusually small for hotel pillows, they looked like decorative throw pillows), and you may as well slept on the floor, it would have felt the same, but you would have had more room to stretch out. The beds are clearly not made for couples. It's an old building, we get it, but some of these things were unexcuseable. The whole hotel needs a serious facelift, and TV's that aren't from 1987 and still need to have the antennas adjusted to get a semi-clear channel.
