Total fan of this place....stayed here for a few days and the experience was quite lovely.....great ambience....really friendly staff... Plus this is right smack dab in Downtown Chicago.....you could literally walk to any destination if you chose to.....from Taste of Chicago to any dive bar.... Give this place a go....it was worth it =)
