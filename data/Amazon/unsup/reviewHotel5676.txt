I stayed here a few times while I was looking for a place. Very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms were always large and clean. (I think I was in a suite) Mine always had a desk that faced the large flat screen television, a couch and had tons of room. I think the location would be excellent for any out of town visitor as it is close to Miracle Mile and the train. I did not experience the bar or the restaurant so no comment.  There is a nice carryout place across the street on the corner. Having otherwise stayed at The James (way overrated) in Chicago I would choose the Talbott for any family in town, sensible couple or business person. There seems to be plenty of cool exciting places to see and be scene in Chicago and if your room does not need to be one of them stay here. The Talbott is a welcoming comfortable place to stay.
