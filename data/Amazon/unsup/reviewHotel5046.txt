If you like waiting, this hotel is for you. Due to so many rooms/people in the hotel, you will always wait for an elevator. Getting coffee or breakfast is like navigating a sidewalk in NYC. Good luck with trying to enjoy a beverage in the afternoon. Long line. Better take your smartphone... The hotel lost my dry cleaning and messed up my checkout/receipt. Good grief!
