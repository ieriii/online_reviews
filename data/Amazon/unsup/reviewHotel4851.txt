There is one positive attribute to this hotel: locationOur room was not dark or dingy, but it was tired and worn.If you want WiFi it'll cost you over $12/dayWe kept the Do Not Disturb sign in the door 24/7 and housekeeping came in our room one day. $250 was taken. A security report was filed as well as with the CPD. So far the hotel has not met with me to discuss this, they have ignored my calls/emails.Use the room safe....a lesson learned
