If you are looking for old world class and a fabulous entry to impress. The Palmer House is your go-to. I would say it is over-priced but if you are attending New Years or a musical/ball/galla event and are decked out this is probably the place to stay to complete the experience/moment. I love Miller's Pub which a great rib restaurant nearby with a fun atmosphere. Events at the Palmer House are great too. However, if you are looking for a spacious and modern hotel with all the amenities the Palmer House is not your go-to. Old World class and big city grandeur make this a blast from the past in a good way.
