Comfortable and friendly. The Knick, good people here. Highly recommend. I have stayed here over and over the last few years. I say, the staff recognizes you after a while, and it is a very nice feeling in a big town like Chicago. I used to stay at the Talbot previously, but it changed hands, and became very corporate, inflexible and expensive, so I start going to the Knick. Its a pretty cool old hotel. Once the "Playboy Club", it does the job, day in and day out, as a great mid-priced downtown stay. Spotlessly clean rooms, lovely amenities, newly remodeled... absolutely no downside. Right by the beach, and right by the El, actually, just across from the Drake. Oddly, though, the bar serves up a decent Old Fashioned (ask for Steve) compared to the wretched crap at -of all places- the Elysian, or the Peninsula, which are absolute crap. (trust me on this) Knick, you are my "go-to" spot in Chicago. Thanks for the always nice stay Knick! Adendum; did I mention they fill your ice bucket during turn-down service?  ...nice touch. Carry on.
