I attended a special event here and have to say that it was pretty nice. The lobby entrance was a little chaotic and not clean because of construction, but the conceirge staff directed me where to go for my event. The banquet and event floor is really nice and airy. The dark red and yellow carpet complements the rich wood lining the walls. The event that I attended took up all most of the ballroom.. The ballroom matches the hallway as well. In general, the facilities were nice. The lunch that they served us was pretty good I have to say. For being hotel conference food, it was good. They served chicken parm, ceasar salad, and steamed veggies. It was a tasty, light meal that was decent. For the cocktail reception, my first cocktail was pretty strong, but the second one was a little sweeter. Out of all of the food they served, the chocolate brownie was killer. It was a good mix of sweet and rich. Best hotel chocolate brownie that I've had. In general, the hotel banquet facilties were nice and clean. The food was pretty good too.
