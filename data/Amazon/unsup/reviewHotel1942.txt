This is a nightclub with guest rooms (or a small Vegas hotel without a casino). Once inside, you have no idea what time of day it is. Trance and ambient music flows through the public areas and the glowing light is minimal. At first it's cool but then it gets depressing. The staff is friendly and the amenities are useful but you pay quite the price for it.
