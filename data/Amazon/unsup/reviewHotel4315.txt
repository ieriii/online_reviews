The Palmer House is very beautiful and has an impressive lobby- so 1st impressions were great! The restaurant and bar in the lobby looked great, although we never ended up dining there. Location was fantastic, we walked everywhere and found great sites and restaurants. $250 a night was about right for the cost per night, much higher and it wouldn't be worth it. Our check in was great, the staff person was fantastic, offering us great food recommendations and was very friendly.  He offered us the option to upgrade to the executive tower/room. It was $45 more per night, it included a bigger room, that didn't look straight at another building, a DVD player, WiFi, and the executive lounge that offered free continental breakfast each day, non alcoholic beverages throughout the day and happy hour appetizers and snacks each night. We went for it and I think it was worth it. The room was comfortable, the lounge was great to pop into to grab a drink or snack. It would have been better if a drink or two was also included, but the bar was open from 3-11 each night, so it was nice to have access to that.  The executive floors have their own "express" elevators, a business center and some cozy couches/chairs with TV's. The only downside that I can mention is that they "concierge" was non responsive and even when we left a message on their line, we were NEVER called back. Really? That seemed strange. But we let it go. Also, the maids were not the greatest. They made the bed but failed to take our breakfast dishes (they just left them all on the tray), and they didn't change out our towels, instead, just folded them back up and replaced them (we could tell, because one of them had corn flakes on it from a spill we had earlier).
