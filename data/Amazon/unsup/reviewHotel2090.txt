Stayed here on business. Got a corner room with a fantastic view. Lots of space and a small fridge in the corner. The coffee maker was fine. The bathroom was a little old in appearance but everything worked fine. The room was likely dated but these things don't bother me if I can get a good night's sleep. Noise from below was at a minimum but this might be that I was facing the river. Location is great with the metro just outside the place. You can walk through the attached buildings and not go outside. Didn't try the bar but it did look like a nice view. The hotel was going through some renovation but that didn't seem to affect anything.  The staff was friendly and helped pick some places to eat that night.
