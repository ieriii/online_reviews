Stayed here for my first anniversary and loved it. You really can't beat the location. As other folks have noted, the Intercontinental is really TWO buildings - the historic tower, and the addition, or "new tower" (I'm using the term "new" loosely), which is just to the north. The main hotel entrance is in the new tower, and that's where you'll check in, visit the concierge, etc. We had a corner room in the new tower, and it was great. Not large, by any means, but clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated (one window also opened!). Everyone from the bellhop to the check-in counter staff were professional, helpful, and friendly. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was flaky, but not a big deal. That said, the real allure of the Intercontinental is the historic tower. It has charm and history in spades. The first several floors are simply amazing. Each floor is decorated and painted in a medieval or renaissance manner which is astounding in detail. There are several small fountains, murals, nooks and crannies to explore. It's an entirely different experience from the new tower, and I feel sorry for the folks who stay at the hotel and never see the original building. We didn't stop at the hotel bar, but we did check out Eno, which is the wine, cheese and chocolate bar on the ground floor of the historic tower. The place is pricey, but fun if you're feeling indulgent. There are separate reviews of Eno on Yelp as well. The only other drawback was the expensive parking, which was over fifty a night. Keep in mind that parking costs are not included if you're booking the hotel thru a third party travel website.
