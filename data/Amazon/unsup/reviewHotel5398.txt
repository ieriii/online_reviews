We just stayed at the Indigo...clean, convenient, but would never go back. Their reduced rate was still higher than other hotels in the neighborhood and not worth it. The rooms are very small and neither room we were offered had dressers for clothing, the first room did not even have a closet! The heating system & blowers were so loud and woke us almost hourly through the night; they did nothing to fix the situation and it was truly miserable. If you want food while there, they have it delivered from a mediocre restaurant across the street. Look elsewhere!
