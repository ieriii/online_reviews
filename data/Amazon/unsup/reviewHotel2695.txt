Stayed here with my 14-year old for a special night in the city. They upgraded us to an awesome loft suite on the top floor!!! So nice! Room was super modern and cool, he loved it. The only problem was that the heat could be turned off! We had to open the windows and put the ac on!!!! I should have called down and had them check on it, but was too tired...we muddled through. told mgmt about ii in the morning and they were very nice and apologetic, I should have called!!!
