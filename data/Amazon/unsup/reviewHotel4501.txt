For one of the most expensive hotels in The Loop, I was very dissatisfied with the way I was treated when I went to check in. The front desk said "hello." However, when he discovered that my reservation was through Priceline for a discounted rate, then the niceties ended. Immediately he starts to upsell my father and I to suite on the executive level for an extra $80/night with lots of free amenities. When we declined, he lowered the price to $50/night. Keep in mind I was already paying $125/night through Priceline. Knowing that my reservation was 2 persons, he stuck my Dad & I with a single person dorm room. The room itself was barely bigger than the bed and there were no closets. To add insult to injury, there were lots of normal sized 2 bed rooms that were empty. I even verified this with the cleaning staff on the floor. When I went back to the front desk and spoke to the same rude person that check us in and asked to speak with a manager. The manager would not speak to us, but conveyed to the front clerk that miraculously that there was a room with 2 beds available that was handicapped accessible. The rooms was normal sized, but the windows were on 3 floor with no view because there was some metal structure blocking any daylight from coming into the room. They also refused to change my room again even when said I give them a bad review online and they basically shrugged. If you are paying $350/night, they are nice. If you are paying a Priceline discount rate, they treat you like a second class citizen.
