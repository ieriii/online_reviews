Hotel with Style and Impeccable Service. I'm staying three nights here and it is one of the best hotel experiences I've had (even compared to Four Seasons & the Ritz). The hotel is a bit smaller than the chain hotels, but has oh so much more style and glamour! It blends hip and history all into one-- what a unique boutique hotel should be! The service is excellent, from the reservations team to the front desk, to the concierge, housekeeping, waitstaff- you name it. I'm not going to say that there haven't been minor mistakes- like I had to call twice to change my reservation, etc. But overall, the attitude is consistently caring, professional, and there is attention to detail everywhere. Main lobby and lounge area are very inviting- nice relaxing space to meet up with friends/colleagues or just surf the net on your laptop. The rooms are fresh, upbeat, modern, extremely clean, and very quiet. I was upgraded to a suite (even though I was paying a corporate rate-- nice!) It has a stylish sofa/hideaway bed with a work area and plasma TV. The bedroom has a large king bed (surprisingly comfortable- NOT hard or hollow like most hotel beds), a beautiful large floor length mirror, make up table, another plasma TV and a bathroom in floor-to-ceiling marble. Downtown Chicago hotels are not cheap- You may be able to get this between $150 - $209 if you book ahead and stay multiple nights and use corporate or AAA rates. This is definitely a great value- it really feels like a small luxury hotel without the big name.
