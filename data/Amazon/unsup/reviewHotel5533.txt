4 stars for this hotel and all its amenities, pool, ice cream & popscicle dispenser, queen size but full looking beds, wide window facing the street and other businesses across the street. The staff was helpful, continental breakfast offered scrambled eggs and hard boiled on some days they offered sausage patties and bacon, there do it yourself waffle machines were excellent, orange juice, milk, water, and punch all good located everyday before 9am on the second floor rooms are clean, wide glass to view the outside, advertised queens looked like full beds, bathroom fairly large with a walk in glass shower. as for neighbor no loud heckling or jumping from the floor above us like some other spots. definitely would stay here again if I were to come back food **** continental breakfast offered until 9am get there quick before food is gone service **** helpful staff, price $$ standard ambiance **** clean, neat, pool is a tad small so is the jacuzzi only fits 2 at a time pool on the other hand is heated and indoors excellent choice for this quaint hotel
