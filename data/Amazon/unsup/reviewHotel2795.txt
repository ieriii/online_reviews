A pretty good place for the family to stay. The hotel isn't as up to date as the other Embassy Suites near Navy Pier and wears it's age a bit. Room was typical Embassy Suites. Pool was okay. Great location, blocks to either River North or Michigan Avenue. Had a great view of the Tokyo Hotel though. Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment vs other locations I've been too. The staff wasn;t exactly friendly except the bell hop. Biggest gripe, as with all the entire chain, is that they do not offer free internet access-though plentry of networks to log into that were unsecured
