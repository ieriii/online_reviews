This was my home for the past 2 weeks. Luckily it was on my companies bill, because I almost went pee pee in my pants when I woke up and found the bill slipped in underneath the door. $2,124.36!!!!!!!! Ooochee mama... and that's with NO room service, a little dry cleaning, and watching 1 movie. WOW. The Holiday Inn itself is okay, I utilized the pool a little bit, and the view from my room was just AWESOME. (check out my photos!!!) It's connected to the Merchandise Mart (aka Chicago's World Trade Center) which is convenient since that's where my offices are. It's walking distance to just about EVERYTHING. I really did enjoy the area and the stay. As for the hotel itself, it's about average... but the location and view makes it a prime spot. One other useful bit of information. They have free wireless, but if the hotel is full... it got rather useless early evenings.
