Location, location, location and that's about it. If you want somewhere that is in the middle of chi-town, this hotel is excellent for that. I stay there just last week and it was nice that it was in the center of Chi-town but the hotel itself was a little run down. My facet in the sink & bathtub leaked and the walls were so thin that we could hear the neighbors whole conversation. It was crowd too. Parking is $48 per night and internet is $13 per night. Oh and don't use the mini-fridge. They'll charge you $25 for using it.
