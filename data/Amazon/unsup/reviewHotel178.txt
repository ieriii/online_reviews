Room Robbed!!! While my parents danced at my wedding, their room was being robbed. They came back to find a laptop, iPad and camera gone. My parents' keys were accounted for, and there was no sign of a "break in" which means whoever stole their electronics had their own key to my parents' room. The police and hotel are investigating and I hope that the hotel beefs up their security as a result. I am completely devestated that this robbery happened and tainted what should have been one of the happiest nights of mine and my parents lives. My parents have travelled the world extensively and have stayed in hundreds of hotels, they never expected this to happen at a Hilton in Chicago. I felt compelled to warn others to avoid having anyone else go through this experience.
