Located on Lakeshore drive and directly across the lake, the outdoor patio and rocking chairs have an awesome view. It's absolutely relaxing. Everything about the W is super chic. There are awesome bamboo chairs in the reception area. The bar/restaurant, Wave, has comfy chairs and a bigger area in the back where you can lounge comfortably. The drinks were super yummmmmy! The Wave-jitos was refreshing, but the bloody mary was my favorite - it was light and tasty. We also got some side dishes: broccolini and truffled risotto. It took a long time and I ended up scarfing down a lot of the garlic/cheese crackers. The room layout is a typical hotel room, but the small touches makes it special. I love bathrooms and this one especially! There's a window that looks directly into the rest of the room (yes, there are shades so if you have friends over, you can do your business in private) and a sliding door. The shower doesn't have a door and there's a rain type shower head. The Bliss fab six sits on the shelf along with a robe. There's a mini bar and safe and a LED TV. You have the option of a wake up call or using their wake-up CD in the alarm clock provided. My room was on the 31st floor, you have to slide your key in the elevator in order to go up and when we got to my floor, we noticed a telescope next to the window in the lobby. Heeheee.... peeping time! We checked out all the people in boats in the lake. Fun times! Lastly, the staff is super friendly and very helpful. Definitely a good hotel choice. OH and there's a Bliss spa in the lobby... what else can you ask for?
