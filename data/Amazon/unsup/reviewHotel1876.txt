Stayed here for a weekend using my points and was upgraded to a Fantastic suite, which was pretty spacious. The room and bathroom were clean and had plenty of space and I have only two complaints about the room: 1) The bathroom sink was really small. Everytime I tried to wash my face or something, I would end up splashing water all over myself and the sink. 2) The toilet was situated in THE most awkward space. It was tucked away in the corner of the bathroom and there was literally only 2 inches of space between the front of the toilet and the wall. So bizarre, considering that the room itself had this big open welcome area that was directly adjacent to the bathroom. Other than those relatively minor complaints, I enjoyed my stay very much. The hotel decor is really trendy and modern...and also very dim. It's not the type of hotel I would typically stay at, but it was definitely fun to spend a weekend here. The staff is helpful and pretty friendly for the most part. A good thing to note is that this location isn't particularly close to anything besides the Willis Tower and Millennium Park, meaning if you're in town and want to go out at night, the W Hotel - Lakeshore is a lot closer to a livelier nightlife. There are also not very many restaurants or other things to do around this location, but it is very close to two CTA stops.
