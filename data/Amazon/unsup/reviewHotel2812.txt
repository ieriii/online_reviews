Quite nice. We stayed for a night of Christmas lights on Michigan Ave and the thanksgiving parade. Someone forgot to clean a sink out so that was disturbing. Beds not great comfort wise..a little to soft for my taste. City view is nice but no way to block out the city view to sleep, a set of interior curtains would help here. Staff was rude at check in. Not mean, just not nice.
