As an out of towner, this was a lovely place to stay for a short trip. There were tons of pubs and restaurants within walking distance, not to mention the park. The room was clean, the amenities were about what you'd expect for a Hilton, and the beds were like clouds! Be careful though, the parking situation is pricey - $45 to do it yourself and almost $60 to valet per night. If you find the Hilton through a bargain website, make sure to add parking to your price.  *tip* if you DID happen to valet, don't pay to have the hotel hold on to your bags during that extra time after check out if you still want to see a little more of the city before you leave - the valet folks will bring your car around, put your bags in, and then park it again so you can explore baggage free.
