Sunday evening, one room, two adults, King size bed ON the positive - quiet and modern lobby - great location in the city for walking - Kiehls products Room for Improvement - very small room - the room was very musty and old smelling - the toilet seat had a cut out of it that scratched our legs - we were privy to the afternoon's vacuuming when we arrived (loud, cords all over the hall) - too much $$$ for what you get It is just "ok".
