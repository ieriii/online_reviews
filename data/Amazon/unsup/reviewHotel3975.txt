Great hotel and location. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are good sized. Unfortunately there is no fridge, so leftovers from restaurants is not really possible. Also the gym is pretty tiny, enough though it looks like they could have made the gym bigger if they wanted to. It has all the essentials, but space is tight for free weights. Besides that, everything was great. Especially the breakfast buffet. Absolutely incredible. It had an omelette section, fruit, pastries, salmon and cheeses, and a generic breakfast section (eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes). Service was excellent and to top it off, you can eat in an area surrounded by water with flat screens with ESPN. Overall, great stay and highly recommended!
