This hotel is in the middle of everything. One of my gfs and myself went to Chicago on a whim b/c of the Virgin Airlines Groupon and she found a $99 per night Groupon for this place. Great location, right across from the Trump building and on the river. It's right off of North Michigan, near the Magnificent Mile and between Grant Park (0.2 miles away!). It's close to the L line from O'Hare ($2.25 per trip every two hours) or you can walk everywhere. The corner bakery is several yards down from the hotel and there's a Walgreen's and 7-11 closeby. Bar downstairs, pretty flowers, nice desk people, complimentary internet and biz office for printing out boarding passes, nice waiting area, pleasant door staff. Would come back!
