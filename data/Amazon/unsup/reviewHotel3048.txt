Really my rating is between a 3 and 4. Once again, we got lucky, and booked this hotel on Priceline for $82. So for the price that we got it for, I should rate them 5 stars. However, if I had to pay $300 for this room, the same price at Swissotel, I would probably give it 2.5 or 3 stars. The design of the hotel is cool and contemporary (browns/lavendars/grays), very West Elm-ish. We asked for a room on a higher floor, which they accommodated, but the view was not of the lake or Navy Pier. Night view was nice because during the holidays, Chicago decorates streets with lights, but during the day, the view is of other people's condos and parking lot. We had 1 window instead of 5. I was most impressed with the shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and liquid facial soap from Bliss (famous brand for spa located in NY, Chicago and LA -- probably elsewhere too). Really liked the quality of shampoo and conditioner. But, we didn't get bar soap to wash hands (but they do have soap dish). I had to use facial liquid soap just to wash hands (slight inconvenience). No bathtub either (not that I wanted to take a bath or anything). Shower was nice, but Swissotel offered both. The bathroom shelf where Bliss products looked mildly dusty [ : \ ] The "W" experience was more about selling stuff. They had Bruce Mau book on spectators and a "W" book that sells brands and products. Cover was kind of cool (looks like fishnet), but book looked kind of old. I flipped through it anyways. I did like how they labelled the price for water ($6 for Fuji water). So if you are a hipster, this hotel might be for you, but I prefer to pay and extra $20 for Swissotel. This hotel experience was comparable to a knock-off of Andr Balazs' Standard Hotel chains, but not as hip. Maybe comparable to the newly renovated Flamingo Hotel in Vegas, but not as new and more expensive (and in different hue -- Flamingo: pink/red/fuchsia theme).
