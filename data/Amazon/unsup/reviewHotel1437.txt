Just recently returned from my three night stay here. We stayed in a King Suite on the 27 floor for around 480 a night. + The service from the staff was probably the best part of the stay at the Omni. The staff were extremely helpful and professional. The turn down service was great as well. The room was a generous size. Complimentary wifi if you sign up for the select guest program, connectivity was great. - Our bathroom was extremely small. Two people could not get ready at the same time and the only other mirror to use to get ready was outside of the bathroom and above the bar. - The carpets were stained and our pillow cases had stains on them. - The decor was outdated. Overall, the stay at the Omni was disappointing. Considering the price we paid we would've paid a little extra and indulged in a more modern and trendy hotel.
