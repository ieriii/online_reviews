I loved this hotel...when my niece and I walked in we didn't feel worthy enough to be here. We thought we would get kicked out and be told the Super 8 was down the street. It was super classy, chic, and sophisticated. From the door man, to the concierge, to the bellhop, to the desk clerk, everyone was super professional. The room was fantastic, the bedding awesome, the flat screen with cable, even better. I ended up getting a Groupon for some reason and received 4 glasses of complimentary wine at the hotel bar. That place was great. They serve you a little bowl of snack nut mixture while your laying on the couch watching all the guests walk by. Now the downers, renting movies at night $15 per movie (and not the dirty ones), wi-fi, you had to pay a fee per day. I think it was like $8, the room service cappuccinos, 2 for $16, uh hem...and the fee to park your car $50 per day, holy sh*t I say! But other than that I loved it. It was right on Michigan Ave and an easy walk to everything..yes I would come back :)
