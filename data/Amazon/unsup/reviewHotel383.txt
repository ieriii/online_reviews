No rooms at the inn, The Conrad that is. We have a Thursday night benefit (less glamorous than it sounds, it was at the FOP) and the dental show is in town...ugh. So I begin searching for the best deal in town.  Low and behold, here is the Hilton Garden Inn, inches from the Conrad. Great location, awesome service, clean rooms and a comfy bed. No Michigan Avenue views but nice views from our room. Definitely a great choice right in the mix of things. One negative, thin doors. Be aware if you are a light sleeper.
