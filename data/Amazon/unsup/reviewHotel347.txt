We got a room with a king size bed for $83 a night, great for college students and anyone else travelling on a budget. The bathroom was clean and updated, and the shower stays warm even though the water pressure is lower than I'm used to. The TV has a variety of channels, including HBO and MTV. What we loved was that the Harrison station (red line) is only a block away and close to many bus stops. There is even a Dunkin Donuts and Subway across the street, and a CVS and 7-Eleven nearby. Even though the track for several trains going into the loop is right out in front of the building, we were able to sleep through the night just fine. The only things that woke us up were people next door to us and outside our room due to the thin walls. Granted, we were right in front of the elevators. Other than that, we were very satisfied with how much we paid for the room.
