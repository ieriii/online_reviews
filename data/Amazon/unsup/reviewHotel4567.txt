Nice room on HHoners floor. Good size, comfortable bed and linens. Modern clean furniture.  Had a crappy old TV though with a static filled picture. Also, not a huge fan of the compact florescent lamps they use everywhere - give me one normal light bulb or halogen at the desk. But I guess they are trying to be 'green' or something. The food sucked, got a 14$USD cheeseburger that tasted like crap, drinks were pricey too - I think I paid 11 bucks (many times over) for a kettleone + tonic. Overall it was a nice place though - I am sure I will stay there again, I just won't eat there.
