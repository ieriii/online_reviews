Stay away from the massages. My husband and I booked a couples massage this weekend. The message therapist gave me a choice of a relaxing massage or deep tissue. I asked for the relaxing massage. The massage itself was a little uncomfortable at times, but over all felt pretty good. As suggested, I drank plenty of water after the massage. The following morning I woke up and was terribly sore. I was in pain all day and two days later, it is even worse. It is difficult for me to move my neck. I had no pain whatsoever before this massage and now I feel sore and horrible. I am so angry that this 60 minute masssage has caused me 2 days of pain. Worse, I feel very foolish for paying $125 to feel like this. I have gotten massages before and never felt like this!!!!
