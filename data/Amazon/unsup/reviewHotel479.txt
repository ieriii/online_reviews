I had a pretty darn good stay here over the course of two nights. The location is not quite as convenient as being directly in the loop but it is very close and near enough to many shops, restaurants, cafes and the lake. The value proposition here is two fold: firstly, the room, or should I say rooms, give you more of an apartment style set up than a typical hotel room. The key here is that because you have a living room and a kitchenette area separating your bedroom from the hallway, blocking out the vast majority of noise from passer-bys. My bed was huge and comfortable. I had a view of both the lake and the city. The second area they really stand out in is the extras: all you can eat breakfast, and a two hour complimentary happy hour in the evening at the bar. Combine this with a 24 hour fitness center, a pool and sauna and it is pretty difficult not to enjoy your stay here. The staff, especially in the dining area, were exceptionally friendly. As for the drawbacks. The carpet was ugly and the interiors themselves were drab and in need of an update. The fitness center could use an update too. The style of Embassy Suites means you have a view of the exterior of all the rooms all the way up to the top floor from the lobby. Because they all look exactly the same you get the feeling of looking up at an old tenement building in a former Soviet bloc country. The hotel is very, very kid friendly, which means it may not suit all business travelers. Summary: This Embassy Suites meets and exceeds expectations on every level except the aesthetic side, and even that was not so bad. I would definitely stay here again.
