The hotel is in a great location and offers a nice continental breakfast. The major drawback the hotel has is the noise from the "L" train station at West Belmont. I asked for a quiet room on the side away from the station some time in advance. When I checked in, the clerk had me on the noisy side closer to the station. He did move to what was ostensibly a quiet room, #208, but it turned out that the room was directly above a frozen yogurt shop. The shop played blaring music that penetrated into my room. When I called the front desk about it, they clearly knew the short comings of the room stating: "They'll close in about an hour." The hotel offered to move me, but I decided it wasn't worth the hassle. I toughed it out and eventually the shop closed and the music stopped. I discussed the issue of getting a quiet room with the front desk clerk upon check out. She informed me that though I might request a quiet room, there was no way they could guarantee one for me in advance. I emailed the hotel after having left with a summary of my concerns. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a prompt email from the general manager apologizing for my inconveniences, offering a credit as compensation, and requesting that I call her. I did call the GM, and she explained to me that the hotel had been working with the yogurt shop on noise issues. Further she said she would talk with her staff as to how to better accomodate guests wanting quiet rooms. Desired room types are not always available on the quiet side of the hotel. In closing, she requested that I call her personally to arrange any future stays at City Suites. Given the gracious and generous response of City Suites' management, I will definitely give the hotel another shot.
