Stayed here while attending the IRCE2012 conference. This as one of the 4 or 5 hotels recommended by the conference and also the most expensive. Probably b/c it's located in the middle of downtown - walking distance within about 15 Starbucks in a 1 mile area! Location: 5 stars Rooms: 2.5 stars (thin walls and doors - so I could hear clearly the conversations happening in the rooms around me). I paid $300 per night, but had a view of scaffolding into the brick walls of the building next door. Probably still better than my coworker whose room faced the train tracks. Layout: 3 stars - it's confusing - multiple buildings of various heights and my 8th floor room had 3 different elevator locations I could take. Decor: Rooms are very dated (dated, not classic mind you) - well maintained, but dated in decor and layout. Amenities: 3 stars. Good water pressure, bright / clean bathrooms. But you have to pay for use of the gym? That really sucks. Late check out will cost you extra!
