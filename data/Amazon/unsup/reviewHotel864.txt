Stayed here one night to be close to a family event. Great location, clean, really comfortable bed, large room with little living room area. We didn't use the TVs but they do need to upgrade them. Staff was pleasant if not overly enthusiastic. Gym was adequate, although if I'd gone in during early morning hours it probably wouldn't have been, with only 2 treadmills & a handful of other machines. For a first-time visit to Chicago this hotel would be great, since it's walking distance to what you want to see and the price, at least on http://hotels.com, was very good.
