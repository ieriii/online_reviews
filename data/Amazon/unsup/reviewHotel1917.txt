I definitely prefer having drinks at the W on lakeshore over this W, but I was in a suite here last night and this was a very impressive room. There were at least 25-30 people in this suite and while there wasn't a lot of room to move around it was still spacious. The trendy room was very elegant and had everything you could possibly need....however, I'm sure you pay plenty for all of it.
