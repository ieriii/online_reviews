The Westin River North. It's quite a jolly little cottage.  I love how any schmuck can just waltz into any hotel like he owns the joint and camp out, lounge or even have a bit of a rest stop in the loo.  My cousin was in town for a few days and staying at The Westin River North, so I cabbed over to meet her for a few drinks. This Westin is pretty swanky and posh. I walked in, acted like I owned the joint and started being The King. It's good to be The King. And it's free. The first thing I noticed upon entry was the smell of the place. I think they use Drakkar or some other mens' cologne for their mop water or just have guys walking around spritzing it into the air. I guess there are worse smells in the world. I just don't like the cheese ball smell of cologne. The free smells at Jimmy Johns are better. There is a very large and open lobby area with a bar, tables and couches. This was my destination. Victoria on tap? Yes, please. Thanks, cuz.  As for the lobby loo, it's only alright. I've seen some seriously fancy hotel loos (hello, Nomi and that palace in Cancun), but this one doesn't quite measure up. It's better than a Burger King bathroom though.  As for the rooms, they're nice. I could camp out for a few days in one. After a tour of a few River North joints, my cousin and I came back to the lobby bar and ordered a bacon and chorizo flat bread. Seriously, how can anyone resist ordering something containing these two ingredients. Delicious and recommended.  It's not a bad place to hang out for a few quiet drinks or even stay a night or two. Four stars.
