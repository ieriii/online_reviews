If you are a type A personality do not stay here. You will find things about this hotel that bother you and you can't figure out how to make it not bother you. I stayed for 4 nights on the 38 floor and went to a conference at the courtyard Marriott down the street. Pros: Wifi worked all over the hotel for me There is a Starbucks in the hotel (with limited hrs of 6 am to 8 pm) Great location on the strip, especially with all the new stores popping up on the street Room service was super nice and generous (although food sucked but since when has room service ever had good food?!) Morning concierge staff was nice and helpful Air conditioner worked GREAT on the hot nights I was there Huge workout room Cons: Room did not have the most pleasant smell (smelt like feet) Infrequent hot water availability (I wear a pliable splint that needs to be heated up and had to sleep one night without it) A wet pillow case was left in the room by cleaning service Check-in concierge was extremely rude Overall, the hotel was in an amazing spot! I won't lie, it was nice when I went shopping and had a quick stop in between. But in reality, I felt like I was at a super 8 or something of that caliber. There was one morning when I left (8am) and before my door even closed, a cleaning staff member jumped in to start cleaning the room. I understand you have a job to do but at least wait until the door is closed and use the room key! Warning, if you are not a big fan of noisy lobbies then stay clear of here. The hotel bar is in an atrium and all noise there is amplified. I didn't mind it but in the morning it was strange. If you have stayed with Marriott before, you might be disappointed. If you simply don't care about much in a hotel, stay here...you'll be fine and won't care about the same things us anal-type a personalities do!
