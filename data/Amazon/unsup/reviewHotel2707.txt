We had the pleasure of staying at The James on a recent trip to Chicago. Their service is unbelievably attentive without being smothering or pretentious. Since it was summer time, we were comfortably able to walk just about anywhere we wanted to go; their location is great. There are lots of restaurants and excellent shopping all in close proximity. There are so many small details that obviously someone has given a lot of thought to. The ambiance and the room amenities are hard to beat. It was almost like having a little place of our own in the City. The whole experience was just very, very comfortable and welcoming. Everyone at The James went out of their way to be helpful and service oriented. If you like boutique hotels and want to stay in the River North area during your Chicago visit, put The James at the top of your list.
