I came to Hotel with great expectation as it was highly regarded by certain websites. Location was the only positive thing about the Hotel. The service was poor from most of the staff but as i was travelling on my own i didn't really want to relocate as i found driving around the city a bit daunting. I stopped for 3 nights and after the 1st night i had my card credit stollen. All my arrangement details changed and i explained this to the staff. Although things now became complicated for some reason. I had to move rooms on an occasion and the rooms air conditioning [both] were noisy and disturbing. To top things work duties commenced in the early hours of my last night just outside my window.Bad service from valet company too had to wait an hour for my car when told 20 mins.
