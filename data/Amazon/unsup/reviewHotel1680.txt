I have never been there, but this is what many of my friends say: Like nothing you've experienced before. Sophisticated, lively accommodations with nine different styles and sizes. Allegro's 483 guestrooms are a modern chorus of color blended with the original Art Deco design. The Allegro is a contemporary American hotel in Chicago's downtown Loop district. Close to everything music, theatre, galleries, restaurants, tourism and nightlife. In the Midwest it's the most intriguing hotel. You'll find it's an experience worth repeating. Hotel Allegro offers thirty-one suites with Jacuzzi tubs and showers. On the top floor is a 900-square foot hospitality suite with sweeping views of Chicago's West Side. Hotel Allegro, like no other Chicago hotel; excitement, ambience and superior value. At Hotel Allegro... It's the special touches that make the difference.
