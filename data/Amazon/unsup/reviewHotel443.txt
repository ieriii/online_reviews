So a month later, the issue with my sister's missing ipod touch was finally resolved. It took more phone calls and emails over the ensuing weeks before anyone finally contacted me, which I still find annoying, but the manager claims that they did look into the issue and speak with the housekeeper, who of course denied everything. Whatever. All I know is they sent my sister a gift card to the apple store to replace her ipod touch so the issue is finally resolved, but I still would not stay there again.
