definitely kick ass location, lovely wine bar with a great menu, courteous/friendly staff. Agree with other reviewers on the beds being awesome and the view from the 33rd floor was excellent. Liked the bathroom with separate toilet/shower/bathtub areas and loved the extra-large bathtub and trademark bathrobe. Only drawbacks: Anthesthesiologists' convention in progress, and I wanted to have breakfast in bed on our last day, but the breakfast menu was severely limited.
