Why is it that hotels feel they can impress you with a monster lobby and then cram you into a tiny room? I don't know about you, but that just don't seem to add up. In fact, the Allegro doesn't just have one lobby - it has two. You walk in on the ground floor, with a very impressive staircase leading upwards to, wait for it, the real lobby! It's an elegant, gorgeous and spacious room that's well-decorated and filled with people. It actually took me a moment to find the check-in desk, as it was tucked away in the corner of the room. ...or maybe I just got distracted by the free wine bar. As I would later learn, there is a complimentary wine tasting everyday which includes red, white and house sangria. Oh baby. I checked into the hotel, was given my room key, headed upstairs and found - a tiny room. A bed, a TV tucked in the corner and just enough room for a desk and a night table. When the bathroom doors open, they almost touch the opposite wall. Everything felt cramped in the worst way possible. The room was also decorated with this 1970's wallpaper of a white background with brown circles and squares. I looked at it for a few minutes and actually felt reality start to slip away from me as I slowly began to loose my mind. Thanks Hotel Allegro for that experience. Plus, they had this funky rounded sink that splashed water on me every time I turned it on! Every time! Gah! There was free Internet, which was nice, but you had to first sign up for a really annoying honored guest program to get it. Somehow, I felt less than honored if I had to jump through hoops to get Internet - but that's just me. So, for the splendor and free wine of downstairs, I'm giving a 5, but for the room, I'm giving a 2 - and rounding down to about a 3. And that's what I have to say about that.
