We booked this place on Priceline by choosing a 4-plus star hotel. We stayed Sunday-Wednesday so it wasn't very busy, but of course we were given a room right across from the elevator since we bought it on discount. I really don't understand this way of thinking though - why not treat everyone the same so they keep coming back, discount or not? Anyway, the hotel isn't super fancy, but it was nice, clean and contemporary. When I got into bed, there was a big wet spot on the sheets, so we moved rooms to a handicap room, which was nice because it was bigger but the shower was too short and if we adjusted it, it would spray all over the bathroom.Our room was cleaned nicely everyday and the cosmetic products they supply are really nice, so it was definitely worth the priceline price, but I think I would have been a bit disappointed had I paid full price.Great location, nice neighbourhood, comfortable beds
