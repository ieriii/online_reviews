This hotel is like Joan Rivers. It looks okay on the outside, but everything inside is falling apart. The wallpaper in the hotel room was peeling off, the hot water handle "on" the sink in the bathroom fell off, and the shower faucet sprayed water so strong and aggressively it almost knocked me out of the shower a few times. The towels in the bathroom were cheap and overly linty. There was also no mini-fridge (which is always greatly needed) and the TV was a piece of junk (not a newer flat-screen as their web site indicated)--the reception was also horrific. Great location (despite filming at the time) and the staff were pleasant enough. I later noticed in the lobby cobwebs hanging from the crookedly positioned valances and lights. That should've been our first clue. Anyway, we also ate at the restaurant in the hotel. Very mediocre. There was even a piece of hair or thread on my hamburger bun. Gross.
