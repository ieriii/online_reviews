The Seneca is pleasant. Not outdamnstanding, but pleasant. My room was basically a one bedroom apartment. The bed was comfortable. The furnishings were okay. I would have given this place four stars, but for one thing. The bedroom window treatments consist of miniblinds and sheers. In the middle of the city, this means you will be bathed in city lights all night as you are trying to sleep. They need actual light-blocking draperies. Really. It's such a simple fix. Why don't they just install drapes?  If you don't need darkness to sleep, then this is a reasonably priced place to stay. Otherwise, you might be better off going elsewhere.
