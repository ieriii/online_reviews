Had a nice stay at the Sheraton. We booked this hotel last minute on priceline on the way in to Chicago and ended up with a great room overlooking the river. Perfect location for walking to Navy Pier, Mag Mile, Mil Park (bean), etc.  Only one small problem during the stay... the beds were WAY too soft. I usually like a nice soft bed but you sink so far in that you have to wiggle just to get up out of the creases!!  Otherwise it was a great hotel. I would def stay here again!
