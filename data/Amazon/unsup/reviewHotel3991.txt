Just checked in (we'll be here for four nights) and the staff has been excellent so far! Smooth check in (at noon none the less), comfy bed, got free internet with the word of the week and now we are getting ready to head to some museums!!  Looking forward to a great stay here in Chicago! I've stayed here before and it's always great!
