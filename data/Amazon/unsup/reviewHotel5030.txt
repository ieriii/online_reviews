I'm actually writing this for my wife. We stayed here so that I could go to a Notre Dame football game. My wife was pregnant and didn't feel well so she stayed at the hotel. Literally, she stayed in the room THE ENTIRE TIME. She absolutely loved this place. She did not want to leave. I finally convinced her to at least meet some friends for dinner one night so she came out for a couple hours for dinner, but that's it. I have to admit, the bed was extremely comfortable. I should probably have written a bad review since my wife chose the hotel over joining me at the football game - the whole reason we went to Chicago!
