I love this hotel. My fiance and I had our engagement party here and everyone loved the food and the atmosphere. The food is excellent and the service is great. The outdoor seating at Poor Phil's is lovely in the summer. We often ride our bikes here and sit outside for lunch when the weather is nice. We have stayed in their suites a couple of times and love their oversized jacuzzi tub.
