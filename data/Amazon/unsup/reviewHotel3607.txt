I was just here this past weekend with my husband visiting my sister. As we booked The Drake online via Orbitz, he asked me where I would like to stay and I jokingly said, "The Drake", assuming that it was expensive. He said, sure we can, it's only $84. In amazement, I said book it! I've always thought this place was too high class and out of our price range, but apparently not!  I'm an interiors and architecture lover, and being able to stay there and check out the place was fun for me. I definitely felt like I was living in the 20's and living the life of high class luxury. Roaming the hallways and peeking into the lounge and restaurant areas was definitely a time warp. I'd see people dancing to some jazzy tunes and dressed their finest delicately eating their dinner.  The details of the place was beautiful! There were so many beautiful fixtures throughout the hotel, and I'm sure I didn't even see the half of it. As for our room, we had a king size bed that was so very comfortable! I normally have a hard time sleeping at different locations, but here, there was no problem at all! There was a huge flat screen for your entertainment pleasure with a generous sized desk and mini bar all within reach. There was a book in the room that documented The Drake's history and it was really neat to see all the big names of the past that stayed here. I can see why kings and queens would stay here. There is so much decadence, charm and history to this place that it makes you want to check it out.  I would definitely stay here again! And I would love to try their restaurants here too!
