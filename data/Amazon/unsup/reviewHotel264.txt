Excellent price, great location (right next to John Hancock building), very nice and spacious room, free internet, and excellent service - this is the place to go if you don't want to go broke while staying in Chicago hotels. I recommend it to my friends who plan to stay downtown and will most definitely return any time I have business in the Loop.
