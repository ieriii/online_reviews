If a Ritz Carlton were to marry a Four Seasons (later in life) after they already established themselves (without children)... this is what you would get-- the Ritz Carlton - a Four Seasons Hotel. Of course the Ritz Carlton would be 20 years Four Seasons senior... however a happy marriage all the same. We experienced the contemporary feel and service of the Four Seasons with the layout and history of the Ritz Carlton. Rooms were more outdated than previous Four Seasons that I have stayed in, however moderately updated with details sprinkled around every corner. The indoor pool, sauna, and fitness center were standard for a Ritz Carlton, however the water aerobics class took up 3 of the 4 lanes in the morning. The ice service in the afternoon was thoughtfully timed, however the turn down service did not include chocolates waiting for us on our pillows... something I always look forward to. The location was ideal for shopping and restaurants (steps from the Magnificent Mile). We were centrally located to everything we tentatively had planned for our stay, but due to the humidity in the middle of summer -- we found ourselves enjoying the comforts of our hotel rather than walking around. When visiting Chicago in the future, I may stay here again...
