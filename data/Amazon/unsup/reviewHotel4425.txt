It was our second time staying at Palmer House and while we weren't as in love with it as we were the first time. Its still a great place to stay. The pros - in the Loop, right on the brown line, some rooms have two full bathrooms which is soooo nice, great staff and beautiful lobby. The cons - preeeetttty sure our room wasn't cleaned before we checked in (dirty towels, used dry cleaning bags on the closet floor, popcorn on the floor, etc). The rooms are kinda dated. The bathrooms are fine but the rooms themselves are just old with older fixtures and a tv I had probably in 1997. All that being said, I have to give it 4-stars as if we were going back to Chicago tomorrow, we'd pick to stay at the Palmer House again. Its just easy and in our price range.
