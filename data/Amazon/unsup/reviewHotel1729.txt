I really like the Kimpton hotel chain. When coming to Chicago, this is a perfect hotel for me. I like the unusual decorating, it's much better than the boring styles of most hotels. I have to admit I am a HUGE sucker for the free wine each night. Obviously, it isn't great wine, but it's free and a good way to start your night. The location was good for us. We didn't hear the El, like another reviewer mentioned. It wasn't right on the Mile, but that was fine. We didn't mind walking a bit. The conceirge was great about giving us restaurant recommendations that turned out to be winners.  Our room here was VERY small with a small bathroom as well. It was recently redone and everything was lovely. The bed was incredibly comfortable with high quality sheets and comfy duvets.  I haven't been back but will probably stay there when we return to Chicago.
