Located right on Lake Michigan with either great views of Navy Pier or the Chicago skyline, the rooms are modern and comfortable. Rainwater shower heads and Bliss spa products in the bathroom make this hotel feel like a lovely getaway although its located near the pier, river east, michigan ave, etc. Nice lobby bar with a good wine selection. Purrrrr....
