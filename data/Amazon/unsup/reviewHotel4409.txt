My last name is Palmer so this place had me from hello. You walk in and the old time flare hits you immediately. Honestly, everything inside is stunningly beautiful. The hotel is located in downtown Chicago with entrances on state street ( a nice shopping area), so you really just can't go wrong with it. There is a starbucks and convenience store inside, very nice bar, convention center, and impeccable rooms.  It's also one block down from DePaul University. My room had two double beds with a "lounge" space with two chairs and one ottoman. My only complaint about the room was the slightly crammed bathroom. I could have used an extra foot or two. This place is pricey, but definitely worth it. The staff were top notch and they catered to my every need.
