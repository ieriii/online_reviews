I always wanted to go to the Fairmont San Jose but it's silly to rent a room for a night when I can sleep on my tiny futon at home a few blocks away. Luckily, I was able to experience the Fairmont Chicago. Here's the breakdown: + AMAZING bell boys. So funny and personable. I felt like a guest, not a tourist. They made me feel very comfortable and welcome. + AWESOME VIEW at the 22 floor. I was able to see the tall buildings and snow fall from a higher elevation. It was epic. + GORGEOUS interior design. We had two beds and the pretty flower artworks on the wall matched the color theme of the room. +WHOA, COMFY ASS BED. I wish I had this at home! The pillows were coshy and the comforter was like a million marshmallows hugging my body. +HD CHANNELS, NO WAY! Plenty of choices and in high def no doubt. Not too shabby. +UBER FAST elevators. I hate those slow crackity ones that smell like old fart. Plus these had clean mirrors to double check your morning hair do. + PRETTY SCENTED lotions and soaps. It wasn't floral or manly. It was a neutral smell that was fresh and sweet. I brought some home...;) - SLOW shower. I'm into the waterfall types of shower because they're pretty to look at but damn, it took me a while to wash the day away. A++++
