If nothing else, this hotel was located in the PERFECT location for visiting/tourist-ing Chicago, and our river-view room had an amazing view. We got to the hotel, and we were actually able to check in about 4 hours before the 3pm check in time, which a huge positive! The space of the room was ok. Nothing special, definitely not boutique-like, as I was hoping it would be. The interior reminded me more of a Holiday Inn than of a hotel that...well, charges as much as this one does. The room size was perfect, even roomy I would say, for 2 adults, while the bathroom size was pretty standard. I know there are some complaints about the elevators, but we were on the 28th floor and had no problem at all. From the lobby, we actually didn't have to wait for one the whole time we were there, and anytime we needed one from our floor, we didn't wait longer than a minute. My biggest complaint was that every single night we stayed there (3 in total), I was woken up by noise in the hallway. Once from noisy elevator traffic and the other two times from a group of drunken girls yelling on the floor. As an NYC native, I have no problem sleeping through noise, and I actually brought/slept with earplugs in all nights, so I think this is really a testament to how thin the doors are. My only other big issue was that the bed was quite uncomfortable. I mean, when I'm traveling, I'm really paying for two things: a bed and good nights sleep; and this hotel couldn't meet either of those. Lucky for them, their location bumped up their rating from 1 star to 3. In all, if you can get a good deal on hotel71, then it might be worth the stay here. If you are a tourist like I was, it more than likely is worth the stay. If you end up having to pay full price, you may be disappointed. Oh, and if you do end up booking some nights here, make sure to request a room on one of the higher floors.
