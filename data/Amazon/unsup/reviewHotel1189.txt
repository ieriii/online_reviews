1. Room insanely cold. 2. Rude front desk phone service 3. Wake up call happened late and then repeated twice with other staff making the call (lack of coordination) 4. No place to charge phone or computer 5. Television on dresser beside bed instead of in front of bed. 6. You have to pay for internet The only upside: 1. Pretty quick cab ride to MDW in the early AM 2. They actually give you toothpaste in your room (you don't have to ask or buy).
