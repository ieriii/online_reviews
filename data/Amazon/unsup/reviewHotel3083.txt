I had the pleasure of staying here for 3 nights. Granted, it felt like a scene from "Night at the Roxbury" every time I stepped into one of the elevators. I even began paying homage to Katan and Ferrell by bobbing my head to the side to the beat any time I was alone inside. But this got tiring so I stopped. My 23rd floor room was perfect. The view of the lake was spectacular. I did experience the bar once when a friend came out to meet me for a drink. Again, a bit Roxburyish but whaddya gonna do. The bartender was friendly. The service throughout the hotel was impeccable. The 5 stars are fully deserved.
