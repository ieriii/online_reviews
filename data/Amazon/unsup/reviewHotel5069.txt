If I could I would give this place 10 stars. One word---AWESOME!!!!Absolutely no complaints. The best of the best I've experienced!! Some of their fine points:Great customer service, courteous staff, clean, oversized large and luxurious bath towels, bed was more comfortable than at home, house car available for taxi service to local areas.This place does not cut any corners.
