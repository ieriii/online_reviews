Was lucky enough to be put in a room w/ a fantastic view of the river and the Hancock Building. Nicely appointed room w/ a very comfy bed. Great location w/in walking distance of some stellar shopping, subway and Millenium Park. Was a bit shocked at the $52 per night parking for my $40 a day rental car. Good thing I had had some wine when I learned about it, the sticker shock just made me laugh!
