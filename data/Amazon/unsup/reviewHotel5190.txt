Great location on the river , perfct view of the river and the city. Bed (MEGA KING ) was one of the best I have sleeped on. If you want to stay downtown and have a great jump off point to the rest of the city ... this is it. Charles the door man was one of the best, he will provide you with a feeling that you are special and appreciated as a customer. Joe and Hope from Alaska
