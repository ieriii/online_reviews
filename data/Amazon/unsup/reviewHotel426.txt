The place was ok... room was huge and the bed was nice! The service was relative rude when we asked to check in earlier than 3 pm (we were there at 2 pm) and they said we had to wait... so we took a 1 hr car ride to come back for a 15 min waiting line for cheeking in... so we werent alone... The parking is free but no1 checks if people from the souring areas use it. We went for a late dinner downtown and went we got back we didnt have parking... I had to wait for 45 min for some random spot to open and I had to rush because they were other 3 cars looking for space!!!!! I went back took a shower watch a bit of TV and then look to the parking lot from the window and one of the cars was still waiting (~3am). We woke up early (I dont sleep much) and the parking lot was almost empty by 9 am.... I wasnt too happy about this... Otherwise, is cheaper than downtown...
