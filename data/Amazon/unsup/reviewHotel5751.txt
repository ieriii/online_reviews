i can't really comment on the rooms since i was just here for a graduation banquet...we had one of the conf rooms for the night. it was clean and nicely decorated. it started with an open bar that wasn't too shabby and the drinks were pretty good. the bartender was nice and patient as we tried to figure out what we would like. as for the food it was just ok, not anything to write home about. i thought the salad was a little small as it looked like they just spread it out over the plate so it would look like more than what it actually was...lol...i had the stuffed chicken breast (prosciutto, spinach, and cheese) and it was pretty good....i tried the risotto and the fish both of those were good too. the red velvet cake was just alright. overall it was good food added to a great night.
