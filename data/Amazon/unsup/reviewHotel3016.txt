I go back and forth between staying at this W and the W Chicago City Center and realized today I had never written a review. I am so sorry about that W Chicago Lakeshore - please forgive me...I was not trying to slight you by only reviewing your sister property. The W Chicago - Lakeshore is another great property. Service is tip top - and that is what is important. Check-in is always a breeze, everyone always offering to help. Going to the Bliss Spa is a great way to spend an afternoon. And having a drink in the Living Room people watching is a great activity. I ordered room service on a Saturday night from my iPhone using the W Hotel App, and the meals were delivered so fast I thought at first this must be an order for another room. (Use the W app - great to get things sent up to your room right away!) Like most W's, the hotel was a rehab project - i remember staying in this hotel when it was a Days Inn many moons ago. The "shutters" in the bathroom take some getting used to if you have not seen them previously, but it adds to the quirkiness that I love about this place. The beds are great to sleep in - great view of Lake Michigan - a great pool on the 8th floor - I could go on and on and on. It is a great location. But note folks - this is a W - make sure you do your homework and understand what a W hotel is like. Whimsical. Whatever. Whenever. This isn't a stuffy old traditional property - the Ws have a theme and attitude that I am guessing many of the other reviewers misunderstood...
