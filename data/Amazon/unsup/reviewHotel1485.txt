The Omni is geared toward business clientele. It's all meat and potatoes, and very squared away. Service is impeccable. I was particularly needy when I discovered that I had lost my driver's license immediately after checkout. Three staffers checked everything, including the cleaning people who by then had moved on from my room to another floor. One evening, we had martinis in the onsite resto 676, which proved sophisticated and fun. On the down side, I would have been happier if our suite was not looking directly into new construction, or if the check-in people had alerted us to this detail. But good for you, Omni, for finding great real estate right on the Miracle Mile. It was a confortable two day stay, but as a leisure traveller, I will venture out to another property when I get back to Chicago.
