This review is specifically for The Palm Court at the Drake Hotel. The cherubs around the fountain, the live entertainment and elegant "Powder Room" are just a few examples of how a classic, elegant old hotel continues its historic heritage. It seems that the Saturday night I was there is the ballroom/social dancing night. It was wonderful to see the women in their pretty floral dresses and heels, while the men were decked in their jackets. One gentleman brought his dancing shoes in a separate bag, changed from brown and black deck shoes into glossy black dress shoes. In an instant, he was up and out on the dance floor with a woman - where she came from, I haven't a clue - and was gliding his way around the floor.  It is a civilized evening. The songstress croons soulfully and the band plays silky, sensual music. Those who happen to stumble on this event are largely unaware of what is taking place and try to blend in with the regulars. They take a few brave chances with their dance steps, but soon realize they are neophytes. Perhaps this venue was one of the predecessors to the "So You Think You Can Dance" idea! The dancing moves were amazing! And the "Powder Room!" Unlike anything I've ever seen. I'm a 50-something from Hawaii and have traveled around the world, but I've not been in a magnificent, elegant ladies room such as this. The sign above the doorway actually says "Powder Room" - not "Women" or "Ladies" or anything else. Each stall is exquisitely decorated and there are even plush velveteen footstools to sit on. There is even a sink in each stall. Large handtowels and tissues are generously provided. I love having an after-dinner drink here. I enjoy people-watching and also use the tie to reflect on my day spent in Chicago.
