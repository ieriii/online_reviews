We treated ourselves (for a change) to a centrally located hotel in Chicago this past weekend. We chose the Courtyard Marriott because it is relatively affordable for Chicago and it's known brand name. They offered a military discount which was great. We paid for parking (pretty common in the big cities) and chose to self-park, which was entertaining as the garage was extremely tiny! The staff was very nice and helpful. The room was big and very clean and comfortable. We had a nice view as we were up pretty high. It wasn't noisy in the hotel and the beds were heavenly. Plus, they get an A+ for having curtains that actually close all the way over the windows! My only complaint was that there was no mini fridge, which was a bummer since we had a lot of leftovers we wanted to eat for lunch the next day. All in all, this was a great hotel and in a really perfect location. A short walk over to Rush, Navy Pier, the river, downtown, and the Red Line.
