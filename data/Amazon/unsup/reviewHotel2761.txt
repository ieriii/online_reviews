For my birthday we did a one-night getaway to downtown, which from the Far North Side is kind of an exotic locale I suppose, but we weren't there to see the sights, although the location seems pretty optimal for tourists. Anyway, this really was a fabulous hotel. It was quiet and sort of minimalist without seeming austere. The concierge had that kind of haughty politeness that only concierges at fancy hotels can rightly have. The bed was *amazingly* comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The European breakfast comprised very tasty baked goodies. And bonus points for being across the street from Trader Joe's. It's hard to imagine how you could really be disappointed booking here.
