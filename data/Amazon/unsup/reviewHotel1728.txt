I had an average experience at the Allegro Hotel. The staff was all very courteous, and you can expect good service. However, the carpet in my room was wet. Seems like they just deep cleaned it and didn't give it enough time or ventilation to dry. The decor is a little quirky - I felt a little like Alice in Wonderland, kind of bewildered by the bright colors and patterns, but some would call that character. Also, they have Aveda products in the rooms. Eee! It's been a few years since I've stayed there, so I don't know if they still stock the bathroom with Aveda stuff. But I loved it.
