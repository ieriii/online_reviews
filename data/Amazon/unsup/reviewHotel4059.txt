Location, location, location. It was my family's first time in Chicago and we were only going to be there for a few days. Since everything seemed to be located downtown we decided to stay at the Hyatt. What a great decision. EVERYTHING was within walking distance. Millennium Park was two blocks south, you're practically on the Magnificent Mile, about one mile SW was the Willis Tower (and a mile really isn't that far of a walk people), and lastly, you're only a block or two from the lakefront and river boat tours. The concierges were great. We arrived fairly late, around 1ish in the am, and they were very accommodating and friendly. She even asked if I wanted a room with a waterfront view with no extra charge, but unfortunately the rooms with direct view were all booked. She still gave me the best she could find and we were still able to see the river as we laid in our bed. My airline lost my son's carseat and lent me one for temporary use till ours was found. The concierges took care of switch when my son's carseat arrived with out a problem. My only complaint would be their parking. It cost $50 per night for their valet service (no private lot). I went online before our trip and found that parking at the Millennium Park's garage was drastically cheaper; $20 a night, so expect to pay a little or a few blocks walk if you have a vehicle. Other than that, absolutely no complaints. The Hyatt is a great choice.
