Loved this hotel! Stayed here with Vanessa N and Kristin C on our Chicago adventures. A chearming botique hotel, they feature Kiehl's bath products and turndown service twice a day. At the second turndown service, they even lay bathrobes on the bed and provide you with little cookies bked fresh from David Burke Primehouse downstairs. Lovely. it's also conveient - two blocks from the Red Line, close to Pizzaria Uno, Pizzaria Due and Petrillos. Trader joe's is directly across the street, if you don't want to spend the extra money on the room's bar/snack service. It's also a couple blocks away from the shopping on Michigan Ave.
