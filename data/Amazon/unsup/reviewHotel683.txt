Such an wonderful location to be staying while visiting Chicago. I had a room that faced Magnificent Mile and it was such a great view to see the architecture at eye level and then look down and people watch. The room was really spacious and open. Shopping is at your fingertips and there are so many good eats around that you need not travel far. If you are looking to venture out a bit, the train is really close or my favorite way to explore a city is just to walk around. Chicago is an extremely walkable city but if that's not your thing then their train system is pretty good too. This Marriott is kind of in the middle of everything with the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave right there you can pick a direction and just go and you'll get somewhere where you want to be. North, South, East, or West point and go. Location means a lot when picking a hotel and this is a great one. The concierge here is so friendly and even funny to boot. Great suggestions whether you give them something to go off of your tastes and likes or not. It's a really busy hotel whether it's late night, early morning, or the middle of the day and you can kind of get lost in the mix but the staff is pretty attentive so even though you may feel like it might happen... it probably won't *Overall You get what you pay for. This hotel is a bit on the expensive side but the staff is as excellent as the location so if you're willing to pay for that then you'll be happy here. Try to get a room on the Mag Mile side for the great view. Rating: 4
