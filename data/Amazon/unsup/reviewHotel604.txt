Parking: totally sucks! self-parking overnight is $45. The elevator/garage area is not very clean and is obvious that it's not been attended to.. No A/C, paint chipping, not a good look! Check-in: Staff was very pleasant and it was very easy and quick. Room: Very small! There is a small closet door that kept getting stuck- and with it stuck, you can't open the front door, so it was very frustrating. Room was clean overall, but bathroom can use some updating. Also, the A/C / heater unit is extremely loud.. I kept waking up through the night when it turned on. Lounge: there's no lounge here. Business center: You can take the stairs down to the business center from the lobby. OR you can take the elevator down, then take the stairs up to the business center. For someone traveling with a suitcase, I find it annoying that it's not on a floor where it has ready-elevator access on the same floor. Not to mention that it costs to use the computer and to print; and the printer-on software wasn't functioning. Breakfast: It's one of the better breakfasts I've had! Eggs, potatoes, AWESOME sausages, fresh fruit, coffee, the usual. But the quality is much better than many other hotel breakfast buffets. I will not likely stay here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid it either.
