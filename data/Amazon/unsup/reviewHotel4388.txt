The Palmer House really exceeded my expectations - it's one of the best hotels in Chicago I've stayed at.  The lobby exudes old-world elegance...it's very European. The staff was helpful, and the room was large and well decorated.  I was staying in Chicago on business, and the hotel's proximity to everything was excellent. There are a number of great restaurants nearby, and it's only two blocks from Millenium Park - where I was fortunate enough to catch a free outdoor Blues concert.
