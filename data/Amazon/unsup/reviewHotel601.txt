So I live just 12 miles North of here in Evanston, but decided to stay at a hotel off Magnificent Mile so I could be close to a conference a few blocks away. Pros: * Location (a few blocks from Ohio St. Beach; a few blocks from Michigan Ave.) * Relatively cheap for a brand name hotel close to Magnificent Mile * Good quality pillows * Cute (gimmick-y) chocolate chip cookie upon arrival Cons: * Unreliable elevators. At any given time, only 2 out of the 5 elevators will be functioning (sometimes only 1 at a time!). I've seen people waiting for 15+ minutes on the ground floor waiting for the elevator. I waited 5 minutes to catch the elevator from the 6th floor going down. This is unacceptable. * Spotty wi-fi. I paid to get wi-fi and not some trash that loses connectivity every few hours even though all my devices still say 'connected'. * Under-stocked hotel bar in lobby. It was my birthday and a colleague of mine wanted to buy me a drink--just about everything I wanted seemed out of reach given the supply here. TL;DR - Cheap given its location, but I wouldn't come back.
