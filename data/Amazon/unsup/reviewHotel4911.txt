My husband and I stayed here for our one year wedding anniversary. We had planned a small weekend getaway to downtown Chicago since we don't get into the city very often. I used my hotel points to book us one free night and had requested a lake view room, if available, through the hotel's online system.When we arrived, the front desk noted our request and set us up with a nice lake view room!!! It may have helped that we were staying on a Sunday night as I hear that wedding nights (Fridays & Saturdays) are quite busy. The view was beautiful - plenty of boats on the water and people at the beach, which is a short walk from the hotel.The room itself was very stately, but not stuffy. The bed was firm and the plethora of pillows were very comfortable. It was a romantic atmosphere but not overly so...we saw one or two kids/families in the lobby.Overall, while we thoroughly enjoyed our lake view room (it was free!) I would certainly consider staying at The Drake in the future...even without a comped room.
