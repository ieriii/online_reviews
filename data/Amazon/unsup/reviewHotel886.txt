I stayed here for a long weekend in May '10 last year. It is a beautiful, historic, boutique hotel and I was quite impressed when we first arrived. Another plus was the free wine in the lobby (which is absolutely beautiful and comfortable) every day between 4-6pm (I think). Also I thought the nightly rates were very reasonable for the wonderful location. Unfortunately, everyone can have different experiences in the same establishment, and if we had been in another room or another floor it could have been a 5 star experience. BUT, the toilet in our room exploded and flooded the ENTIRE hotel room while we were gone (Thank God) due to a plumbing issue in their building. It was disgusting. They moved us to another room (and most of our stuff thankfully stayed dry). To apologize to us they took our home address and promised to send a lovely basket or something. NEVER CAME. Also they didn't knock off any $$ for the stay. They gave us a certificate for one free drink at their bar, but that was it. Doesn't that seem like bad service? Our stuff got wet when a toilet exploded in their hotel room! I'm going back to Chicago this weekend (and go back very frequently), and I'm not planning on staying there again, but it was a pretty hotel in a great location.
