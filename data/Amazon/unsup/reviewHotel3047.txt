Why does Chicago get the most unhappening W lobby-bar? Most other W hotels nationwide you walk into and the lobby is a vibrant, cool, sexy, happening bar/lounge on weekend nights. This one just isn't. The music was really good, but the atmosphere was amiss. It closes around 1AM. We went upstairs to the bar/lounge and that was as unhappening and unexciting on a Friday night. They started shutdown mode at 1:30AM.
