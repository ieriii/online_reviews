This hotel is nice, Its got great, fun, style. The lobby is really nicely done. I like the way the room looked but the bathroom sink was tiny. The King size bed was perfect, so comfy in fact that I looked for the brand on the mattress for my own house. The staff were great too. I do have a major issue though and thats the fact that I remember being in this hotel in 1995 and I was BLOWN AWAY with the original Art Deco style of this building. Now, only the elevator doors remain. It breaks my heart to see the destruction of architectural heritage. I dont know if it was the Kimpton people or some other company that "remodeled" this place but I cant think of anything else when I walk through it.
