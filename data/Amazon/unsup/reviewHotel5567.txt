My boyfriend and I stayed here this weekend and really enjoyed it! We were in a junior suite which was a comfortable size and had two bathrooms. The view was beautiful. The room was clean, and nicely decorated. The bed was much better than most other hotels. The sheets felt clean and fresh, and the mattress and pillows were soft. The front desk staff was very accomodating.  One of the issues I had was with the elevator. It took forever to get to our floor and we ended up having to walk one time. The bathroom with the shower was small and awkwardly configured but it did not bother me much. Overall, we had a lovely experience and would stay here again!
