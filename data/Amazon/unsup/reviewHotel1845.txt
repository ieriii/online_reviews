DON'T. EVER. STAY. HERE. OK, I said it. I arrived at this hotel for business last week. From the beginning, customer service was terrible. The guy up front snickered that I didn't have any Starwood points. I asked if he could help, because all my points are being diverted to Delta. Sadly, no. My room was tiny, even by Chicago standards, the bathroom so cramped and crowded that my makeup fell into the toilet. The bed had a glowing light underneath that I couldn't figure out how to turn off. I had to sleep with the light on. The water got turned off one day into the trip. Hotel staff offered me a Fuji water to compensate for the fact that my co-worker and I could not flush our toilet, brush our teeth, or take a shower. Gee, thanks. We arrived back at the hotel at 6pm to find the water still turned off. Front desk arranged for a transfer to W Lakeshore but was not courteous at all. The woman I spoke to refused to let me speak to her manager. We moved to another hotel and I complained to Starwood corporate. The hotel compensated me some points, but the whole experience was way horrendous.
