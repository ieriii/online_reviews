I went to my friends birthday which was celebrated in this hotel. We were at the upper half of the building and the sights overlooking is just breathtaking. The amenities are beyond my expectations and the staff are friendly and very polite.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wish to have a special party for any occasion.
