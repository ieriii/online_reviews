Ian!! Congrats you did it again. Total home run, great space, great ambiance and total class act. From the bar to the pump room to the overall atmosphere...favorite new hotel--period. Couple of observations: reminds me of the Gramercy but in white and a little more homey.... . The rooms while awesome (caveat---I was in a suite), do have some of the original features of the Ambassador so the bathrooms are a tad small and there are a few other quirky nuisances. But a small price to pay for a bad ass experience.
