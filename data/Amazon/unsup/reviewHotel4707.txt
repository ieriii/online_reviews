My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night. The door man was helpful and attentive, although the front desk was busy, they too, were attentive. The bartender was lacking personality, but the lounge area was aesthetically pretty awesome, and the drink prices were more than affordable, (especially since we had just walked out of a bar with a $10 cover charge and $15 drinks). Honestly, from a monetary standpoint it was probably cheaper (and more relaxing!) to drink in the hotel lounge all night versus go out to the bars. Yes, the room is small, but it was clean! The "complimentary" bottled water in the room actually turns out to be a $10 ($5 each) charge on your credit card upon check out. I also had a $45 charge for valet parking, when indeed I self-parked and paid cash. I called the front desk to report the issue, though, and they immediately refunded me. I love the absence of bureaucracy at Boutique hotels like this one. I would stay here again. Oh! And another plus - no charge for the fitness room or for internet usage!
