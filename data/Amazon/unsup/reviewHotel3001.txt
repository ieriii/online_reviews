Love this hotel!!!! Would love it more if I was in my twenties, lol, but I can pretend. The rooms are absolutely amazing and the views are completely unobstructed overlooking the lake! Dress cool tho when checking in, no pjs or sweats, you will look like an idiot, and that is just one of the many reasons I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!
