****FOR EVENT AND MEETING PLANNERS**** We chose the Dana Hotel and Spa for a business meeting last month and it went off without a hitch. If you are looking for a place that will help you plan a flawless event, please choose the Dana. Sandi and Maureen in their events office are fabulous to work with and are punctual, flexible, and creative. The food was very good and we recieved ample compliments from our attendees.
