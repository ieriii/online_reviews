Shockingly bad service. I booked one of my salesmen for a three night conference here. I booked over the phone for him, and I have the gentlemen at the front desk the salesmen's contact information should the need arise. He briefly told me the times of check-in, but I didn't note them as being anything unusual. Come to find out, check-in here is between the hours of 3pm and 6pm EXPRESSLY. If you don't check in during those times, they lock the doors and their system cancels your reservation. My salesman's flight didn't even get in until 8pm, so color him surprised when he shows up to a darkened porch and a locked door. Jorge, the manager on-site came to open the door after a certain amount of noise was made and let him in begrudgingly. He told him he was late and that they assumed he wasn't coming. They couldn't call to check? To make matters worse, on my salesmans 3rd day, he returned to the hotel to find Jorge waiting for him with bad news. Because he checked in late and his reservation was cancelled, they had double-booked the room. The couple waiting to check-in to his room was currently waiting in the bar. He was given 20 minutes to pack and get out. When he asked Jorge to call him a cab, Jorge told him that cabs don't come to that area and that he would have to walk four blocks to catch a cab or a bus. HONESTLY! My salesman is a better person than I as he handled it with grace, but I am furious over the way he was treated and how the situation was handled. It's a shame too, because the space is gorgeous and we would probably use it again if it weren't for the ludicrous business habits of the staff. Stay away unless you plan to play by their crazy rules and pay their crazy prices.
