What happened to this place? Victor Hotel has gone the way of so many other clubs. Started off hot, now desperate to make a buck. First, when you arrive, if you don't want to valet your car, then don't drive up to the club on Sangamon. It's a narrow street in the warehouse district with delivery trucks on all sides, making it nearly impossible to turn around. Secondly, after security pats the guys down, you'll be paying a $20 charge. I came here with a birthday party, and they "had no record" of the party, yet the other people who got there before me didn't pay. Hmm. Victor Hotel conveniently has an ATM. This machine also charges you $4.50 per transaction when you withdraw the $20 needed for cover. Seriously, like other reviewers said, this is Chicago. If I am going to a club that makes you wait in line and charges $20, it better be amazing. Instead, $20 gets you what looks like a garage with strobe lights. The sound system is pretty poor here as well. Stand too far back, and you won't hear much. Stand moderately close to the DJ booth and your ears will ring for two days.
