So... I had an interesting experience with Hyatt as a conference attendee.  I had this whole long thing posted, telling the story, but... too long! Shortened version - they screwed up our reservations, tried to blame me for the mistake when it was blatantly obvious they had screwed up, threatened to write corporate, and low and behold, the next day, they must have been waiting for me to enter the room, because within 10 min, my roommate and I hear a knock at the door. A complimentary water and fruit service for me. I guess this was their way of apologizing.  So. Would I choose to stay here again? The rooms were ok, the iPod radio dock was nice. The service sucked, but at least they tried in a small way to make up for their crappy service that night. No, I probably wouldn't opt for the hotel, but if I have to attend a conference there again, I guess I'll have to stay there for the convenience factor! They're lucky they sent us the water and gave the discount, otherwise they'd be looking at 1-2 stars! But I guess that was the point! :)
