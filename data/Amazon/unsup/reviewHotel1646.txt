Honestly, I usually like Kimpton's. This one has the worst Feng Shui (why are there mirrors across from the bed? Just creepy!). The walls might as well be made of cardboard because you can hear EVERYTHING happening next door. Pros: Hotel staff is nice, except the lady at the free wine hour who carded me. Seriously? And of course I didn't have my ID because I'm staying at the hotel. Not going all the way back up then down just for your tiny glass of wine. Other pros... clean, bed is relatively comfortable, AC, convenient location... iPod dock. Free WiFi if you register with Kimpton online. Cons: See above plus tiny rooms, even tinier closet, noisy, noisy, noisy!!!!!!!! Decor = not my style. And oh, THEY CARDED ME at the free wine hour which was full of business professionals. I was dressed like a business professional, am pushing 30, and that's just kind of embarrassing to be honest. But again, the worst part is that the walls are made of cardboard and you can hear everything happening everywhere. Bring ear plugs.
