This place is the shizzzz. Too bad they don't accept Westin points. Spacious, nice soothing decor, friendly staff and just around the corner from Le Passage, where my company hosts their annual customer reception. Aside from their top service, you get a chocolate on your pillow every night! Now that's SWEET.
