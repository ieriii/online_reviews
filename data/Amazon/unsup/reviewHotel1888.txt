We stayed at the W the weekend just before Christmas. I went with a bit of trepidation, given that I am not a particular fan of the W on Lex in NYC. A major discount on the regular rate was the motivation to give it a try. When you walk in the front door, you could swear you are walking into a mini versus of the NYC Lex W with Whiskey Blue on the left and a popular after hours lounge the right. However, after spending a few more minutes soaking in the atmosphere you'll notice the vaulted ceiling, tile, and marble accents that give it a warmer, more dignified feel. The elevators will almost knock you over with their 3-d holographic-like walls. Expecting the usual W-esque room, we were amazed to find out they upgraded us to a large junior suite. It looked like the head designer from Pottery Barn just redid the place. Very impressive. What was not impressive is that they want $15 to connect to the net for the day (and no Boingo), though the lobby wireless was free. The staff was especially pleasant. Though it was -30 windchill, the door man stood outside for almost 15 minutes trying to find us a cab. He then convinced the Acura driver to drive us to Midway for no charge. They have a joint promotion with Acura to drive you anywhere within 5 miles for free to show off their cars. We wish we knew this earlier. The only problem is the location if you are going for a weekend. It is only one block from the Quincy L stop, which is nice if you are coming from Midway. But you have to transfer (or jaunt up to Clark and Lake) if you plan to use the trains for anywhere else. It is not a bad walk to State Street to Marshall Fields (ugh...."Macys"....) but a bear to get up to Mag Mile if it is zero like it was the weekend we went. Cabs are the order of the day, but not easy to find in the financial district on the weekend. Very few decent restaurants in the area. Overall, we were happy with our stay, but the location leaves a lot to be desired.
