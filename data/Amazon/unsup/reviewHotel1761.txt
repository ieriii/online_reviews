I am a frequent guest of Kimpton Hotels and an "In Touch" member. I have stayed at the Allegro once before, well over a year ago and prior to the massive renovation. The good: - The location is touristy, but convenient. The El is very close by, as are multiple bars and restaurants. - The renovation is definitely a huge improvement. The palette is pleasing and the rooms are much more restful. - The beds are comfortable, as expected at a Kimpton hotel. The bad: - Leave your toiletries at home, because there is absolutely no space to place them in the bathroom. Literally...zero. - The closets are extremely bizarre. They removed the main rack to hang your clothing and replaced it with two face-out racks...you can't see your clothes all at once, as you are forced to stack them on top of each other. Also, you'll find tacky apparel the hotel is trying to get you to purchase, taking up the majority of hangers. - The doormen (with the exception of one, Fidel) are surly and I found this quite annoying. I was told which cab to get into, as though I'd never hailed a cab before (I am from NYC). While approaching the hotel on several occasions, the doormen would yell at me what door to use (there are three, all of which work...) yet not once did they bother to open it for me. Where is the service? - While check-in was pleasant, the woman who checked me out was both rude and abrupt. Not only was I not asked how my stay was, but I was hastily shoved a receipt (no envelope, no review of charges) and shoved aside for another guest who was checking in...at noon. I travel very frequently for business and pleasure and normally have the Kimpton group on the very top of my hotel list. After this horrible experience, I will likely reconsider my loyalty and may make a beeline back to the Starwood group.
