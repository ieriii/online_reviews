Love. love, LOVE this hotel! Attentive staff, beautiful decor, incredibly comfortable beds. All at a very affordable price, especially for this area of the city. The room was beautiful (we had the Mansion Room with the dark wood), shower pressure, which usually stinks at most hotels, was fantastic. I look forward to returning very soon!
