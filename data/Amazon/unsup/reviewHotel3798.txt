Nice hotel, very modern. Located conviently downtown with walking access to the theater district and Michigan Avenue. Wall to wall windows offer a spectacular view of the city. A little pricey for my budget but worth it once or twice. Parking is pricey - $41 after taxes. Overall a nice place to stay.
