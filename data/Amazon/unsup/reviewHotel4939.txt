I went to this hotel again for New Years! How awesome was that decision! Fireworks could be seen from the comfort of a bar stool at the sky lounge. Sipping (at least I was sipping my partners in crime were slamming) cocktails and being waited on hand and foot. We did the Tech room this time as my boyfriend had to work ...a little...how boring is that? He worked I shopped. Everything close by. Rooms are really nice and the beds are most amazing. I think I snored I slept so hard. Food in the pub shouldn't be missed. Yeah Yeah..chicago dogs..chicago pizza..blah blah blah. This place as the best dang fish and chips you'd ever have. This hotel shouldn't be missed..it's a great deal...in a fantastic location and really rockin' people. Ciao!
