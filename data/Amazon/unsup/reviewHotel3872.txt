Wonderfully decorated, big comfy beds and friendly staff for the most part. The doormen were super helpful and friendly as was the female reception staff that worked afternoons. The male reception staff the next morning were opposite. Rude and sneered at us rather than a nice "hello" which were given in abundance the evening before. Maids were friendly as was the wait staff in the restaurant which had good breakfast and big portions. Incredibly comfortable stay and great views.
