A post scriptum to my earlier less than positive review. A few days after returning home the Hotel Lincoln sent me a survey to fill out about my stay. I again gave less than stellar comments. Imagine my very pleasant surprise when a day or so later I was contacted by a member of the staff, who 1) apologized for my inconvenience, 2) told me that one of my suggestions had already been acted upon, and they were looking into my comments about the room, and 3) and informed me that he was sending me a certificate for a complimentary night's stay at the hotel. I am impressed with the personal follow-up and attention. This is more than I would have ever expected, and have not experienced this type of courteous response from any other hotel I have stayed at. Kudos to the Hotel Lincoln for going above and beyond the call of duty in trying to make the customer happy. I am looking forward to returning to Chicago in the near future.
