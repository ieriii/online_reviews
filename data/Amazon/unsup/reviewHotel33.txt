Realy small hotel but it's in a great location in downtown chicago. The rooms itself are pretty well maintained. The lobby is fairly nice. Elevators are small, I don't know if that's the theme they are going for, cozy.... The price isn't that expensive considering you are in downtown chicago. A decent room with an okay view ran me up about a little over a hundred a night, though It's all about location location location. I almost never saw the staff other than check in and check out, maybe that's a good thing... I'd come back again if I'm ever in chicago.
