They just renovated, so the rooms are pretty swanky, particularly the bathrooms. I love the roomy showers. The decor is very Westin-esque and I'm a fan of their free shampoo and conditioner (the brand is Gilchrist and Soames). The restaurant downstairs leaves much to be desired. The decor is horrendous and the food was so-so (I had the shrimp scampi farfalle).  If you want a decent drink and good company (particularly after you've left your laptop in a cab, but I digress), go to the bar. I had a manhattan and the knickerburger (verdict? delicious and fairly priced) and enjoyed good conversation with David, the bartender. Overall, the stay has been good - but spend your money somewhere else on food.
