Chicago has many lovely smaller old-fashioned hotels of the boutique variety. The Whitehall may just be the classiest of the bunch. It can barely be categorized as a smaller hotel, but with slightly over 200 rooms it definitely is no behemoth convention hotel. The building is a charmer, and it has a great location just off from Michigan Avenue. The rooms are plush and so are the bathrobes.
