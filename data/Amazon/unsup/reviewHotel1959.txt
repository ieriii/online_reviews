Kind of crazy. This place is super swank in the lobby. Sort of West Elmy with a plum velvet twist. Light projections, art, velvet furniture, black lobby. 2 door guys, 1 concierge, 2 desk people, 1 very tall blonde and removed store clerk. Some very cute, kitschy and extremely specific items in the hotel shoppe. The hotel's restaurants and bars swing right off the lobby behind tall black walls. Initial impression was grande. The stay. The stay was super plush with a cushy king, proper amount of pillows for 2 plus a nice body pillow xtra. Toiletries included Bliss travel pack (found at Sephora for $25 a pop). Very nice. CS/Modern Luxury and Wired magazine in the room, nice details. Overall, the stay was comfy and friendly. We stayed in the Fabulous room. Service. Service was ok. It didn't seem to be very coordinated. I was supposed to have champagne and strawberries delivered for my birthday morning. Didn't happen and we got tired of waiting. They tried to reschedule for the evening and that really wasn't as seamless as you'd think, either. The first night of our stay, we requested extra hangers. We had to ask repeatedly and then we finally got them. Like a DOZEN of them, on our last day. Thanks. The Whiskey Blue was a nice hangout and you can't really beat the location as far as being able to walk to many of the touristy attractions and CTA. The hotel did seem to be a magnet for underage teens which was kind of odd to me. For some reason, I don't really notice teens in VA unless it's in Tysons Corner, where they persist in droves. In Chicago, it seems like it is teen CENTRAL!
