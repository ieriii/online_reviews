We ended up choosing this hotel without research because the price was unbelievable. We could not have been more delighted. The hotel makes you feel like you've stepped into the 1920s. The room was really nice and comfortable and made us wish we could stay more than two nights. The hallways were really funny to try to navigate and it was quite an adventure to get to your room if you are staying far from the elevator. The hallways are endless. When I return to Chicago, which I definitely want to in the near future, I would absolutely stay here again.
