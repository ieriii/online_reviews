I enjoyed my 3 night stay here. The only thing I didn't like about my room was that it didn't have a microwave or a fridge. I mean they provided us with chilled alcohol and water in this mini cooler looking thing and also candies and snacks (none of these we touched). lol Also, for some odd reason...i noticed that hilton hotels do not have any fans in the restrooms. lol Other than that, I loved their beds and their cookies. I asked for their delicious cookies when I checked in, walked out of the hotel, came in the hotel, and checked out of the hotel. lol It's that good!  We stayed on the 18th floor so we got a nice view of the swimming pool and downtown. This location is great, close to the navy pier and you can just walk to all the shops.
