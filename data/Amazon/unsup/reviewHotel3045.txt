I took my wife here over Memorial Day weekend for a little mini vacation. I've stayed here before and my wife and I have even gotten spa treatments at Bliss. This time it was all about dining in and enjoying some movies.The rooms are very clean and nice. The movie selections were immense so we were covered there. We also ordered dinner in the room on Friday night. Fantastic food. BUT, they did forget my wife's order...completely. And it took a while to get it up to us. Breakfast downstairs was great the next morning. Everything is a little expensive, but the service was nice and I had steak ka bobs and eggs, while my wife had the french toast. All in all, a nice trip.
