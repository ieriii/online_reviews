I'm not sure how I was so lucky to end up here. It almost seems tacky to say but somehow Hotwire got me and my S.O. a very affordable room over my birthday last year (January 1st - no small feat!). Again, NO idea how this happened. I hadn't heard of The Drake and had no idea what to expect. My jaw dropped open upon arrival. Deliciously elegant with what I guess you could call old-world charm. That's not to say the fixtures and the beds and the HVAC aren't top notch and newly furnished. Great views, wonderful service, comfortable and functional everything. Now the Drake has become my gold standard. BAD IDEA. This means any other hotel has become a comparable flea-bag motel, no matter what the star rating, price, or how nice a view of a city I get. I open the door and... disappointment. Where's the perfection of the Drake (the roomy interior, handsome desk, huge bathroom, the tasteful color scheme, the fantastic location...)? Phenomenal. Classy. Retreat and romance material all the way. Still thinking and dreaming about it a year later.
