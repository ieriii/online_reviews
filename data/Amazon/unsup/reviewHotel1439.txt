Babysitting again... got to enjoy a night sitting on my computer in front of the TV while the baby slept. Its not Peninsula or Ritz Carlton, but its a nice hotel. The layout of the room was a sitting room connected to a bedroom. The bathroom was spacious and the living area included a wet bar and a desk. The room was very clean and the housekeeping came down to turn down the room bringing milk and cookies - a very nice touch.
