One of my favorite places to stay in Chicago.  Location 5* Architecture 5* Lobby Bar 5* Rooms 4* I love this hotel. First of all, as a person that stays at the Hilton a lot, this works for keeping my Hilton status up, but that being said, this is an awesome hotel. The building is beautiful, with ceilings covered in paintings, reminding you of the glory days, where people dressed up to go out, and lavish lifestyles prevailed.  The lobby bar is a great place to hang out for drinks and watch hundreds of guests and even locals come to quench their thirst. Their is a high end restaurant in the lobby as well, but I never did make it inside - it looked good. My morning Starbucks run was simplified, since there is a Starbucks on the first floor. No, it wasn't one of those fake Starbucks that just serves some, it was a full fledged store.  If you are looking for a very reasonable hotel, located in a great location, you have to try the Palmer House Hilton.
