Classic location for smaller wedding/event with multiple rooms for different activities if you like to sit and talk away from main action. The neighborhood is quiet and a nice choice if you want to be a little out of the city, but still close enough.  The staff is always courteous and helpful. A classic gem in Oak Park.
