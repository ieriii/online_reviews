I stepped in and felt like I had stepped into the 70s. And the floor was so dirty. We took our shoes off, and after about an hour, the bottoms of our feet were all black. So gross. Most importantly, several of my girlfriends came over. We're all professionals in our late 20s-early 30s. We were laughing and giggling but definitely were not screaming or being loud. An extremely rude manager came up and told us that we were being too loud, he could hear us downstairs, and that there had been 2 complaints. If there was a 3rd complaint, we would have to leave the hotel, which we should have done anyway. First of all, 2 of our friends were resting in the bedroom because they had headaches and barely heard us. We were on the 5th floor. So if they could hear us in the lobby, the construction must be outrageously poor. 5 minutes later, they sent a cop up, who was actually very pleasant. But really, a cop? By then, we were just sitting around, trying to figure out where to go. Not being loud at all. Go spend your money somewhere else. There are plenty of better and cleaner hotels...with more pleasant managers. The only pleasant people we encountered at the hotel were the valets. They were the only ones to get a nice tip.
