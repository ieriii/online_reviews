I stayed here last weekend for TBOX. The price was great for downtown Chicago. My room was really small and the room had an extra bed in it (my reservation was for one). I spotted a stain on the sheets on one of the beds, so I ended up sleeping in the other. My view was of a roof, boo. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive though. I thought internet access was free in this day and age, but this place charges a pretty hefty fee. Very disappointing. Channel choices on the TV were also very limited without paying more. I'd consider staying here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
