This review is strictly about "The Living Room Bar" in the lobby. Loved it. Maybe it's because we were there early on a Saturday or because it wasn't a busy weekend, but we had the place practically to ourselves. We strolled in just for drinks on a whim while walking home. It's romantic, quiet and has cool decor.  Our server was prompt and attentive at the right times and the drink list is great. Sure, it's probably $12 or so for the average drink, but it's a lounge-type place where you go to start of the night or to end it. I'd definitely go back if I was wandering by again.
