We booked our hotel through Hotwire, and I think the price we ended up paying for our room was a fair one. First of all, Hotel Allegro was super convenient, just a few blocks away from the blue line stop where our tired, weary feet emerged late the night of our arrival. The neon blue sign for the hotel was never more welcoming at that moment! The staff were also really helpful, friendly, and courteous and gave us some good recommendations of a place that would deliver to the hotel (it was really late and everything closes SO early in Chicago!). It was very convenient and easy to get to other places in the city from it, making excursions easy and convenient. My first impression of the room was that it was ridiculous. In a good way, mind you, but ridiculous nevertheless. Cream colored wallpaper with bright silver designs, a gigantic distressed glass mirror directly in front of the bed (hmm), which itself was pretty ridiculous with its blue velvet headboard and a large black bureau and minibar, with a huge flatscreen tv. Maybe I'm silly, but I really enjoyed the room. It was just ridiculous enough to be fun, and although all of the furniture took up most of the space, it was decorated loudly enough for a room twice its size. I didn't really mind the smallness of the bathroom either, although if we had been staying longer or for it might have gotten cramped. The bed was comfy, the thermostat adjusted the temperature of the room in a flash, and I felt like the room and bathroom were well cleaned before we arrived. The only bad thing was the room service. The guy who brought it up was pleasant and I guess I should have expected it to be expensive but I was NOT prepared to pay $28 for soggy, gross nachos without any salsa. We only ordered it because it was getting late and we were desperate but YIKES. For $28 they could at least make it a decent plate of nachos. All in all, I'd probably stay again, but I will NEVER use their room service.
