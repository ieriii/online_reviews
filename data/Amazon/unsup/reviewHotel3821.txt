My girlfriend and I were on a get-away over the 4th of July. We're in our 40's and it was during the week. After extensive research we used Magellan Vacations to book our stay at The Dana Hotel (23rd floor/middle room). Magellan got us a GREAT rate and had amazing customer service. The Dana was outstanding on all levels. The service was amazing...a shout out to Monette and Matt. We ended up eating at Aja most of the time because it was good food and wonderful service with a fun sidewalk cafe feel. The rooftop bar was fun (although we were there during the week, so not the craziness we read about). The rooms are very trendy and modern (on the small side, which doesn't bother me). It's definitely the boutique side of W.  The beds were so comfortable with amazing bedding. The wall to wall windows made it feel so cosmopolitan. The decor is euro-asian. LOVED IT! When we needed help with the ipod dock in our room, they came right up and helped us. I LOVED having the dock in our room!!! Free paper in the morning. Nice bathroom products. It was all just nice. I have to say that we did not get a chance to use the spa however, so I can't speak to that... I will definitely stay here again.
