Stayed in the Historic Tower which has a beautifully ornate restaurant and swimming pool. The rooms are vey dark and not to my taste but the room service was responsive. Plentiful buffet breakfast ($27) and the hotel lobby has a Starbucks. The hotel is very conveniently located on Michigan Ave. 15 min walk to Macy's downtown or 15 min walk to Water Tower Place. Plenty of restaurants and bars within a 5-10 min walk.
