I liked this hotel for it's location to all the events that we attended like Chicago Symphony concerts, the art museum, as well as some good nearby restaurants. It was next to the L but our room was located in a place that we really didn't hear it. The staff was very courteous and friendly and there was always someone at the entrance greeting and welcoming you back. Our only complaints were maintenance issues like a bathroom door and armoir door that didn't close properly. The room rates were good considering how close it is to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave.
