You can't get a room cheaper than at the Hyatt in Chicago. The location was pretty convenient- pretty much a block away from Michigan Ave. This place is huge. Everyone has conventions here, so it's always packed. It's an older hotel, too, so it feels kind of grungy. There are two buildings. The rooms are fine. It's got what you need and relatively comfortable. The shampoo/conditioner is pretty terrible though- no surprise there. One thing I found really weird was that they have machines for quick check-in/check-out. I thought hotels were supposed to be all about service, so it was strange that they purposely set it up so that we didn't talk to an employee during our entire stay.
