The location is nice, the hotel is okay, the service kind of sucked. I had a broken outlet and iron and no one came for hours. The room is was tiny, but I pricelined it for $70. For the location it isnt bad, lot of good shopping in that area. Keep in mind parking is at least $35 a night in that area.
