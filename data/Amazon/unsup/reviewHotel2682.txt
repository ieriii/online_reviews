My choice hotel in Chicago. Even though my Chicago office is technically in Evanston, I'd always rather stay here and commute out in the morning. One of the best hotel-gym-gyms I've ever used. That is, when it's too cold to run along the lake (and, trust me, it's often too cold for San Francisco me to run along the lake in wind-blown Chicago). Good service. Yummy food. Nice sized room. No wires (yea!). No silly desk that I am never going to use because I always sit on the couch or tap away on my keyboard from bed while watching one of my two flat-screen tvs. Whole Foods is nearby when I don't want to eat out and I am on city 3 in 3 days and need a little more interaction than the room service guy.
