If you should have pockets so deep or a generous corporate discount to stay in a chic boutique in the heart of the Gold Coast, you can do no wrong by selecting the Sutton Place Hotel. Located at the corner of Rush and Bellevue and across the street from some of the best Chicago restaurants where the elite and upper-crust tend to frequent, the Sutton Place Hotel is a dream for a business person or tourist. The beds are incredibly comfortable featuring pillow-top mattresses and oodles of feathered pillows. The rooms are sleek, modern, and includes Bose sound systems and flat screen TVs. The bathroom for me is the most telling feature of a hotel. And Sutton Place leaves no detail unturned. Love the onyx black granite countertops, shiny chrome fixtures, and impeccably clean rainforest-like shower head (no water stains or buildup). The purple orchids they leave on the bed and in the bathroom are nice touches and the bird's eye view of the Gold Coast, particularly when it is evening time and the streets are lit, emotes a great vibe. I've stayed here twice -- didn't want to leave --and I've also been here when I was in the neighborhood and very light-headed after a night out with business associates and used their restrooms. In all aspects, their hotel staff is most polite and courteous. It is why to this day, I continue to recommend my guests and out-of-town business partners to stay.
