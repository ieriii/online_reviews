I just adore this hotel. It really is gorgeous. I'm a big fan of anything with a great history behind it, and this hotel is chalk full of interesting history. I love the architecture and how I feel like I'm stepping back into the 1940s-1950s whenever I walk the halls with the movie stars from one of the best eras in Hollywood. I've been here twice (though didn't stay the night-my mom did) and I can't wait to go back just to take it all in again. This time I went with my mom, boyfriend, and his mom to wander around and check out all the fancy stuff. There was a wedding reception and a prom going on, so we didn't see the smaller rooms, but we did venture into the Grand Ballroom, and boy was it ever grand! They don't call it that for nothing, let me tell you. The chandeliers were just gorgeous. We wandered all over and encountered the most beautiful piano I've ever seen. Sadly they'd locked it (too many people trying to play it, I imagine), so I didn't get to see what I'm sure are beautiful keys. Sigh. Maybe someday. I'm not entirely sure what Gene is talking about, I have yet to encounter a small room there. We booked a room both times using hotwire and were able to score a $78 (for a saturday and sunday, friday for my bf's mom was $73) deal. Good sized room, double beds, and with a window looking at another wing of the hotel. The only thing I didn't really like was that there was no screen in the window, but as I wouldn't go there with kids, it's not that big of a deal. I can't wait until I can stay there myself (though it'll be a while since I live one el stop away).
