The location is actually quite good although it's not on Magnificent Mile. At check-in, we were asked if we wanted to upgrade for $39 (I think) a night. What does this mean? A bigger room on a higer floor - what the hell, it's my birthday! First room we got on the (30th or 31st) floor, it was near the end of the hall BUT it was right across from the ice machine and that machine was cranky and noisy! A strong smell of stale smoke was overwhelming when we walked inside the room and the bed was oddly placed - great view of Navy Pier but...I know the noise and the smell will drive me crazy. Called front desk - yes, there's another room on the same floor. Switched - it's closer to the elevator lobby but the room felt much better. View is an office building - it's kind of amusing to watch others work while we relaxed :) Service was ok at best. It was very busy when we got there - nobody bothered to help w/ luggage and we have to hail our own cab when we left.  I guess that's the best you can expect from Hyatt...
