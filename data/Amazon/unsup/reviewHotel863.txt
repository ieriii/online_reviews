I stayed here for one night on recommendation from my manager, who knows the area well. The location was convenient, the rooms were well kept/clean/huge/comfy/quiet....more like a suite....the bar did what it needed to do, the service was delightful; overall the experience for a business class hotel (with a bit of personality) at $125 a night, blocks from everywhere I needed to be was wonderful. Only, bring your shampoo if you're a lady. Beware: they only offer the shampoo/conditioner combo option which means super bad hair day for important meetings the next day. :(
