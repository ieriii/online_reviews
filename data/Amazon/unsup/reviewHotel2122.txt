The InterContinental Hotel Chicago has a rich history as one of the city's great landmarks of Freemasonry because it used to be the Medinah Shriners Temple private athletic club at a time when Freemasonry was incredibly popular and the Shriners used to conduct incredible parades and pageantry throughout Chicago. This building is particularly interesting because the symbolic features are so prominently and beautifully displayed. As you walk up the grand staircase you will see very ornate columns and images from a time when the Near East represented all that was magical and mystic which glorious images of Crusaders and Moors. The pool is particularly worth viewing given the chance as are the upstairs ballrooms. Take your time viewing and enjoy the treasures you're guaranteed to discover!
