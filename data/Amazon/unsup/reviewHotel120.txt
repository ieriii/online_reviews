For the price I have to give a solid three stars. The place was under construction and the air conditioning was off in the lobby for the three days I was there. they could have made arrangements considering the temperature was over 95 and humid every day. Also, the doormen were very inconsistent, usually hanging out at the curb chatting up the valet attendant. The rooms were nice and clean, beds comfortable and the aire in the room blew ice cold. All in all, I would stay here again as long as I was able to get the reduced rate with AMEX. If you are looking for a hotel with dining, this place has a restaurant but it remained empty my whole stay. (But hey, this is Chicago and I am sure no one wants to eat at a hotel restaurant unless it is associated with a kick ass chef!)
