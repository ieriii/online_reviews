So I have not stayed here yet, but I would recommend it to out of town guests from my experience tonight. I went to the hotel for an event and I really liked it. The bellmen, the door man, the wait staff, etc where all so nice and professional. That was impressive and the hotel was clean, it's convenient to Rush Street where there is always tons of things going on and great places to eat. I like how it's away from Michigan Avenue with all the tourist. If we have a get-a-way in the city, I think this is the next hotel I'd like to book a room at.
