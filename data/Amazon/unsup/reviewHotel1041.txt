We decided last minute to head to the city for the weekend. We did the usuall research and shopping on travel sites and came across the Amalfi. We prefer boutique type hotels over the huge mainstream hotels in the city, a couple of our other favs (the W, Dana and Wit) were sold out. The Almalfi had an advertised rate of $199 per night for the weekend...almost too cheap so we did more research just to make sure, read lots of great reviews so we booked it. When we arrived we checked in with what might have been record time for hotel check-in, it took all of about 1 minute or less. The Lobby is small but beautifuly decorated. When we opened the door to our rom we were pleasantly suprised, we were on the the top floor with a pretty decent view up and down State St. The room was on the small side but very clean, very nice decor and a comfy bed and a large bathroom big enough for two people to get ready at the same time. All in all an ultra bargain for a weekend room in Chicago. Our $199 per night rate included their complimentary happy hour cocktails in the lounge every night from 5:00-7:00pm as well as complimentary continental breakfast on each floor every morning. The hotel staff was helpfull and friendly and housekeeping did a great job. There are nicer places in the city but nothing in this price range will compare. The hotel and price paired with the great River North location on State St has pushed the Amalfi to the top of our Chicago hotel list. We will be back for sure.
