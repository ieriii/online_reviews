W = Will not be staying here again. The room was TINY - the bed was super hard (Fred Flinstone's bed people), there was track lighting on the floor - which was difficult to turn off. And the best part? Our heat was broken - and our room was 90 degrees by the time we woke up in the morning. I couldn't wait to leave. We got our room comped because of an event my boyfriend was attending - so thank god, we didn't pay for this.   This is my first experience with the W chain and I must say that I am not eager to try this chain out again. Too bad that the City Center spoiled this supposedly fabulous hotel line for us.  There are plenty of hotels in Chicago - and you can do a lot better somewhere else.
