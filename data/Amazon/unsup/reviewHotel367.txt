We stayed here last August on our way back from the Chicago airport. It's conveniently located (lots of eating establishments, and Lake Michigan nearby), and billed as "most improved" property in the downtown area. Accomodations are not bad if you don't mind the occasional torn bedsheet or mystery stain on the carpet. The bellhop was very friendly and helpful when our key wouldn't work. For the price you pay, it's a good bargain.
