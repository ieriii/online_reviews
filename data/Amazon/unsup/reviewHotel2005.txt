Stayed one night this weekend with reward points. This hotel just opened on 10/31/11, so as you can imagine, everything was very nice and new. Starting with the lobby, not being a big expert on decor, I would describe it as ultra modern, fixtures were very cool, the bar area and restaurant was very modern and had a sheik look to it. One thing I like is that the room we had (and from what it looked like, all or almost all the rooms had) a nice sized balcony. The rooms were very nice, bathroom had a sliding door into the bathroom, then a 'dual purpose' sliding door that slid over to close if you were in the toilet area or close if you were in the shower area. Shower was very nice, overhead 'rain' faucet I really liked. Nice flat screen TV in the room and FREE wireless internet. I would recommend the hotel, very impressive.
