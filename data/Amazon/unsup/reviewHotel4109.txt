I will preface this by saying that Hyatt is my favorite big-chain hotel property. They seem to consistently deliver from town to town, with a clean, modern feel that extends from the rooms to the common areas. I think that the fact that there are almost always herds of middle aged conventioneers adds an invigorating buzz to the atmosphere, but if you don't like them, its not too hard to avoid by going directly to your room. I don't think the exercise room gets too busy either because these folks are preoccupied with getting their drink on and "working the crowd" (interpret that however you'd like). This Hyatt is particularly interesting because you can access the weird miniworld that exists underneath the buildings in this area (offices, predominately). So if the weather is bad out, you might be able to find a few places open during business hours. I somehow stumbled into it one night and it was a bit eerie because everything was closed, but still lit up and walkable. Sorta like the mall equivalent of a ghost town. I find it a bit odd that no one else has mentioned it, so maybe I imagined the whole thing. Spoooooky.... PS - the small Italian restaurant located in the hotel is surprisingly good - not your average overpriced, mooch off the expense account kind of place you'd expect in a large hotel. A good soup and salad bar, and good portions of tasty pasta too.
