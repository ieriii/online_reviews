Your lobby is georgous, but the table service sucks. Lounging in the area between Lockwood and Potter's Lounge, I ordered a hot chocolate which arrived quickly enough, but when I tried to pay the lady, she said she'd come back. She never did, even though other groups got their bills. Trouble was, I was short on time and didnt have the patience for this shit, so I tried to track her down. No luck. Had to get the hostess at Lockwodd to find my bill, which by the way was almost $5.50. For a small cup of hot chocolate and shitty service. Go to hell.
