Gets four stars for its location and price. I booked this guy on Jetsetter and found a decent deal $150 a night booking two days in advance. I was happy with that given that its in the heart of downtown and a very clean hotel. Has a very trendy modern feel. The lobby is real small, but has a free pool table. My room was very clean and well kept.  Read my review on the bard downstairs - iddn't love that place at all. But honestly, this was really just a place to crash while I conquered Chicago for the weekend. I'll try and stay somewhere else next time ONLY bc I like to try new hotels to keep the experience fresh, but I would recommend this hotel to anybody.
