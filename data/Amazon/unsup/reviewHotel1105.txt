Clean room, and quiet, albeit much smaller than I expected. I kind of feel I got the overflow room. (Hilton Garden Inn has a room like this with more square footage, but not as large bathroom(The decor seems to have been stopped half way around the room. Two walls are conspicuously bare. Nice 38" flat screen. Work desk is simple and nice with plugs and eithernet jack built into the top.The decor lamps hang awkwardly low. Bathrooms with separate tub, shower, vanity and toilet areas (almost nicer than the room!) The toilet looked like something out of a newly renovated truck stop. Dunno what that was all about, but hey, it flushed and worked. Staff is very thoughtful and prompt. Down side: room was unnecessary drafty. Vent in the hall blows cold air. The doors aren't designed to really seal so a cold draft blows through the room. And it was 9f outside.. brrr...
