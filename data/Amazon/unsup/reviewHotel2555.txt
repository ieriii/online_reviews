I was really looking forward to a more upscale night out; a break from my usual jeans-and-tshirt pubs. Yet once I walked in the door all I could think was, "I wasted a new dress and an $18 cab ride down to the meatpacking district for THIS?!"  I get it, they're trying to be an exclusive, affluent bar.... but does that mean that literally EVERY SINGLE seat in the entire bar has to be reserved for bottle service? I'm not exaggerating. And the funniest part was that at 11 on a Saturday it was basically empty. Really? You think you're that cool that you fill up your entire club with bottle service parties all night long? Well la-di-dah. I could go on and on, but clearly this place just wasn't for me. There is a way to be a swanky, upscale club without being arrogant and uninviting. I suggest that Victor Hotel figures that out, fast.
