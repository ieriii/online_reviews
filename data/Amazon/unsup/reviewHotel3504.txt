This hotel claims to be a 4 star, but it is not, it is a 3 star pretending to be a four star, lobby is nice...elevator is crowded....room is crappy for a 4 star....they have double beds only unless you get a suite. I paid 600 dollar for 5 nights for business and they put me in a studio room with one double bed...what the hell..the room are so tiny, and the front desk service is horrible....the hotel s own by the nearby doubletree , so it sucks! never gonna stay at the allerton again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
