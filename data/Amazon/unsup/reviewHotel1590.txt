are you kidding me? we stayed here for three nights in the recent jaunt to CHI this early Oct to check out the new Piano Addition at the Art Institute. this hotel has got to have the best river and skyline views in all of chicago! and what a location: one isliterally at the midpoint of ART [AIC] and shopping [magnificent mile] i've stayed at Ritz's and Crillons yadda yadda and one does not expect the same lux here so for what it is- a room with a view for just over a hundred clams-it's perfect, its cozy, it's central. and if you happen to stay over the weekend and you have one of them river views, be sure to get up and watch the yacht regatta that literally stops traffic as the bridges open up to let them thru!. By itself that show is worth half the room costs! ;-)
