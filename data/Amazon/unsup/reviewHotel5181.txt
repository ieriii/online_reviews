The Allegro Hotel, like other Kimpton Hotels, has great service and immenities - free WiFi, free wine hour from 5-6, Aveda bath products. The rooms are fantastic. I stayed in the Lion King Suite; it was so wonderful that I had to stay another night! It was very over the top with an animal head on the wall, African masks and a water feature. It was my boyfriend's birthday and the staff sent up a bottle of single malt scotch for us, gratis! I am always blown away by the staff at the Kimpton. The Allegro is going under renovations, so many of the old rooms that they had will no longer be available.
