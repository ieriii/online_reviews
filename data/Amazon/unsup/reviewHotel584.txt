Room and facilities were fine. Nice area to sit and have coffee in the morning, with good coffee and free WiFi (throughout the hotel, as all hotels should have). But we stayed on a Saturday night, and the whole lobby level is basically a nightclub. Plus, lots of noisy, boozing guests, guests with TVs blaring, etc. If you're a 20-something looking to party and aren't worried a good night's sleep, this place is fine. If you want, as I usually do, a peaceful place to relax and sleep, this ain't it.
