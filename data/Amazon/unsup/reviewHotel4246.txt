I've been watching reruns of Boardwalk Empire and think this hotel lobby is the perfect place to live out my Margaret Schroeder fantasies (except for the making-out-with-Steve-Buscemi part, no thanks). First off, the place is massive! There's a whole shopping arcade in the ground floor level including the righteous Merz Apothecary. Ascend the glorious staircase to the extravagantly decorated lobby and admire the decor while sipping a cocktail at the turn of the century bar. If you're really feeling opulent, there's high tea on the weekends. The location can't be beat - it's right in the heart of the Loop, close to the historic Marshall Fields building (now sadly a craptastic Macy's). Whether you stay here or just stop in to admire this architectural gem, you'll be transported back in time. Maybe you'll meet your own Jimmy Darmody here....you never know.
