We were able to get a room at this hotel on Hotwire for a great price. When we arrived and checked in on yelp, we got a free room upgrade to a suite. Yay! We also were able to check in early. The staff is friendly and always ready to answer questions. The location is great.  The hotel is a little older and some of the furnishings are outdated. But if you can look past that, it's a great little place.
