A gorgeous building with beautiful rooms, some in semi-vintage styling. I had the pleasure of staying here while attending a research conference... The Marriott (where the conference was held) was booked and so I had to stay a few blocks north at the Seneca.  I am very glad I did, because this hotel is a charmer...
