This Ian Schrager retooling of an iconic Chicago hotel seamlessly melds classic architectural details with modern style and service. The hotel hasn't been open for long, and the quality of service is where this fact is most obvious. The staff are all improbably attractive, and tremendously green. I'm sure that they'll get better, but the generally inexperienced staff -- front desk, valets, coffee bar, bar -- are what cost this hotel a star in my review. Probably would have cost them two stars had they not all been so good-looking! I'd definitely stay there again!
