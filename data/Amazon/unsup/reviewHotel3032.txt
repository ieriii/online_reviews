Now this is what a hotel experience should be about. When I checked in, Front Desk Jen asked me about my flight and taxi ride in, had my room all ready. And the room itself was terrific - king-size bed, a plasma tv, nice modern accents, and slick shower, complete with Bliss Spa bath products. I had wake-up calls scheduled each morning I was in town, and the person who called each time was soothing and polite, so a nice way to start each day. Oh, when I did get to my room, about 20 minutes into it, Jen called to inquire if I needed anything. I actually didn't get a chance to really enjoy the bar but it seems more of a scene at happy hour than at night, but that could have been because I was there on a Wednesday and Thursday. Still, as with all the Ws I've been to around the US, the bar and lounge were typically sleek and playful, sort of like something out of a Jonathan Adler catalog. Since I took cabs (always plentiful outside), I didn't get to really explore the walking area around the hotel, so I can't comment on location, save for the fact that wherever I went around town, my fare was always under $10. All in all, I'd easily recommend this W for a stay, whether you're a tourist or business traveler, heck even a weary local who wants a bit of style and fun. Note: I booked my room via Expedia, and got a super deal since I also made flight plans with them.
