In Chicago for a wedding...we needed a hotel that was in a good location and priced right. We ended up getting a nice deal through Hotwire at the Chicago River Hotel. Pros - *Convenient location to everything. *Nice cafe/restaurant right next door. *The staff was very friendly and prompt with service requests. *Bonus with free wifi and self-serve water bottles in the hallway. *Comfy bed and pillows. I would have preferred a king bed, but all they could offer was a queen. Still comfortable though. Cons - *The shower was very tiny. We referred to it as "European" all weekend. There was also no tub, which wasn't a big deal to us...just though it was worth a mention. Water pressure also wasn't that great. *Our view...which was at an alley on one side and a dumpster on the other. That wouldn't be too bad, BUT on Friday morning at 7a...construction workers were jack hammering on this side of the hotel. It didn't happen on Saturday or Sunday (since typically people work Monday0Friday), but man, of man...it was loud. *The only TV in the room was next to the desk on the opposite side of the room where the bed was and it was approximately 24 inches. With that being said...we didn't watch any TV in bed while we were there.  Overall...tis was a nice hotel in the heart of Chicago.
