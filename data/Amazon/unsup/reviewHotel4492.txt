The Palmer House is so cool. I stayed there a few months ago and got a great price on Priceline. The room I stayed in had been updated and was very comfortable and very nice. The hotel itself is just so old Chicago - historic and beautiful. Several months ago I went with my daughter-in-law and son to look at the Honore ballroom for their wedding. It was stunning - a huge room with a marble fireplace - so elegant. The ballroom is right outside of Potter's Lounge, very classy, hip lounge which we would have used for the cocktail hour prior to going to dinner in the ballroom. You notice I say "would have" - so very sad. The wedding coordinator there met with us, showed us everything, provided some initial pricing and then NEVER got back to my daughter-in-law with a proposal. I could not believe it. She actually had the nerve to contact me at work about 4 weeks after we met with her to see if we were still interested! Anyway, as pretty as the Palmer House was, my son and his gorgeous wife just held their reception at the W Lakeshore and it was awesome!  So, great historic hotel - very poor follow-up!
