Really beautiful place, but the staff is so snobby and the music tends to be poor. I was also not impressed with the fact that you can't go into certain areas because they're hosting private parties--get a partition or something! I would complain about the cover charge, but just get to know the bouncer and they won't make you pay--enough people pay without complaint, so they can afford it.
