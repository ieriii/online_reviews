Nice hotel although the rooms are a little cold. The service was good and the rooms are a decent size. 5 stars for the breakfast joint across the street and the doormen that will go out to the corner in blizzard conditions to hail you a cab. Also every room has a killer tub which helps with the whole hangover process.
