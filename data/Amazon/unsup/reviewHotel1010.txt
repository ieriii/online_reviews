Positives: - Excellent location - The Loop - Walking distance to most everything - Millenium Park a few blocks away - The "El" nearby - Many great restaurants - Boutique style hotel - similar to Kimpton - Very nice decor - Snack bar with fee - DVDs available for viewing - Decent view - Friendly and helpful staff - Breakfast available in the elevator lobby of each floor - Donuts, pastries, bagels, yogurt, juice, coffee - all of a higher quality Negatives: - Pricing - I was able to get a corporate rate thru my employer @ $239.00/nite - Bottled water available for a fee - Our room was close to the elevator lobby, so a little noisy - very bearable Not many negatives, really. We had great weather and good temperatures. Loved Chicago.
