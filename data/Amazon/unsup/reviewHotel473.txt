Very clean hotel, and the breakfast was excellent for a free buffet. However, you better hope that none of you have to stay in the front room right on the atrium. It's like an echo chamber, and the hotel does not seem to care if people run and yell at all hours of the night. I stayed Thurs-Sat night, and had to call and complain about the noise both Fri & Sat nights.  Also, on Sunday check out there was only one bellman working.
