This hotel is incredible! We snagged a sweet deal to stay here and paid about $89 a night which is unheard of. The staff is on top of everything and the rooms are spectacular. No complaints at all staying here. They did make an error in charging me during check out but quickly fixed the problem with no problem. Would definitely stay here again.
