I booked this hotel on a whim via jetsetter's flash sale event. As a pessimist, I always tell myself to expect nothing from those promotional stock photos. But once I got there, the greeting, the service, the chicness, etc, i find that this is where value meets quality at right in the middle. I loved the design and the "it is what it is, and its good" attitude. I also love their full-sized Intelligent Nutrients products in the bathroom. It makes me feel like i'm staying at a cool buddy's house instead of a stingy hotel. And cudos to their speedy wifi. many hotels offer free wifi, however, 80% of them are dial-up speeds. The James is an exception. The minibar and the "help yourself drawer" is another thoughtful thing they've done. from tequila to heneiken, from contact solution to chapstick.. if you weren't thoughtful enough to bring these essentials yourself and got too cozy to go downstairs, do help yourself. but I'm sure they'll charge you for anything you grab though. but that's fair enough. the bed is so comfyyyyy!! beware once you land yourself on that mattress you will not want to explore the city. but c'mon. the hotel is at the center of everything right off michigan ave. so exploring the city doesn't necessarily mean taking a long hike.
