great hotel. comfortable beds, had the nicest gym in a hotel i've been too, . The pool was not working during my stay though, but they even have a balcony lounging area. Stayed on the 23rd or 24th floor I forget, but the window view I had was overlooking the river/ferrys/, and staring at some chicago university/college. Pretty gorgeous view.
