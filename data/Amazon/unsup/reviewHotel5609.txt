My boyfriend and I treated ourselves to a mini-weekend getaway here this past Valentines Day weekend we left feeling relaxed and restored. I first found myself at the Westin River North in May of 2008 because my sister set up a block of rooms here for her wedding. We stayed in the bridal suite and it was pretty s-w-a-n-k-y. The view of the river was gorgeous and a wonderful thing to wake up to on her wedding day. Anyhow, I digress. Back to my stay this past weekend. We checked in on Saturday afternoon and it was quick and simple, we were up in our suite on the Executive Floor within 5 minutes, now that's efficient! Our suite had an iMac, a giant king sized bed and a nice view of Marina City. We decided to really indulge and order room service (we had dinner reservations at a nearby steakhouse). After calling and placing our order, the food arrived in the exact amount of time they told us it would arrive...to the minute. Impressive. And then, 15 minutes into eating room service called us to check up on us and inquire if everything arrived as we had ordered it. The checkout here is quick too, they have an Express Checkout option where they slip your bill under your door and you can enclose your keycards into the same envelope and drop it in a box at the lobby. No fuss checkout is always a plus isn't it? You obviously have to pay for any charges not on the bill -- but since you sign all your purchases (food or services) you are aware of it in advance. In. Out. And relaxed, thank you Westin River North....
