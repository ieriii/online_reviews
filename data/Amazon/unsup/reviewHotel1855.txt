I agree with Claire H.; the lemon drops are yummy here. We had that and cookies and milk...a roomful of booze in the lounge and we ordered...yup...a plate of chocolate chip cookies and a tall glass of milk to share! Before going to bed... the rooms are a bit small here...but we loved the rain showerhead... We didn't really pay much attention to the price...I was there for work. The staff was super nice....
