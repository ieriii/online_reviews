The best hotel stay I have ever had. A whole lot of bang for very little buck. I mean, it's the price of every other Westin, only this one is right off of Lakeshore - so minutes away from fun in the sun. It's right across the street from the Hancock center. It's on the same street as ALL the amazing shopping any obsessed shopper (like me) would ever want. AMAZING LOCATION! It's right in the middle of everything. I loved it! When I first walked in - it was like no other Westin. The lobby is long and beautiful. The room was nothing extravagant but still nice. And the beds were perfect. We had a great view of that little courtyard area in front of the Hancock center. I loved that they had a gym - so my gym schedule wasn't interrupted. The staff was very informative of the happenings around town. Especially with the nightlife! I will DEFINATELY stay here again when I come back to the Chi :)
