Kinda has a rock star feel/appeal to it....which works, if you're feeling like a rockstar. ironically enough i was hanging with the amigos, who also were in town and ready to party like rockstars for one more nite in 2009. The top suite was the seen for this rowdy group, which didnt seem big enough, although it was very slickly designed. We had a great view, and the lounge, lobby, and adjoining bar made the scene complete for our big night out to see Sister Hazel. It wasn't anything super special, just looked good and over-priced...plus I think we were expecting the suite from the Hangover movie...minus the tiger, I guess. In any event, it did the job, and the chick at the desk after the show (around the 12:30-1am time frame) was unbelievably helpful and nice...just like everyone, the staff was always amazingly helpful.
