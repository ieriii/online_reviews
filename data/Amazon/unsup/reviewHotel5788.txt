Rooms are kinda old. Service is pretty mediocre, but they do have a pool, fridge in room, free parking, free shuttle and the location is pretty close to downtown and some good food near Univ Chicago. I'd go back and stay here again bc i got a super good deal on hotwire, but I wouldn't run back to pay full price ever.
