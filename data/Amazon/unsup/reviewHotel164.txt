I love old fashioned hotels, but love my comfort too! The Whitehall has both! It has a wonderful history since 1920s, and a charming atmosphere. Our room was a bit on the small side compared to more modern hotels, but otherwise very comfortable. The hotel is connected to an italian restaurant Fornetto Mei which also includes a bar and a connecting lounge area between the hotel and restaurant with comfy sofas and seating to relax with friends. The hotel is just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower Place - a great area with lots of great restaurants, sights and shopping. If you have a car, the valet parking is very convenient. It was $39 in May 2007 with unlimited in-out privleges. I did notice a public parking across the street on Delaware Ave. that might be cheaper, but sometimes it's just so nice to let the valet handle it!
