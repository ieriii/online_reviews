So they apparently finished the renovations as I've stayed at the Talbott 3 or 4 times in the last 6 months and everything has been near perfect. The bar is back at the front of the hotel, it's clean, it's attached to the restaurant and they serve a mean Ketel One Martini. We ate at the restaurant a couple of times. Our server, who's name I really wish I could remember, took great care of us. I always ordered something from the nightly specials and it never disappointed...and he always suggested a great wine pairing. From the menu, we had the Beef Carpaccio one night, which was excellent. The best part of the stay, though, was the hotel itself. When I hear boutique hotels, I think small, but the rooms were excellent sized - bigger than the last Marriott I stayed at - and the bathroom is much nicer (and bigger) than the one at my house. Lots of marble, rich fabrics, pillows and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Plenty of space for working. Warm and inviting - it was almost as nice as being at home. Reasonably priced for a downtown hotel, within walking distance to a few other restaurants, a Starbucks and my client's office. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat...
