The Drake Hotel is like a hug from your grandmother, comforting and familiar, a little worn-in and cozy. I loved my big king bed - and my room was larger than my apartment in Brooklyn. So nice! The towels were kinda shitty, the shower curtain was worn, the wallpaper was a bit peely in the bathroom, but it was clean. If they could fix that, and get better bath products, it'd get 5 stars.
