Needs help.. The first room did not have a bath tub, the second room reeked of smoke (and we were on a nonsmoking floor) and desperately needed some touch up (paint chipped, dirty carpet) finally we were upgraded to "the tower", in a very nice room with a soaker tub. Problem here was that there were no curtains and the only window treatment was a see-through shade, so at 7am we were wide awake... The television signal (although in HD) was breaking up every 30-45 seconds, the shower water pressure was very low.Katie at the front desk was lovely and because of her help made our stay.Having worked in the hotel business for over 12 years, this is a property that has fallen in disrepair, the elevators have cracked or missing mirrors, scratches and paint chips are patched lazily, leaving marks. The details are not being tended to and if this is not addressed I wish them good luck in this competitive hotel market. Would not recommend this hotel, there are better hotels in Chicago.
