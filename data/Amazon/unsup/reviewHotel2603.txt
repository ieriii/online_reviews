I seriously had higher expectations of this lounge. I had been hearing the buzz for a couple of years and I was actually VERY excited when I finally had the excuse to go there (by the request of an out of town friend). I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. Another Yelp! review was right on when they said that they want to like the place - I did, too. HOWEVER, there was no line outside when my friend and I arrived and despite how hot we looked (hehe), it was so annoying to have to stand in the cold while the dorks at the door stared at us for a couple of minutes to make it seem FAR more choosey than it actually is or deserves to be. The cover was ridiculous and the drinks were definitely nothing special (no Red Bull). I ran into a friend there who said the place is usually frequented by "D-Bags and the women who love them." Very true. I have never seen so many visible panty-lines and faux-ny tails in my life. There was only ONE very attractive boy that, of course, ALL of the VPL's were hovering around (and blocking my view - hehe), so I was pretty bummed. All in all, it was a night to tell stories about, but definitely not a night to make any attempt to experience a second time. Maybe I'm just not as cool as I thought. hehehehehe.
