Got drunk and could not drive so got into a cab and had the cab driver take me to a hotel that he recommends. My Gf and I went through a hotel phase where we loved exploring. I did not think that this guy would take me to a place that would cost me close to $500, but oh well, I enjoyed it very much. The rooms were quite trendy and the entire ambience was great. The room amenities were nice and the next morning I got up and went to the spa for a nice little morning. The only thing I did not like that had nothing to do with the hotel, really, was this drunk idiot thinking he was some type of rapper walking in hammered and proclaiming he spent a lot of money at the clubs...umm, you are not alone, idiot, it's Chicago and everyone spends a quite a few dollars on the weekends. I recommend this place to anyone. This is the favorite of my GF and I!
