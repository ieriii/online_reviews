I've never reviewed a hotel before, but this experience has been so fantastic in every detail that I wanted to reciprocate in kind. I arrived in a stress situation (my original hotel had blown it with my reservation) and from the moment landed at Dana, everything was better. From the incredibly helpful doorman to the reception staff, from the dynamic textural surfaces of the floors, walls, and ceilings to the artful food for breakfast, from the rain showers to the incredibly delicious beds, every single detail has been exemplary. Sometimes you can stay in hip hotels and feel like you have landed in the home of the terminally hip. At Dana, you feel like you have landed in what life should look like at all times. Tonight I try the spa, and imagine it will be as excellent as the rest of the experience.
