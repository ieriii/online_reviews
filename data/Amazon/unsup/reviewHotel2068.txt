Typically you get a crappy room when you check-in after midnight but we somehow lucked out. Yvonne checked us in and when she slided the room key over to us, she said that we were really going to enjoy the room. That can be ominous coming from a complete stranger. Hmm. If you can at all, request a river view. Or room #1612. It is a corner room that is more like a suite in terms of size. The major attraction is the view of the Chicago River- you get both the east-west and the north-south branch, plus the gorgeous 333 Wacker Building across the water, the L trains, Merchandise Mart, boats and the many bridges. The furnishings are ok, the bathroom not updated, but who cares when you get this much space and an amazing view! Can't comment on the food served here. There are plenty of options close by (not so much for a sit-down breakfast) or you can get chain-restaurant food court next door in the Merchandise Mart.  Or hop on the L and get out of River North for a spell.
