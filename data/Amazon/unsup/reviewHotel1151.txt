Stayed here for a 3-night stay for an annual conference. MAJOR problems with reservations.I booked a room 3 months in advance and was displaced to another hotel bc they "overbooked"- I assume we were targeted bc our room was at military rates. After a long flight & trudging through snow w/luggage I was NOT satisfied with this initial impression. After many words were exchanged, we were shipped off to a sister hotel, brought back in the morning and rewarded with a suite on the 36th floor. Other than this initial migraine, staff was polite, facilities were beautiful, and conference was well-run.
