When we got to the place where check in was happening, we noticed that the entire lobby had no carpet, part of their renovations. We asked where the fitness center was, that was also closed down, as was the restaurant. We went up to the room where again the lobby had no carpet. It also smelt of smoke. We went back down to ask if there was a smoke free room and were told that while all rooms where smoke free, we were put in a room that used to be a smoking room but unfortunately there were no other rooms available due to the renovations. We then asked to leave, as this was ridiculous and for a refund. We checked into the hotel and checked out of the hotel all within 30 mins it was that bad This was an absolutely terrible experience
