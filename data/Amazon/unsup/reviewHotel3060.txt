City or Lake views are all great from the rooms. Comfy yet chic decor in the rooms. Bamboo texture on the walls, a cool wooden shutter design between the bathroom and bedroom, Bliss Spa products in-room, and a wonderful spa available for treatments, yummy restaurant downstairs, incredibly helpful & professional staff, swanky bar and night life, and walking distance to the pier, the lake, and all the downtown delights! My only complaint? THE PARKING FEES??? GEEZE! $45+ a day to park my rental car! Are you kidding me? With the cost of the room, parking should be included or much less expensive than that.
