stayed here on my biz trip a few weeks back and was pleasantly surprised with the room. bigger than most standard hotel rooms with a nice loungy couch and big windows to view downtown chicago. nice hip decor and free internet access in room. the bathroom had a nice mirrored closet. would come back again. but i dont think they have a hotel bar. oh by the way, the penhouse was used as Bruce Wayne's penthouse from The Dark Knight
