I love this hotel!! After reading the reviews I was a little nervous so I called and spoke to a manager advising her of the not so good reviews online. She upgraded my room on the spot and advised that she would do her best to upgrade (at check-in) to a lakeview room - which she did! Once we were there, the beauty of the hotel just knocked me out! From the lobby to the gold elevators to the room itself (with a lakeview and of course the view of The Taste) were fantastic!! Location was the biggest plus - it was just perfect!! Yes it's an older hotel but I think that adds to the beauty. Yes, they say it's haunted but we didn't experience any of that - too bad, might have been cool. And yes, there were picketers but they didn't bother me in the least. The only warning I would have is that parking in the garage behind the hotel can cost you $28 - $33 per day. All in all, I will go back again and again!
