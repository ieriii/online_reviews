I booked several rooms at the Fairmont Chicago for some of my close friends to stay at for a girls night. We all loved our stay here. The beds are soooo comfortable. The showers are absolutely amazing. Everything was so clean. The staff was very kind and accommodating. We also ate dinner at the Aria restaurant in the hotel and it was DELICIOUS! The Wine Room was also an added bonus and such a perfect thing to add to our weekend! Would definitely stay here again!
