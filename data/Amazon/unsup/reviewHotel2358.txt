The staff here is awesome. Honestly, so nice and good at their jobs. I cannot sing enough praises for this group of people who graciously handled 4000 Harry Potter fans running a muck for 4 days. The rooms are nice and really clean and the location is awesome, right across from Grant and Millenium Park and just a couple of blocks from the lake.
