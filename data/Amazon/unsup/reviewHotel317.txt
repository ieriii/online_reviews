Loved how close this hotel was to where we needed to be, but holy crap was that one of the worst night's sleep I've ever had. There is absolutely no soundproofing to prevent you from hearing the L, its announcements, and its chimes all night long. The AC was a window unit, so it was like having an open window and all the noise coming right in. I really wanted to like it here, and maybe it's not so bad in different rooms, but I'll never stay here again. They should consider adding earplugs to their basket of things to buy in the room, I'd gladly have paid big bucks for them during my sleepless night.
