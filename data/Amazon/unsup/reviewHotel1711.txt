It's been a long arse day of traveling and all you wanna do is get into that hotel room for a minute and decompress. I had originally reserved at Hotel Burnham but due to a snafu on their part, they had to send me over to Hotel Allegro. So, into a cab I go for yet another leg of my journey (it was so close I could have walked easily but I didn't argue when cab fare was shoved in my hand.) I was a little annoyed at the change but all that was gone when I walked into the lobby. Hell-o there, gorgeous! If you've ever stayed in a Kimpton, you can expect business as usual here. Free wine in the evenings, ultra cool, plush, and fashionable digs, the best in technology (iHome, free wireless, HD flat screens), mostly helpful and pleasant staff, and room service orders you regret in the morning. I also really like their pens. They rank up there with Yelpstick as being an all time favorite tschotske. Highlights: - lucked out with a crazy huge room, super clean, very comfortable, and quiet - one bell hop in particular was a ray of sunshine and was supremely helpful with bags and directions - animal print robes for sassy relaxation times (see photo ;) Lowlights: - the other hotel sent over a bottle of wine for their mistake (how'd they know I'm easily placated with alcohol?) and I didn't have the minibar key to access a corkscrew. I called down to have it brought up and it never showed so I eventually had to go down myself. - valet parking is exorbitant (no self park) and other options in the area are nearly as bad. Best to leave the car out of it or plan for paying that much. - front desk staff can be a leeetle bit snooty. I paid $100 (with a lil help from my friend Mr. Shatner) and with taxes it was around $128 for a Friday night stay. I would definitely recommend if you have business in this area of the Loop or just want to stay somewhere with a fair amount of personality and pretty high standards.
