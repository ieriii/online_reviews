My husband and I checked in and we were very disappointed overall. Our room was in the Buckingham Wing, which was the far south of the hotel. The elevator was the size of closet, which was only able to hold only 4 people. Our room was TINY. It fit a queen bed, and one tiny side table and that was it. I booked it because it looked so nice and spacious. The area where these rooms were was not part of the original hotel. It was a modern add on. The room had a strange funk to it, which we believed it was the curtains that probably needed to be cleaned. I think although it was an older hotel in the Chicago, I expected to have a little quaintness, it was just not up to our expectations. If we stay in the loop again, we are going to be willing to pay a bit extra to have a nicer space.
