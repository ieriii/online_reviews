My wife and I just visited Chicago for the first time two weeks ago and stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for all three days. We both felt that it was the best hotel that we have ever stayed in and all of the staff were extremely helpful and professional. Our room was great, the location on the Loop was perfect, and the Balance Spa was inside the hotel and we loved it. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone and we cannot wait to visit Chicago again.
