Great location (steps to Millennium Park and Michigan Avenue) and well appointed rooms. We actually got a pretty good rate here ($120/night) through Priceline, but standard room rates are typically more than double that. For OOT guests, parking can be rather pricey around these parts -- the Fairmont charges $50/day with in/out privileges -- so if you're not planning on moving your car, park in the Aon Building (directly across from the hotel parking), it's $13/day on weekends.
