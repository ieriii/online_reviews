After spending a night at this hotel, I thought to myself, every time I go to Vertigo this summer, I am staying here! It turns your night lounge experience into one that doesn't have to end after the lounge closes! I stayed in a Superior King room with a corner view and good wine already in the room for you. The hotel was spotless, and the bathroom looked like it was built the day I stayed there. A marvelous hotel, with personalized staff members there who treat you like royalty. If you are having breakfast there, they have great salmon and bagels.
