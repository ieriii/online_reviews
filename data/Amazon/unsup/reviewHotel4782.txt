Was in Chicago several weeks ago with my wife. Stayed at the Wit and we loved it! Every staff member we encountered from the bell-men, the front desk to the housekeepers and the restaurant staff was very friendly and upbeat. The hotel is beautiful and conveniently located. My wife and I will definitely stay here again next time we're in Chicago!
