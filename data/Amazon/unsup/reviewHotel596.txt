I come up to Chicago about once a month to see my girlfriend and tend to stay at a different hotel everytime i visit. So when it came to NYE I thought why not pick a new hotel and decided on Public Chicago. My gf and I were enamored with the place from the minute we got out of our cab. The guys working outside to the clerks working the check in were very hospitable and friendly. We both loved the decor of our room. What's also nice is the hotel is near rush and division and not that far from Michigan Ave. Next time I'm in Chicago I will definitely stay here again.
