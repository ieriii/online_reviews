The Doubletree Magnificent Mile is exceptional! Our room was comfortable with a great view. We were within walking distance to Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, Millenium Park, lots of places to eat & drink... The staff was extremely friendly and efficient, our son is a big fan on Pablo. Only drawback, free wifi in lobby only, slow elevators and front driveway construction was a bit of a nuisance. Highly recommend!
