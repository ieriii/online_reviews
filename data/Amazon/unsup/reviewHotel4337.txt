I've stayed at many Hilton properties. This one is good, but definitely dated. The biggest complaint is the bathroom. It was remodeled but the sink was so small that I could hardly find room for my razor and toothbrush. Also, the view from my room was non-existent. A wall. That said, the bed was comfortable and the normal Hilton Honors perks were provided. It just doesn't excel in any category.
