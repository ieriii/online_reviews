Wow never realized this was right next door and so nice! Stayed here one night a few months ago and enjoyed the stay quite a bit. The room was spacious and clean and we had a lovely view of the river! I really liked this Westin compared to most others! One thing the Westin does is leave their lights very dim - so if you're a bright lights and shiny atmosphere person, this might not turn up so well.
