Nice boutique hotel. Rooms are smaller than what I'm use to staying in, but the great customer service at the hotel made up for it. Like I said rooms are small, and so is the bathroom. I like the decor but didn't like the way the shower was designed. The hotel staff was very friendly and catered to every need. Hotel lobby bar was very small, only about 6 bar stools but they did have a little lounge area next to it. Overall good experience and the the hotel was within walking distance to a lot of restaurants and shops.
