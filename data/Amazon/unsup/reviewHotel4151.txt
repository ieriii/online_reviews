Picked up this hotel for a great rate on Priceline for a few days. The hotel was in a great location for me as I have friends that live a few blocks from here. Was also excited to be around the corner from the Hard Rock and their lobby bar, but the place was dead while I was here. Front desk staff were very helpful, and was able to score a room on one of the top floors with an amazing view and a slightly larger room than I was supposed to get. Love the $20 trick. :) Internet worked really poorly for me the entire time I was there, which was a bit frustrating. Also had to deal with parking my car a few blocks away for like $25/night as opposed to the hotel's $50/night parking. Wouldn't have been that bad was it not for the cold weather.
