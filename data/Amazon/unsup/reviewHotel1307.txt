This is not are review for hosting an event at the Ritz., or traveling on business at the Ritz. This is a "my husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a night downtown" type of review. As such, our stay was a little underwhelming. The location, staff, and room service were all at a five star level but, sadly other aspects of our stay made us feel like this hotel is just not worth the price tag. Our room was a bit shabby, the mini bar looked to be on it's last leg and the carpet was coming up all along the edges of the room. While I was waiting for my husb to arrive, I tried to watch some TV. The cable service was terrible. Half the channels were out and it took about 3-5 seconds for the picture to appear when changing channels. There was also a slight error in our room service order (received decaf coffee instead of regular). We would have thought nothing of these small inconveniences had we been paying about $200 less for the room. Next time we stay downtown we'll be doing just that by booking a room somewhere else.
