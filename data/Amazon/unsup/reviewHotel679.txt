Excellent location! And when I mean good I mean good. It is 2 doors down from the very famous very addicting Garrets Popcorn! Staff was very friendly. we stayed over New Years Eve weekend. I think the regular Valet/door man guy was on vacation. The service we got Saturday and Sunday, was not that great. Paid $42.00 dollars a day to park, and they would not go get our car to warm up early, and when we pulled up to the hotel, we never had anyone come out to get our car. But on Monday the day we left, Neil was there, and he was friendly and over eager to help us. So, I think he was on vacation. Hotel was clean, easy to get a round. I would stay there again.
