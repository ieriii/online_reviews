I have mixed feelings about this hotel. The steakhouse is pretty good mixing steak and sushi dishes quite well and the club upstairs can be a fun time but the rooms are just okay. My first room had a very bad smell in it, which they accommodated by changing my room but the bathrooms have glass walls. There is no privacy in the bathroom and the walls and ceiling of the main bedroom are concrete. I just feel like the hotel could be a lot better.
