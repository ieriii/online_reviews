I usually go to Chicago every June for an annual show, one year I left booking late and couldn't get my usual Marriott Downtown room and this hotel was my only geographically desirable choice. I stayed on the top floor corner room right across from Grant Park with a view of Lake Michigan. Other than the view, this hotel was awful especially the room. The rooms are not up to ADA code, they are dirty and old. Here is the rundown on my room: The bathroom door at a 45 degree angle opens out and hits the front door You step up to go in the bathroom (dangerous and obviously not ADA)...the architect was smoking something when he/she designed this. The shower pipe in the bathroom wet wall was missing a strap and moving and shaking when using the shower and the drywall was coming apart from the wall. Bathroom sink very small pedestal and no counter top Acoustical T-bar grid ceiling was very high and the tiles were stained from some leaks There was a very small leak and I had to ask for extra towels (I had the last room in the hotel) to put on the floor The hotel has some nice historic elements in the lobby, it just needs to be totally renovated and possible new plumbing throughout! I'm giving 1-star for the view, but I would of preferred to camp out in a tent next to Buckingham Fountain....:-)
