I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and loved it! It is modern, relatively close to the highway and eaterires and very clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful.(especially Ms. Jackie). THe hotel appears to be newly renovated so everything in the rooms is new. The bathroom is large and mine had a garden tub in it. There is plenty of floor space in the bedroom area and ample mirrors to see how you look before you step out the door. Free secure parking is a plus too.
