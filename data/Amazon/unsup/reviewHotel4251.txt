This place double booked my hotel and gave me a voucher to use in a future stay oops, they will never let you use the voucher. They always have space until you tell them you have the voucher. Total joke I was just on hold for over 10-15 min trying to get approval again a huge disappointment! I would never stay at this hotel in Chicago and would let everyone else know that the management talks out of both side of their mouths. What a total joke! Find a better hotel anywhere but here
