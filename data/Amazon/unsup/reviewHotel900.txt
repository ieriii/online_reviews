This hotel was everything I wanted and more. The girlfriend tasked me with planning a date where we got all dressed up all fancy and such. Yelp led me here and as always it did not disappoint. Check-in and check-out were relatively quick and hassle free. One thing I really liked about this place is the fact that they have done everything to retain the old world looks (we got actual keys for our room!) The doors were either original or very reproductions, I loved the hinges on them. The accents throughout the building and our room reflect the exterior of the building and its charm. While marble stairs worn from years of use, just awesome. I also loved the phone they had in the hallway styled to look old world. If you have a chance you might want to visit the Atwood Cafe, after a night out we decided to stop by and get some drinks. They dont skimp on the alcohol and we struck up a good conversation with the bartender (he previously worked at the place we went for dinner that night). Funny story, on our way back up in the elevator from the Atwood Cafe we ended up sharing the elevator with a member of the hotels management, he asked me to hit floor 11... I asked him for one of the bottles of Chianti he had hands full of. He was quick to inform me.... "ask and ye shall receive", that simple gesture made our night even better. We had a good laugh over it and enjoyed the bottle later. Great way to end a good night on the town. Great place to stay, the management is helpful and the amenities are generous. OH! And I forgot to add, we stayed in room 1503, its as high as you can go and has great views of State and Washington, see for yourself from my pictures.
