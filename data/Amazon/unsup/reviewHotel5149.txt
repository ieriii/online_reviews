What a nice surprise. I stayed at the Radisson Blu Aqua hotel for business and because the location is close to the office. I have to say that even with several other options in the immediate area, this is now my favorite. The room I stayed in 1401 - was very cool, very different from the standard rooms in the area. The restaurant was clean and the food was very good and competively priced for downtown Chicago. I recommend the bacon fried salmon and poached eggs or the amazing french toast. Happy Hour was terrific! The staff is oviously proud of their hotel ... someone sure knows how to hire talent.
