I stayed here during the 4th of July weekend, the hotel was very busy but the staff was very polite and helpful. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. If you are going to stay here I suggest a room with a city view, looking at downtown Chicago was amazing. This will be my hotel of choice every time I visit Chicago.
