This place is at the tail end of a two year renovation and is now swanky and nice. The location is impossibly good... I disagree with a review that states you are deserted here. You can walk 5-10 blocks to anything you could possibly want to eat. You are a 10-15 ride to Wrigley. Location is super! The service is a slight step up for an HI as well. And the cityscape views are in every room on every floor.
