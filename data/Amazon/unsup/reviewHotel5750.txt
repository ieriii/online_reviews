Business class hotel through and through. No frills very basic rooms. Our remote broke and even though the hotel was redone in 2005 it needs another makeover for sure.. Dont think you are going to split a room with another person that isnt going to see you naked - their bathroom door system is a little shotty and depending on your roomate could be frightfully revealing.
