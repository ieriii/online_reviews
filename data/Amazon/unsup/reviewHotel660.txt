We went thru Priceline and got a great rate on a Tuesday nite. Room was nice and clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was adequate and I liked the Neutrogena products. BE AWARE that the mini bar and snacks on top of the fridge are sensor activated so if you even lift something up to look at it, you get charged!! We did notice in the hallway that a tray of room service food stayed in the same place for approximately 18 hours which I thought was a bit gross. It is within walking distance to many attractions in the area including Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile. Our only problem was finding a place to eat late at night close to the hotel- we were there for the Cubs/Phillies game which went into extra innings, so we didn't get back to the area til about 11:30pm and NOTHING was open - not even TGIFridays or ESPN zone. That info has nothing to do with the review of the hotel, just general knowledge. Thank goodness for the chocolate chip cookies we got on arrival, they got us thru the night, even though we were looking for appetizers and a glass of wine............
