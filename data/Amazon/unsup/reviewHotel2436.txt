SPENDY! Bring those credit cards! Or, bring your boyfriend's! lol Grand building. Old hotel. Lovely park across the street. Walking distance to the Lake Michigan walkway.  NICE VIEW & LOCATION: I stayed on the 24th Floor of the Chicago Hilton. I learned there are 3,000 rooms. This is supposed to be the flagship hotel for Hilton Hotels.  Good view if you can get a good angle at it.  SMALL ROOMS/SMALLER THAN THE OTHER HILTON'S: The rooms are smaller than the other Hilton Hotel rooms that I've been in; and, maybe, that's because I was paying the economy/ghetto price for my stay.  Nice because there's a Starbucks Coffee shop down on the 1st floor.  HOSPITALITY ROOMS FOR THOSE WHO PAY MORE: I used the 24th floor hospitality room the whole time I was there...not knowing that I wasn't supposed to...until the last day :) Thanks btw. :)  GYM & SWIMMING POOL: I used the swimming pool early in the morning (5:00 a.m. when it opens); so, it was nice not to have kids in there. Hotties in the gym. :) COST? WELL... If you're traveling on a budget...umm...find somewhere else. If you're traveling on your office budget...definitely stay.
