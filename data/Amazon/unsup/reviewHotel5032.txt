with a reputation that raised the bar, the W hotel were popping up all over the country with sophisticated, modern hotels and i so wanted to stay at one! well, i finally stayed at these hotels once on a business trip in san francisco, and another time on vacation in south beach. both times i was impressed with their unstuffy professionalism and contemporary decor. when it was time to choose a location for our wedding, we knew right where to go. i told our wedding planner to get to work. for our wedding ceremony and reception, the pricing was average for downtown chicago and the reception package was pretty inclusive. guests couldn't stop talking about how nice our wedding was, and the views from the altitude room were as good as all the little details the W put together. the drapery complimented our chuppah perfectly and it was a great space for dancing. fun signature martinis too. funny little fact about this hotel: i found out it used to be a days inn. complete transformation overhaul! some of our guests stayed in the room block and said it was a nice touch to their weekend in chicago. if you are getting ready for your own wedding at the hotel, a suite is a MUST!
