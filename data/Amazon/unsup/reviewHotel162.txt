Stayed there for three nights in June 2011. It's a convenient location and the price was fairly reasonable. Negatives: 1) elevators are small to begin with (6ppl max) but then they broke down 2) poor mattress - caused back pain 3) dark room with poor lighting 4) old building and rooms (not sure when was the last time they renovated Employees were friendly but would not stay there again because the mattress gave me back pains.
