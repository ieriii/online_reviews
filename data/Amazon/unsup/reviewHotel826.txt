The top things about the Silversmith that I must point out first are LOCATION and VALUE. But the actual hotel, and the experience were nothing to complain about either. We never get a hotel in Chicago, and we most definitely would not expect to find something affordable downtown. But somehow we managed to do so. With our Yelp check-in , we were even upgraded to a suite (which I would be fine without). But it was lovely. Every point of contact with the staff was positive from the moment the door was opened for us downstairs , to the lobby with our checking in & out. The rooms were clean. The suites are good sized. The bathroom was awesome. Good water pressure, nice shower, AND a tub (granted I am assuming the regular rooms only have a regular sized bathroom). We had no complaints, and this was an excellent choice for the rate. The best part for us was that we were able to access the orange, red, and blue lines easily. AND since we took Amtrak this time, we also were able to walk to the train station (if you have a ton of luggage, you might want to grab a cab). We will definitely stay here again. Overall a very good experience.
