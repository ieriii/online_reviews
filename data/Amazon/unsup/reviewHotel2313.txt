This review speaks completely to the Marriott as a venue to host a meeting or event. I was here for a conference and I must say that I was impressed by some of the renovations. The colors look very modern, hip and trendy. The layout of the hotel can be a bit confusing but the hotel did a great job of placing signs to assist those who may have gotten off track. The food served for every meal, break, and the reception was great and well thought out. It didn't feel like the hotel food of "yesteryear" . A few negatives: the hotel didn't anticipate the need for hangers for the coat racks on a cold November day so people were tossing their coats on top of the racks while staff stood about and eventually got more hangers. Escalators were not in service and the stairwell needed to access the floor where the sessions were being held was kind of scary and dingy. Lunch serving staff seemed very unhappy, many people weren't offered drinks with their lunch or coffee. When I walked up to the hotel I was not greeted by any staff or offered any assistance though i'm sure I look baffled since I was looking for a specific entrance.
