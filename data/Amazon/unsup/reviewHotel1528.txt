I treated my boyfriend to a night here to show him my favorite city. I'd made reservations online, and when we got there, our room wasn't quite ready, but the concierge let us check into an "executive suite" so we could get in right away. He said he hoped we "wouldn't mind" the fact that the room was a little bigger and there was an attached conference room.... mind? Ha! We got into our suite and couldn't believe how much space there was. The room was gorgeous, immaculate, stylish, and had THE most luxurious bed linens I've ever slept on. Outstanding views out of both sides of the building, too.  Nothing like an improptu rendition of "The Apprentice" in our boardroom-for-a-night. I don't think The Donald would have approved of our boardroom demeanor, though... The price wasn't too bad ($200) considering we were right downtown Chicago, within walking distance of Michigan Ave, the river, and Millennium Park. What a great night.
