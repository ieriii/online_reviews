Great price, Great location, Great service! We had a room facing the river for our honeymoon and it was only $209 a night! The valet was $25 a night. They have water bottles on every floor you can fill up, a fridge, microwave, and coffee pot. Water pressure kind of sucked. Our air conditioning didn't work the first night, but they fixed it for the next night. It is soo close to Michigan Ave shopping. River taxi access within minutes. Many river restaurants easy to access. LOVED IT! Will stay again!
