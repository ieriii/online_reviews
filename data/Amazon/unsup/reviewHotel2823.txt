okay, so i had a 1-night stay here over a year ago because i won a certificate at my niece's baby shower. i did not pay for this stay. everything was comped, even my dinner at heaven on seven. i loved staying here, and not because it was free. we had a suite and anything that feels like home to me wins my vote.  the room was clean. i am a fan of cleanliness and meticulous cleaning. i was impressed. there was a fridge and microwave. the living room area was cozy. the bedroom was huge, i love spacious quarters. the view was of the neighborhood, not bad! i love chicago, although i don't like chicago costs. the hotel is ridiculously close to shopping and action. we had a good time sightseeing and WALKING everywhere. it was nice. the ONLY thing i did not like about this hotel is the atrium - i think it's ridiculous. i want a hotel to be a hotel. not a mall. or a federal building. i thought it was weird opening my door to an open floor. did not like that. but then again, i wasn't sleeping in the atrium, and i also did not pay for it, so i guess i will get over it. i would definitely stay again. and in fact i wish i would have chosen embassy for this year's local getaway instead of the sheraton.
