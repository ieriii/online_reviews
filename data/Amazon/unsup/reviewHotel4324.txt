In general I dislike Hiltons. You always pay to much for what you end up getting when you stay there.  This Hilton you could buy wifi for $7 an hour in their Starbucks. And the elevators were SO FREAKING SLOW. HORRID. Staff were not friendly - even the peeps behind the desk at the Hilton Rewards check in line were very put out by all the distasteful guests that were showing up and wanting to check in. The nerve of us. Never again. Not ever. And seriously, Hilton, I am doing what I can to stay away from you in general if I can from now on. You just are not worth the money. Its not me, its you.
