Looks great...but:No closet, or anyplace to put your clothes in our room. The bathroom was so tight I couldn't sit on the toilet seat unless I was leaning forward as the sink and wall were too close for almost anyone to fit, on and it was nearly impossible to flush said toilet seeing that it was pushed so close to the wall. You had to reach behind and come in that way to get it to work. The heating/cooling box banged every 30 mins starting at around 6:30 am. Oh and the parking for 1 night for guests was $51. Almost half of what we paid for the room. This was the first one we've stayed at so we're hoping that it was just the City Center version of the W.
