I had a nice stay here. They greet you with candy while you wait in line to register. Awesome. The room and bathroom are nice, and they gave me a nice view, can't complain about that. I ordered some chocolate cake thing for room service and it was aweeesomeee. After a long night out, my friends and I came back to the hotel and went into the lounge room. They have a massage chair, loved it, internet, tv, food, and a nice view of the city. I just can't think of something bad about it. It was a very nice stay at the Sheraton.
