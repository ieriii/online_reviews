I enjoyed my stay here in February, but this place is not without its disadvantages. I decided to book via getaroom http://bit.ly/l3aVjS which was advertising a pretty cheap rate at the time.Pros:- Super close to top attractions including Magnificent mile, Navy Pier, etc.- Attractive lobby- Friendly staff- Comfortable room- Nice gymCons:- No free internet. Huh?- Food at the restaurant = not cheap- Can sometimes get a little crowdedAll in all, this place is worth checking out.
