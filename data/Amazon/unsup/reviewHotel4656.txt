I stayed here back in late October 2009. The rooms are a little small, but they are very clean and comfortable. Perfect for a couple or someone visiting the city alone. The staff was very friendly and they let us check in early, which worked out great! Parking was free if you have a hybrid- we don't, but could have saved a lot of money on parking if we did! There is a small spa in the hotel. We had thought about scheduling massages, but it didn't seem to get much service which concerned us. So, we decided against it. There is also a restaurant that connects to the lobby. We had free breakfast tickets from the hotel. It was overpriced for what it was, and they were short staffed- and service was horrible. I wouldn't pay to eat here, but it was alright for a free meal. Despite the restaurant, spa, and smaller rooms, I would stay here again. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean (newly remodeled) and comfortable! I would definitely recommend it!
