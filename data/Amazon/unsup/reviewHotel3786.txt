There's a great joke to be made about putting Santa up in a modern downtown Chicago spa/hotel. Maybe it's the gift he gets for bringing good cheer. Either way, before I could get geared up to don the red suit, I had to climb into this sleek, mod hotel room. And the result was a couple of days of luxurious bliss that had me grinning like that practical joke where Rudolph thought his nose was on fritz. There were tons of tiny cool touches that made an excellent hotel genuinely fantastic: Jones sodas for my inner indie soda lover, the rain shower set up, the giant bed with overstuffed pillows and the panoramic views that had to be seen to be genuinely appreciated. I stopped in the rooftop lounge one night which was fun, if a little emotionless, but my understanding is that this part is new, so maybe it'll evolve by the next time I head back. But other than that, the staff I met was terrific, friendly and welcoming. Here's hoping I see ya again soon, Dana!
