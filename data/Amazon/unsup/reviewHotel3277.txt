I was really disappointed by this hotel. When you think "Hard Rock" you think of something really impressive and historical. The lobby/bar are nice and they make some good drinks, but beyond that there is nothing to brag about. The rooms are plain, some views from the rooms suck, and they don't have a lot of rock memorbilia. We have been here a few times and i have made the decision I won't go back. It's not worth the money.
