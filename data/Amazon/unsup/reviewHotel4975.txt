I stayed here earlier this year while on business. I'll start with the pros: The hotel enjoys a great location on Michigan Avenue, near several restaurants, shops and other points of interest. I also had no problem with the service. However, the hotel shares a flaw with many of the hotels in which I've stayed in Chicago, San Francisco and other cities: size. The rooms looked a lot bigger on http://www.getaroom.com, and the lobby itself seemed rather small. Also, the elevators (these were small too) were beyond confusing. You have to go up to the 3rd floor to then get on another elevator? I've never seen that before. The hotel isn't perfect, but you get what you pay for. You'll still have a comfortable stay at a reasonable price.
