Very nice, comfortable and SPACIOUS rooms... no room for improvement in that area. Service was fine, although the concierge was slightly pretentious. Eww. Hard Rock is at a great location on the Magnificent Mile so its very easy to get around to Millennium Park and all the shops. I wasn't terribly crazy about their bar, however, and found it on the smaller side... also it was filled with fanny pack wearing tourists (i.e., Hard Rock seems to be mostly families who were staying there which I am totally fine with but at 8AM when you hear kids screaming at each other and Mom & Dad yelling at them to shut up next door to your room it's not good...) Overall I was impressed with Hard Rock and would recommend to others who are fine with that...but I'll probably try the James Hotel or the Sofitel Hotel next time.
