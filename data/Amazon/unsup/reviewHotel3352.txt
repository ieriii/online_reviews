Yes people the rooms are small, the sink is really 10 inches wide, the elevators are slow as heck and the bed sheets are not the greatest at all BUT if you have a room at the Essex you are in the heart of Chicago. Who the heck wouldn't love to start their day looking out to Millennium and Grant park especially if the Blues Festival happens to be going on and be within walking distance to the Shedd Aquarium, Field and Art museum? Although the weather wasn't great, I loved being able to grab some coffee and take a stroll through the nearby parks, jam to some awesome music and get lost downtown. The location is fabulous and you just can't beat the competitive prices here considering all the money you'll be saving in cab fares.
