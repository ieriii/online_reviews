One of the best locations in Chicago, walking distance to many things, and right outside the red line. After being spoiled by 5 star places in the last year, I was not expecting much from a Hilton Garden Inn, but I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby was nicely done, and the front desk was speedy, friendly, and efficient. The rooms were nice sized, with very comfy beds, and clean modern updated bathrooms. They even had a mini fridge and microwave. Our air-conditioning vent was directed right at my face the first night and kept waking me up, but after arranging the curtains and blocking it with a pillow the second night, it was much better. Parking was valet only and was around $40 a night, which is in line with everything else in the area. For the room price, you can't get better, and I would definitely choose to stay here again.
