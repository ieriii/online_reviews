I'm actually not that impressed with the Hilton Chicago, where I've stayed the last two nights, but it might be because the conference I'm attending is at the Palmer House. For $260 a night, the Hilton is just a bit too little. The lobby area isn't that great, there are way too many elevator banks, and it's occasionally unclear which elevators you can use to go to which floors. Then, when I arrived, they'd assigned me to a smoking room, even though I'd requested a nonsmoking room. The room didn't smell too badly, so I didn't bother changing rooms at the end of the day yesterday, but the room itself was confusing. Two beds, OK. But two bathrooms? I've never stayed in a hotel room with two bedrooms before. Which one do I use? Which one do they clean? Bizarre. That said, the wifi was relatively inexpensive, and the signal was strong. CNN was on the TV. And the alarm clock worked. I slept well, the Net worked, and that's about all that mattered. There have to be better hotels.
