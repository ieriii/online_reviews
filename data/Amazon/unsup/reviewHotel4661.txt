Hotel Felix is a swanky boutique hotel downtown Chicago. Definitely a prime location if you are going to be spending a lot of time in the loop. The decor is trendy and classy. The idea of the hotel being very eco-friendly is what really drew us there and it is true. Eco-friendly products, procedures, etc. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. However, the bar staff was rude and short with us and not very knowledgeable about local restaurants and sites as I would imagine they should be. The rooms were decently small and lacked some basic items, like cups. Great boutique hotel if you are willing to spend a decent amount.
