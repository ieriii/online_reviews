Yay, another great Hilton hotel! They "stuck" us in a room on the 28th floor with a unobstructed view of Lake Michigan. Flat screen T.V. in the living room. Another T.V. in the bedroom.  Came with a concealed fridge and and microwave. Also a wet bar. The fluffiest biggest towels anywhere. The hotel restaurant breakfast buffet is very good with a lot of options. Nicely within walking distance of everything in downtown Chicago (one block off Magnificent Mile). And for what you get....the Hilton Suites is not that expensive.
