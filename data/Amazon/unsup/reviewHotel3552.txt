We were here for a wedding in the Gold Coast Room... o-m-g!!! Exquisite, grand, beautiful and royal are the first words I thought of as I walked in. The room is smaller than most banquet halls, I think it could hold upto 200 people. The wedding we attended transformed the room from a ceremony setup to a sit down dinner with DJ booth, center dance floor and dinner tables on each side of the room. Food was average to low - but not sure whether this was catered in house or through a catering service.
