The Allerton's only advantage; LOCATION. It is central to everything and smack dab in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. Until my recent experience, I had never encountered problems with this hotel. The woman, who checked us in one evening, was very rude and did not offer any room upgrade alternatives (i.e., upgrading to a king suite) to accomodate 3 adults when I discussed my initial needs. Instead, she was standoffish, short, and unhelpful, providing us with keys to room that did not fit our needs with helping to identify a fitting solution. Upon walking into the room, we realized how small it was and called down to the front desk to ask for other options from another woman, which the woman in the beginning should have suggested to us before hauling all of our luggage upstairs and having to come back down. I was glad we got to upgrade for an additional $35/night, which is no problem. My other complaints was that Valet service was not available when I arrived and we had to double-park and go inside to get somebody to assist us. The elevators are also very small. I have been charged an additional fees on my debit card; I have called the front desk and been fowarded to the accounting center several times where I have left only 2 voicemails requesting that someone call me back. I am dissapointed and frustrated with the level of service provided by this hotel, beginning from check-in to even after the hotel stay- which I am still dealing with a week after my check-out date. No one has contacted me from the hotel yet. For the level of dissatisfaction I have experienced, I do not plan to use this hotel in the future and nor will I recommend it to anyone else.
