Beware of the half-naked 50-70 year old women! Being part of a bridal party, we booked a couple of rooms at the Dana Hotel this past weekend for the bachelorette party. The hotel itself is very nice, clean and has a super friendly and knowledgeable staff and an extremely friendly and helpful doorman. The one thing that I could have done without was seeing women who were no joke, in their 60s and 70s and dressed in what could have been found in their provocatively dressed granddaughters' closets. Aside from the wardrobe no-nos, the hotel rooms are very clean and the beds are super comfortable. The only other odd thing was the shower--the inside of the shower was very spacious and had a waterfall faucet along with a handheld faucet, but instead of a wall, there was a huge piece of glass so the person showering could be seen from the bedroom side of the hotel room. These rooms are definitely good for those who are looking to get a little frisky, but there is a curtain for those that like their privacy while showering. Overall, we had a great experience here and hopefully I'll be able to return someday!
