I am giving this hotel a full 5-star rating. While I have stayed at more luxurious hotels, this one really exceeded my expectations. First, the location: FANTASTIC. A short walk (less than 2 blocks) to both the metra train station and the Chicago el subway train stop.  Second, the hotel itself is extremely well run. Nice front desk staff. Rooms are very clean, and modern. There is a pool and hot tub on the first floor, which is a nice touch when travelling with kids. I would have gone with 4 stars but after enjoying the free HOT breakfast every morning, I had to give them the full 5 stars. Price was unusually low for a Chicago hotel. Tremendous value, and we will only stay at LaQuinta when we return to Chicago next time.
