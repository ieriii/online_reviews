Overall: I just wasn't impressed by the results for what I paid. Pluses: -Very Clean -excellent concierge, front desk and bell staff. Minuses: -I don't mind paying for internet, but this was useless slow internet. They had 2 tiers. 256 Kbps for 15, and 1 GBps for 18. The first night, i cheaped out and suffered for it. The second, I upgraded and still suffered.  -When I travel, I like to unpack and be organized so I can find things. That way, I can pack my laundry into my suitcase as my trip goes on. Unfortunately the hotel (at least for my room) is devoid of dressers.
