This hotel is a wonder of history and metropolitan elegance. Tucked away deep inside "The Loop", The Palmer House offers convenient access to just about anywhere in the Chicago Area. This area of the City is really safe, even during the wee party hours allowed in Downtown. There are a number of restaurants and bars within walking and cabbing distance from the Hotel, and a 10 minute walk gets you right to Lake Michigan and Millennium Park.
