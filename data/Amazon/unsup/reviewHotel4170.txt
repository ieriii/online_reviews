Very nice hotel, the rooms are well laid out and the furnishings are nice. The lobby area is amazing, plenty of space to relax and walk around. The only drawback (for me) was the lack of free wireless internet. It cost ~ $13 a day to be able to use it in your room. I would definitely stay here again.
