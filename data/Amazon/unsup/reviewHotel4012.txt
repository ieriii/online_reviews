"You know you're in a good hotel when the wall art isn't ugly." Anyway, this place is the bomb-diggity. The location couldn't be more convenient for all your tourist-y out-of-town needs and if you get your room on priceline (meh I don't get paid for this free endorsement) then you can easily score a good deal. ($129/night with two queen beds.) (WHAT?!?!?!) Also, they know you'll forget to bring your iphone charger because it's the last thing you think about after you've packed in all your clothes and crap so they are considerate enough to throw you an iphone/ipod dock charger in your room. Beds are squishy soft. They are totally awesome.
