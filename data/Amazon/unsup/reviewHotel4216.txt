What a great hotel. Just returned from a two night stay at the Hyatt Regency. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left I was impressed. The hotel staff is very curteous and professional. The hotel itself is clean. The location was perfect, three block from the Red Line and walking distance to Navy Pier and some great restaurants! The room we stayed in was very nice, the view was not diserable but the comfy king size bed and flat screen TV made up for it.  I loved having the ipod docking station in the room as well.  We got to the hotel well before check in time and were allowed to keep our luggage in storage until we checked. It was a smooth easy check in. I will tell you, it was a very very busy hotel with lots of people. There were over 1600 people checking out on Sunday. So if you like quiet hotels do not stay here! Next time I visit Chicago, I will be staying at the Hyatt!!!
