I've only been in the lounge/bar portion of this hotel, and I enjoyed it. It is pretty swanky, and they made great martini's for the group I was with. We stumbled into this place (well, not literally) by accident on our way to find somewhere to meet some friends from the burbs. It was a little pricey as it's in the middle of all the tourist traps downtown in the theater district.
