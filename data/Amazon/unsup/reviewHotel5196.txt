STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. I arrived at 3:45, check in is listed at 3 p.m. I had booked a non-smoking room. The smiling girl at the desk informed me that there were no non-smoking rooms available, but for an upgrade i could pay an extra $20 (i was already paying $200, nice 10% add on Hotel 71). I declined the upgrade and informed her that i'd booked a n/s room and that's what i wanted... so she said i could wait 45 minutes while they ionized my room to get rid of the smoke smell. i was tired. fine, i'll try it. my wife and i returned to our room around 9:30 to chill out. The tub was broken so my wife couldn't take a bath. They had booked us in a room at the end of the hall with the entire rest of the floor booked to a wedding party. We were up all night. People in and out of their rooms, slamming doors, knocking on doors being loud...oh and now the smoke smell was re-emerging in our room. finally at 1:30 in the a.m. i called the front desk, i couldn't take it. Miraculously, now there was a N/S room available at no extra charge. They sent up a security guard who just handed me a new room key and left. No help w/ our bags or anything for the 1:30 IN THE MORNING ROOM MOVE! They wanted to make me feel better by giving me free breakfast. When i checked out the next morning, the counter girl said 'you're all set' without giving me a receipt. after i requested the receipt and checked it.-- $50 room service fee for the 'free' breakfast they promised. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.
