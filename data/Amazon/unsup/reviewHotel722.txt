For a Westin, I was expecting more. I thought the interiors and bathrooms were lacking, and their toiletries aren't anything special. The written instructions for their eco program to skip housekeeping, and return the card are unclear. Perhaps I should've known to keep my card, and give it to the front desk rep when checking out. I interpreted it as giving several options, one of which to drop off in the room card box. Calling the Michigan Westin after my stay to request Starwood points didn't work since I didn't comply with the instructions. No Starwood points for this guest. I think there are nicer hotels to stay at in Chicago like the Palomar or W, than this Westin without sacrificing much for location.
