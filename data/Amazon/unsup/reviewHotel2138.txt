Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Bliss. Do you know how to spell Bliss? Well I do. It's spelled I-N-T-E-R-C-O-N-T-I-N-E-N-T-A-L H-O-T-E-L. The Intercontinental Hotel provided as stop #2 on the engagement festivities surprise tour. We were upgraded to a suite in the Historical Tower, it's the only way to stay, with a generous bathroom and jacuzzi, his and hers robes and sweeping views of the Magnificent Mile from our windows. A long, dramatic hallway leads to a spacious suite, perfect for our getting ready for surprises #3 and #4 on the engagement tour, and for popping bottles of champagne in celebration. The staff was gracious and accommodating, and had I known where on earth I was going while I hastily packed my overnight bag, I would have thrown in a swimsuit to take advantage of the killer 1920's-inspired pool area, complete with lunching balconies and ornate blue tiling. (Think of Queen Sophie Ann's "day room" from True Blood). Starbucks is located on the first floor, and room service choices are elegant enough to be considered ordered on special occasions, such as an engagement : ) Five stars for making me feel like a soon-to-be blushing bride!
