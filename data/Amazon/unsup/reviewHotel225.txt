Super precious hotel. Loved it. Will be my 'go to' hotel from now on. You heard it here first. So, I cannot stand downtown Chicago (i.e. magmile and all other typical touristy spots) so this offered a perfect location to the neighborhoody side of Chicago. It was less than a 5 minute walk to the lake, an easy easy walk to shops/eats etc, and was located on the cutest tree lined street you've ever seen surrounded by breathtaking homes. I was in heaven. The hotel was super clean and our room #701 was a corner double room with beautiful views to the homes below and I could even see the lake! It let in amazing natural light and honestly felt like my own little chicago apartment! I didn't hear a peep minus the loud girls next door who finally shut the heck up at 4am. The beds were comfortable enough, the hardwoods were great, and the room in general was spacious and so adorable. A few notes: Remote didn't work. Light fixtures were totally whacked up. And the bathroom was teeeeeny tiny. Annoyingly tiny. The rooms are showing signs of wear if you care enough to look. I notice details because I'm anal like that, but otherwise a really really great place to be. Did I mention there were huge freakin blueberries on the wall? Cuteness overload. P.s. The front desk/entrance area smelled like vanilla. Perfect.
