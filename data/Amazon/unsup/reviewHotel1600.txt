I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back. I have had a ton of hotel stays recently...and I compare them all to this amazing hotel in chicago where I stayed for a week about a year and a half ago. even though it was so long ago, I wanted to write a review for it. that being said, staff changes and with time, hotels change. so yelpers, read my review with that in mind! While I was there, they were going through some construction on some of the floors so I got a great deal from expedia. I didn't hear a thing. the staff were super friendly and super helpful. I could use their business center for the interviews that I was going to go to, and I was walking distance to jazz alley, fannie mae chocolates, great food, and downtown on top of my interview. The location of this place is INSANE.  I was reading reviews written recently where they say the rooms are smaller than some of the other hotels etc. I don't know WHERE they put me, and if the rooms are different, but I had a great room. it had two beds in it, a chaise, tons of floor space, a exec desk, a flat screen, amazing shower, and an amazing view. everything smelled new and looked great. they had coupon books for visiting and when I went to the front desk they would draw me a map wherever I went.  on one of the nights where I came back really late (because I got lost) and my friends, knowing that I didn't know the area came back with me, the hotel staff even asked if they wanted to stay with me in my room and offered pillows and bath stuff. I was shocked. nobody EVER does that. amazing staff, amazing stay, I want to go back.
