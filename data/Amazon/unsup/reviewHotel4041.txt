Loved the Hyatt. Pros - BIG rooms. Queen sized beds. Beautiful, spacious lobby with high ceilings. Great price point if you get it online (we got our reservation off of hotwire). Really nice staff. Amazing number of electricity plugs. We had four girls in a room and not once did we have to hunt for an outlet. Cons - NO free Wifi anywhere, including the lobby. The TV quality was pretty bad, but who goes to Chicago to watch TV?? Some notes about their gym: Great up-to-date equipment. They offer cold towels, but no sanitary towels to wipe down the eqipment which was odd. A bit cramped, but I think that was to be expected given the area.
