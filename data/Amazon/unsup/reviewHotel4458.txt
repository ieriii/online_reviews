Three stars for the pretty architecture, lobby and nice staff. However....I must have stayed in one of the rooms that was waiting to be remodeled...I had no wi-fi, the room was tiny and ugly as hell... While room service was fast, the food was not good and WAY overpriced. And I'm pretty sure the sheets here gave me an itchy rash because one suddenly popped up on me and gradually went away after I left. I hope next time my company makes me stay here, I get a better experience.
