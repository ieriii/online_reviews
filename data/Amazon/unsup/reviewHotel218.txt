Stayed here for six nights with 5 other coworkers for a tech event with Chicago. We are all in our late 20s, and we felt like this hotel was not for our age group. Almost everyone there looked over 50, and the decor is a very cheesy nautical theme, and we joked to people we met at bars that we were staying in a retirement home. Also, we pretty much all found the front desk staff pretty unhelpful. When we were checking in it seemed like they wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible, and when we asked for them to call a cab in the morning, they called one and said that we should wait fifteen minutes outside, but it might never come.  We paid $179/night during the week and about $250 for the weekend. We went to the "Pump Room" for drinks, and wished we had stayed there. It was reasonably priced and very classy because of a recent remodel.
