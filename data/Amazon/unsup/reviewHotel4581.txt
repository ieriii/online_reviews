I'm currently staying at the Palmer house and let me tell you I should have listened to the negative reviews before I booked but thought all the negative people were just being snotty. Well their not, they're right on...lobby looks like it's for kings but rooms are for servants...haha...still tube tvs in rooms, ac makes horrendous noises when turned on, can't sleep. Wall paper is coming off walls...considering this is four stars that's a complete shame, illnois must have a different star system than California cause a 2-3 star holiday inn express in California would put this hotel to shame...people giving good reviews must be booking some $1000 suites or working for the hotel to write reviews, if you book regular rooms you'll regret it...spend 15-20 bucks more and get a better hotel like W, Sheraton, or kimpton...This is the second Hilton I'm staying at and both were messes, so bad that I'm writing the review while this ac doesn't let me sleep...hope this review helps ...
