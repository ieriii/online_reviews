I came to know Hotel Felix via Priceline's "name your own price". I typically aim for 4+ star hotels, but being that I was only in Chicago for 24 hours, a three star would suffice. I 'won' Hotel Felix on Priceline for about 70$ - I'd never heard of this hotel and decided to look it up. I honestly wasn't impressed when I finally read about the hotel and viewed the pictures.  Upon arriving, I was instantly greeted by the bellman who helped with my bags. He was nice and eager. I was pleased until I got to the front desk. I gave my information to check in and was told my room wasn't ready. After a 10 hour train ride, this wasn't what I wanted to hear. I had to 'wait', and sat in the lobby until my boyfriend came to pick me up. The lobby was nice - its a very small boutique hotel, not spacious at all. I noticed the water fountain near the elevators. The lobby sitting area boasts a mod, yet chic decor. After lunch, my boyfriend and I returned to check in. The hotel staff customer service was 'ehh', and so was the room. If you just want a clean, decent place to lay your head and shower - then this is it. Rooms are very small, but you have everything you need. Clean room and very clean bathroom - which is good! One perk, is that you can open the window and fall asleep to the city sounds. Oh! and wi-fi is free! This isn't a bad hotel at all - but its not the best either. Its very much in the middle. For 70 bux, I cannot complain. Would recommend for a very short stay in the city.
