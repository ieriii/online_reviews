The only hotel I've stayed in my two visits to the Windy City. The hotel itself from the outside is fairly isolated and definitely imposing. Checking in was a breeze (it helps being a Starwoods Platinum member), but the lobby was both spacious and elegant. Sometimes at a Sheraton hotel it can be a bit hit or miss unlike the more upscale SPG affiliated Westin and W's. On both visits I had a 2 double bed setups and it definitely makes the stay more scenic if you can get a room faced towards the water because the rooms on the city side isn't much to really gaze at. I haven't tried the restaurants or lounges in the hotel, but they all looked busy and competent. Definitely a great starting point for anyone looking for an affordable hotel to stay in downtown Chicago.
