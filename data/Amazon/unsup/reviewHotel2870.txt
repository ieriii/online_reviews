Full service price, no happy ending. Once you open the door to your room you can see why this place is rated an average of 3. The rooms are small and while the carpet and wall paper are new the place feels old. It's really a big convention hotel which is who they cater to. I bought a room on priceline for $100. The parking is $50 and the internet is $13. So figure it out. It's still $163. But would you expect less than that sort of nickel and dime from this outfit?  It's good if you don't need a car and want to be downtown.
