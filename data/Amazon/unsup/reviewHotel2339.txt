I stayed at the Marriott this weekend because I had friends in town and I wanted to stay downtown. The hotel was pretty nice but the rooms are tiny (although gorgeous view). The bathroom was barely big enough to turn around in. I was a little disappointed with the room itself, but the service was really good - extra towels in less than 10 minutes, the concierge was nice and fast and the front desk staff was helpful. If you're looking for a hotel downtown this one is definitely worth a try - I would stay here again, but I would think twice before stuffing 4 people in a room.
