Extra charge for wifi! That's obnoxious and out dated. Enjoyed coming here when I was a kid, the brunch was great often peppered w football affiliates. Our clerk couldn't recommend parking when there lot was full. Disappointed this visit. 2 bathrooms per room is great and the history of the hotel is exciting. I can't get over what a setback charging for internet is! Come back when its gets renovated.
