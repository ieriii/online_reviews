My company held a convention this past weekend at the W and I must say, it was lovely. Since I live in the city, I only stayed over one of the three nights, but I spent the better part of those days in the W and it was quite nice. The first night's event was at Altitude which is the open space at the 33rd floor... The room is all windows with an astounding view of the lake as well as the city. The ceiling was a little low, but again- the view made up for any nit-picky short comings. Even the elevator is a delight...or a party. It always smelled lovely in the elevator, which you don't realize how nice that is until you're crammed in with a flock of tourists... The elevator music was not your typical sleepy tunes- they were playing Peter, Bjorn & John and other hip anthems. The food was catered by the W and it was good. Not great, but really decent considering they were feeding more than 300 people. On the final night, I stayed over and the room was terrific. I probably had one of the few bad views (looking right out to a cement wall) but even that didn't take away from the overall pleasure of staying there. The bed was possibly as comfy, if not more, than mine at home, and the dcor, while sort of cheesily-trendy, was very comfortable. Also- no generic combined shampoo/conditioner and dry smelly soap... All the cosmetics and soaps were from Bliss Spa... Very nice! All in all, when I start making the big bucks, I will opt to stay at this chain whenever possible.
