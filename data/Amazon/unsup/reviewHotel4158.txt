Stayed here for 3 nights on business during the summer. Bed was very comfortable, had a nice view, and room was quiet. Decorations were nice. Room was pricey at $299 per night, but there were conventions going on which booked up the place and raised the price. The breakfast downstairs was very good. But the best part of the Hyatt Regency on Wacker is the location. Every night we walked to some great places like Andy's Jazz Club, the 14th floor terrace bar at the Trump building, Millenium Park, and a longer walk to Grant Park for Blues Fest, etc. Lake Shore Drive is just a few blocks away. The red line subway is a long walk though, but we took cabs mostly. The bar is a happening place in the evenings, but there are too many guys due to the conventions.
