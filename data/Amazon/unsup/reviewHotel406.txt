The Hilton Garden Inn is on the corner of Grand and State, a busy intersection with a Red Line "L" station. This is a relatively new hotel, so the rooms are standard-sized but still spacious enough compared to rooms at older hotels. There always seems to be small meetings held at this hotel, so there is a business-like atmosphere in the lobby. The Weber Grill restaurant is connected to the lobby on the main level, so the public restrooms are very convenient if you have to go.
