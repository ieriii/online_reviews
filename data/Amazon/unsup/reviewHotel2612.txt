It was a spectacular stay all around. The location was perfect, right by the shops on Michigan Ave with plenty of restaurants to choose from. The room was spacious, modern and clean, with comfy beds and a nice lounge chair and seating area. Aside for all that, what I really liked was the shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the bathroom. They provide large bottles that are locked into the wall so you can use as much as you desire. This is always a problem for me with the itsy bitsy travel size products that most hotels provide. I have long hair and one bottle of conditioner just isn't enough. If you're making a trip out to Chicago, definitely stay at the James if possible.
