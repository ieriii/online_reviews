We Loved It!Our family travels quite a bit so we've had lots of hotel "experiences". The Avenue Hotel in Chicago was one of our most pleasant stays. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel clean. Each employee that we encountered seemed to enjoy their work and performed in top form. I believe this also reflects on the management - happy work environments create happy workers! The view from the Sky Lounge on the 40th floor is breathtaking, and we enjoyed our breakfast there each morning before venturing out for the day, even the young ones thought it was cool. This hotel is in the heart of it all and within walking distance to great shopping, site seeing, and restaurants. I could go on and on but you really need to see it for yourself. If you go to Chicago stay at the Avenue Hotel! The Jones family will definitely be back.
