The lobby was very nice and the room was large. In room dining was great. There were multiple issues with this hotel - it was not easy to access Michigan Avenue (despite what was said on the website) and no employees could direct me to how to get there without walking way out of my way. I tried to call the front desk 3 times only to have the staff never pick up or put me on hold for 15 minutes. Also, I found some trash in my room that had not been picked up from the previous guest. For the price point, I would stay somewhere else.
