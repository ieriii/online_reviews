The hotel was a good one. The lobby looks great although I only spent time walking through it to and from my room to the city streets. It is based on an older building so the fixtures and decor are of a different era which is a good change of pace if you're looking for it. It has a decent fitness area although they charge for use of it. Just a couple blocks front Grant Park with is good and close to a number of good restaurants. When coming back to the city, I'll definitely will consider staying again.
