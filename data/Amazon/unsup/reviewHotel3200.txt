i like this slightly more than citycenter because its more airy. besides that it is kinda a pain in the ass to get to (i mean where would you walk there from?) it is a good time. i just wish that perhaps they would make the lobby a little darker at night. citycenter is just too dark ALL the time, but when this lobby turns into a lounge @ night i don't need to be reminded that light hurts my inebriated eyes.
