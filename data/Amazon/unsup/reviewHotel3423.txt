This hotel is small and everything in it is smaller, just get past this theme and you'll enjoy your stay. On a separate note the valet and the hotel manager that was on duty during our stay were amazing. I was driving a rental car and had side swiped another vehicle leaving a long white scratch on the uninsured rental vehicle. What a bummer! The valet sensed my distress and spent over 15 minutes, with the help of the hotel manager, buffing out the scratch. Mind you, they had no involvement in the prior scrape! They genuinely just wanted to help. Absolutely amazing customer service that will not go overlooked. I would go back just for this reason alone! Thank you Hotel Allerton!
