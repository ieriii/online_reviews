Okay, so I heard all this talk about the new Westin Hotel restaurant, so I decided to go check it out one day. And the food was amazing!! The potions were so big and the chicken here was the best! All the food here was fresh and right out of the oven!! The service was really good too. However, the meal was a bit expensive-- I would suggest saving this place for a nice night out!
