The staff at this hotel are mighty nice in a genuine way. I think that it must be a midwest thing because I found that across the board with the general folk too. Check in was a breeze and we were quickly whisked up to our room. At the time we were both smokers so I had requested a smoking room but OH MY! The smell of the ciggie smoke in the hallway just gave me a good ol' one two punch in the nose! It was like a smokers convention had just left the hallway. The room on the other hand had a great themed decor of being at the beach/boardwalk. It was a great and up lifting feeling being that we stayed there in the middle of February and just in time for a big winter storm. The bed was very comfy and like Robert S. said lot of pillows which was a good thing for me cause I am the Princess of pillow hogs *evil grin*. Oh the hotel is located in the Gold Coast residential area which is an upscale area with condos and brownstones. I didn't feel unsafe at all during the entire trip coming or leaving the hotel. I'd highly requimend the hotel to woman or young ladies who are traveling on their own. I'd stay here again if the price is right. Unfort the hotel can be pricey at times so be ready to pony up for a room so I've had to stay at other hotels :(
