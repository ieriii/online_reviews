My wife (who is from Chi-Town) escaped visiting her family, surburbs for a night in the Loop - we loved everything! The staff was very friendly, great drinks at 5 pm; we had dinner and breakfast at the Atwood Cafe - both were terrific! Elizabeth was our server for dinner - she was the best! It was our wedding anniversary and the staff gave us an extra bottle of wine with a nice card. We only stay at historic sites - this was special and worth the extra $$. The location cannot be beat. Paying for parking sucked, but hey, this is the Loop. Even Sasha the doorman was a hoot and holler (Go Lakers). I would certainly recommend a night here, our room gave her a slice of the Lake and being opposite the former (sigh) Marshall Fields was so classy!
