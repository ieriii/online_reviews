I am almost hesitant to write this because I feel like I am letting everyone in on one of city's best kept secret spots!! I just had my birthday gathering in their main lounge and it was the most pleasant and the most successful experience I have had in Chicago. Shawn, the manager and the staff were super friendly and accommodating... Everything was perfect... Couldn't have asked for a better night out with my friends... Best drink, best desert and the best band for a relaxing but fun night out... Oh by the way, I wish you brought the peanut mixes back :)
