I stayed here for 5 days and was thoroughly satisfied with the Doble-Ya. Service was awesome!  Everyone was incredibly friendly and on top of things. One of the perks of staying here is the Acura Experience complimentary car service which takes you anywhere within 5 miles of the hotel.  Some other perks: Coffee in the morning, hot chocolate in the afternoon, apples in the lobby, Bliss products in the room.  The hotel's location is within walking distance of some historical and popular spots such as the Rookery building, Federal Reserve Bank, and Chicago Board of Trade. Walk a little further and you can get to the Chicago River, Millenium Park &, my personal favorite, the Art Institute of Chicago. You'll be singing the theme song to "Perfect Strangers" & re-enacting scenes from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" in no time!  I wish they had free wi-fi within the rooms, and free printing services... but I rather have the free car rides anyday. :) Another thing that I would say is bad about this location is the lack of nightlife when the lights go down in the city. This is the financial district... but walk a mile north and you'll be right next to all the best places Chicago has to offer.
