While in Chicago for a conference I found this Hotel on Expedia. Here's a tip...go directly to the hotel website, I was able to save a substantial amount by booking directly with the hotel. The location is hard to beat. Half a block off Michigan Ave, kitty corner from the Drake and next to the best shopping in town.Rooms are very nicely appointed. Bed is remarkably comfortable and the large screen plasma TVs are very nice. Bathroom is very fashionable with Grohe fixtures and a waterfall shower fixture in an amazingly large glass shower and tub. I'd recommend this hotel to any of my colleagues.
