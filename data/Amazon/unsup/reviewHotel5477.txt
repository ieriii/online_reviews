I had an excellent stay here last week. The staff was friendly and accommodating (pun intended). The hotel itself is very well appointed, the beds are super comfy and they get points for supplying both squishy and firm pillows. Mark the concierge was incredibly helpful as was Louis the doorman and driver of the complimentary sedan. Yes folks a sedan service in the mornings is included. Heh - i was treated like a Queen and will definitely stay here again when I am in the city. You can't beat the location either - posh shopping, close to the subway and the beach on Lake Michigan.
