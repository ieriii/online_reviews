I thought it was a good hotel for the money. They offered to upgrade our room to a river view for only $10, which we would have done.The hotel was close to a few good restaurants and within walking distance of Trader Joe's, which was a plus!I didn't mind the elevator ride, parking was very easy, and it was a comfortable room. There was a cab always available for us to grab when we needed it, this is a hotel we'd stay in again.
