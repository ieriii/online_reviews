I have been staying at Marriotts for several years, they have one of the best rewards programs (IMO), so many options to choose from to redeem your points - which is why I stick with them.  Luckily the Courtyard was the hotel selection of choice for this conference, it's a great location - only a couple of blocks way from Michigan Ave, nested on the corner.  The rooms are great, have everything you need, wireless and ethernet connections are free and worked very well. The decor is up to date, the beds are comfy, and the rooms have plenty of space.  The customer service at the front desk was always helpful and courteous. The bell hop knew his way around town, he was very reliable in telling me where to go and the best way to get there, and what to watch out for.  Drawbacks:  - the pool is small. It's square, so no Don Draper laps for you - - sorry! - the Biz Center is in the basement, 3 computers there, but one wasn't working - couldn't get online. At least the printer worked! - the elevators were slooooow. I was on the 14th floor, but I think one elevator was out (they have 3) and you have to wait forEVA! But overall it was a great experience, I would definitely stay here again. The Front Door guy is really cool and helpful.
