First time ever staying at a "W" Hotel. The hotel has very different vibe - dark, yet lit here and there with a strange mix of futuristic and hip elements. The front check in desk glows with a pink-ish light as you approach. The elevators have a wild 3D-ish material on the walls. The room was on the 6th floor - and somewhat small - very clean and modern. The desk felt like it belonged on The Jetsons. The bed has a night light system beneath the bed - so it sort of glows. Their was a flat panel HD screen mounted on the wall - BUT no HD channels. The bathroom in my room was tiny. But clean, well maintained, and serviceable. The big fail for the room was the AC unit. It was rather stuffy when I arrived. I turned on the AC and it never really cooled off - it just blew air the entire time. I advised the front desk at check out about the AC unit. The hotel staff were friendly and personable. The evening I arrived the Concierge advised me on eating establishments with walking distance. Beware: If you arrive on a Sunday and need to get to a Drug Store - please note you are in downtown Chicago - all Drug Stores around the hotel are closed. I ended up walking a very long seven or so blocks to a 24 hour Walgreens down off of South Halstead Street. There is a McDonald's next door, a Starbucks across one street, and a Dunkin' Donuts catty corner across the intersection - so you do have alternative breakfast options if you don't want to opt for the rather pricy hotel breakfasts in their restaurant. If it weren't for the AC problem - I'd give the place at least 4 stars. I'd stay here again.
