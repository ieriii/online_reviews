This is the only place I stay when I go to Chicago for work. LOVE this place! It has easy access to I-94, parking is only $43/night. The staff here are very friendly. Rooms are quite nice. Some can be quite small, but they are well kept and very clean. There are many restaurant on the premises as well as around the hotel. They do serve starbucks coffee in the morning, which is always a plus. There is a gym on the 8th floor- I have yet to find time to use it but I hear it's a gem. It's currently undergoing construction on the first floor, but even with this, I'll be going back... Good service is hard to find, especially in a big city!
