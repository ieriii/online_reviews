Beautiful room, with a spacious floor plan and the most impressive shower head I've seen in some time. Conveniently located near Museum Park and Soldier field, there are plenty of close options. The bar and restaurant in house was great, with an amazing staff. The bedding was fantastic and it's been awhile since I've found such a nice bed away from home.
