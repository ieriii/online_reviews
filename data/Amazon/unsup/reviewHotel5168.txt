I work at Sears Tower and this hotel is pretty much second home to me. Our company puts all of our out of towners here and when they know we will be having a busy week put their employees up here. Two years ago my house was damaged in a fire and the W gave me a stellar rate of $70 a night for just over a month. I couldn't beat the location, because of work and the staff was always accomodating. The rooms might be on the smaller side, but this hotel is perfection.
