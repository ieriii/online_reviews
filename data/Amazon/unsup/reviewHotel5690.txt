AMAZING!! My boyfriend and I went for the weekend to Chicago. He had never been and was looking to stay at a hotel ten miles away and renting a car for our trip...I said NO! Did a little research online and came upon this GEM The Chicago River Hotel!! Price wise was only $25 more a night when compared to the hotel miles away. I told the concierge that we were in town for our anniversary so they made sure that we had a great room overlooking the river and straight ahead was the Trump Hotel. The location is seriously unreal for the price. The neighborhood hotels are The Hardrock, Trump Towers, etc (all high end hotels). Restaurants and entertainment is all walking distance. Overall we had an amazing stay at the hotel and are so happy about the price and location :) (Rooms are SO clean, and the size is appropriate because you should be OUT on the town!)
