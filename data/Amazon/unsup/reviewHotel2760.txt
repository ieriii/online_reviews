I was fortunate enough to stay a night at the James last week. And I can't wait to go back! The James Hotel is the perfect balance between modern "chic-ness" and the comfort of home. When you walk in or out of the building, someone greets you or bids farewell--and that doesn't happen much in a city of this size! The rooms are super comfy--the beds are soft, there's no "hotel" signage or advertisements, and the dimmer switches throughout really set the mood. The James would be a GREAT place to have a corporate party, engagement party or anything involving food, drinks and lots of people. I attended a private party there during my stay and they treated us so well--everyone was really surprised. The next morning we ate breakfast in the David Burke Primehouse, and I've got two words for you: Banana Pancakes. The James is perfect for the next generation: its got all the frills of the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton minus the uptight, stuffy attitude. Really cool. 5 Stars.
