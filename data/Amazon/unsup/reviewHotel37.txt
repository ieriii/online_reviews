Paid $140 for a room on this past Thursday. It was a last resort after the Sofitel was booked up and most of my coworker were staying there so I needed to be close bye. Boy did I get the shaft on this business trip. I normally stay at the Sofitel which is amazing but this hotel can't compare in any way except the location. The check bell hop was very nice but besides him, the staff was not very helpful and kind of rude. I was told nothing about the hotel when checking in. I was barely spoken too actually. The room looks ok when I walk in, it was clean but older looking. The nightmare came at 2:30 am when I heard the couple next door having a good time soo clearly I felt like they were in my room. The walls were soo thin and the doors had more than enough room on the bottom for sound to come through. At 5 am the same couple wakes me again as they are getting ready and leaving their room. I finally fall asleep again just to be woken up by the cleaning staff cleaning that room at 7 am and again it sounded like they were in my room. I will never stay here again.
