All right. Me, I usually can be found staying in budget class hotels, like Super 8, Red Roof Inn, and places such as that. But this place changed my outlook on everything. Now when I'm stuck at the Budgetel, I long for a place like this. I stayed here after a north side pub crawl.  The room was fabulous in itself, with comfortable furniture, dark colored upholstery (but not depressing), mini-bar (I do have to admit- I had to have myself a Jagerbomb. I just wanted to know if the $12 airline-style bottle of Jager was any different than the regular bar variety!) data-port, big comfy beds complete with lots of pillows! To me that was heavenly. Not to mention the in-room coffee maker complete with Gevalia coffees (Double-yum!). So to someone who is usually budget conscious, this was heaven! The next morning, we went downstairs to the breakfast buffet, and I was even more impressed. The custom-made omelet I had was off the charts (Swiss cheese and Portabella mushroom!)  and the strawberry kiwi smoothie I had accompanying it was good as well. The only problem I encountered during my stay was upon check in; they seemed to have lost our reservations. So the process to get checked in took a bit longer than normal. But the staff was very friendly and apologetic about the whole situation, which made the wait bearable. If I ever need to stay the night downtown again, this is my spot!
