I LOVE staying at this hotel!! On special occasions my bf and I usually go and get hotel room for the weekend and just relax. They have great rooms with flat screens....they also have a cute lil bar inside the hotel.....you get a great view, and it's walking distance to so many great restaurants and stores. Plus, they provide you with cotton balls and q-tips in the bathroom...how great is that? haha =)
