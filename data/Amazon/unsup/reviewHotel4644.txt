The hotel was decorated very nice and had a comfortable feel. I loved the eco-friendly points of the hotel! I rarely use the products that hotels supply but I loved the brand they give to you (h2o+). The staff was very friendly and helpful. My only gripe would be that the walls are VERY thin. It wasn't an issue for me but just be aware if you plan on staying here!
