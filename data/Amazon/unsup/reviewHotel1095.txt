It was a nice hotel, great location, great gym that was connected and everyone there was very accommodating. I can't say much for the rooms though. The rooms weren't too big, it smelled, the beds seemed smaller than a full but bigger than a twin and the bathrooms in the lobby were better looking.  And it was weird how we had to take an escalator down a floor to take an elevator up to our rooms. And the carts that held all the towels, toilet paper and everything else they used to clean each room stayed parked outside our room all weekend. I mean it was convenient when we needed towels and all but just an eyesore.  The location is great though, there's a gym you can use for free if you join the presidential club on-line, small grocery store right around the corner, Millennium Park down the street and a short walk to Michigan where you can find almost anything you need.
