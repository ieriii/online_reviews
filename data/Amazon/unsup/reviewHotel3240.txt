Get out that platinum card, because it's going to cost you. Reserve early when tourism season comes around, because the rooms will be taken before you know it. And there's a very good reason for that. Even during off season, you want to try to to book as early as possible. Emphasis on the chic and rock and roll. At the base of the building is the Hard Rock Bar, which is quite the spot to hang out in after a long days venturing throughout the downtown area. Alongside of course, is their little store of Hard Rock Cafe goodies. You know you have a collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-Shirts from different countries and cities somewhere in your closet. The rooms themselves are fitted, at least the moderately priced ones, with spacious bathrooms that usually work as quasi jet tubs, modern interiors, and if you're lucky an excellent view of Michigan Avenue. They even offer the call for your very own masseuse after hours or during the day. Overall, a memorable stay with excellent location and respectable prices given the amenities and service they provide.
