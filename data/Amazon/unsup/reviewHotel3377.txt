Dear General Manager, I stayed at the Essex in June on a business trip. I ordered room service quite a bit and it came to my attention that the busboys were not getting the 16% gratuity charged to me. I find this abhorrent, dishonest to the guests, and exploitative to the staff. It also puts the guests in an uncomfortable situation as the busboys are looking / expecting a tip that is advertised as inclusive in the menu. Please immediately look into this situation and make sure that this practice is stopped as soon as possible. I'm posting this information on yelp, so other visitors to Chicago do not inadvertently get taken advantage of, or contribute to the exploitation of people who work in the service industry.
