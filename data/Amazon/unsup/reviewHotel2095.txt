I attended a wedding here last weekend, and had a blast! I'm sure the actual site had little to do with the fun, but the bartenders were happy to keep the beverages flowing! The food was some of the best "wedding food" I've had! I highly recommend this site if you're looking for a place to host an event. I'm guessing it's expensive, but since I didn't foot the bill, I have no idea. :)
