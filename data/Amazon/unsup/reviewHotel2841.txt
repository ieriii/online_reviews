Room was dirty when I arrived. Water still on toilet seat from cleaning crew. Mold in shower grout. Paper thin walls. I could hear every door close all night long. Every five minutes a door would open and close and I could hear it from the bed. Phone conversations in the next room were easily heard. Surprising for a Sheraton. Three times during my stay, the key stopped working. I had to wait for an elevator down, walk to the lobby, get new keys and try again. Many people in our party were having this problem. It got old quickly. Mini bar cost more than was advertised on my final bill.
