my DH and I went to a wedding at the Empire Room and we both agreed they served some of the best seafood we had ever tasted. they offered i think halibut (?) for dinner and italian inspired seafood h'orderves. the historic gold and black touches made the ballroom very elegant. the gold leaf and elaborate candelabra really stood out. the lobby is as good looking if not better than the ballroom. the balcony that overlooks it was a nice touch for the cocktail hour. we did not stay there so i cannot really give any insight to the rooms though since we were only there for the wedding reception.
