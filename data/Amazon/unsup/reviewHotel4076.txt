We paid 250 a night for a 2 double bed room. Pros: 1. The pillows rule 2. Concierge is fast and they treat you like a rock start 3. Flat screen TV, tons of AC 4. Clean sheet, downy comforters, softest pillows Cons: 1. No free WIFI 2. No roll away beds 3. Shampoo kinda sucks 4. They charge for everything along the way All in all, Hotels rule, but it's not really my style. I prefer the couch or the floor. I actually slept on the floor at the Hyatt. You don't have to tip the bell boy, the taxi man, the cleaning lady....blah blah blah.
