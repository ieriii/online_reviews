Just returned from an over-night stay with my husband. The location is great. Right near good food and entertainment. That is probably the only upside to this hotel. The hotel itself is old and outdated. We could actually feel holes in the floor boards through the carpeting. The bed was super uncomfortable. Not old, just bad. The TV in the bedroom only had intermittent reception. One draw back to the location is that it is right next to the Belmont stop of the EL. All night and especially in the morning we were awoken by the train rumbling by and the voice "This is the Belmont stop, the next stop will be...". Lastly, even though I made my reservation well in advance and had requested a king bed they had none available and we were forced into a double bed. While I love my husband I was looking forward to just a bit more space.
