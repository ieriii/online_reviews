This is what I have to say about this poorly reviewed hotel. Location, Location, Location. Good Prices, Go with low expectations and be surprised to get a room with great views, clean faculties and comfortable beds. As a city tourist I wanted to be close to the water, near the museums and shopping. With easy access for transportation weather it being taxi, bus or airport shuttle. I went there with my sister who had to work, while I toured.  We got a room with a kings size bed and a full/queen size bed, located at the corner of the building and the layout was perfect for us two.  Yep the bathroom was dated, but clean. You can tell they have remodeled recently. I had gone there October 2009, so I was pleased to have a very pleasant stay.  Skip the hotel store....just go down one block to CVS if you need supplies. And we did not drink at the bar... but we did eat a quick breakfast at the restaurant, I would not do that again. The food was a 2 star. Besides if you walk just a block or two there is so many other choices for your taste buds.  Again the location is fantastic for a tourist or if you have business in this town. I would return to this hotel and again have low expectations and ask for a corner spot.
