After having an amazing stay at the Dana last year, I was looking forward to another stay. When we got to our room, I could tell things had changed. The gorgeous room a year ago was looking a little thread bare. The floor was filthy. I took my bath towel and cleaned so much dirt, hair and grime off the floor, the towel turned black. I actually brought the towel to the front desk manager to show him and all he said was "I'm sorry, I will tell housekeeping." Our blackout shade curtain was broken and stuck in the up position and our bed sank in the middle so we literally rolled towards the middle. Walls were scratched and dirty. They actually forgot to give us a wake up call... something that hotels just never do. It's always something you can rely on. Well, not here. It made us late for an appointment. After all that trouble, they only gave us $30 off a 3 night stay. The Dana Hotel has gone way downhill... fast.
