Stayed here last Tuesday on a business trip. My company booked this hotel so I wasn't too worried on the quality. Def. the pictures on the hotel website looked better than the actual hotel itself. But that's usually the case anyway. The hotel staff was really nice and had offered advice where to go to eat. The location wasn't too exciting - I didn't find to much to do around the hotel, but at least it was safe to walk around at night. The rooms were your average sized rooms. Nothing big and spectacular - the beds were comfy, and I loved the dual shower heads and the aveda products to use. They have a 24 hr business center, free wi-fi in the room, flat screen tv, books, cd's and magazines for you to use in the room, a decent fitness room (3 treadmills, 2 elliptical's, 2 stationary bikes, and free weights), a complimentary happy hour from 5:30-7 which has drinks, snacks that include meats, cheeses, and bread to snack on, continental breakfast in the morning set up by the elevators on every floor, and newspaper delivered to your room every morning. Overall, not a bad hotel. My only complaint I have with the hotel was that the view kinda sucked - it looked out to another building. Not a bad choice if you want to go with something other than the big chain hotels.
