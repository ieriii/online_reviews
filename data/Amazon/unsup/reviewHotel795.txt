Pleasant hotel experience-nothing too special about the hotel but it was clean, comfortable and the staff was very friendly. Excellent location to shop Mich. ave and see the Chicago sights. The one thing I was a little miffed about was that there was no robe in the room. At a supposed 4 star hotel, this is something I expect and am not happy to find out otherwise...minus 1 star.
