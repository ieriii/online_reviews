My husband and I booked the hotel through Expedia. We were landing at O'Hare super late (like midnight) so we didn't get to the hotel until about 12:30. When we got there we were told there was something wrong with the plumbing and they didn't have a room available for us. They already had us set up at another hotel close by and gave us cab fare. Not bad. When we went back the next morning to drop off our bags we were told our room was available and they upgraded us to a junior suite. Sweet! Everyone was super apologetic. As my husband & I told them, it happens! The hotel is pretty close to everything. The el is about a 6 block walk. Quick $10 cab ride gets you to Navy Pier. Hancock building is just a few blocks away. The concierge is super helpful and will even call and get you reservations for a tour. The bar has some pretty yummy food. The drinks are a tad bit expensive but they definitely do not skimp on alcohol.  We will definitely stay here again next time we are in town.
