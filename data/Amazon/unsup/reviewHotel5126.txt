Pros: great location right on Magnificent Mile. 15-minute walk from Art Institute, 10-minute walk from Millennium Park, 10-minute walk from Hancock Tower, 15-minutes walk from Navy Pier, etc. Our upgraded room was spacious but the furnishings are a bit dated. There's a Starbucks right next to the lobby so it's easy to grab a coffee if that's your thing.Cons: inconsistent service. The valet attendant that took our car greeted us with service that you'd expect from someone at a car pound. We asked for a crib upon checking in and reminded the front desk again upon leaving our room for a stroll up Mag Mile and dinner. The crib was nowhere to be found when we returned. Service was fine in other areas.Conclusion: If you expect a five-star hotel due to the Intercontinental name, then you'll be disappointed. This is a 3.5-star hotel in a 5-star building with a 5-star location.
