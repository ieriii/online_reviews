I attended a week-long training in their conference rooms. The conference rooms were very roomy, clean, and the staff was accomodating. We were provided with water pitchers to keep the attendees hydrated and also provided with lunch in their dining area. The linen table cloths and napkins gave a really nice touch along with the helpful wait staff that were attentive to our needs.Yes the conference rooms were air-conditionsed and I recommend bringing a layer to wear on top, because it can get chilly.
