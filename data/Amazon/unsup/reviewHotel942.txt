This review is written in consideration of location, price and hotel. Location: You are less than a block from Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile. This is the heart of Chicago. A short walk to the L-train station. You are surrounded by numerous restaurants and 4-5 star hotels. There's even a 24-hour 7-11 down the street. Price: We stayed here from December 27 to January 3, that's 7 nights. We had the largest hotel room, the suite...with a desk area, small living room (sofa bed), hall bathroom, fridge, microwave, two flat-screen TV's, king bed, and full bath. All this for: $632.84 (total price, with tax). Hotel: This isn't a 5-star hotel stay. Let me explain. The bathroom doesn't have heat or an air vent. The water pressure in the shower was non-existent. Stains and rips on the furniture. And, expect some street noise. Having said all of this...it wasn't a problem. It wasn't a big deal. One last thing to mention, the staff was extremely friendly. You get what you pay for. But in this case, we got more than we expected. We would stay here again and recommend it to our friends and family.
