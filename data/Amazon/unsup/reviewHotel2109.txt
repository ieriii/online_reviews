I loved this hotel. We arrive around 5am into Chicago so by the time we reached the hotel we were exhausted. The staff was really nice and welcoming. Our room was beautiful! We had great views and a clean, beautiful, large room! The staff was really nice all weekend and dealt with us crazy lollapalooza fans roaming around their nice hotel. The location is great too. Next to tons of shops and restaurants. Wifi is expensive so I suggest cruising down to the starbucks and using theirs for free.
