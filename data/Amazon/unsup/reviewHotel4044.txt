This hotel has a pretty good downtown location and isn't too far from the metro stations. Also the staff was very friendly. Now for the negatives: no free wifi, the hotel is huge so the layout can be a bit confusing, there was an issue where the phone in my room didn't work, bed was just okay and the room furniture had this strange modern/uncomfortable vibe. Also, the rates can be pricey depending on what deal you get. I would consider staying here again if the price were right but i'd say the hotel is okay but nothing special.
