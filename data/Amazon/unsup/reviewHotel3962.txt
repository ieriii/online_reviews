Congress was a great location and a nice hotel. We were charged $20 extra to have a fridge brought into our room which seemed a little steep. Also, after checking out our credit card was charged $25 additionally for each room we rented (3 rooms) for no reason. They said they would refund that amount but it was completely unnecessary.
