First time I have stayed at this location and would return in a heart beat. The service and the room quality was outstanding. Neal, the concierge, recommended and great breakfast spot. A Starbuck's is attached to the location and an Argo Tea shop is right around the corner. Centrally located to all the shopping on Michigan Ave. Great location.
