Excellent location!! Hotel was clean and pleasant. Rooms are very small, but ours was fine for 2 people. Had we brought our baby, however, we would not even have had enough floor space to set up a pack and play. Starbucks and Trader Joes are across the street. Although hotel parking is not a great deal, there is an outdoor lot nearby that charges only $25 for overnight parking. Overall great stay!
