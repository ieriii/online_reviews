When I'm on vacation in a new city, I only sleep in hotels, I'm not there for the amenities so I can only comment on the room and check in/check out process. We only stayed in Chicago 1 out of 3 nights, the other 2 we actually stayed in Indiana and drove into IL (it was a poorly planned & spontaneous trip, but it actually worked out). The $70 Indiana hotels we stayed in had much more comfortable beds but ($219) The River was extremely clean and the staff were very polite and professional. Transformers 3 was being shot right outside the hotel and it was such a surreal experience, as we were walking to the valet station, we had to walk trough the set - there were overturned vehicles, ash covered streets, collapsed buildings - it was like walking through an apocalypse! There were some angry Brits yelling at the front desk about the noise and streets being shut down, but it wasn't their fault, the hotel did everything they could to make a pleasant experience out of a minor (okay... major) inconvenience.
