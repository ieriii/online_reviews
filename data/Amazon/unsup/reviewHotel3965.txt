This hotel kind of blows. I wouldn't recommend it to travelers, except for its location, which is in walking distance of some of the most famous sites in Chicago. I couldn't get the wifi to work, and I have never had to wait so long for an order of pancakes (hour and 45 minutes!) in my life. The wifi reception doesn't work anywhere except the lobby, so if you're using one of the convention rooms you are pretty much out of luck because there are no LAN plugs.
