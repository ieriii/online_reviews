First--I did not stay at this Hyatt, I am basing this review on the customer service I experienced regarding clients that were staying at this hotel for a conference. Trying to contact a helpful person at this hotel is like pulling teeth. I called to see what needed to be done to get welcome gifts placed in each guests room (about 10 guests). I was transferred around on the phone a total of 6 times and still no one could answer my question. I was told a manager would call me about it later---never got that call. Once I finally did get answers to my questions, I dropped the gifts off on a Friday to be placed in guests rooms over the weekend (I gave clear instructions to the manager with a list of full names) She assured me that they would get these gifts in the room (mind you its $3 per drop off). I called on Monday to confirm the drop offs. First time I called and asked I was placed on hold for 15 minutes. I ended up hanging up, calling back and spoke to the same manager I left instructions with on friday---nope, no drop offs---and no explanation. So I had to go into bitch mode, to make sure these gifts were delivered ASAP (she actually asked me "when would you like me to get them to their rooms?" I wanted to scream: YESTERDAY!) Is it just me or shouldn't a hotel have exceptional customer service--atleast a hotel at the Hyatt level? Very disappointing.
