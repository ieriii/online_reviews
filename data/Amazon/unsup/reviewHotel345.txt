I was shocked at the reviews of this place after staying here. In fact they almost deterred me from booking, but since I was on a holiday budget and http://Priceline.com gave me a room for $50/night I said lets roll the dice. Now that being said, I wouldn't do this hotel again for $100 or more like many of the other reviewers seemed to have paid. I could see why they felt ripped. The nearby Hilton and other gorgeous hotels on Michigan probably go for more and I see how these guys undercut the budget market. But try not and pay full price for this place or you might feel taken.... While old and charming, the hotel is run down. Really old. Old bed, old TV, smaller room, you get it...but they do have HBO.... however ESPN was down and that was all I wanted to watch a bowl game. But we were all about seeing the city and received nothing but a great experience. We were able to walk to Millennium Park, the Art Institute, The Sears (aka Willis Tower), Navy Pier, a bunch of good eateries -- and best of all a block from the train. I'd be back... but only for a http://Priceline.com -- $50 deal -- nice stay, friendly staff and the little breakfast cafe downstairs was actually decent and cheap. The only bummer was the parking is $28 extra a day.
