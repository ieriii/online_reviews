I tend to stay at Hiltons when I travel for pleasure for two reasons: 1) They are usually very clean and nice at all levels in the chain 2) A friend works for a property and I can get a deal. However, the Palmer House is exceptionally awesome. Located in the loop only a block and half from Millenium Park its less then a 10 minute walk to Cloud Gate aka: The Bean which just mesmerized me finally seeing it in person. I was a bit obsessed with it. The hotel lobby ceiling is amazing and the overall decor is great and the room was clean and recently remodeled. The only downsides were: 1) No fridge in room (I am sure I could have gotten one of if I asked) 2) No Coffee maker in the room 3) No HDTV I didn't realize there were hotels without these anymore Also, the concierge Phillipe is top notch. I had mentioned on Twitter I was looking on best way to get to the hotel and places to eat around there with good beer. Not sure how he found my tweet but he did and within minutes we emailed back and forth and he provided me with great choices. His service and knowledge of the area is impeccable. Bottom line is this is a great hotel, that is clean, nice and has a world-class friendly staff.
