Hmm. I have to say quite a pleasant experience! We changed hotels after reading the positive reviews of this one. Stayed for a few days. Very nice front desk staff during morning and late evening hours. This was more like a smaller boutique hotel in a GREAT area, Wabash and Erie, 2 blocks or less from everything including Michigan Avenue. Safe, clean, well landscaped lush area. Property also clean, well maintained and fresh smelling. Sure, rooms are small but why would you stay in your room in this great city. I didn't find them terribly small. There was a small hallway that went past the bathroom to an area with a desk, queen bed and flat screen. Modern decor and colors. Small dresser in closet with ironing board and safe. Bathroom larger than I expected after reading the other reviews. FREE WiFi and breakfast buffet which had yogurt, cereal, hot cinnamon rolls, an egg product, sausage, etc. Hot beverages were always available throughout the day. Clean dining area just off lobby. Clean, comfortable beds, updated fixtures, comfy bed, clean, bright linens. I did not have too many issues with noise overall. Good water pressure, hot water, clean towels. Partial view of street, room not totally blocked in. Again, you're not here to look out the window. You are here to eat and shop. (Don't kid yourself). You don't need a car here in the city so save your efforts with that. Close to trains, buses, etc. Easy walkable city. Trader Joe's is across the street, Grand Lux, Bloomingdale's Home, Dues Pizza around corner, Michigan Avenue two blocks away, quick walk. All the restaurants/shops any visitor would want. Save yourself the bloated overhead of some of the other more crowded Magnificent Mile hotels and stay here. Nothing bugs me more when the common areas, lobbies, etc. are just crammed with tourists. Good for single travelers, families, etc. Good for YOU!
