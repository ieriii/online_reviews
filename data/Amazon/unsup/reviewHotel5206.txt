We stayed at the Omni in Chicago from August 28th to September 2nd. Staff on the ground floor were very friendly and directed us to the 3rd floor. Check-in went very smoothly and we got a room on the 25th (top) floor. The living room had a large, flat panel TV with an extensive selection of channels. The bedroom was nicely finished and clean. Bathroom was also neat and tidy. Housekeeping kept our room clean and actually arranged our toiletries in such a manner that we maintained throughout our stay.We ate at the Omni breakfast buffet in the 676 restaurant on the 4th floor every morning because the kids love buffets (and ate for free) and it was good. They really need a separate station for omelettes and other custom egg orders because waiting for eggs in the middle of the buffet hampers the flow. The staff was friendly which was nice given that there was an automatic 20% gratuity levied on our group of six.The daytime concierge for the first half of our stay (Marcus) was extremely friendly and he sat with a disposition that communicated "I'm here to help!" The other concierge always looked as though he was busy doing something so we never really disturbed him.The health club on the 5th floor provided the essentials and never got too busy.The adjoining pool was suited perfectly for my kids (3' 6" from end to end). Numerous games of beachball volleyball. Hot tub was good and there was a general disregard for the sign that indicated that there was a three-person limit.Location, location, location! Perfectly placed on the Magnificent Mile. Hotel entrance is just off of N Michigan and never got too busy in front. If you are traveling with children then I strongly recommend this hotel. That being said, I would still consider staying at the Omni again even if we leave the kids at home.I also recommend that you get the Select Guest membership. It gets you free wireless internet, free bottles of water, and more. It's free and so worthwhile.
