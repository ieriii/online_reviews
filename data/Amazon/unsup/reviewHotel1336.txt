We stayed here on the weekend of the Chicago Marathon with our 1 year old. The staff were super nice, and our room was spacious with a separate area for a crib. The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to excellent shopping, dining, scenery, and attractions. The nicest part was the hotel had a special toy for our son and provided us with a care package for him that had baby lotions, wipes, diapers, etc. Beautiful hotel and we will stay here again when we return to Chicago.
