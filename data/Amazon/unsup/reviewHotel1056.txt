1. Molds in the bathroom (UNSANITARY..probably the reason why my respiratory system is currently screwed, and my lymph nodes are inflamed) 2. No clock in room 3. Broken lamps 4. Smelly/unkempt halls 5. Broken toilet seat cover 6. Broken phone 7. Cloggy tub 8. Ice machine doesn't work on 2nd floor 9. Minimal outlets/outlets that don't work 10. Broken door 11. Wi-Fi only works in the lobby 12. It took almost 30 mins to check, 15 mins from waiting, and about 10 mins to actually check in 13. Questionable/odd tin man who is one of the cleaners... I guess the moral of the story is you get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend staying here unless you ABSOLUTELY have too and have no other choices. There are NUMEROUS surrounding hotels, so I would book early and check those other hotels out first.
