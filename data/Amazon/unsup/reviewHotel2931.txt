We stayed here a couple yrs ago and it's a super nice place. Definitely someplace I'd stay if the Trump was booked. A little older, but classy, close to everything you'd need (Magnificent Mile, movies, restaurants, etc.). Has a Shula's in the hotel, which is one of the best steaks I've ever had. Bottom line, a great hotel I'd surely visit again.
