I generally like Marriott properties and this location is no different. When working in Chicago this location is perfectly situated for me. I have visited the CMMM a few times and hvae usually been pleased, however, my last visit left me a bit disappointed. The a/c in the room was not working and it was unbearably hot. Despite giving maintenance an entire day to sort things out we arrived back to a stifling room on our second night. We managed to get a decent temperature by opening the windows but then had to deal with street sounds all night. I'll give them another chance but if they drop the ball again it will be our last visit.
