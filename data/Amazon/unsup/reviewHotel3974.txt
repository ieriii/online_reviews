Never stay here. The air conditioning unit was really noisy and did not cool the room, after complaining to the front desk they didn't fix it in 3 days, then said air conditioning was not needed on that weather. (The noise wouldn't let us sleep and opening the windows was worse) The second night of my stay I left my camera at the room to go out for dinner and to my surprise only 2 hours later my laptop and SLR camera were gone... (Being in the 13th floor, there was no fire-scape or way of entry other than the card activated door) The security department told me NOT to call the police. Of course I called anyways. There was a pillow missing, I presume that they used to take out the items. There was no manager on duty and the staff was poorly trained. When I finally got hold of the Hotel President a few days later, the gentlemen was as rude as it staff and said that he could not even file a claim to his insurance company (if they have one) because it could not possible be proven that it was his staff. The room was not clean when I got there, I had to call and have them pick up some forgotten clothes in one of the drawers...
