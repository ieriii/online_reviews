very pretty, very modern and very very civilized. there may be no sense of a 'scene' but this isn't new york. i want to spend a few hours drinking a cocktail with a companion in a place that's mature, well-appointed and ...civilized. it wasn't swamped with scads of people looking to hook up, tourists or screaming bachelorette parties. a major plus. folks were well-dressed, sedate and laid back. very...civilized. i was actually surprised at how un-outrageous it was to grab a few here. 4-6 cocktails and a wonderful dessert came to about $80 for two people. maybe my scale is skewed but i think that's all right for a fun evening on a friday night during the summer.
