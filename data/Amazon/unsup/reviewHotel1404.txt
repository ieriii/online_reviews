My review is merely for the 11 hour period we were there between 10 pm and 9 am, but for what it's worth, those were good hours. We needed a rental car for the remainder of our trip, so we picked one up at O'Hare and made the drive here. Finding the hotel was pretty easy. The valet parking? I knew it was coming, and it was still painful. At least I didn't physically see the $53 charge till the next morning. The best part of this hotel, other than the clean, beautiful lines to it, is obviously the location. Just across from the Drake, you're incredibly close to so much that Chicago has to offer. Since we got there late, checking in was a breeze. We had purchased our room through Priceline and there were no problems. We were quickly sent out our way through the tiny elevators to the 9th floor, which had mostly a view of the buildings around it, but through one small opening, you could also see to the lake. Not that you can see much at 10 pm at night anyway, but I digress. The bed and linens were incredibly comfortable and I slept like a baby. The added bonus to the whole 11 hour stay was the concierge who pointed us towards an excellent breakfast just a few quick blocks away at Feast. Head there for a meal if you're staying at the Knickerbocker. You won't be disappointed.
