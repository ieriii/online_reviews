Is it time to roll out the red carpet just yet? Perhaps. I stayed here about a month ago with my boyfriend and I must say that I enjoyed myself. The rooms were big and very modern. I'm a stiffler for bathrooms and I absolutely must say that I'd probably eat off the floors of these bathrooms than the plate of some Chicago restaurants. The beds are big and comfortable with white linen and comforters. I, personally, prefer sheets with a little more pizzaz but it's a subliminal thing: white equates with cleanliness. So, I get what they were going for. I was very pleased with the cleaning services as well. I requested my sheets get changed at the end of the night -- because, of course, the beau and I dirtied em up acting like 12 years olds, jumping around like fools -- and it happened rather quickly. The cleaning lady even engaged in a nice conversation with me as she cleaned. Very pleasant. I thought we had a great view and I was quite sad we had to leave and venture out into the real world. I'd love to have known more about the extra amenities of the hotel, such as the gym. And, it'd be awesome if they could toss a couple of iPod radio docks in there for those who just want to enjoy the view and listen to some tunes. Oh, and we didn't enjoy that you had to pay for wi-fi. Seriously? All-in-all please do check the place out. Loved it.
