Great location, amazing views, stylish design, big rooms, cocktails comped to us, great front desk person, very good price.  Why not five stars? I think in this day and age, hotels should have free wi fi. (With VOIP, some hotels are now offering unlimited long distance and free wi fi.) Otherwise, entirely a five-star experience.
