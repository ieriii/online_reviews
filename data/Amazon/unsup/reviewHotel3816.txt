I really enjoyed staying in this hotel during Lollapalooza. First of all - cool hotel right in the middle of everything and it's close enough to walk to and from Grant Park. (and rock star sightings!!) Awesome about hotel: 24 hour room service, 2 restaurants, a club upstairs (if you're into that sort of thing), friendly staff - especially Ramsey at the front desk, extremely helpful and friendly.  Beware of: the bartender at brunch is quite worthless and the service in the kitchen is slow, while the shower is awesome - the one side of the shower is glass which is open to the room; the only thing that covers the glass is a curtain which is not that easy to close and can be opened from outside the shower. Otherwise, excellent location for shopping, bars, food and all the sites!! I'd recommend this hotel for sure!!
