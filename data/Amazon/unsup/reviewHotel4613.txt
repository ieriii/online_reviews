Nice boutique hotel. All of the staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. I was nervous due to some of the reviews complaining about the size of the room, but it was fine. On the small side but if you aren't spending a lot of time in the room (we were out most of the day, used the room for sleeping). The room had a nice modern decor and we had a nice view. Close to Mag Mile, banks, Starbucks and Sports Authority (in case you need ponchos or jackets due to unpredictable Chicago weather, hint;) Not so positives: Did not like the bathroom sink, too shallow, bad design, was clogged. Doors tend to close very loudly. This was very apparent with the jerk next door who kept going in between rooms early on morning. Loved Chicago, would definitely stay here again.
