Did an overnight here with the family so my daughter and I could do a Memories with Mom package at American Girl. Omni does NOT disappoint! Found a package for around $365 - not bad for a Friday night stay in the heart of the Mag Mile that included overnight parking AND $50 worth of breakfast. Check in - fast and smooth. Kids received a little Welcome Backpack thingie with little toys and a snack in it. Later that evening - cookies and milk were delivered to our room for the kids. They really take care of their little guests! Join their Select Guest Pgm so you could get the free wifi!!!
