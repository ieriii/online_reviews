Fantastic location, friendly staff and nice accommodations. The room is not large but adequate for 1 or 2 people. My daughter and I stayed 2 nights and were very pleased with our room. We overlooked the river. Initially we were assigned a room 2 floors higher but they were working on the AC. The technician let us into our new room and the front desk sent up our new keys. We were able to check in early with no problem. We requested a late check out, paid a little extra for that but it was worth it. The bottled water available in the hall was very welcomed with the high temps!! I would definitely stay there again.
