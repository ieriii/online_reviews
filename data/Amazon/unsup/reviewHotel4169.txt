If I could give 3.5 stars I would. Let me say, my fiance and I really love the Hyatt hotels. We're getting married at the Hyatt Lodge in Oak Brook, and have their "frequent stay" card equivalent. I was super excited about staying here not only because we were going to collect some points we can use for future Hyatt stays, but also because it's right downtown and close to where we were heading out to dinner that night. I upgraded to a King Deluxe on a high floor, so we had a great view of the river and some of Navy Pier. Our bed was comfortable and the room was dead quiet. The bathroom was nicely upgraded and everything was very clean. However, I still think the room was still a little too pricey. I did add valet parking to my bill, which was over $50 for keeping it overnight (OUCH!!!!). Also, I love ordering room service, but $17 pancakes aren't my thing.  Staff was super friendly, though, and checkin/out was a breeze.
