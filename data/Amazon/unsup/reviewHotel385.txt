These people went out of their way to make our stay great. We drove through the night from DC and arrived much earlier than expected. Mitchell and Hans (and the cleaning staff!) did everything they could and got us in our room by 10 am so we could get some rest before enjoying the city. The room was nice and clean. Great view, nice room amenities. The pool and hot tub looked great, although we didn't have time to use them. The restaurant attached to the hotel (Weber Grill) was fantastic, by far our best meal in Chicago! Hotel is in a fantastic location, within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to see. Parking, a bit pricey, but to be expected in the city. Great stay for a reasonable price!
