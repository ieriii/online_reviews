I had a great experience planning and throwing a party at victor so I'm a huge fan. I held an event here for about 20ish people on a Friday night, and the hostess was extremely helpful in making sure everyone in our party got in quickly and free (this is huge, as our ratio of guys:girls in the group was like 3:1). It was a surprise birthday, and the surprise part couldn't have gone smoother thanks to the staff on hand (headed by Ruth!). We got 4 bottles over the course of the night and took up most of the back red room, and were given 2 wait staff members to serve the group's needs, which they did so well!  And really, despite the complaints by other yelpers, I liked the industrial feel of the place, despite the small # of restrooms and pictures of fashion models & nude models on the wall.  So what if the servers come back every five minutes? I like to feel waited on when I'm shelling out for a big group and probably do need some help that often :o) I paid zero attention to the crowd at the place, but that doesn't matter too much to me when i'm out with friends to celebrate.  Bottom line: if you throw a party here, they will serve you well. beyond that, you're better off checking out the other reviews
