So this is the hotel closest to my Firm's Chicago office, so I've stayed there many times. This past weekend motivated me to Yelp. I was 96 miles short of renewing Gold Medallion status on Delta, so I decided to take my wife to Chicago for her birthday to top it off. The W is right in the heart of the loop, and only a few blocks from my wife's favorite attraction, the Art Institute of Chicago. Also this is where she stayed last time we had a "couple" visit, two months before our first child was born, so I knew she liked it. Upon check-in they were extremely courteous (in part due to my Gold Starwood status), and when my wife mentioned it was her birthday, they not only gave us a room upgrade (offering the west side with more ambient sunlight, or the east side facing the courtyard with more quiet; Ed note: the west side faces the El, which is why the "darker" courtyard is quieter), but also offered us a selection of wine/cheese/fruit options. She chose champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries. Upon returning from our touristing that day, the chilled champagne and fruit were waiting. I never like to write a review without some constructive notes. First the hotel building is old (although it's been fully modernized), so the outside walls tend to be very cold in the winter. Opening the closet door felt like opening a refrigerator. The should consider more insulation. Also, the water closet is a bit small relative to modern hotels. We will of course return. I haven't even mentioned the trendy, nightclub feel of the lobby.
