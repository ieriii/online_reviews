I stayed here in May og 09 because I got a free stay. Yes, it was free. My company is in the Aon Center (which is connected) and they gave all us administrative assistants a tour, lunch in the Aria restaurant and a free one night stay. Anyhow, I had a king room on the 29th floor with a park view. The park view is high on my list of things that do not suck - I get no view at work since I don't have an exterior office. The bed was awesome. It was like sleeping on a puffy cloud on a warm sunshiney day in heaven. We also decided to splurge on room service. I got a steak. It was done the perfect shade of medium rare. It was also crazy pricey. $113 for my meal and my BFs meal. However, when I called they were all "How may I help you, Ms. Diggs" Which I totally got a kick out of. Maybe they were being extra nice to me because of the nature of my visit and due to the fact that our companies have a deal, but they brought me up a complimentary Perrier and a fruit plate. Not a fan of the Perrier, but the fruit was delish! I did buy some snacks and beverages at Bockwinkles (this was before the CVS was opened - it opened two weeks later) because I didn't want to pay for anything in the mini-bar, but I do expenses for a lot of travelers at my work and I knew those items would be vastly overpriced. The room was pretty big, the toilet had its own separate area from the shower and bath, and the food was good. I have no complaints. I'd stay there again if I came into some money or wanted to have a nice weekend with my BF on the town.
