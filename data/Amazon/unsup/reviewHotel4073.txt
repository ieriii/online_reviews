This is a convention galore hotel. It's impersonal, but for $65/night with a view, I'm not complaining! I got lucky with the view. The spacious room was probably bigger than a studio rental in SF. The king size bed was so comfy that I actually ended up sleeping in until 11 am some days! The Hyatt is conveniently located near the El trains and buses, which makes it easy to get around. It neighbors many of the tourist's attractions: Millennium Park, Navy Pier. the Magnificent Mile, etc... The Hyatt's lobby is beautifully laid out with a dining area encircle by a zen-like pond with delicately "spitting" waterfalls. You can watch t.v. while waiting or just relaxing on the many sofas and chairs. Their bar offers a stunning backdrop view of the city.  Once again, this is a hotel with lots of conventions so to get from point A to B, may take 10 mins, but the majority of all convention hotels are like that. The difference is that you get a lovely view on your way there. Tip: Purchase the unlimited transit passes. DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR into Chicago. Chicago has one of the best public transit systems that I've experienced. Besides, it'll cost you at least $40 or more to park your car overnight at the hotels. I'm in love with Chicago, will have to visit soon!
