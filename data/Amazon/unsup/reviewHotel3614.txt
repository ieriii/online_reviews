I seem to stay at The Drake during nice weather days only. It is on the South end Of Michigan Ave, and a short way onto one of my favorite running routes: Lake Michigan. It seems to be authentic. It is, however, now the Hilton Drake, which could be an ominous sign for any vestige of uniqueness. The ambiance is striking in a refined traditional manor. A woman was playing the harp in the bar, which is nice The rooms are decent, but you are paying for location. If it is freezing cold outside stay at The House of Blues.
