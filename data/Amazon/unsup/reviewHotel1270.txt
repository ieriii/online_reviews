This Best Western is the closest hotel to McCormick Place other than the Hyatt McCormick, but it is not exactly walking distance to McCormick Place. This decent hotel at the southern edge of downtown is well situated if you are going to the museums or to Soldier Field, but you are away from the shopping action of the Magnificent Mile.
