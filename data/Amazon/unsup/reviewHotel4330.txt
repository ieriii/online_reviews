Beautiful lobby with impressive ceiling.. Great Location. (next to 2 train lines) Superb toiletries.. Can we say Peter Thomas Roth? And yes, I'll confess, I helped myself (stole) a few hand lotions from the maid's cart.. Comfy bed. Not the heavenly but the kind you can sink into nevertheless. Vent-less bathroom.. My biggest gripe.. Put it this way, bathroom is right next to the bed.. Husband takes care of business and opens door. Omg, shoot me! Now!
