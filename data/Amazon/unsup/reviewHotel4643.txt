Stayed here on my mini-vacay with my OG BFF. Found a really good deal on Expedia and it only cost $200/each from a Thursday to a Sunday. Situated on the corner of W Huron and N Clarke St, the hotel is in a pretty good location. A block or 2 away from Hard Rock Cafe, Rainforest Cafe and the BIGGEST double-decker McDonald's (open 24/7 - and I'm not just talking drive-thru) I have ever seen in my entire life!!! It's several walking blocks away from the Magnificent mile, and other tourist attractions, but completely walkable if you have the right pair of shoes.  Staff are extremely friendly and professional, the hotel lobby is small, but classy and the amenities are nice (no pool though). As with any major metropolitan city hotel, the rooms run small so I gave it 3 stars, but on the upside they are kept pristinely clean. They even provide eco-friendly bottled water in the room, but don't drink it or accidentally lose it behind furniture...they will charge you $2.50/bottle upon checkout. Next time I'm in town, I'll probably stay here again. =)
