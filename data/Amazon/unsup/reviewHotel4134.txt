Priceline sent us here when we booked through Priceline (name your own price) and this stay was definitely worth it! Though the sheer size of this place is enough to make you feel like a small fish (2100 rooms, what?!) the room we stayed in was quite large and spacious.  Linens were clean and crisp, beds were comfortable and downy, and our room was SUPER quiet and dark. Granted, we were in the west wing, and had a nice view into the neighboring business high rise. If you're like me, you'll spend half your time in the morning watching all the people laboring away, and be glad you're not them.  The staff was very helpful and the woman at the check in counter supplied me with a map and a detailed list of neighboring parking garages. Valet is 50 dollars here. Though the thought of unlimited in/out privileges is appealing, spare yourself a bunch of cash and park at one of the other spots. Millennium garage, directly behind Hyatt and next to the little grocery store, is 30/overnight. Its indoor, clean, and safe! There are reduced rates for being there 12 hours or less. The hotel is also located very close to the infamous Michigan Avenue, where you will find the art museum, millennium park, numerous fancy-pants boutiques and stores. Plenty of sights to see, lots of people to watch, and just a quick walk back to your room. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.
