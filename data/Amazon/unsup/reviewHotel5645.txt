We went to the Westin for an over night stay. The hotel was very nice. Our room was very comfortable and the bed was very nice. We both got a good night sleep which is usually not the case at a hotel. The only charge that we thought was high was the parking fee. It was $52 to park our car over night. It would have been cheaper to go another route. Check in and out times were very decent.
