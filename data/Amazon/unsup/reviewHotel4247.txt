Absolutely beautiful, elegant and amazing hotel. Super accommodating and great views from some of the rooms. Here's all the details: The hotel is just gorgeous inside. The main lobby area has a really high ceiling and you can tell that a lot of time and detail was put into this hotel. There is a bar and lounge area which is just as nice. This is not a modern and trendy hotel, it is an elegant hotel.  Service is phenomenal as well. The front desk was so kind to me and understanding that I was freaking out because it was my boyfriend's 30th birthday and I wanted everything to be perfect. I called to ask them to put some more ice on the champagne in our room because dinner ran late and they did, no questions asked!  The rooms are really nice and you can tell that everything is of good quality.  It is a large hotel, so sometimes the elevator may take an extra minute or the line to check in at exact check in time might be long, but it is all worth it. It's in a great location as well, right in the downtown loop area. Walking distance to almost anything your hear desires.  Take a cab everywhere that's far if you're from out of town so you don't get lost on the wrong train. :)  I have been here for a wedding before and that was amazing as well.  The hotel is a bit pricey, but worth it.
