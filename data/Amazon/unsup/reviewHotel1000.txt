I've stayed at The Amalfi many times since it first opened. The main reason is that it is centrally located right in the heart of downtown; 3 blocks from The Merchandise Mart where I usually work and only slightly further from all the fabulous shopping on Michigan Avenue. Conveniently located right across the street from Harry Carreys and right next door to Keefers...both great choices for food and drink. My only problem is that the hotel is in desperate need of an upgrade...it literally hasn't changed since I first stayed here 5 days ago. Still, the best value for any hotel in this location!
