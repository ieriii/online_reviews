Huge hotel. Very nice. Parking situation is a rip off($55 to valet per day or $45 to self park). Our room was large, clean and had all the amenities you'd need. We got a great deal on priceline for a room on a Saturday night of $100(plus another $23 in taxes). If I got a "deal" on a room I'd definitely stay here again. Great location in proximity to many restaurants, bars and parks in downtown.
