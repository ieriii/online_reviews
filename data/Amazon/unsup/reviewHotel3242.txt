HRH, located just south of the river & Mich Ave, is like a mullet of a locale: one part Loop, close enough so you can go to the office; one part miracle mile, close enough so you can shop & eat & be a stupid tourist. Solid 3.5 star hotel. The front desk staff is Post-Office-counter slow & not terribly brilliant, but friendly, managing to get the job done. (Eventually.) Ditto for the valets. Rooms are modern, rock-hip furnished, comfy beds but overly squishy pillows. Agree w/ Gregory M., sheets are way over-starched. Bathroom is nice, but lighting is awful (dim & overhead spotlight) so if you desire nice lighting for hair & makeup, you'll be disappointed. Also, you can hear every door in your hallway closing & opening, so be sure to ask for a quiet room if you're a light sleeper. BASE bar always has a crowd, so if you're into that, you're in luck. If you're looking for a chill bar, head to Morton's next door.
