I came here last night to listen to my boy play records. I otherwise would probably have never come here - it has been off of my radar and my friend's radars for whatever reason. Well, my boy - being excited about starting a regular thursday night gig there - was excited enough about the place that I figured I'd go take a look see for myself. I knew with my boy there playing music that my ears, at least, would be happy. After all, he was put on this earth by god herself to play house music :). And, I was put on this earth by god herself to listen. The space itself is perfect! High ceilings, perfectly lit, intelligently and pleasingly decorated, relatively smoke free, and a nice open floorplan that makes moving around very easy. This was a Thursday night and the place was comfortably populated - male, female, gay, & straight hotties everywhere. A real nice crowd. Apparently a new sound system is on the way - not an absolutely necessary improvement but louder and clearer is always better right? :) The only reason I won't give five stars is because of the damn drink prices. HELLA EXPENSIVE! The crowd was surprisingly diverse. As some others have mentioned - there is definitely a creative streak allowed in terms of style of dress for men and women. I don't think you'll feel comfortable in a ball cap and gym shoes but there is freedom to express yourself otherwise. Best part of the night - I met a 6' tall blonde girl and her name was Yolanda! For real! We didn't get along so well because I couldn't stop fucking laughing :). How fucked up is that? ;) Me: Hey there, whats your name? Girl: Yolanda Me: *gasp* I'm sorry, what was that? Girl: *louder and slower* Yo-lan-da Me: Oh, hi Yolanda, my name is Johnson. *stupid grin on my face* Yolanda: Johnson? Is that your first name? Me: Yeah, Johnson baby, Johnson :) *bigger stupid grin on my face* We didn't talk much after that :)
