I stayed here because from the suburbs to drive back and forth for a conference in downtown is a hastle. I stayed with a co-worker and I think our opinion of this place is the same. This place, from the outside, has a tacky feeling to it. It looks old and I didn't want to stay but the girl I was with said it was cheap and FREE parking. Inside, it's not much better. It's dingy and I felt the room was too small. The front desk people were well enough. They didn't look too happy but they gave us place to visit while we stayed. The view from our hotel room sucke. Did I really want to wake up facing a dirty alley? NO. My car was safe and sound and the "consierge" (sp?) was great. But the money I saved on the parking, I would have rather taken it, spent a little more, and stayed at a classier hotel.My experience wasn't TERRIBLE, but I won't stay here again.
