I apologize if this evaluation is in the wrong place, but I didn't see an entry in Yelp for the bar/restaurant, as opposed to the hotel. I visited the bar at The Talbott two nights ago after dinner across the street at Feast. If Yelp had a 6th star, the staff here would have earned it! Although their drink list is still in the process of being refined by the bar's new mixologist, Danny (the bartender) whipped up several delicious drinks that really hit the spot. He -- along with the rest of the staff -- were polite, helpful and fun. I'll definitely go back.
