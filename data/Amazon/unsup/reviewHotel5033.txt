So lets just say you will not miss the big "W" protruding from the hotel while driving down Lakeshore Drive.... From the moment we pulled up to VALET the car (may I add, it is ridiculous charge and should be cheaper for hotel residents... $40...but hey its the chi) anyways, It reminded me of a Miami vibe....with the shell mosaic shingles on the hotel front wall that glisten (I love) to the outside quarter to the right when you walk-in filled with posh plush retro couches and pillows (def a Miami wanna be). CHECK-IN: was a breeze...although had problem con my room keys at first, but problem easily resolved with the friendly concierge. It is a small hotel and the BLISS SPA is nice too (of course pri$ey) but I have been to way better spas in other hotels. So save your dinero!!! The bar located on the main floor is also filled with an upscale trendy crowd Now the part you should really care about...dun dun dun.... ROOM: very modern, beautiful, small, amazing view (request Lakeshore) but very comfortable...you will def have a great nite's rest....plushy very soft beds and pillows and Gorgeous marble bathroom filled with the hotel spa products "Bliss" with open french windows....You can see in your bathroom from your room or vice versa (weird but a nice touch). Overall, I liked it and I got a great deal on the room (hotwire) so not complaining!!! =)
