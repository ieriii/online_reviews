This is a very historic hotel that caters to the well off. My personal experience was interesting & rewarding yet unsatisfying. Obviously I have special needs with my disability yet the job to accommodate that was feeble at best. The bathrooms are small and few & difficult to navigate. There are even stairs and NO ramp to one of the main lounges featured bar. Top it off this is the downstairs.. Now Imagine how bad the rooms are for the disabled. They charge for everything.... the wifi even in the main lobby has a ridiculous fee. Lets not even get me started with the parking... LOL With the "rich history" comes a lack of vision toward the future. The atmosphere was stimulating & stuffy. The people were down to earth but yet on another planet. The staff where great, but that is what you expect for such a pricey hotel. Food was good but pricey as where the drinks. Location was well what can I say it is the tourist center of downtown.
