This hotel is getting 3 stars mainly because of the location. Because the customer service is nothing they should be proud of - that's for sure! The room was nice enough, clean and bright but very small, as were the beds. Our bathroom door did not shut properly which was fuckin' irritating. What I want to know is how you can say you have a martini bar with 50+ martinis and not make a cucumber martini? WTF! We stayed here four nights and it wasn't that bad. We got an OK deal on Priceline. But basically I would not CHOOSE this hotel to stay at again and the MAIN reason (HOTEL MANAGERS I HOPE YOU"RE LOOKING AT THIS) is because the check-in staff and front desk staff were incredibly rude, very disorganized and generally not appearing to be that interested in customer service. These people need MAJOR MAJOR training. I had to wait over 25 minutes for them to "find" a package which I stood there looking and pointing at the entire time. This was especially not cool because I told them immediately when I asked for the package that I pointed to, I needed to be in my cab outside to head to an event... which I was then late to.
