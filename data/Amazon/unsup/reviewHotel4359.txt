This place was disappointment to say the very least. At first glance it looks grand and ornate, but don't look too closely or you will be sorely disappointed. Front desk check/reception was rude, arrogant and reluctant to be helpful. Did I mention RUDE? On a positive note, the housekeeping staff was first class, professional and very helpful. In my humble opinion, the housekeeping staff should switch positions with the front desk employees and this place would be, without a doubt, five stars. I will avoid Hilton's whenever possible. Based on rudeness and arrogant front desk , I would have given a minus star if I knew how.
