The hotel is nicely appointed but I did not find the rooms to be functional at all. The room was small, the closet so small I couldn't fit my carry-on suitcase in it and pants could not hang straight down without hitting the safe. Besides the desk, there are really no places to put anything since the nightstands are so small and with the lamp on each one leaves no room for anything else. No dresser - the only drawers were in the tiny nightstand. There was no space in the bathroom for toiletries. Somehow I got a handicapped bathroom, so it was huge but had no space at the same time. I do have to say that the water in the shower/tub was really hot. The menu in the restaurant didn't look all that great to me and was slightly overpriced. There is a wine reception from 4:30-5:30 each day and the bar/lounge area was nice for a drink. The location is great - right in the middle of Michigan Avenue. This is my new corporate hotel, so we'll see if I got a flukey random room this time and will get a better room next time. I'll be visiting the Allerton often in the future.
