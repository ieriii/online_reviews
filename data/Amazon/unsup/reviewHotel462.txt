The location for this hotel is perfect- I love staying here when I come to the city. The people who work here are friendly, and are very accomodating. The last time I stayed I arrived two hours before check in and they let me come in early with no fee. On another occasion they kept my luggage safe for me when I got there early and the room wasn't ready. The lobby and rooms are great- I've been here for a romantic getaway and also for a couple of girls trips and the rooms are great for both. The complimentary breakfast and open bar hours are also fabulous perks of this hotel. It is my favorite place to stay before a Bears Game!
