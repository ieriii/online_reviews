This was my 2nd stay so an updated review. WIFI is still free and this time is was very fast. A definite upgrade from last time. I was on the 23rd floor with a corner suite. The room was spacious with a separate living area and bedroom. A couple complaints about the room: - The sliding doors between the living and bedroom never stayed open and would constantly slide closed. -The living area was very large but a lot of wasted space. There was a kitchen area which was nice and also 3 tall bar stools. However, they were randomly placed and there was no bar or a kitchen table to use them with. I feel as though someone took the table out and never replaced. -TV selection really small and only 1 remote was annoying -Phones did not work in the room and when told they never came to fix. Overall, I'll stay again. The restaurant, AJA is good. The check in is quick and the service is great. The rooftop is very nice. The location is awesome. An easy walk down state and to michigan. lots of good eats and shopping nearby as well.
