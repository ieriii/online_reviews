It's a bit far. I did priceline, so it was okay. It was a 10 minute walk to Pink Line, and 0.5mile walk to blue line. They do have shuttles but they run only on the hour and half. Great if you have people at the hospital. My sister liked how big the room was. Love that it was a non-smoking building. They provide Bath and Body Works shampoo. Downside: no free wi-fi. There is a computer you can use downstairs to check email, and another computer to print your boarding pass. I think past midnight, they lock the sliding doors so you have to show the receptionist your key card before she'll open it. That was a bit annoying. Rooms are clean, neat, white. Lots of lights available. We had a fridge in our room which was nice. The hair dryer was ionic and ceramic :) And they do have coffee/ tea in the room. No complementary breakfast. The walls are thin which may just be all of Chicago, but anytime someone leaves the room you can hear it shut. For the price, which was less than 180/ night, not bad. Which I could find a place closer though to other amenties, but it gave me a chance to explore that side of Chicago. I give it a four based on the neatness of the room, the fridge, and all. Receptionist did not seem that welcoming or friendly, they just were doing the job. not very helpful in getting to places but it's okay I asked other people. That's it.
