I've stayed here a few times and its been great every time. I live in the suburbs but sometimes its nice to stay in the city. Super comfy rooms, personable staff, excellent views of Navy Pier and the Chicago River and just steps from Michigan Ave. Starwood Preferred Guest members enjoy upgraded rooms, complimentary bottled water and other extras. The drinks at the bar are a bit pricey ($14 on average) but are plenty strong enough to make up for it. The hotel is also walking distance to Chicago favorites like Gino's East Pizza, Northwestern University and Piano Bar. Best part? Its in the exact same area as the Trump Hotel with rooms at 1/2 the price or less.
