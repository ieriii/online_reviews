There's not much to say about this place that hasn't been said already. It's just awful. I don't care how good the location might be, it's not worth it to stay in a dirty, stinky, scary-looking hotel. You can tell that it was once a fine establishment, but it's been let go for far too long and now just looks like something out of a horror film. We stayed here to save a few bucks, but we kicked ourselves for that. We'd rather have spent the extra money and stayed in a relatively nice place - AKA, anywhere else. I really don't understand how anyone could give this more than 2 stars (I guess one for location?), and certainly not 5 stars. Did we stay at the same place??
