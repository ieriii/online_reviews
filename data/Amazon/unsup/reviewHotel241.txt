Got this hotel through price line. Good location for what we needed and parking next door. Cute, but very small rooms.  We got there early and told that our room would not be ready until at least 3 or 4. We had to be ready and leave by 3, so I used the lobby bathroom to get ready. We were sitting in the lobby waiting for them to tell us our room was ready. After I got ready in the lobby bathroom, my husband went up to the gal again to ask her how much longer. She had a room for us right away. Ugh, you saw us waiting and me running back and fourth to the bathroom to get ready. So, we went up and put our stuff in the room and left.  Bed was comfortable and the bathroom is stocked with the usual.
