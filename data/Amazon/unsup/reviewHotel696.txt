We LOVE this hotel. Gorgeous, modern room, the absolutely perfect location in the city.... ended up here by accident when an east coast snowstorm landed us in Chicago and we couldn't be happier. Free wireless, laundry machines, super friendly staff, what more could you want? When our flight got cancelled a second time, we had to stay longer and they extended our great rate even though we were now going to be staying over a holiday. We were, of course, completely won over! But, yes, watch out for the heavenly scent of Garrett's popcorn hitting you right outside... we were fairly obsessed with getting some our entire visit!
