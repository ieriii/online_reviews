As a former resident of Chicago, I like to go back and visit frequently. And when I do, I always try to stay at the Heart O' Chicago. Decent accommodations for a very low price. The rooms simple and usually clean. Free wi-fi is a perk. Free parking right out front. The continental breakfast has improved over the years - what used to be tiny cups of coffee and a few donuts is now coffee, milk, juice, and plenty of food options. The biggest drawback is that the walls are QUITE thin (the last time I stayed there, my dad was in the room next door and we could have conversations with each other without yelling... yikes). But that's not enough to keep me away, and I'll continue to stay at the HoC for trips to come.
