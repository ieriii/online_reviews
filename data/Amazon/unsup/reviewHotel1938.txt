I went to a wedding here - simply beautiful - the setup was beautiful and elegant. The bride said that she worked with the planner there and they were very attentive to the little details that she wnated. The food was divine. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The bar is a great place to hit up for happy hour in the Loop, too.
