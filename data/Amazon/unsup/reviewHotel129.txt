I like the style of Whitehall much better than Seneca, it's also an older hotel but the style is a little bit more modern than Seneca. It's definitely worth your money if you are to pay the same for the Whitehall or the Seneca. The only reason they are up for comparison is because they are both within steps of the Hancock center and they are both very historical buildings. However, Whitehall just renovated it to be a little more modern and a little less creaky than Seneca. The lobby still retains its old world flair but the rooms have been updated to have plush beds and nice bathrooms. This is the perfect spot for a secret weekend getaway because it makes you feel like you have been hidden away, yet are steps from Michigan ave!
