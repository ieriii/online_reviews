Stayed here over a 3-day weekend. Interior is very modern, trendy, and has an upscale feel for Gen X & Y-types. This place reminds me a bit of the W-Hotel chain, but not as trendy. The Bad:  The room was fairly small. Disappointing. The desk and bathroom tops were not very clean - they were full of stains. The biggest annoyance during my stay was how thin the walls were. I could literally hear the girls next door complaining about how some guy wasn't giving them any attention at the club - word for word. I dont wanna hear any conversations from next door when I want to fall asleep (after 1am?) especially when the going rate is $160+ a night. Oh, and I could clearly hear a couple having sex on another side of the room. Nice. (not really)  Advice to management: install more sound insulation between rooms. The Good: Service is friendly and attentive. The hotel provides free wine (to guests) in the lobby at 5pm. Nice.  There is a lounge called Encore on the first floor (didnt go, but it looks like a nice place to hangout for a drink). Hotel provides a nice breakfast every morning, including plenty ice water (with lemon) in the lobby and freshly-popped popcorn in the afternoons. Location is next to the Chicago theater district and is fairly close to all the tourist spots. For $160+ a night, I expected a little more. Not sure I will come back here, unless I get a great deal. For the most part, the hotel is fine, but dont expect a quiet space in your room. If you are looking for peace and tranquility, you may want to look elsewhere.
