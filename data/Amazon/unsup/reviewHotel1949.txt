The location of this W is great- it's downtown, so very accessible to Loop areas. The rooms are very nice, with white cabinets/shelves in the room and plenty of space. The big issue I have with this property is the layout of the lobby area. There's not a lot of space, and the path to the check-in desk and elevators is not very intuitive. Note: I am on a personal mission to stay at every W Hotel in the USA (and then hopefully branch out to worldwide!)
