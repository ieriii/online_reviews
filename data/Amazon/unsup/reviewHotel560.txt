The Public is by all accounts an Ian Schrager hotel. Which is lovely....if you enjoy your bed on the floor and your bathroom miniscule. I don't. So I'm not the perfect Schrager-stayer so to speak. The bed feels like a futon, but the sheets were nice and soft. Decent TV and an ipod dock. NO ALARM CLOCK. Which is annoying. I want an alarm clock in my room please. Desk was not very user friendly and definitely not comfortable. Bathroom was teenie tiny and I ran out of hot water the first day at 7:30am. Apparently they had water heater issues that day, but they failed to let us know. On the plus side the little coffee bar is fabulous. Very good lattes. And the bar is cool and hip and has decent wine.  Overall, I like a little more comfort when I stay away from home. So I can't say that I loved the Public.
