Stayed at the hotel for an anniversary weekend staycation with my fiance. The room was nice and clean with a comfy bed and your usual hotel ammenities. The view was atrocious (a lovely construction site), so we just kept the curtains closed. We mainly stayed at this hotel because of the pool and their multiple restaurant options. Unfortunately during our stay the pool was freezing cold, there were only 4 total chairs available on the sun deck that were all occupied, and Shor was the only restaurant open during our stay (the food and service were more than subpar). We did get a really nice package deal, the romance package that included a bottle of sparkling wine, a chocolate fondue, and breakfast for 2 the next morning with late checkout. While the items included in the package were great, we had to specifically request all of it. If we did not alert the front desk of this, we never would have received any of it. I don't understand the point of having preferance selections when you book online if no one is actually going to pay attention to them. Overall, would I stay at this hotel again for a staycation? No, probably not unless there was some sort of great deal. Would I visit the restaurant again? Hell to the no. Would I recommend this hotel- sure, but only if you're here for a convention at McCormick place.
