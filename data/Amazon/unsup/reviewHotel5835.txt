I stayed here last Sunday (April 26) with my friends while we were visiting Chicago and I was not impressed one bit. Our experience started off over the phone where my friend called to see if we can get an early check-in. The front desk clerk who took answered the call was quite unprofessional and sounded like she dumb founded, so my friend hung up. The check-in seemed to be fine until we actually went to our room. The bellman helped us to our original room (1423) and was very courteous and informative. When we finally opened the door to our room, immediately we smelled a stench of either vomit or rotten milk. *uGh* GROSS. We questioned the bellman to see if he can smell the odor and he said no and proceeded to call the house keeping. I did not like the fact that the bellman sounded a bit rude when he stated over the phone "the guests in 1423 thinks there's an odor in here, but I don't smell anything and I am highly sensitive of any stench." I'm sorry, but if there was really no odor, would you really think I'd waste my time fussing over the room when I could be around town. After the call was made, the bellman told us if there was anything wrong he was sure they would be able to accommodate us and still refused that there was an odor in our room and said all the rooms smelled like that. The bellman left and house keeping came in with his spray bottle in his hand. Of course, right away he smelled the odor and we pretty much told him that won't help. So we called the front desk to make arrangements for a new room. Little did we know that we were going to get moved to the 10th floor which had the stench of cigarettes throughout the floor. *uGh* gross. We pay the suppose "4-star" price at a non-smoking hotel for a reason and I felt like we stayed at a 2 or 3 star MOTEL because of the service and uncleanliness of the hotel. I honestly wished we would of just booked two nights at the Wyndham.
