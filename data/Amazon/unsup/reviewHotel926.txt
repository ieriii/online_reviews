This was my first trip to Chicago so I really loved this hotels downtown location. It was walking distance to all the famous shopping, the river, river taxi stops, the beach and Navy pier.  I also loved the comfy beds and quiet room. I thought it was rather expensive for the size of room you get but am told that Chicago is almost as pricey as NYC, so $150 a night wasn't a bad deal. The valet parking is $36 - which you have to get if you rolled into town in a car. However; that I am told, isn't that expensive either. They don't serve a complimentary breakfast which is a bummer, but our room did have a bath-tub. One minus, one plus. All-n-all, we had a lovely stay.
