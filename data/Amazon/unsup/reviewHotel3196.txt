This place uses a modern motif for its interior designing. I stayed here in the winter when they still had a $109 corporate rate. I thought to get that rate and be right off Lakeshore is a deal. Checking in was smooth the front desk staff were polite. They handed my card key and directed me to the elevators to get up to my room. The lobby area bar doubles up as a lounge and they were playing chill lounge/electronic music. I was liking it. I wish I had the CD. Anyhow, I take elevator up to my floor; I step out; I'm staring down this long dark hallway and I feel like I'm in some Freddie Cougar movie. The hallways are damn dark and it's just eerily silent. I feel like I'm in some haunted house at a theme park. I make it to my room and open the door to my surprise the room looks pretty clean. I still have a wierd complex about walking on hotel floors in my barefeet. It gives me a nasty feeling about what i'd find if i had a black light with me.  I also take the top comforter and toss that into the closet because I always hear that hotels don't change the bed comforters as often as the bedsheets. So i've just developed this habit of routine everytime I get to my hotel room. Bust out the flip flops cus I ain't touching the floor and out goes the comforter. The rooms also have an LCD TV, but what's the point of one if they're just gonna give you shitty channels to surf through and the delays to change a channel makes almost watching TV painful. Overall this hotel wasn't all that and I expected it be way more modern chic. The staff were polite though. I've never eaten here so I can't rate how good their food is. There's plenty of restaurants when you get towards Michigan. Again, since this is a downtown hotel and if you have a car, the parking fees are going to be a bitch.
