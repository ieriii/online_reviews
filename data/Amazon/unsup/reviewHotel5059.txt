This is a cute smaller hotel in downtown. The staff is very courteous and pleasant. Everyone from the doorman to the receptionists seem to be very genuine. Most of my experience is with their banquet facility on the 2nd floor. It is a very nice space. Didn't end up spending any time in any of the rooms, but if I ever had a need I would definitely consider James Hotel.
