The one star is merely for the beautiful lobby and the fact that this is a Chicago landmark. I stayed here for the NYE party this past weekend and I was astonished by the poor service and rudeness we received from the staff. They oversold the event so it took waiting in line to do almost anything. I went to the bathroom right before midnight and the men guarding the doors refused to let me back in. They said the room was at capacity. How can that even happen? If you were responsible enough to only sell enough tickets that the main room wouldnt be at capacity then I wouldnt have spent $ 140 to be standing in a hallway by myself on new years stone cold sober. They wouldnt allow alcohol in the hotel rooms and if they found any reminants they would charge a $ 60 corkage fee. So greedy! Now back to the staff and maintenance. The conceirge had no idea when check out was, the starbucks staff yelled at me for no apparent reason and when we checked under the bed to make sure we didnt leave anything behind we found dirty dishes with food still stuck to them,an empty ice cream carton, and a bunch of used glasses. DISGUSTING!!!! Who knows long those dishes had been there. I will urge out of town guests never to stay in this digusting terrible place.
