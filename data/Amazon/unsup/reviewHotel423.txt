Just stayed up in this hotel for a national conference being held at the McCormick center, the hotel is within walking distance from the convention center and also very close to the 29 bus that leads all the way down to Navy Pier. The room was just OK, it wasn't the nicest room I have stayed in or the worst. Guest services were always nice to us. The room was clean and looked like they were recently updated, but they really need to get HD TV Channels, and for thirty minutes one day the Internet was down. The water pressure in the shower was lacking as was the air conditioning from the unit in the room. Very easy also to get a taxi from this hotel, the only other thing is the restaurants from here were a long walk or short cab ride. One more note- the Internet access is unsecured.
