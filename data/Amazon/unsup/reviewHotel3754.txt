The only thing missing is a pool. There was a roof top with a cheezy bar that was sparsely populated. OK, that's the bad part. Amazing room design. The "mini" bar being not so mini meant we opened a bottle of wine just after we dropped our bags and hung out on the balcony drinking a Tempranillo. That's HOT!
