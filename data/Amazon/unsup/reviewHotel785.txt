The main reason to stay here is the location. It's right on Michigan Avenue, next to Hancock and Water Tower. Ultimate location to start any Chicago adventure. The hotel is newly remodeled, quite nicely I must add as I remember the old version (Hellloooo, pastels!) Hotel lobby is uber modern and clean, but unfortunately the meeting rooms don't necessarily match that feel. Rooms have also been updated, and I'm sure there is a premium for a lake or Michigan Avenue view. Probably not for the wall view I got! Beds super cushy comfy with tons of pillows, key. Reception was more than cool with my request to extend checkout until 2:00 p.m. and no housekeeping knocking on my door (a pet peeve). Went to a large event here and the catering and event department did a great job. As far as I could tell, quite smooth considering they were serving 75 sloshed Irish firefighters and their rambunctious dates.
