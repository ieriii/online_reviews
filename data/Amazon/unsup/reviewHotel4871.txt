My husband and I stayed here back in May and had a really pleasant experience. It was a really great deal ($140/night on Michigan avenue can't be beat) and the location was very convenient. Yes it was old. Yes the room was dated. But everything was clean, we had a decent view and the staff we encountered were all friendly. This is not a 5 star hotel and you don't pay for a 5 star hotel so don't expect that. If you expect a clean room, good service and a great location I don't think you'll be disappointed.
