I was really pleasantly surprised by this hotel! My husband and I live in Chicago, but decided to stay downtown the night we saw Conan O'Briens Tour and chose this place based on price and the fact that we could walk easily to the Chicago Theatre, not expecting much more than a basic room to sleep. It was very well decorated, very modern and comfortable, free wi-fi, a great flat screen tv and a rather large mini fridge. The front desk was very friendly. Really enjoyed our stay, and it certainly exceeded our expectations.
