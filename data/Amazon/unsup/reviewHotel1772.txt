Based on the other reviews we were expecting a very small room; this was not really the case. There was plenty of room for a desk, chair, king sized bed, minibar, a closet to put all our luggage in and more. The decor in the room and the lounge was fun and contemporary. The room was super clean and the housekeeping did an excellent job. The hotel has a free concierge and a free wine "social hour." They were able to hold our luggage for us all day long after we had checked out, also for free. We will be staying here again next time we go to Chicago. Tips: -Lobby is up one floor from ground level in the lounge. It's tricky to find at first. -Coffee is served in the lobby from the morning to 10am, if you are late risers and come to get coffee at 10:10, it will be gone.
