My friend and I had a fabulous stay at this quaint hotel last week. I received a gift certificate for a weekend stay so we took a road trip down from Milwaukee. The building is a restored beauty with antique touches and exposed steel bones. In fact, I learned that it is Chicago's first steel skyscraper. The location could not have been more centrally located and within walking distance to Millenium park and Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile. The room we had was lovely and clean and very quiet. For us the most impressive part of our stay was the friendliness of the staff. I highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here when I come back to Chicago.
