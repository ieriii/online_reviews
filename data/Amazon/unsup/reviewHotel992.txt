Great location & value! The rooms were clean and nicely arranged, the staff was friendly and helpful. My friend and I took advantage of their free breakfast every day. It was pretty good with croissants, danishes, juice, milk, tea, coffee, oranges, apples, etc. Their happy hour is nice, too. I only caught it once, but good drinks & snacks. The location is fantastic. We were only a short walk across the bridge from our conference. There's good restaurants nearby. Good stuff!
