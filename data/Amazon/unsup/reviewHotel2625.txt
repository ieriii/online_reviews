I will never stay here again. I've had better service at the best western. Where do I start... 1. Did not follow thru on a promotion running (stay 3 nights, get 1 free) even though we booked on time - we contacted the manager twice via email about adjusting our bill but never responded to us! Once they get your money at the time of reservations, forget about it after that. Their non refundable reservations are a bunch of BS! 2. Projection TV did not work 3. Toilet stopped working mid-stay 4. Maid service did not clean room one day -- arrived at 5pm after a day out on the town to find a dirty room. 5. Stained couches and filthy shag rug 6. My friend forgot a gift for her baby in the room, no one followed up with us about the forgotten gift. For a boutique and fashionable hotel, the service and follow through is horrible. Not worth your money at all! It was a horrible place to spend my birthday weekend in Chicago.
