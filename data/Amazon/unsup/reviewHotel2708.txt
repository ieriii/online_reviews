I don't even know where to start... this hotel was EXCELLENT!!! We spent our HONEYMOON at a suite at the FABULOUS James Hotel, Chicago. We arrived to rose petals everywhere including the shower, champagne and strawberries. It was VERY sexy! Checking in was incredibly fast, as was checking out. We felt like this hotel went above and beyond our expectations. The bed was FABULOUS and we are thinking of buying one with our wedding money:) I also didn't want to part with the deluxe robes, sheets or towels. If you are into any of the guest room amenities - you will LOVE the products they use and i hope you appreciate the linens as much as I did. If you like, fresh, clean, new, urban, cool spaces - you will LOVE this hotel.
