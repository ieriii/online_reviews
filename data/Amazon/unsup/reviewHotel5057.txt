My family and I booked into this hotel for our weeklong trip to Chicago. We are being charged $200 a night for the five of us, but I am not impressed. I was told that there was WiFi available, but not informed that it was an additional $10 per device per day to use. The free computer terminals, which I am using to write this review, have three computers and are quite busy most of the day.The Suite my family checked into was slightly cramped, and I had very little room. This hotel advertises as a "family-friendly hotel", and I guess that is who this is for, couples with small children and single businessmen. I shall not be returning here, and I would rreccomend the Embassy Suites on the Navy Pier, I have found it much cheaper.
