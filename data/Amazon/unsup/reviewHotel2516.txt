Great hotel. I highly enjoyed my experience here. The beds are so comfortable and I love the idea of 2 bathrooms. Although it was just me in the room, I could imagine how helpful it would be if my husband were with me. We ate in both restaurants and hung out at the bar several times. All staff was very accommodating and friendly. The food was very good. In the morning, the bar turns into a makeshift breakfast area with fruit, muffins, coffee, juice, etc. Still a little pricey, but gives you a break from the $22 breakfast buffet in the restaurant. I love that they use Crabtree & Evelyn bath products. I always load up when I go to a Hilton. Hey, you've got to get your money's worth, right? It's not like I take towels or anything! There is no refrigerator or safe in the rooms. I found this a little odd. There is a mini bar, but I stay away from those things. Other than that, my stay was great!
