Loved staying here for the perfect location, is centrally located to meet all your needs of good food and shops. The hotel needs a little bit of remodeling but what can you say about a hotel that has been around for years and is so "Iconic", they planned on remodeling is what the gentlemen stated, so will see on our next trip. The staff was very friendly and the concierge set up reservations at a great steakhouse. Will be back.
