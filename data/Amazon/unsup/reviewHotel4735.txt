dare I say orgasmic? not so much on the sexual sense but rather on the sense of that intimate peak between two people, the breaths intertwined, souls lost into each other. yes, I know this is not a playboy forum and I don't expect it to play out as such, but, the conversation. Is rather, titillating, arousing, intense. A mental foreplay, that unfortunately leaves me wanting more. Yet, well worth the while, you are best served to leave this bar for your last call. Yes I know, some clown bragged about mimi, mimi this, mimi that, no. SUSIE, this displaced blond from california, with dreams in her eyes, emotions on her shoulders will engage you in your best drunken whimsical best. No matter your sense of being, drunk, stupidly drunk, saying what we believe to be golden wisps of of wisdom to anyone that would hear our sprawl, but instead of tallying us as another drunken drunk, Suzy entertains our inner demons, our hidden poets, our honest child, whatever it is that lurks in our drunken being, suzy nurtures that spirit. Where others may pass us by as silly or funny, archaic, Suzy will push us, see where our drunken dialogue leads us. Banter us, even. I hit alot of bars today, wanted to lay waste to chicago before I left, glad I saved last call to this little gem. Mimi this, mimi that. bah, humbug Suzy rocks. drink up, hit this bar. This little blond from california is rather spicy.
