We stayed here because the hotel was convenient but it's definitely not a Westin.  We received an "upgrade" and had a great view. But the room was absolutely awful. Flushing the toilet was an ordeal as it was so noisy. The flat screen TV was in contrast to the aging furniture and decor.  For the amount of money we were paying, the value was minimal.  Despite having a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, housekeeping called to ask a question. What's the point? The front desk gave a room key without checking ID, which is very scary.
