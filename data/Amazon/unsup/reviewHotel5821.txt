We stayed in the motel because of it's convenient location. Although it was a bit rundown, low lighting in the bathroom, no shampoo, low security on the windows (no screen when we opened it), it was OK the first night. However, when we returned in the evening for the second night we discovered there was no parking space available. We were told to double-park, and if the other person who owned the other car wanted to get out, we would be called to move our car regardless of the hour. When we complained that we were never informed of that problem, we were verbally harassed and threatened. We will never go back, will inform AAA personally. Don't stay here folks. Evanston is not that far, actually cheaper most night at the Best Western, and you'll be treated well.
