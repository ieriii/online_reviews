The Intercontinental Chicago needs a lesson in Feng Shui. The room with double beds was small (not surprising considering it is a hotel in the city). Unfortunately the trick of using mirrors to expand a room was used ineffectively. Right next to the bed was very large mirror that took up practically the whole wall. I swear I didn't sleep well because of that. The only thing that the mirror accomplished was to highlight the circus like drapes of the room. I happened to like the whimsical decor but I didn't like having bad dreams. Unlike the mirrors in the bedroom, the Intercontinental is in an excellent location. It's right on Michigan Avenue and if you're into shopping then you're in luck. Bloomingdale's, Saks and American Girl are right next door. If you need to ride the L train it is also not too far away. The hotel has a fabulous pool fit for royalty. It's olympic sized and surrounded by Spanish tiles. The only thing missing was a poolboy who'll fan you and feed you grapes. Sadly, I was not able to spend some time poolside or in the water. The Intercontinental is a decent hotel to stay in. It's a reputable chain on the higher class end. The Chicago location, however, is slightly underwhelming.
