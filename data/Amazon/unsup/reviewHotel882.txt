You can't do better than the Burnham for excellent service and accommodations. From the moment you arrive, you're in for a treat as they literally make you feel relaxed, at home and without a care. Emil, Suze, Darnell, Liz, Ben; nicest people you could know; Ray is a terrific bartender, and Vane excels at all he does. Coming back for the NATO Summit in May, should have made reservations by now. But Jack Marvin, the Front Desk Manager, says, just email me, we'll take care of it. Can't get better than the Burnham!
