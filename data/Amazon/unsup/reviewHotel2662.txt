Really enjoyed my stay at the James Hotel. I don't usually stay at hip modern dcor spots, but the beds were comfortable and the shower had a nice stream of hot water and the rooms were spacious enough and that's really what I care about. I'd like to tell you about the cookies, but my roommate ate them all. It is right in the heart of tourist stuff, which might not be hip, but I was a tourist so it worked out for me.  Was able to walk to one of the many walking tours that Frommers has on their website. Right there, did you read that, that was probably the most important part of the review. Whenever you visit a city, check out Frommers' walking tours (or some similar travel site, most of 'em have them). They're great. And if you stay at the James, they don't charge you to use the business center, so if you go to Chicago and stay at the James, you don't even have to do any preplanning to arrive, unless you plan on doing the architecture boat tour, which sells out. Anyhoo, my only complaint is that the elevators are slow. Too many floors and too many people. Time to get one of those fancy elevators where you tell the elevator which floor you're going to before you enter into the elevator. I've only been on 2 of those types of elevators and now that I've been on them, I think any new building is flawed if they don't have them. I'm getting tired of stopping at every floor, that I'll either stay on the lower floors or will act like the woman on the southwest commercial and hit the door close button as people approach. That's not actually true, but I've felt like doing that. The most important thing to know though is that the most important celebrity to Yelp fans stayed here. Yes, I ran into Fabio in the lobby of the hotel. Yes the same Fabio who sadly was stuck working with Michael Chiarello. If you're not a fan of Fabio than you're probably should not be reading yelp. And that is the most rambling review I've ever posted. Time to quit.
