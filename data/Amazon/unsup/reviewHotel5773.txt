In the grand scheme of things this hotel was soooo not worth the 189 dollars + 28 for parking, internet fees of 10 dollars per day for a grand total of 231 per night not including taxes. The only reason they get away with ripping people is because of it's proximity to the school and people will pay or else. I've stayed at much nicer marriotts with better amenities with a reasonable price. I was there to attend a wedding. The valet staff was reasonably nice. But the desk staff was rude and unhelpful when they booked the bride & groom in adjoining rooms instead of on separate floors as requested. After they tried to put her out, I ended up giving her my room to appease everyone. The sad part was that they tried to chastise her and tell her if she had asked one of us earlier she wouldn't have had to cause such drama.
