I have now talked to some sort of manager named Abel. He was the only person employed at the hotel who seems concerned about how his employees are behaving. He asked me for times during which it all happened and specific details and then stated that he agreed for the most part that this was not acceptable. He stated that he was going to address these employees about their behavior and then asked what I would like done. I told him I just wanted my money back.  It has only been a few days, so I am trying to be patient at this point, but I still have not received my refund.
