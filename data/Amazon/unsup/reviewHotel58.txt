I had a good experience here, for the most part. The building is old, and I liked that. It had some character. The room was clean and comfortable, the price was right, and the people were friendly and efficient. A great location too. As noted by other reviewers, the room was chilly.  BUT -- I was really put off by their blatant misrepresentation about wi-fi. The web site says: "Complimentary high speed wireless internet access." I have posted a picture of the sign on the building that says "Fast Free HSIA," which must stand for high speed internet access.  And IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. When I checked in, the friendly desk clerk told me, standing not ten yards from that sign, that there was "slow" internet for free, but "fast" cost $6 an hour. She said the "slow internet was OK for checking e-mail, but that's about it. She was right. VERY slow.  It's not a big deal to me whether there is a charge for internet. But it is a HUGE deal to me that the hotel flat-out misrepresents what you get for your money. Very offensive.
