I enjoyed my stay at the Amalfi hotel. The only thing that I did not like about it was the lady who sits at the desk and greets/checks people in. She was kind of aloof and distant. Then later there was another woman at the front desk area who seemed the same way. That was weird to me. The hotel though was nice. They had some magazines,which I love, waiting in the room for me, some CDs, and a very nice robe to lounge around in. The bed was very nice. I could have fallen asleep in it seconds after my head hit the pillow. Oh yea, and I cant forget the the happy hour. The drinks were not all watered down as I would have expected. They were pretty good and top notch. I'd stay here again for sure.
