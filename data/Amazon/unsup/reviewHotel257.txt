This would not be my choice of hotels when coming to Chicago, but it is my companies choice. I will admit it is close to work and convenient to mass transportation to get to the locations I prefer socially, but let's talk about this hotel. Let's Make a List: 1. Good location, close to Union Station and mass transit. 2. Friendly staff and very good customer service. Always remember me. 3. Bed was very comfy, love a firm mattress. 4. Close to main highway could here traffic outside, but can still sleep. 5. Bathroom is postage stamp size. Had to close door to get in shower. 6. Restaurant off lobby is average. It's Italian, but they do breakfast too. 7. Free internet. Big plus for me. Can't be without my computer. 8. Green friendly. You can opt not to have sheets changed everyday and to use the same towel for a second day. 9. Nice fitness center. If your business is in The Loop and near Union Station, this is a good choice. My company knows a good deal when they find one.
