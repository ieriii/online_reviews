Second stay here and all was well. It was my birthday and after visiting our 4th floor room facing apts, a special request for a room with a view was cheerfully honored by CINTIA BECERRA at the front desk. She later sent a birthday card and cheesecake. Lovely.Another special nod to Jamael (?) who saw us wondering the historic tower and took time to answer question and unlock a few of the banquet rooms to show us around. Also took us to some of the conference areas and filled us in on the hotels history. Very nice man . Our room was clean, bed comfy plus and every staff member we encountered said hello and smiled. Little things mean alot when staying in hotels. Did I mention the historic pool? WOnderful!!
