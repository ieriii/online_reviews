Time for renovations. The only good thing about this hotel is the location and the fast elevators. When you step off said elevators you're greeted with worn and dated carpet that desperately needs to be replaced. Like another reviewer said, the hotel is set up in "prison cell block model where all the rooms are squared around the central atrium". This makes it quite loud as you get the noise from the atrium bar. The suites are small, depressingly dim and dated. The sitting area with no natural light reminded me of a cheap motel. With such a small space, it's beyond me as to why there are 3 sinks. One in the bathroom, one in a wet bar type area, and another free standing sink in the bedroom. There are better ways they could have used that space. There is no fan in the bathroom, so it steams up big time when you shower. (mold, anyone?) The cheap little hairdrier provided barely blows any air. Even the teeny wall mounted ones you find at most hotels work better. The sheets were nice but the pillows were not feather like their website says. Now free breakfast is good because it is free. However, the line for the made to order eggs was extremely long and slow, so we opted for the pre-made. The scrambled eggs were terrible. Powdered, Im sure, but again, free. What got me, was when the egg tray was almost empty, the manager brought out another and then promptly scraped the old eggs into the pan of new eggs prompting noises of disgust from me and other patrons in line. His reply was "What? it's not like people touched it with their hands." Classy. Luckily I paid for this stay with Hilton points. I would never spend real money here and will not be back.
