As mentioned, great location. Staff was great, cookies are a great touch and a nice room. Also, a small thing, but I do like the Neutrogena products. I was kind of surprised that the nice HD TV offered no HD programs. I also see how the mini bar could create a problem with unknown charges as mentioned. I overheard a lady talking in the restaurant how she must have moved something on the weight-sensitive trays and was charged. I don't know why they have to set it up that way. It should allow for a delay in case something is picked up and examined. Maybe five minutes. I was also a little disappointed that the free breakfast with my Gold status with Hilton was only a continental breakfast and to get anything hot it was an extra $6. The free for Gold members at the Hilton Garden Inn up the street was much better. Nice and hot in the Weber Grill Restaurant. Not a bad stay at all, but didn't blow my socks off. If price dictated I would stay again, but might not if price wasn't a factor.
