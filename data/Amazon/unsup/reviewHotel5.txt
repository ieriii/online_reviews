Disgusting!!! There is literally duct tape holding together the elevator. Crack heads live here.. not safe! Walked in, bought a room.. saw it and left. No locks on doors, no parking, no air conditioning, no way! For the $$ you pay for the room ($ 55 a night) and parking ($ 38 a night) you could stay down the street at The Ohio House and NOT sleep with one eye open. Would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. Seriously, DO NOT STAY HERE!
