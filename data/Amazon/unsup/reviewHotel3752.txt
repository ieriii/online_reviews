My company put me up in this hotel for Lollapalooza this year and I really enjoyed my stay at the Dana Hotel. Aside from the obvious positive attributes, such as the central location, modern decor, and amenities, the friendly staff really stood out. I am from Los Angeles, so I was not used to the Midwest hospitality that I heard so many good things about. Rooms were clean and spacious, maids were attentive, Whole Foods around the corner, nightclub at the top floor, 7-11 across the street... All these things help in making a hotel feel like home. Loved the restaurant at this place, Aja, and the waitress was so cool. I can't remember the exact details, but I remember being comped one of the sushi entrees during dinner, solely out of good will from the staff and me being indecisive about whether to order more food. It was a really warm gesture. Who doesn't like free food?! Breakfast at Aja was another highlight, with plenty of healthy, hearty options. The front desk seemed overwhelmed at times and I had to wait quite a long time to check-in, but all very minor, considering the overall pleasant stay.
