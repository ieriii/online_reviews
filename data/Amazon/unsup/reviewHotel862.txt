The Crowne Plaza Silversmith is a classy hotel in the Loop, across from the Jewelers Row area. The comfortable interiors are reminiscent of the Prairie Style of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Its main facade does face the "L" tracks, so you may get a good view but also an earful in the evening. Ada's is a decent downtown deli.
