It's a great place to stay for a holiday weekend shopping trip. The Historic, or south tower is the former Medina Athletic club. Be sure to check out the junior olympic swimming pool and browse the conference and meeting rooms in the Historic tower The interior decorating in this tower is definitely unique. Room service, while expensive, is very good. The lounge is comfortable and the staff is very accommodating. I'll definitely go back (and not just because I can stay for free)
