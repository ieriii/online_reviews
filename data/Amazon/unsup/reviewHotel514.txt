Stayed here a couple days to see the city before going to MI for a wedding. A suite that sleeps 6 (but 4 comfortably) for $149 was great. Very convenient downtown location, close to many things, including public transit (we took the bus, train and free trolley - which was sadly discontinued by the city yesterday). There was a fridge and microwave in the room, which came in handy after visiting Chicago restaurants, which served Chicago portions. (Also to keep the beer cold - buy that across the street at Dominick's/Safeway.) We stayed over the X-mas/New Year's holiday and the place was swarming with kids. It made the manager's reception (free select drinks and bar snacks for a couple hours) a little difficult since half the bar line was ordering "kiddie cocktails" aka Shirley Temples. A staff member commented that the place was always like that when school's out. The breakfast was also a little chaotic, but worth the wait. Cooked to order omelets and biscuits & gravy were hits with us. The pool and hot tub are open until midnight, which was nice. Parking at the hotel was expensive, so we used cabs, public transit and walked as much as the cold allowed. Surprisingly, the hotel charges $10/day for WiFi, so go across the street to the Starbucks inside Dominck's where WiFi is FREE. Also, you don't get to opt out of housekeeping, which was a little weird. And the ceiling fan was disgustingly caked with dust, which was also a little weird.
