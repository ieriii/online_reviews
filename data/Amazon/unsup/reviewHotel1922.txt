This is a great W to get a deal. I booked a $159 room for Easter night for business, and it came with a free Bliss Spa product. Pretty cool! They also had some really yummy hot sangria and little tiny sweet bites by the elevator for guests. I love that you can get that boutique feeling in a corporate hotel. This and the W at the lake are some of my favorite W hotels that I've stayed in.
