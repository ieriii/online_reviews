I was in one of the updated rooms and they were very nice. The room was clean, modern, and inviting.  It is a convenient location to Michigan Avenue, but it's almost as if once you cross to that side there's nothing there except the hotel, which seemed to attract some shady people standing around the corner asking for money to patrons heading back to the hotel. This was annoying. While the room was clean and modern, there is an issue with the really thin walls. I could hear everything in the room adjacent to mine. A man and woman were having a conversation and if I really wanted, I'm sure I could listen in and understand the words that they were saying. But I was headed out and had no real interest. Luckily at night it was quiet, but if you had some rowdy neighbors could totally see how this would affect the rating of this place.  I'm not sure that I'd voluntarily stay here again, but I wouldn't nix the idea either. There are better hotels in the area, but my experience here was fairly positive for one night.
