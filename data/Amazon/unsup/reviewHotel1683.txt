The newly remodeled Allegro is dead sexy. The small rooms add to its urban feel, and who doesn't like being able to wash her hands WHILE sitting on the toilet. Spacially, it's like an innovatively planned closet you might find in Tokyo or New York, which suits a short stay or romantic romp just fine. Stylistically, it's ultra modern and simple - the new classy. I appreciated the Aveda products and that there WASN'T a $7 bottle of Evian sitting on the night stand.  I'm just realizing in reading other reviews now that the walls are thin. I hadn't noticed any noises from other rooms...or the El which was practically next door, but it's probable that, given the booked-to-capacity status of the hotel, I may owe some neighbors an apology... It may behoove some to know that Allegro is one of many fine establishments you can book on Hotwire for half the price. Not that you can request it, but it's in the pool anyway.
