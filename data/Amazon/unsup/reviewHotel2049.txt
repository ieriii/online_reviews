Wife and I had our Wedding here in November and the Holiday Inn staff were the greatest to work with. Barbara Martin, their catering director, was the utmost professional and nicest person we could have wished to work with. She was very attentive to us with all our needs, and always calm and collective in such a hectic, fast-paced industry. We booked the Wolf Point Ballroom, on the 15th floor, which has a very nice view in the cocktail area, and the ballroom which has views towards the Sears Tower to the south and to the east towards the lake...both great views! The food was above average when it comes to hotel wedding food. You can't expect much since you know the food is sitting their in warmers ready to be served, but our Strip Steak and Chicken Picatta were both good and tasty with big portions. We also had a vegetarian or vegan option which was liked by those who chose them. In summary, if looking for a reception place for your wedding with a great view, good food, and a wonderful person to work with, the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza is a great place to consider!
