Stayed at Hotel 71 last weekend and had a really nice time. They upgraded us to a river view room since we were only staying a night. Very nice! The rooms are very sizable and have great amenities. I particularly loved the shower (overhead). The only negative I encountered with Hotel 71 is parking. Not surprising due to its awesome location. Parking is expensive and you cannot get your car on demand. For me it wasn't a big deal. There are a lot of parking options (and much cheaper!) if you're willing to walk a couple blocks.
