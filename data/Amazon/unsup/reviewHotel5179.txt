Overall, our experience was positive (great location, clean, unique decor) but there were a few things that needed improvement: 1). Standard room was WAY to small. Our king-size bed took up most of the standing room. Forget about using the ironing board...You practically have to stand on your head! Luckily my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and really didn't mind the close quarters...Had we been there for more than two nights, or had there been ONE more person in the room, it could have gotten pretty ugly. 2). The fitness center was nice and had a variety of equipment, but only 2/4 treadmills worked. In a hotel that size, it was totally inadequate. 3) The walls are tissue-paper thin. I was in the hallway, a full five doors away from our room and I could hear my husband's telephone conversation quite clearly despite the fact that he was speaking in a regular tone of voice. 4) An in-room coffee pot has become a standard amenity at most hotels...*ahem... Did someone forget to mention that to the staff at the Allegro? 5) Speaking of beverages, where did they hide all the vending machines? Oh yeah, they don't have any. I guess this is to ensure that we'll purchase the high-priced drinks/snacks from the in-room "wet bar". The wine hour didn't make up for it either, since we don't drink alcohol. I suggest you take a stash of pop if you're in the same boat. 6) Word of caution: Even though it's located in a great place, surrounding restaurants tend to close early...maybe because everyone heads to the theaters? Don't get caught hungry after about 6 pm. Your choices will be severely limited unless you want to get a cab.Finally, would we stay again? For the quality and price, you betcha!.
