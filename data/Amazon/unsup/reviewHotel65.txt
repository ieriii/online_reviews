If Yelp had negative stars then this business would get a -5. THIS PLACE IS A WORLD OF NO!!! Rooms are old and gross. Yes, clean sheets, but the beds feel like they are from the Salvation Army. The shower barely had hot water. Service is TERRIBLE. I had to walk down to the "lobby" to get an iron. And it's not like I got a discount. This place was not cheap the weekend I was there. Terrible, terrible, terrible. I WILL NEVER GO BACK.
