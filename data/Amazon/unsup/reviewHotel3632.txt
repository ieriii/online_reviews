Although I've never stayed at the Drake, I went to High Tea after seeing The Nutcracker several years ago. I like the Drake's "old-fashioned" feel and authentic atmosphere. With all the renovations happening everyday, it's nice to visit somewhere from another time. As for the tea, I think it's something everyone should experience once in their life. The food was good--finger sandwiches, scones, tea (obviously). And the tea was even better. Compared to the Ritz, tea at the Drake seemed more believable, more appropriate.
