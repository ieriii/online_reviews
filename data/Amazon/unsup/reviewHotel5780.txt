Dog friendly! ($50 pet fee) To my wife and I, our dog is our child (yep we are those kind of people), and pet friendly is very important to us. The Staff at this place flat out ROCKS!!! Angie and the rest of the front desk/hotel staff were super friendly and helpful. We originally had a second floor room which was a problem since our Greyhound is really bad at going up and down steps. Angie got us a room on the ground floor and made sure it was directly below our original room to ease the transition. I did not find the rooms to be as bad as some have posted. They are what they are.. We had a flat screen tv, modern HVAC, and a decent wi-fi signal. The decor was typical Ramada Inn and as Lisa B conveyed, it's in a decent location. My only complaints are that we did not have a fridge in the room and the doors opening and closing were very loud. I doubt you can find a better pet friendly hotel for the price in the area.
