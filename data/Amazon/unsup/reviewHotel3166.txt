I have enjoyed my stay here, particularly the public bathrooms. The bed is great and early check-in, late check-out are convenient. Service is good, but was annoying b/c refused to give me walking directions from Clark and Lake. Also, don't like how they say my last name everytime I call. Great elevator music!
