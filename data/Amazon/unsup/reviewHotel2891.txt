The Sheraton Chicago is very beautiful with lakefront views and right on the river. With their recent reconstruction, the insides are stunning and very nicely done. I've attended a conference here and customer service is just fabulous and the food catered in for lunch was pretty good for conference food. Shula's Steakhouse is also right there which provides for another great food option. It's super convenient and close by a lot of entertainment, including Navy Pier, AMC River East & Lucky Strike Lanes (bowling) and of course, the Magnificent Mile for your shopping and dining pleasure. Also, this is one of our final two options for holding our wedding reception - Elisa has been a real treat to work with. Even though we didn't decide to go here for our wedding, Elisa was really fabulous and easy to work with.
