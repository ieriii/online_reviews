I stayed here for 5 weeks on a business trip. Had a total blast! The rooms were outstanding and it's in a great location for people who are working with businesses in the loop. Spent way too much at the Starbucks in the lower level, as well as the bar in the lobby. The architecture here was unparalleled. Internet not included in rooms and neither is the fitness center, which are both pretty big cons. I would definitely stay here again! Even if I had to pay for it myself.
