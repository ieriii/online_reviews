A HIDDEN GEM! We stayed here over the summer and it was the best hotel experience I've had in a long time....maybe ever! Blows away the Drake which was the last Chicago hotel I visited. Largest basic king rooms in the city. Modern, upscale feel, yet also warm and inviting. Hotel staff went above and beyond to make you feel welcome. They all truly cared about the business and their guests. The location is also amazing. It's right in the heart of the city - shopping, Oak Street beach, restaurants, bars, spas...but just off the Michigan Ave so you have some peace and quiet for relaxation. A must try if you're looking for an escape to the city or are visiting from out of town. You won't be disappointed!
