I stayed here a week ago and was lucky to use some of my Hilton points and was upgraded to the Executive Floor on the 24th floor. The first thing you notice when you walk into the hotel is the decor in the lobby, which seems to span on forever into ballrooms, meeting rooms, restaurants, and small shops. The colors are very warm and comforting as are the staff and everyone that greets you. My room had two beds and two bathrooms which was a bit excessive, but it comes with the whole upgrade. The view was decent as I was on the 24th floor, but I was caddy cornered between two points of the huge building that jut out and it was kind of a limited view. The room was very clean and everything was top class as Hiltons usually are. One thing of note was the gym. It was absolutely huge. If you are into working out when you travel you will truly enjoy the gym experience here. Even though the weights and machines may be a little old, there is HUGE variety for a hotel gym and even a mini track that goes around all the equipment. Plenty of TV's and a great view of the city make working out easy. The location of the hotel is superb. Plenty of restaurants in the Loop as well as shops and sites to see everywhere. My only complaint is the concierge. I needed to extend my stay by a day and I went to ask him what could be done. He said the hotel was booked and then gave me the number for http://hotels.com. THAT is shocking. I'm a Diamond VIP member at Hilton and the last thing I want to hear a concierge tell me is to call http://hotels.com. I'm not trying to be rude or cocky or anything, but he could have at least referred me to another Hilton or Hilton family hotel. Apart from the concierge, I loved the hotel and can't wait to be back.
