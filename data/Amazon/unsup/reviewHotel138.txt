Was in Chicago for a convention and had a limited budget. Found the Whitehall fit into that budget and was in a perfect location. I was concerned about some of the reviews on yelp and tripadvisor but, I thought I would give it a chance. Yes, it's old and small. Yes, it could use a makeover. But, for the price it's awesome. I did see the strings hanging of the chair in my room that someone photographed. Maybe I got the same room. But, come on, who cares. I wasn't hosting a social event. The place is clean. Things are worn but, not warn out. The bed is comfortable and they give you lots of fluffy pillows. I felt very comfortable leaving my personal items out on the bed or bathroom counter. The staff was extremely friendly and helped me quickly. The air conditioning was noisy and I had to use ear plugs. However I don't think it was any different then any other hotel in the area. The Four Seasons is directly across the street and at $500 per night they provide ear plugs for you. My friend stayed there for the same convention. The shower at the Whitehall gave me a warm shower everyday and the safe was large enough to hold my laptop. Bottom line if you want to pampered in a luxury hotel, go to a luxury hotel. If you want a great value go to the Whitehall.
