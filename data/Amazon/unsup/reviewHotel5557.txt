I'm writing this as I sit on a friend-of-a-friend's couch. Why? Hotwire didn't make it clear enough that in the state of Illinois, you have to be 21 to check out a room. I booked my reservation more than a month in advance, but upon going to the front desk, they informed me that I couldn't check in to my room. After asking the dude at the front desk if they could make an exception--he promptly snapped at me and said that I should leave. So, in a city that I don't know, 30 degrees, and no friends in the city... he threatens to call security if I don't leave--"no exceptions". After a half hour of calling around, I got a hold of a friend who told me that his friend would let me sleep there for the night. It was a 45 minute walk-subway-walk to his house... and here I am. Thanks la quinta... I would never recommend that anyone even consider going here.
