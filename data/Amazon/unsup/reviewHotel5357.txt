Our visit could not have been lovelier. From the reservation process - check in - tour - and breakfast - the staff was a delight. Special thanks to Stephanie. This beautiful building is rich with a feeling of history. Our room was perfect - comfortable - very well appointed. Breakfasts were yummy and enjoying the parlor after was great way to start our days. Can't wait to return. THANKS!!
