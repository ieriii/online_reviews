Location location location! This hotel is near everything - all the subway lines are within 3 blocks and Michican Ave and Millenium Park are only a few blocks away as well. I got this hotel on Hotwire (never done it before - makes me nervous not seeing the hotel first!) for about $140/night when everywhere else in the area was close to $200 plus so I was happy about that. Front desk was extremely friendly and helpful the entire time; used the Yelp check in to get a suite - having the extra room came in handy throughout the trip. The suite was ready when we checked in on the very early side of around 11AM. Loved the water infused with fresh fruit in the lobby. Gym was pretty OK - 1 elliptical, 2 treadmills, 1 stepper and a weight machine. Wish the room was bigger and they had dumbells but I have seen far worse hotel gyms. Rooms show a little wear and tear and decor is not to my taste but the bed was super comfy and the tub/shower were good so I really can't complain! The room was always spotless so that is another plus. I wouldn't hesitate to come back!
