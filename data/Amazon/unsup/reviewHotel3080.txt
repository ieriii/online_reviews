We stayed at the W last weekend. This was the weekend of the air and water show. The W was the perfect location. The lobby of this hotel is awesome it makes you feel like you are on a beach vacation and not in Chicago. The restaurant is good and not too overpriced. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is great! We didn't have a view of the lake but the views are amazing because you can see them from the hotel pool and observation deck. We arrived early on Sunday and they allowed us an early check in w/ no problem and a late check out the next day. On Monday morning I had just missed breakfast by 5 minutes. The waiter asked the chef to make an exception and he did. I did not have to ask him to do this he just did it. The service was flawless. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Also the hotel is on the lake and only 5 blocks from Michigan Avenue and a 10 minute walk to Navy pier.
