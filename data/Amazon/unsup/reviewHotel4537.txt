This review is for happy hour only. I've come here a handful of times for cocktails in the lobby. Here's the thing... the drinks are expensive, the service isn't great, and the food options are small... but none of that matters. Because you come here for one reason and one reason only. The atmosphere. It's a kick ass old hotel with a million things to look at on the ceiling alone. I love sitting in those tall back chairs, sipping on a scotch, and catching up with a friend. If you haven't ever been here I highly recommend you visit.
