I've stayed here, the Intercontinental and the Peninsula. For the price and locale (I prefer fun people watching in Gold Coast to crazy annoying tourists on Michigan Avenue), this is a great place to stay. The business center is great, the bathtub is dreamy and I had the BEST night's sleep in the bed here - which is saying alot since I stayed here the night before a big interview.
