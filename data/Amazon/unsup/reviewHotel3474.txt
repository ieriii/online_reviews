I found The Allerton via a web special on http://Hotels.com. The location at Michigan and Huron (two blocks south of the Water Tower and about five blocks north of the Chicago River) was perfect. The room was small; it felt like a room full of doors where the front door, closet door, and bathroom door all came together in a tangled mess. Otherwise, the room was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was quite comfortable. Boo! Hiss! For charging a minimum of $9.95 per day for in-room internet service (even more dough for faster speeds). You can get free Wi-Fi in the Second Floor lounge if you would prefer to surf in public. I was on the 9th floor with a western view of Michigan Avenue, so there was nothing to shout about there. My friend was on a higher floor on a corner and enjoyed her combo view west and north. Room service was always prompt and courteous. Skip the bar on the Second Floor. It is dead, dead, dead. But, if you want to grab a bite to take back to your room, the $5 sliders and $5 quesadilla are a good value. The gym on the 25th floor was well stocked with all the equipment one would expect, and was never busy. There is free coffee on the Second Floor each morning, and you can also use a computer kiosk there to check in for your flight home.
