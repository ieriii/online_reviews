Wonderful stay. My husband and I took our 3 kids there over Thanksgiving, ages 12, 15 and 18. The double Queen family room was big with 2 bathrooms and a sofa bed. They do have roll sways if needed. The workout room was 3000 sq. Feet w/ 10 treadmills. We were right next to all the shops on Mag. Mile. The hotel lobby court was wonderful for drinks and a snack before bed with great music. The hallways to the rooms are extra wide and just nice. It is very elegant and historic. We had our iPads w/ our own Internet so we didn't experience any issues there. The price was $259/night and $35/ parking. We thought it was great and will stay there next time too!
