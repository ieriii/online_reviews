FuFu is not always hip. Employees: The employees try to be so cool, they seem distant. Not much personality here.  Cleanliness: The hotel is clean, but looks too dark inside. Facility: The room we stayed in was just plain strange. It was long and narrow. The hot water for the tiny sink in the Bathroom, along with the shower was not consistent. The sink water never got warm enough and the shower water took forever to get warm. You can't watch the flat panel TV from any place in the room. You can't see it from the bed, even though they have it mounted on a swivel base up on the wall, it doesn't swivel enough. Not even close. There is no couch. You only get a fufu chair that is one of those long chairs and it's REALLY uncomfortable. As you walk into the room, there is only one tiny light in the ceiling. This makes the entire front part of the room too dark to be useful. The one saving grace for the room was the bed. It was great, along with the bath towels. The desk in the room (908) has broken leg tips. Those silly looking words printed inside the lamp shade and also in the wine shelf were just plain spooky. It made using those lights a no-go. There was a nice ice machine on this floor. The slide light controller for the lamp was lame. The elevators have sort of 3D images on each side of little round objects. It's not good to place 3D in transportation devices that go up and down. This makes some guests dizzy. You have to navigate through a narrow corridor in the Lobby because they have places for people to sit and drink as you attempt to leave the hotel. Overall Recommendation: This hotel is located near, well, nothing. A better choice would be the Intercontinental located on the Magnificent Mile. It has gobs of restaurants and movie theaters within walking distance.
