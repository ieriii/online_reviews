"The largest Hyatt in the world," according to the desk receptionist. This is a fantastic hotel, definitely a highway robbery of a deal I got on Priceline at the last minute. The gym is absolutely state-of-the art. I would even venture to say that it may rival stand-alone gyms in many cases. For example, the treadmills can not only estimate your BMI, they can also give you a rough estimate of VO2 max as well. While this technology is state-of-the art, think about how often you see something like this at a hotel gym. There is also a wide selection of free weights as well and plenty of TVs. The room? Also pretty nice. The key cards don't need to be slid through the door; they are just tap onto the door and you're in, which I've seen at only one other hotel (Flatiron Toshi in Manhattan). I had a fantastic view of the skyscrapers from my window. I noticed that by the bedside, there weren't electrical outlets at least by the tables, but you had great flat-screen TVs. There's plenty of food options that are available. A Starbucks in the building, a small cafe type area and also a great looking place for dinner, though I can't comment on the food as I have never had the time to eat there. Check-in and check-out are also out of this world. You can check-in with a reeptionist, or you can check in completely on a kiosk, like you're an airport. The check-out is also handled on the kiosks as well, as well as a drop off box before you leave as well. The doormen are very helpful and courteous. If you're staying for business or pleasure, see if you can snag a room at this amazing hotel situated on Wacker and not far from Michigan Ave and Grant Park. http://Hotels.com say that many of these rooms are at least $200 a night, but if you get lucky and Priceline it, you can get yourself a great bargain. Perfect for a romantic weekend if you're looking for a good hotel to stay the weekend in Chicago.
