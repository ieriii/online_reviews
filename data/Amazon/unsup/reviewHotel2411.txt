Thanks to Jenny Z. I got to stay in one of the four rooms she got from her Hilton Diamonds Reward Program and just the fact that they pulled four rooms for her the night or two before the rally makes me like them even more. The room was nice. I thought it was larger than other rooms I've been in but can't say how it compares to other Hilton locations. Also the beds were unbelievably comfortable and the bathroom was huge. They had a well stocked mini bar but the key was hidden from me and I was not allowed in. How well I guess we did have a tub of booze anyway! The hotel staff was very nice and tried to be as accommodating as possible. They were so busy but everyone was very nice and took things in stride. I arrived via cab and as soon as I got out I had four different men wanting to help me with one bag. They opened the doors and directed me to check in all with smiles on their faces and a ton of people with more luggage than I walking around everywhere. If I can expect this kind of service at every Hilton I will be a very happy girl!
