Can't beat the location of this Hotel. Our room was very spacious (King) and had a great view of N Michicgan Avenue, the Water Tower, etc. We did happen to score a room on the 22nd floor. I don't know how anyone else encountered issues with this hotel, from the other reviews. The flat screen TV had Cable TV (of course, if you know how to work a remote, it was very easy to navigate through the menu and screen and cable channels. It was a holiday weekend, a fully booked hotel, and a very large wedding party was staying at the hotel. No issues with chekc-in, service, front desk or TV. Staff was respectful and helpful when needed.  Checking bags after check-out and the car valet service were each very convenient. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend some time on the Magnificent Mile. Only gripe: no complimentary WiFi service in the hotel rooms.
