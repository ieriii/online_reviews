I stayed here for NYE for two nights. It might have been a bad time to choose this particular hotel, but I still dont think I;ll be going back. The staff seemed more worried about their hair and Armani than anything else. When you walk off the street into the dark "trendy" lobby, it all just feels a little silly. We had a view of a back side of some building, and a little slice of Millenium Park. Whatever, views arn't a huge deal to me. The rooms were nice, I was a big fan of the bathroom. But...But..David Bowie was in our hotel room. On some sort of ...mirror. It was odd. If the staff hadn't been so "better than thou" it would have made the stay much better. The best staff people we encountered were the room service staff. They were great.
