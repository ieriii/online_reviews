Great hotel!The hotel is in a great location and lets you get to experience the real neighborhood side of Chicago but allows for you to go downtown in one shot if necessary. Also the connecting restaurants and coffee bar was great! One key thing to note is the staff was really nice and the decor of the hotel was amazing. Also it is located in between two of the best neighborhoods in the Chicago area Lincoln Park and Old town. You cant go wrong with this hotel.
