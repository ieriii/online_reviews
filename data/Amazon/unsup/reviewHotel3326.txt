I stayed at the rock, for six nights.. the room was good...BUT!! there was no room for your belongings... the draws were filled with snack from the hotel & they even put a refrig in the other draws filled with beer, soda, ete..u had 2 little draws & 1 stand up dresser hanger only..other wise its was good... the service was very good ( BUT KEEP AWAY FROM THE CONCIERGE & THE CHINA GRILL THERE.. DRINKS ARE 18.00 & UP, WHAT A RIP OFF...)thats my opin...
