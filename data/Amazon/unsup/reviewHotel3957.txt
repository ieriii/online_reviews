Shame on me as a yelper, because I should have checked on yelp prior to booking. I did this solely because NACS recommended them on their list of hotels. We paid $190 per night and stayed for five nights. For this price, we didnt have hot shower, warm meals which we ordered through room service. I didnt have to go into details as most reviews here already explained the condition of the hotel. To my surprise, this condition was dated back as far as 2006. Interestingly enough, the only hotel around the loop with PICKETERS! I think Motel 6 could have been a better choice. By far, this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at! I wish I could give them a ZERO star!
