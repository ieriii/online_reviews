This hotel is in a perfect location for visitors to Chicago, in the middle of the shopping district and walking distance to the loop. The room wasn't a bad size, things appeared relatively newish, and I got the room for a good price on a discount site, so I wouldn't complain anyway.  There are a few cons, though. Being an upscale hotel in downtown Chicago, nothing's free. They charge for internet, and the parking fee is outrageous. I parked in a garage a few blocks away for far less, since I wouldn't need my car anyway. They don't have enough elevators for a high-rise hotel, so it can be a long wait in the mornings and afternoons when everyone's checking in and out.  The hotel also charged my credit card for the room even though I had already payed through a discount site. To their credit, though, they apologized and dropped the charge immediately when I called them about it.
