My place is so tiny that when people come to visit, they have to stay in a hotel. My mom was coming into town on a busy weekend and I happened upon a great deal at this hotel. Just east of the Mag Mile and taxis aplenty were what was needed. My mom loves to window shop, so she could wander in familiar surroundings while I commuted up to her. The room was the perfect size suite with doors connecting the bathroom to both the living area and the bedroom. Genius! Plus, it had a seperate closet/vanity area for dressing and primping. The bed was soft and comfy and the tvs in both rooms was a plus. The lobby is just fine....I mean, you're not staying at the Palmer House. Anyhoo, my mom loved this place for the price, location and cleanliness. It was a bit out of my way, but whatever makes Mom happy!
