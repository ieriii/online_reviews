Anyone who knows me, knows that I am far from a swanky hotel kind of guy. When I look for a hotel, give me a Super 8 or Days Inn and I am a happy guy. On my own, I would never ever pick a top of the line hotel as my first choice. I must give major props to whomever designed the interiors here, both of the rooms and the lobby. They did an outstanding job conveying a sense of modern style and swank but absolutely did not lose any of the feeling of comfort or "like-home" feeling. This was a balancing act that they they excelled and I must give them major kudos for that fact alone. The staff here was outstanding. I was somewhat expecting a formal almost snobbish attitude from the employees but once again they proved me wrong. Everyone was super friendly and helpful and made me feel right at home here. If someone asked to recommend a hotel in the downtown area, I would not hesitate for a moment to give this place my seal of approval.
