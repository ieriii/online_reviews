probably one of the few reasonably affordable ways to get yourself into a room on Michigan ave. Obviously, the location is great. Walk right out the door to Grant Park. Makes for a nice morning. They also offer a free hotel shuttle to various touristy places like the hancock tower, navy pier and one of the museums, I forget which one. Also nice. There is an indoor pool, fitness center and a deck on the 4th floor that looks out over michigan ave. The rooms are fine, maybe a bit a small. However, the rest of the inside, like the hallways, stairways, are kind of creepy. Internet there is kind of expensive, and probably the most annoying was that our room didn't have a fridge (we ate two huge meals out in chinatown, and since we didn't have a fridge to bring the doggie bag back to, we threw the food out the second night, which was sad, and went into food coma the first night, which was painful and gross). Oh yes, and agree with the reviewer below that the mandatory valet parking thing was kinda annoying.
