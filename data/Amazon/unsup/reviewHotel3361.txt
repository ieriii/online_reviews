Best rates in the area yet excellent service and comfortable room.  Friday night in July - King size bed - $179 plus $31 TAX (Thanks Daley, Stroger, Blago) Free shuttle service to area attractions including Navy Pier or the Museums.  Nice big pool for the kids and full service restaurant & bar for the adults.  Grant Park is just across the street and great food choices are within a few blocks.  I recommend bringing the bikes and go across the street and head south towards the museums for an awsome lakeside ride.  The only street I crossed was right at the hotel.  The bike trails takes you under LSD and over the Metro tracks.
