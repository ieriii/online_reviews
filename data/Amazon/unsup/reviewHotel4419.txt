I'm staying at the Palmer House because I have to. And I wish I didn't have to. This hotel is fine, corporate America fine. But it is a big barn with Fraternity and Sorority conferences, business meetings, and all sorts of madness. The rooms are inconsistent, some being really, really cozy for two adults. Even tiny adults like me and my beloved. I highly recommend the upgrade to the "executive floor" where the rooms are huge and you are afforded the luxury of express elevators, free breakfast and round the clock snacks and drinks. What really irks me about this place (aside from the scripted corporate speak of the employees [that irks me everywhere]) is all the ridiculous surcharges. $25 to check in early. $20 per day for internet. $18 to use the pool. $20 to use the gym. Really? So what exactly are the amenities of the hotel? Clearly, this place has a lot of rooms to fill in order to pay the wintertime heating bill. It makes me feel like I'm being swindled, and I'm not even paying for my room! For a little more money, there are better options, and better locations in Chi-town.
