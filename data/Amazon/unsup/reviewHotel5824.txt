Would recommend this hotel to anyone. My wife's sister booked us a room at Crown Plaza thru her work. The address we were given was 733 w Madison, upon arrival we find out that our reservations were actually in Skokie, Kurtis the front desk worker was awesome in helping my wife and I figure it out, then got us in contact with his manager, who cancelled our reservations at the other hotel and got us rooms, right there off the loop. Clean rooms, great service, 5 block walk to either set of trains, and access to Greek town, and great food, and service.
