LOCATION is the best part of the hotel. GREAT location. Walking distance to some great restaurants (which was key for me because I spent a week here for a conference that did not serve food so I was on my own for every meal - and I hate hotel food). The bar/lobby area was AWESOME too - totally vibrant, lots of people, nice vibe. I brought my laptop down there because I had no WiFi in my room - which is my #1 complain with this hotel. I can't remember the last time I was at a hotel where I had to plug my laptop into an outlet! #FAIL My other complaint is the cable - hardly any channels - no Bravo, no VH1 - I look forward to business trips because I can watch some trashy reality TV and decompress from stressful days. But not here. However, the fitness center is GREAT! Weight room and an aerobic room! One of the best I've ever seen. Which is great because I ate my way through Chicago!
