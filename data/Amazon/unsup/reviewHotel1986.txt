I just spent several days at the RBA for a conference and have mixed feelings about the space. Aesthetically, it's gorgeous. The beds are ridiculously comfortable, the shower is GIANT (some rooms have up-to-your-neck deep soaking tubs), the public spaces are inviting and comfortable. But, as an event planner, when I'm paying this much money for a room/event space, I expect some pretty high end functioning. We had several mix ups with our staff rooms and guest rooms (the hotel checking people out too soon or cancelling reservations even when we specifically stated the reservation needed to be changed, not cancelled), the shower handle in my bath broke, as did the knob that gave functionality to the handheld shower head. A member shut her glass shower door only to have it shatter (thankfully it's covered by a film that held the glass in place). And the room had a ridiculous espresso machine that didn't work properly. As far as the event space...again, aethetitically, it's great but it's not set up well for functionality. Screens are too small in meeting rooms, sound system is not created to work on an individual room basis so stand speakers that blocked the screen views were set up, and the registration area is a bar that has little functionality for the needs of registering several hundred people. As a plus, the service staff were extremely friendly and on top of things as soon as they needed to be done...which was a big plus, but not quite enough to make up for the other elements. Hopefully they'll work out the kinks before I get back there next year for our 2013 conference.
