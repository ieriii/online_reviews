I haven't actually stayed here, but I spent so much time in my colleague's hotel room during her stay last week that I feel as if I stayed here... And I like this new modern looking hotel! The people who work here are super friendly. We were big fans of the concierge who didn't even blink when we asked him if he knew of any strip clubs that served lunch. The rooms are very spacious and I especially loved the hardwood floors and rain shower surrounded by glass doors on all sides (there is a curtain to shield yourself from peeping toms). Business travelers will also be thrilled to know the wifi is fast and free...and this hotel just happens to be located in a very convenient downtown location. If you get hungry Ajasteak is right downstairs and there's plenty of other good eats (quartino is always a winner) within a block of the hotel. My colleague found this room on http://quickbook.com for just over $200, which I thought was quite the deal for a quality hotel during summer in Chicago. She seemed quite happy with her 3 nights in the hotel as well, her only complaint being that the walls were super thin so you can hear everything in the neighboring hotel rooms. I probably won't ever stay here since I live just minutes away, but I'll be recommending it to out of town visitors and may visit the inviting spa.
