Back in November I checked out the Spa with girlfriends who all agreed we could use facials. Admittedly, I'm a huge Spa snob, and my favorites are either the Peninsula or The Four Seasons.  The service was not the most professional as the esthetician kept taking her hands off my face and then harshly re-starting the facial with cold product. Normally they keep a hand on your face during almost the entire facial to avoid the jumping reaction that happens when they touch you again. But the most disturbing part was the women going to extractions with her fingers rather than a tool. Ewww! Perhaps massages here are better, but I would definitely NOT recommend this place for facials. Yuck!!
