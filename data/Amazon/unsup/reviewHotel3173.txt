The W hotel is one of my favorites. I stayed there recently and the WOW service there did an amazing job for me. The rooms are modern yet comfortable. They have amazing views of the lake. The only thing that sucked is the pool was being remodeled. The Whiskey Sky is great for pre partying drinks. Definitely recommend it.
