Wonderful experience overall.  First night so so as room was small, small bathroom, 2 beds, average decor on Diamond Floor...Second night was fantastic on Executive Floor....pay the difference to upgrade...you will be glad that you did.  Hotel has gorgeous lobby, magnificent not-to-be-missed restaurtant Lockwood, lots of amenities, excellent location.  Overall great staff.  Around $50 per day for parking with valet...lower cost pakring options are nearby.  Fitness center is $10 per day.  Would go again...this place is great. Have OJ take care of you at Lockwood and have Derrick take care of you at check-in and have Waffa take care of you for cocktails in the Executive Lounge.  These three people plus Kenneth the bellman were stellar!
