James Hotel is a metrosexual's dream! It feels like it's designed specially for trendy jet-setters. The decor is gorgeous - very modern and tasteful with a masculine edge (lots of dark wood, bold patterns, leather and stainless steel). My company held a meeting at James in one of their private meeting rooms yesterday. But it wasn't a traditional "conference room"...I felt like I was in someone's apartment. It had all the comforts of home...a really nice home. There were even cushy throw pillows and bookshelves stocked with art books and knick knacks. There was plenty of room for 20-30 people The couches and chairs were super comfy and gave our meeting a nice-laid-back vibe.The food was great and the staff was attentive and friendly. If the bedrooms are as comfortable as their meeting space, I will definitely be back to stay a night.
