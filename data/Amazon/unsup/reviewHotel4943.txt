I'm a priority club member so always trying to stay someplace that I can collect points. Downtown Chicago has several options so I researched many of them on the web, and found time and time again the Avenue was coming up with positive feedback. Sure I saw the reviews about noise, but come on people it's downtown Chicago what do you expect? I can attest that the staff was incredibly friendly from check in to check out. The front desk was accommodating with my special requests and didn't make me feel like I was inconveniencing them at all. My room was huge, which is so nice while traveling on business. You have a place to relax...a place to work...and a place to sleep. You don't have to do it all while propped up in your bed like most other hotels. The room was spotless and I'm big on that! I don't keep my home messy so I certainly don't want to pay money and stay in a place that's messy.  Everyone I passed in the hall smiled and said hello, wishing me a good day continuously. I really felt like my business was appreciated and with so many options that is important. The restaurant was good, lots of variety and the hotel is in easy walking distance to all of the hot spots in Chicago. I'll tell ya, some of those other hotels in Chicago could take some lessons in friendliness and customer service from this Hotel. Thank you for making my time away from home incredibly enjoyable
