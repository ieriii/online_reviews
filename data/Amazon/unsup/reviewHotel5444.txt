Sutton Place in the Right Place: Being Chicago suburbanites, we had decided to "vacation" in Chicago for an evening. We looked for a hotel that would allow us to be close to the things we wanted to enjoy and The Sutton Place Hotel had the right location. (Be sure to check for specials and consider the different types of rooms. The prices vary widely.) Our first impression as we checked in was that the lobby was dark and the staff was unfriendly. Once we got to the room, things were much better. (The elevator was one of the fastest I have ever ridden.) The Deluxe King Room was spacious and had a nice view of Rush St. The bathroom was huge for a hotel. The tub was big enough for two! The room included a nice sound system with a CD player and a few CDs. Unfortunately the CDs had seen better days and there was a lot of skipping. The location of this hotel is great if you want to experience Rush St. with a minimum of travel. We went to dinner at Gibsons, had drinks at Dublin's Pub, and listened to jazz at The Back Room without walking more than a half block. Many drinks later we retired for the evening. A soak in the tub was a perfect way to wind down. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were fluffy. The A/C was very quiet, but effective at keeping the room cool. In the morning we went to The Original Pancake House which is right across the street. The apple pancake was delicious! Once again, the location of this hotel was our primary reason for choosing it. As we checked out after a wonderful stay, we were surprised by the steep cost of valet parking. I thought that $40/day for a guest of the hotel was a little steep. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will definitely keep Sutton Place in mind for our next trip to Rush St.
