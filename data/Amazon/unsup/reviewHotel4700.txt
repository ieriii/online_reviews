This place is freakin AMAZING. I came here with a couple of friends and when we booked this hotel, I had high expectations from the pictures that the hotel posted online. Let me tell you, this hotel exceeded all of my expectations. It has a superb location, very close to the magnificent mile, bars, old town, zoo..you name it. The beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever laid on. We created a schedule for ourselves everyday but we always woke up late because we did not want to get out of bed...and it's not from us being hung over either (except for one of us but I won't get into that). The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The bellboys were awesome, especially Chuck! He helped us find some amazing local eateries and bars and was just awesome to talk to. They also have a gym, which isn't too big but hey, who goes on vacation to work out in the gyms at their hotels right? Bottom line, the service is great, very affordable, very clean, and great location.
