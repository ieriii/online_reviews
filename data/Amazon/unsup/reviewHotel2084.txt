All of the staff who made my wedding day happen were wonderful! Barbara Martin, the onsite wedding coordinator, is extraordinary. She is the utmost professional, responded to all of our questions in a very timely and clear manner, and was there to make sure our rehearsal and ceremony went off as planned (with helpful suggestions for how the day should flow). The reservations staff shared updates about our room blocks in a timely manner when we requested updates. The catering staff was so attentive throughout the cocktail hour and the sit down meal. All of our guests received the courses in a timely fashion, and the food was delicious. If you go for the mid-level wedding package, the steak for each guest is huge and very well prepared. At one point, my husband stepped away from the table during dinner, and a staff member took his plate to make sure it was warm when he returned. Thank you to everyone! These are among the reasons we choose the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza as our ceremony and reception location: - Barbara Martin is great. - Affordable with lots of perks including comped rooms and parking for us and our parents the night of the wedding along with free breakfast the following morning. - The LaSalle room was just the right size for our 100 guests (plus dance floor) and the view of the Chicago is great (and makes any decisions about decorating or coming up with a theme so easy -- Theme: Chicago, Decorations: Look out the window). - Close to public transit for our out-of-town and city-residing guests. - Reduced parking rates were available to our driving guests. - We were able to have a block of rooms for Friday and Saturday night available to our guests at a reduced cost without having to make a financial guarantee that we would fill the rooms.
