My husband and I went there for our mini honeymoon. Loved this place! Drinks at the hotel bar were yummy. Hotel is within walking distance of so many fun places. They even left us a note and a box of chocolates when we checked in, congratulating us on our honeymoon. We would definitely go back again.
