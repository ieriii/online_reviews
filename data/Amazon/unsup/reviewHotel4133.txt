I enjoyed my stay here (September 2011). The view from our room was jaw dropping. It was right across the street from the river and Magnificent Mile. So many sites and sounds of Chicago right at my fingertips. The parking was a bit hard to find and expensive, but other than that, no other complaints. Oh yeah, SUPER COMFORTABLE bed! Also, great curtains that kept the room nice and dark to help me sleep in. Oh, I think the price was around $125 a night for Sunday-Tuesday.
