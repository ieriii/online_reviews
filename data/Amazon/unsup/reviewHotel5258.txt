this place was ok. we got a room with 1 king size bed. the room was very tiny. but thats ok since we were only in the room for sleeping. this was the only hotel i could find downtown with free parking and a indoor pool. it was nice to park out car and walk the whole weekend. this hotel is in the perfect location close to alot of good shopping and food. but one bad thing.... when we checked in they gave us tickets for a breakfast "buffet" so im all excited to wake up and go eat eggs.bacon,ham,hashbrowns, you know all the good breakfast stuff... we get there and it IS NOT a "buffet" at all! it sucked soo bad!!! all it was is toast with a toaster that did not work good at all, and nasty oatmeal.
