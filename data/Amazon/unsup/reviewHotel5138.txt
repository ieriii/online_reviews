We just had our wedding here (Friday, June 18) and we - and all of our guests - loved it! We're still hearing compliments from guests on the food (steak and chicken napoleon with duchess potatoes and steamed vegetables), the cake (the hotel connects you with Alliance Bakery, which does a fabulous job), the amazing views, the nice guest rooms and the excellent service all around. Barbara Martin is an outstanding wedding coordinator - she's organized, knows how to handle brides (and mothers of brides) with ease and she is always happy to provide suggestions, recommendations or advice to help with the wedding planning process. This was the perfect place for a Chicago wedding - you can't beat the city skyline and the river as seen from the windows in the Wolf Point Ballroom! My husband and I highly recommend the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza to anyone looking for a beautiful, service-oriented venue for their wedding or special event.
