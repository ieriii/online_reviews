We stayed here this past weekend for 2 nights, and I must say, it's some of the best rest I've gotten in a hotel bed ever. The beds, pillows and comforters were so comfy! Had drinks in the Bar 151 inside, and also the "Big Bar" - nothing like paying $6.50 for a domestic bottle beer and $11 for a Bloody Mary, but I guess that's the price you pay for convenience of being in a hotel bar. The bathrooms were nice, could have used a little more counter-space but whatever :) I like a fairly roomy bathroom and they had good ones. I wasn't a fan of the toiletries in the room, NO one in our party liked the lotion (LOL, we had two adjoining rooms) but I always bring my own anyway. Usually if I don't use it, I'll lift the toiletries for a future trip, but in this case I passed. Not a huge deal but sometimes getting these little extra "freebies" is some kind of treat. Good location, friendly and accommodating staff, and I love that they allowed us to leave our bags after checkout on Sunday for a few hours so we didn't have to lug them around the city until we departed. We were on the 28th floor and I didn't find the noise level to be too bad. I didn't notice any inconsiderate neighbors, but we were nicely located at almost the end of the hall. The view wasn't the best, but interesting. Our room was facing two office buildings. Saturday it was pretty empty, but on Friday afternoon when we arrived, people were still working and we had fun peering in and commenting on the activity going on with working strangers across the way. Overall, a very nice stay!
