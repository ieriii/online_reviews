I traveled to Chicago last year and booked here on a cousin's recommendation. The staff couldn't have been friendlier and the location more convenient (at Wacker Drive and Michiagan Avenue). Don't miss the 71 East Cafe, which has great options for lunch and dinner. My room was large, spacious and offered great city views. I snagged a low rate through http://www.getaroom.com. My only gripe was that parking was expensive, but it was to be expected considering the location.
