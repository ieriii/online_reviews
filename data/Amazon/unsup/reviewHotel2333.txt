My fiance says I shouldn't make Mormon jokes while we're checking in at the Marriott. Maybe that is why Mom's room had all kinds of stuff in the bathroom (q-tips, cotton balls, shower cap, etc.) that we didn't have and she had chocolates on her bed!!! Damn them giving me the special Atheist room!  There are some fine features about this hotel: 1) It couldn't be in a better location. We walked all over this lovely city and could easily catch a cab at a moment's notice if needed. 2) The elevators in this joint are CRAZY fast. I don't know if they are run by space rockets or what, but if you can catch one that doesn't stop on every floor to pick up other people, you won't believe how fast they move. 3) The hotel has been recently renovated and the room was very clean and fresh feeling. 4) The staff members were all very nice and the operation was insanely efficient considering how big and wildly busy the place was. Not so lovely things about it would include the following: 1) Feather pillows - hate them. It would be great if there were are alternatives so that you don't feel like you are resting on a pile of birds. 2) The hallways are seriously over air conditioned. They could settle down with the A/C and save some of that money to send to the church. What are they thinking?! 3) Bad hairdryers - Low is not warm and high is insanely blowing your hair all over the place. Mom agreed on this one. 4) The windows seemed like they were not double paned or not thick enough. Our room faced Michigan Ave. and even though we were on the 32nd floor, it was so loud with sirens and cars honking. We were there for the July 4th weekend, which was probably an especially loud time. It just seemed like there could be better windows to make it less noisy inside. I need some peace and quiet to curl up with my Book of Mormon and read more about the angel Moroni.
