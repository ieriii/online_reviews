We could barely find the hotel. No signs that said valet parking. We got to the front desk area and it wasn't even a true front desk it was actually 2 desks. Then we took the one of the elevators up. They have 5 elevators (2 are service elevators which they say you can't use) the elevators are so small that you can barely fit 3 people in them. Not to mention the fact that they are super slow. We got to our room on the 13th floor (i though hotels usually don't have a 13th. We got off the elevator and as soon as you step off a room door is right in front of your face. The halls are do tight i felt like I was in the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and I was waiting for a little oompa loompa to wall by! And we walked into this cramped little closet of a room with a king sized bed and we asked for 2 dbls when checking in. So we went back down and asked for our double actually this happened with all four of our rooms. They said the other gentleman in your party has your other keys. We asked them to re program our current keys (13th floor) to the new room on the (16th) and they looked at us like we had 9 heads. We got to our new room which had 2 beds. It was a larger room on the end which had windows all around with amazing views. The room itself was very nice. I didn't however like the beds. Way too low. I also didn't like the fact that they lighting in the bathroom was very minimal. I had a hard time sleeping because of the beds and the fact that the hotel Is right in the middle of downtown but that is just me because I live in a quiet little suburb.We also spent $100 for 3 people for breakfast buffet which was not worth it at all!
