Well, if there was a rating for less than 1 star, that's what I'd be handing out. The only redeeming quality seems to be the new bar in the Pump Room. I live one block from the hotel and have used the hotel (when it was the Ambassador) as my 'guest room'. Well, this time I stayed at the hotel and allowed my guests to use my condo. OH MY GOD!!!! I'm so glad I did not let my guests stay at the hotel. I would have been mortified. I've not stayed at the hotel since it switched from the Ambassador. I now can say 'I remember this place when it was a good hotel". Other than some cool lighting, the rooms are nothing more than cheap IKEA furniture. There are no coffee makers in the room. If you want coffee before 0630, you will be rudely told by the front desk young lady that you can walk over to Starbucks. It's just over two blocks away. A very easy walk however who the hell wants to do that at 0500??????? The staff is rude. In general, one is made to feel that staff is being bothered by one's presence. In fact, I think they thought they're doing me a favor by staying at their hotel. Public has managed to take what was a magnificent hotel with great customer service and turn it into nothing more that a cool looking Day Inn Motel or Hotel 6.
