It's been two years now and slowly....I'm becoming an expert on downtown Chicago hotels. That didn't sound right. Of utmost importance to me is noise & cleanliness, so I give this place a thumbs-up. The A/C is rather loud, which forces me to hit three stars instead of four -- but I must also add that the AC works quite well even so.  The breakfast buffet is better than most, and if you just want to take a couple of items to go (as I find to be most useful), they charge you very reasonable a la carte prices (well, as reasonable a hotel fare goes). Staff is courteous & helpful; service is prompt, and they have good in-room coffee for brewing. I always consider that a plus as it enables me to be civil once I'm ready to go downstairs & use the biz center or get breakfast. If you want to get nitpicky, the gym doesn't have any floor mats. So what? It's clean and the equipment is modern and clean. The comfort, convenience and service make this a great bargain. I would book my boss here and he is WAY fussy about hotels. Check it out!
