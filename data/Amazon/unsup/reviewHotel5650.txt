My girlfriend and I stayed in the hotel for two nights when we visited Chicago. We got a decent deal on http://Priceline.com, though the parking is a little expensive. The hardwares (space, bed, bathrooms etc) are good, but the shower hose was broken and towels look old and dirty. So was the comforter, which had some blood stain on it and disgusted us .
