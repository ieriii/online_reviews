What happened? A couple years ago this was THE place to be...heard sooo many good things about it and was really excited to come here finally this summer. So we get there and there is a huge line, we walk up to the front and get right in... HOWEVER: there is security at the front, frisking the men and checking women's purses! Ok....the security guy actually looked at us and said "you sure you want to come in?" Ok....we go in, and there's a $20 cover. My friend tells the girl it's her birthday, so she says fine $10 to get in. We're standing there, trying to decide if the thumping music, and potential for violence as evidenced by the fact that guys need to get FRISKED, is worth $10 or whether this is the end of the night. We decided to turn around and actually never made it in. I was really sad about the whole thing, because I had built up Victor Hotel in my mind all these years...it was such a letdown, kind of like when you first realize your parents aren't the superheros you think they are, like a coming of age. Oh well, at least we didn't get robbed.
