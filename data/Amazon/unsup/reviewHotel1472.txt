Great location, right off Michigan Avenue. We had a one-bedroom suite, which was nice, although smaller than the other one-bedroom suite we stayed in (Millenium Knickerbocker Chicago).  We ordered breakfast room service the night before, and it arrived promptly the next morning and was delicious.  The entrance was kind of weird--you had to get into an elevator from the street to reach the lobby, and then get into another set of elevators to reach the rooms. The lobby was modern and the concierge was wonderful.
