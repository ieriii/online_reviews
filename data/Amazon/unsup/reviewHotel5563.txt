We got a great price on our room because we booked before it opened. For the price we paid, I was satisfied. There are a few areas in the renovations that I noticed that could have been done a little better, but overall, it's a nice place to stay. The decor is very 50's style/kitschy, but I loved it. We got a suite, which was a nice size. The bathroom area is a little small. You have a separate sink/vanity area from the room with the toilet/shower which is small. They probably could have installed the bathroom door differently, as it's a bit awkward using the toilet. Decent sized closet but the best part was that you had drawers hidden under the bed to stow your non-hanging clothes, etc. I wish EVERY hotel did this! My only gripe with the room is that the safe didn't work. The location is a nice one, right in Lincoln Park. I'm not positive I'd stay in the Lincoln Park area on my next visit, but if we do, I'm sure we will be staying at this hotel. We JUST missed the grand opening of their rooftop bar. I've seen pictures of it and it looks awesome! This will definitely be the spot to be in LP.
