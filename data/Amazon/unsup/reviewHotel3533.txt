My boyfriend and I stayed here for our anniversary and we were more than pleased. First of all, our room was HUGE. We had a suite and were not aware of it because the room was cheap. We booked the room a week in advance on Expedia. We had a sitting area with a TV, a full bathroom, and a separate bedroom. There were two TV's,and an i-pod home (LOVE THAT). They will charge you, however, if you use the refrigerator. Stupid Chicago rule... Anywho, we also had drinks in the pub downstairs and I believe I had the best martini in my life. It is called a Castle Wrecker and you must try it--hints of raspberry, peach, and lime :) What I really liked about this place is that we are very young looking for our age and we were never discriminated for that. I have been to places where I have been looked at oddly because I look young, but I am in my mid-twenties and I can easily afford nice things. This place treated us with respect and I highly appreciate that.
