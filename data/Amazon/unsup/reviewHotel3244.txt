What a fun and fabulous Chicago hotel! Everything about our stay was pretty near perfect. We arrived early from the suburbs, overloaded with our heavy backpacks, but the front desk was super nice and let us check in 4 hours early! We giddily took the elevator up to our room, impressed with the all mirrored elevators and the white, European, short, skinny, boy with a huge blonde affro that stood silently and pretentiously with us (undoubtedly both wondering if he was someone famous). Our room was on the 17th floor. Each floor is a different theme, we were on the Annie Lennox floor (perhaps we'll have sweet dreams we pondered). The view from the room was awesome, overlooking the river and part of north Michigan Ave. The room itself was a view to take in with plush beds, tons of mirrors, and fun modern furniture and plasma TV. The bathrooms felt clean and new. Needless to say, later that night, we had a lot of fun having some pre going out drinks. We had to resort to drinking in our room because the Base Bar within the hotel was ridiculously priced. We also had too much fun travelling to each floor to check out the different themes and memorabilia that was on display. When it was time to go out, the doorman helped us hail a cab, very friendly. Upon returning at night, we fell into a blissful sleep on the most comfy bed I have slept in in a long time. When we checked out the next morning, the concierge gladly held our bags for a couple of hours while we shopped and got brunch. We took time to admire the building one more time before heading out, and you have to admit that the hotel, which is in the old Carbide and Carbon building is one of the prettiest in the city. Modeled after a Champagne bottle, the roof top contains real 24 karat gold. Fabulous! One of the best Staycations I ever took!
