I decided to make an appointment at the spa on my day off, to treat myself. I originally booked a massage using the online system, which was super easy. I changed it to a mani/pedi after a ridiculous sunburn left my skin feeling pretty sensitive. I wish I'd just stuck with the massage. I typically stick to affordable (less than $50) nail salons. I've never had a spa mani/pedi before, but I had one done at a salon before (Anna George) and loved it, so I figured the treatment would be similar. It was pretty much the same service I've received at my cheap salons. My technician was friendly and the equipment was clean, but I wasn't blown away by anything. I was getting a spa service, but I wasn't shown into the relaxation room or given a bathrobe and slippers, like other customers. There's no drying station, so I sat in the reception area for about 15 minutes while my nails dried. I don't think I would come back for another mani/pedi. I paid $80 (plus tip) and my manicure chipped within a day. My pedicure chipped within a week - and my pedicures usually last 2-3 weeks. I've had the same type of service at my cheap places, so I think I will stick to those spots.
