I stayed at the Whitehall hotel in April and overall had a great experience. The hotel itself is old and even though it went through a renovation not to long ago, it still felt old. The beds and rooms were very spacious and comfortable, but the elevators were very cozy (maximum 5 people, 4 with luggage). The staff are extremely nice, and has a small, but clean entrance/lobby. LOCATION: FANTASTIC! In the heart of the magnificent mile and never really needed a taxi! I'd stay here again for the price, comfortable beds, and the convenient location.
