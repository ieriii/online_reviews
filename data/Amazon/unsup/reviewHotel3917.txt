Bah. I didn't realize how much yelp needs 0 stars. I'd use -1 stars if I could. This hotel is *awful*, and deserves every bit of my worst review yet. I travel a lot for work. Like most of the week, most every week. The fact that I know hotels is a given. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. (and when I was under 18 working for a small company with no hotel reservation in Houston, there was NO VACANCY anywhere, and I had to stay in a place that rented rooms by 15 minute increments and had mirrors on the ceiling. Not joking. Horrid.) If I had the option, I would stay in a Motel 6. I am not kidding. There just isn't one close enough. I am not sure where to start. Paint is peeling from everywhere. Carpets appear to have been stained since the 70's. Water pressure is low, and showerheads seem to have been made for midgets. The halls are not even air conditioned. This is even a problem when it's 60 degress outside and beautiful. Saying the rooms "have a smell" is generous. They reek. Bathrooms have warped doors that rarely close, missing tiles from everywhere, stains on the walls/toilets/tubs. The lights dim when you plug a freaking iron in. *IF* you can find a plug that doesn't appear to want to shock you. Also, it seems to be impossible to cool the rooms to a reasonable temperature for sleeping. And lo and behold, they have internet access?! Oh wait. It's corded and the cord is 3 feet long. And no desk. I'm not sure how I am supposed to use this. And it's $10. What the frick, can you say table steaks?  I'm down with classic hotels. I'm in Chicago, of course there are cool old buildings. However, someone of influence needs to contact the owners of this hotel and let them know that "old and disgusting" does not equal "classic and classy". I don't like giving bad reviews. But this place is a stinker. Update: Added a couple pictures of the bathroom in what is actually my nicest room I've been in.
