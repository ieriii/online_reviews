I can not recommend this hotel for business travel. We paid a great deal of money for my tiny room and then when I had no Internet connection as promised. When I enquired, I was told to the room had never been connected to the hotel's Internet and that I was simply out of luck. I wrote a complaint email to the general manger about the situation and was ignored. In a city with great business-class hotels, why would I return to one that can't deal with such a simple (but important need) and who treats its clients disrespectfully?
