When I stayed there, I was surrounded by smoke. I couldn't leave the hotel without a line up of smokers blowing their smoke in my face. They set up a little cafe and the other guests light up next to the door, sitting down and puffing away. I tried to sneak out the starbucks side entrance, and that was next to their official smoking area and eqqually bad. I knew I had to worry about air quality in Chicago, I just didn't know it would be from my hotel!
