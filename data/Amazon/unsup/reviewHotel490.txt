I usually don't review hotels in YELP (at least not yet) but I figured I would for this one since I stay here so often. Embassy Suites Lakefront is my 'go-to' hotel when I stay in Chicago. It's in a great location if you need to be downtown. It's short walk to either Navy Pier or Michigan Ave, or just a short cab ride away to most other places in Chi-town. The hotel staff is very friendly across the board. The rooms are all pretty good and the hotel is clean. If you're a Hilton Honors member, be sure to ask if they have any corner rooms available, for they usually have larger living rooms than the traditional rooms. Their morning breakfast buffet is quite good with a lot of variety. Probably one of the best Embassy Suites breakfasts available (trust me, they're not all created equal). The made to order omelets are worth the (short) wait. The evening Happy Hour is also a nice plus and a great place to unwind or congregate before heading out to dinner. If heading to Chicago for a few days, be sure to consider this as an option for your stay.
