We just had our wedding here and it was awesome. You are in awesome hands with Barbara. We wouldn't change one thing about the wedding, how it was handled, how organized it was, etc. It was perfect. We had some complicated details and everything was set-up perfect. The food was awesome, the cake got a ton of compliments, the views are incredible, the newly renovated rooms were nice. All in all, a great experience. Highly recommend Holiday Inn Mart Plaza for any event/wedding.
