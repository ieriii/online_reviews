Extremely nice staff, even offered to park our car and feed the meter while we slept in before our long drive back to NY. Loved the location, aveda products, size of the towels, ie huge, and the dcor of the room. Only two complaints, the pretzel we found under the desk, and the length of time it took to receive an ice bucket when request, a half hour! Despite the later we will return.
