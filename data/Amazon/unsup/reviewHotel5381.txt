We stayed here for one night, as we had a party in Lincoln Park and didn't want to drive back to the suburbs after it was over. We were thoroughly impressed with this hotel, and would highly recommend it to anybody looking for a place to stay on the north side of town. We had a suite, and thought it was amazing for the price we paid. The staff was incredibly friendly, the free breakfast was more than we expected, and the amenities in the room were top notch. If you're looking for a place to stay on the north side, look no further. Best value out there, no doubt.
