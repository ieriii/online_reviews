top notch hotel: My girlfriend got a room at this hotel and it was an experience. I am not used to staying in a classy & place with character like the talbott.We arrived a lil early than 3pm check in and they allowed us to check in early, so i thought that was a big plus we stayed for the weekend and the room was very clean and very quiet.Security is a big thing on my list and i felt good knowing that there were modern security camera everywhere you walked. i was even making out with my girl in the elevator and looked up to notice a camera on me.Everyone was very friendly and helpful and that made us look forward to coming back.Its also located in a real good & safe area. with all the train & bus lines close by. Excellent places to wine & dine but you will pay more because this is the gold coast and the safe areas are usually the expensive areas.The wifi wireless internet is great for those laptops and my laptop worked great.Its great thing to have the internet in your room and wireless is a bonus. Oh yeah no coffee makers in the room so you have to go the lobby and get a cup. Also in the bar in the morning they have pastries & juices setup there but its not free. I made the mistake of grabbing 2 donuts and got charged over $3.00 yikes. theres a place called tempos which serves great breakfast a block away. I would stay at this place again and even though it might be a lil pricey to stay here it worth every penny of it.
