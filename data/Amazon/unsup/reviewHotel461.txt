I have stayed here a few times and my experience has been mixed. On the plus side, the hotel has a gorgeous lobby, with great views of the city around it. It feels bright and open, much more so than most cookie cutter Embassy Suites. The rooms (suites) are nice and standard, and staff has been courteous and helpful on all occasions. The pool that is right off the lobby is nice, as is the jacuzzi. On the minus side, the lines for breakfast can be atrocious, especially on weekend mornings when families stay at the hotel. I am talking about 20 or 30 minutes buffet lines - forget about ordering a custom breakfast. You really need to be there at 7 AM to avoid the lines, but that means you need to alter your schedule to account for the hotel's inability to handle a crowd. The same is true of the evening reception - lines of 15, 20, 30 people to order a drink - frustrating. So I can recommend the hotel, but if the complimentary amenities are a reason for choosing this hotel, be prepared to dedicate extra time.
