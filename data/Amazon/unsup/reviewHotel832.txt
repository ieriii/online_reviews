Location is what this hotel is all about. It is within walking distance of Millennium Park, State Street Shopping, and even the Sears tower, andn many, many other tourist attractions. The L is right outside, so if you need to go anywhere, it's steps away. And don't worry about it being loud - I slept fine there.  However, I wasn't crazy about their room and decor. They are older, and the room we had was a bit too old for my taste. The bathroom was clean, but it didn't have the new industrial touch many other hotels I've stayed at did. While I like the location of Silversmith, I would still prefer a hotel near the Magnificent Miles, since the Loop isn't as cool at night. I guess it is fine if you're just looking for a practical place to stay while in Chicago, but if you're looking for something a bit more "special," I'd recommend other hotels.
