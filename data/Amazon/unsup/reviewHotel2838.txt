We stayed here for our fist night in Chicago - GREAT Location. The rooms are adequate - somewhat out dated and the valet parking is ridiculous expensive - $51 for 24 hours. It was a short visit and for location it is a great hotel. But if you are looking for comfort, there are other nicer and more hip hotels closer.
