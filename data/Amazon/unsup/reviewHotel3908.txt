I would almost be tempted to give this place 3 stars just for location, but it is just not possible. Our human interaction with the Hotel staff was minimal and basically acceptable it just seems to us like they are banking on the fact that their location and overflow from other hotels will keep them full enough to cover their expenses and make some money. The place would be well served if some dollars were reinvested into a bit of a makeover. The place is filthy, the carpet is smelly and it just looks old and dated. It wasn't our choice to stay here, but since I snoozed on signing up for the Chicago Marathon, I had to go through Marathon Tours for an entry and the only available hotel left was this one- so we checked out the reviews before we arrived and were totally mortified by them. The A/C wasn't working in our room and based on the dismal service described in the other reviews, we decided against calling the front desk to report it. Thankfully it was cool enough in the evenings and we were able to open the windows despite the fact that it was the 14th floor. The fresh air did wonders to dissipate the musty smell from the room and the cool nights made it for comfortable stay despite the sound of the L train passing by every few minutes and the random sirens blaring somewhere in the city. Very convenient location and a bonus star for the small poltergeist I saw on the last night we were there .... a haunted hotel is a cool hotel...
