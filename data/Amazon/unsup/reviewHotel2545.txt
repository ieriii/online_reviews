Victor Hotel can blow me - that is, if I had the right parts. Came here with a group of 8 people - celebrating 3 birthdays in one night. Wanted to find a cool place to hang out and have some cocktails. We get to the door. It's only 10pm. Not really late considering this is a lounge and the party doesn't get started until after midnight. The asshole manning the door said "there is no room for your group in there - it's packed. BUT - you can get table service in there" FINE - it was early March - Freezing - ok - so we went in with the table service, only to find that upon entering - the place was empty. The decor is BARE with the exception of their bars being lit up and a few plants. The space is divided into several sections and like I said - Empty. The music is so loud - even if you do have table service and squeezed into a small space - you can't hear your friends talk.  This place cheated us / coerced us into getting table service - That is just DAMNED bad service. I do not recommend this place to anyone.
