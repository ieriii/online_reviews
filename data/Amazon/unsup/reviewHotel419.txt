Wow. Worst hotel experience of my entire life. I arrived here around 9:45 on a Tuesday night. I had to be up early the next morning and was just looking for a place to grab dinner, store my stuff, and catch a good nights sleep before a long days of work. Upon arrival (at the self proclaimed 3 star hotel) I was disappointed to find that it was in a not-so-nice part of town. However, I quickly got over the fact because all I was looking for was a bed to sleep on. When I got to my room, changed, and left to grab food, I noticed the door to my hotel room would not lock from the outside. I called the front desk and asked to either be switched to another room or to have someone come fix it. Unfortunately, the handy man didn't arrive until 11:30... which meant I was sitting in my room, awake, foodless, waiting for him to arrive. After he came it took him an hour to fix my door. I wrote an angry letter to hotel management the next day and got the room comped for the night. However, I was pretty upset because I wasn't able to sleep very well, which definitely affected my performance at work the next day. Anyways... all things considered I will probably avoid the Chicago South Loop hotel the next time I'm around... and I recommend everyone else do the same.
