I work for a wedding planning company in Chicago, IL and worked at a South Asian wedding last night at the Drake Hotel. We have done NUMEROUS weddings at various 4 and 5-star hotels within Chicago and the surrounding suburbs, so we had a certain expectation. Let me first off say that the banquet halls where the wedding was held were beautiful-the decor, the flowers, everything. HOWEVER...we were told by the hotel management that we could leave our personal belongings in a specific place at the hotel (which we always do), so that we could work and not worry about our stuff. After a few hours, we came back to find that the wallets of the 5 girls with whom I work (including myself) had been opened and all of our money had been STOLEN along with an iPhone! No guests had access to this room-it was only hotel staff. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM AT ANY OTHER HOTEL!!! I was completely disgusted. This is a hotel that claims to uphold a certain "standard", but they have apparently no requirements for when hiring people. To make matters worse, when we filed complaints with the security manager, he told us that "plenty of help gets hired for the day of any wedding and they're not actual employees of The Drake". Basically taking away any and all responsibility from the situation....I was completely APPALLED.It's not even the hundreds of dollars that were taken, but rather the principle of the matter. Coming to a hotel like the Drake, you expect a certain degree of professionalism from the staff and you certainly don't expect someone to violate you the way that we had been. As someone who has worked and attended a LOT of upscale elaborate weddings, I will NEVER recommend anyone to come to the Drake. They may have stolen a couple hundred bucks from us, but they're definitely going to be losing far more business.
