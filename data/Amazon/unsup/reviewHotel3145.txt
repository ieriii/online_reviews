Pains me to write this, but just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, it did. We stayed here for three nights. I wrote my last review upon arrival; unfortunately, the stay did not improve. I doubt that I will stay at this W again, and sadly, my GF says she will never stay at another W - not even the new W Maldives :(  Rather than go into details, I will simply write a laundry list of issues: 1) I already mentioned: rough sheets and a hard bed. As for decor, I'll give them a break, since they are renovating in the next year or two. 2) Overwhelming lemon scent coming from the bed and could not sleep.  We asked housekeeping to change all linens in hopes of "fixing" the issue. They did; however, the issue was not resolved. Come to discover (we discovered, not housekeepping) that somebody poured a substance on the bed and it was simply "covered up" and not addressed by housekeeping. Kudos to Grant for moving us to another room, actually a suite. I have an issue with this, too. I am Platinum with Starwood and they are supposed to automatically upgrade me to the "best room/suite" available - but, we did not get a suite until there was an issue. hmmm... 3) Toilet did not flush properly Issues with room # 2 4) The TV did not work until after we unplugged and reconfigured the wiring. 5) Wireless internet did not work in the suite. Would go in and out. 6) The light in the living room flickered. 7) The vanity mirror/light shocked my GF when she touched it. Fortunately, she was wearing shoes with rubber soles. 8) The heater/AC couldn't decide if it wanted to be hot or cold 9) The window covering in the bedroom did not roll up
