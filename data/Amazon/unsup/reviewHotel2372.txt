Talk about Historic.  Just taking the elevator to my room, the tv screen is spitting out all these facts about the hotel....  Quite impressive.  I walk into my room (which has a double bed), and its the size of a small apartment.  The receptionist told me that some of the double bed rooms are twice the size of king sized beds - and although I like King beds....  This was nice.   The new renovations have added some new technology to the room - and this computer which is all "High Tech"... is annoying as hell.  First off - the internet is NOT free.  They don't tell you the price, but a small warning comes up saying very sneakily that you agree that all charges can be placed on your room....   You can clearly tell that this software is just another ad revenue for the hotel since most of the "recommended" places to visit also happen to advertise on it.... Hmmmmm interesting.  The parking situation is stupid expensive!! I understand you are in Chicago, and it's a freaking commodity, but $50 per night!!!  I was there for a week!!!!  Great room, nice views, friendly staff..... TOO expensive!
