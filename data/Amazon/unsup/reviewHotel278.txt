Lucky us, the Seneca overbooked and we were put in the Presidential Suite! SWEET!!!!!! Excitedly opened the door... DRIP! What the...?! I was scared to call for fear that they'd move me into a regular room. Instead maintenance was sent and fixed the drip (coming from the AC) in no time. NIIICE!!!!!! Love the Seneca Hotel!
