Stayed here for the weekend when I went to visit a friend in Chicago for my birthday. The interior of the hotel is lovely. Wrought iron. Dark wood. Fabrics in blues and golds. I had a room on the 8th floor which had a great view of Chicago and felt like my own mini office away from my office. Kimptons service was excellent as usual--right down to the wine. Many thanks Hotel Burnham!
