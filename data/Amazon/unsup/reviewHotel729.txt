We stayed at the downtown Chicago Westin Hotel this weekend and had a great experience! The weekend price was very reasonable, rooms were average as far as decorating goes, but they had really great beds and bedding. My son needed emergency cleaning service on his suit and, voila! It was hanging in his room within a short time. The lobby is small but had plenty of seating-it gave the feel of a boutique hotel. Even though there was a coffee pot in the room with Starbucks coffee, we took advantage of the lobby Starbucks. The grill/bar had a warm old Chicago ambiance-great photos filled the walls and the light fixtures added to the flavor of the room.
