Can I write a review if I've only been to the hotel bar? I appreciated a lot of things in the bar at the Congress Plaza Hotel, named {something} Tap, like the mahogany wood, the copper bar, and the pillars surrounding the windows which made it look like at one time this area was completely open and airy. This place must have really been something, circa 1910, and it saddens me to see what it has become. The Red Bull cooler behind the bar and the neon beer signs in the window clash with the ambiance. Wait...actually, the ambiance clashes with the ambiance. There are no cocktail waitresses and the few people they have delivering the food look super ornery. The clientele is kind of a mixed bag of "what the hell" and "aww, you poor thing from Idaho that accidentally booked a room here." Still, my friends and I were in need of a little girl chat and wine so we ordered what has come to be known as The Worst Bottle of Wine Ever. It was a 2008 pinot noir, it was $44 (highway robbery!), and it tasted like it had turned. Still - and I'm unsure how this happened - we choked it down, alternating sip of wine with sip of water. Today I feel like I'm going to vom.
