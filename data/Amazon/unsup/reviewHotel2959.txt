sheraton chicago is a bit generic, but what can you expect from a hotel with 1000 rooms? staff seems very polished and its obvious this is one of sheraton's better properties. the lobby has a modern decor, but falls flat as anything more than a area to pass through. still, it seemed very active-- couldn't imagine how crowded it would be if the hotel was ever really busy. location is meh. it's across the street from an amc + lucky strike which is good/bad depending on how you look at things. it IS a good location for public transit connections, however, is a couple block's walk to any of the subway/l trains. rooms are fine. they're not anything special, but i probably wouldn't pay top dollar for them. the rooms do have nice views of the chicago river. all in all a nice hotel in an almost sleepy corner of downtown chicago. i would say this hotel fits the bill if you're looking for something big, clean, and comfortable with good access to michigan ave and the river north areas.
