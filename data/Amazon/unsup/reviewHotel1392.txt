Location location location. That is the key. It's across from the Drake. It's near the 900 Shops.  My friend got married here and the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.  The newly renovated hotel is beautiful, especially the Crystal Ballroom. It is gorgeous! The valet can get pricey (over $25 a night).
