I travel weekly, so finding a home away from home is challenging. I initially made my reservation in April, before the opening and was skeptical. When I arrived, I was sent to another hotel for one night due to over booking. Despite a bit of inconvenience at the beginning, this hotel did an outstanding job of accommodating me when I returned. The rooms are outstanding. The service is friendly and professional. The fitness and yoga studio far exceeded my expectations.I'm booked to go back in October. This is my Chicago home away from home.
