The drake is definitely a classy hotel, but I agree with Kiki that it could use a little bit of a makeover. The lobby and rooms are very nice, but it doesn't even compare to The Peninsula and some of the newer popoular hotels in Chicago. Edit 1/3/07: Attended a tea party for a friend's bday at the Drake today. It was a wonderful day and I had fun celebrating, but not overly impressed with tea at the Drake. The tea was good, but the sandwiches were pretty gross...hardly compares to tea at the Ritz and/or the Peninsula.
