The rooms here are pretty nice, however we had some bad luck and got a room right next to the elevator. Those elevators are very fast and apparently also very loud, because we could hear them all night long. The view from our room was amazing though....a straight shot of the Hancock Observatory with the river in front. The bar on the 2nd floor was fun and a good view of the river, although drinks were pricey...what you'd expect from a hotel bar I guess. We tried to check out through the TV checkout and it didn't work which was a minor annoyance because we didn't want to have to wait in line downstairs (the hotel was super busy the whole time we were there). Overall just an okay experience. Nothing stood out, and next time we'd be sure to request a room away from the elevator.
