Got this hotel through Hotwire at a very good price for the area and class. Based on reviews we figured we couldn't go too wrong and were not disappointed. From the start, everyone was pleasant, helpful, quick, eager to assist. The room was clean, comfortable, and large enough for our family of four (we had wanted two doubles but were "upgraded" to a suite with a king and pull out. This worked out but was not truly an upgrade for us. Nice touches were free wireless internet (worked fine for us all weekend), free safe, whirlpool tub, separate shower, large rooms, close walking to many sites and eateries. Noise was only a problem one night when our neighbors were closing their door (letting it slam shut) continually at 2 in the morning. Most hotels have a lack of noise proofing around the door and this was no exception. That said, it really was only a problem once and briefly. Parking is what it is for downtown Chicago - you pay for it here but the Valet staff were great and will get your car whenever you need.
