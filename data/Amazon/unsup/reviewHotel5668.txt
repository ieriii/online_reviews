One of the best places i've ever stayed. My hubby and i got married this summer and couldnt go on our honeymoon for a few weeks, so we did a mini honeymoon in chicago - and this is where we stayed. Listed on tripadvisor as one of the top ten places to stay in the US - I can definately see why. Our room was over a thousand square feet or something like that - basically the size of our apartment - it was wonderful. For paying a fraction more than you'd pay for any standard room elsewhere in the city we were getting a huge room and personalized treatment you'd never find in huge hotels.  The bathroom was amazing - though i was disappointed the tub wasnt really sized for two - which would have been great - i enjoyed soaking in a bubble bath and watching tv. Lounging around in their luxurious robes was fantastic - and we got monogrammed robes to take home.  They have a concierge to take care of all of your reservation needs or to give suggestions for things to do in the area - we're from chicago but this was a fantastic luxury to have. She reccomended some great places that we never would have found on our own. They spent probably a good hour hunting around trying to make an appointment for a couples massage for us on july 5th (which seemed impossible) They did it! And it was much appreciated work!  After going out for dinner the first night, we came home to a turned down bed with rose petals and a complimentary bottle of champagne as well as some truffles and a congratulatory note about our marriage.  This place was great - i will definately come back and highly reccomend it to all travelers or chicagoans for a little getaway. They make you feel like family here and the service is outstanding.
