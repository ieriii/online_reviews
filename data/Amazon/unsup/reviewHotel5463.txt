I reserved a block of rooms for out of town guests for my recent wedding. The hotel staff was really great to work with. Rosie contacted me a week or so before the wedding to make sure she had all the info to pass on to the guests. I was a little concerned the suite I booked would be too small for the bridal party to use to get dressed so I e-mailed Rosie, she said she would make sure I was put in the largest junior suite, no problem! The room was beautiful and plenty spacious. The guests loved the location. I think it has a perfect combination of boutique/smallish feel, without seeming quaint or shabby. Would give 5 stars if the price ($179 per night) could have been knocked down just a bit! Otherwise, no complaints.
