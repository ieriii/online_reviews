It's a classic old brick hotel that's been refurbished into a pleasant boutique lodging for those on a budget. Given its age the rooms (and hallways, and elevators -- dragging luggage is not always a perfectly smooth operation) are small, but all the room interiors have been comfortably refreshed. The location is great, right on the Mile with excellent views from the higher floors. Their lounge is modern (but again, small), but a nice quiet spot for a drink.  In the morning, there's complimentary Intelligentsia coffee to start your day. I'd definitely stay there again when business takes me into the second city proper.
