I'm not usually a fan of the Sheraton, but this time, I really had a great experience that was much better than my last two stays at each of the two W Hotels.  Several great things: 1. Price - I booked far in advance so was fortunate to get a good rate of about $215 and ended up with a corner room on a high floor, so was very pleased. That said, they did fill up quickly, and the rate goes up when that happens. 2. The bed was comfortable, plenty of pillows.  3. Great location - just a few blocks from the Lake, which has a nice running path. 4. Nice restaurants and room service. 5. Friendly staff.  6. Free bottled water in the rooms. 7. Minibar that left space for me to put my own drinks in the fridge. A few problems though: 1. My window wouldn't open. They were very nice about it and sent a technician who was friendly and fixed it pretty quickly, so no minus points. 2. The shampoo. The Westins and Ws have pretty nice shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc, but the Sheraton stock supplies are horrendous. No body wash is provided, only a crappy bar of soap. No face was is provided. And the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling like I washed it with glue. Bring your own and please complain so hopefully they change it. Minus one star. 3. They double charged me for internet because I connected on Wi-Fi and with the wired connection. But they fixed it immediately when I called in and emailed me my updated bill, so no minus stars. Internet was still pretty slow, though. Overall, a 3.5 star experience, that I'm rounding up to 4.
