It's a nice clean hotel located in downtown Chicago. Went to Chicago for a business conference. the conference itself was located at Hyatt McCormick, but we stayed at the HRC, which is OK. Less lobby traffic. Got a room on the 30th floor. The view is OK. Overlooking some construction site. There are lots of bars in the hotel but lack decent breakfast place. Which is a little disappointing considering it's primary a business oriented hotel. Nothing amazing or outstanding. Expensive for what you get... 200+ / night without wifi really kind of sucks. Wouldn't stay there as a personal trip, but OK for business.
