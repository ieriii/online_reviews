I used hotwire (i love love love hotwire) and booked for a 4 star hotel. Sadly as soon as I stepped into the room I knew this was NOT a 4 star hotel, it was clearly a 3 star. Pros: - FANTASTIC location. my view outside my window was of tiffany's and saks. awesome sight to wake up to =) - comfortable bed (why it was not a 4 star) Cons: - no cable tv! no local network channels either! only pay per view! - no morning newspaper option - TINY room...my college dorm room was bigger - poor bathroom amenities: poor quality towels, no body lotion - housekeeping came at 9am... I'm really not sure why they advertise themselves as a modern boutique hotel because the Allerton is clearly more of a clean budget hotel thats only worth staying at because of the location.
