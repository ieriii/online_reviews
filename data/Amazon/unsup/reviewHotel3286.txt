Stayed for 1 night in July 2009 and it was great! The hotel is in the Carbon & Carbide building, a beautiful example of Art Deco architecture. Our room was surprisingly large and was well-decorated in muted grey tones in a Dwell Magazine style. We lucked out and had a nice view of the city. Our bathroom was sleek, but only had a large shower stall instead of a full tub. The hotel's location is perfect--steps from Millennium Park, the Loop, the Chicago River, and several metro and train lines. The staff was helpful--especially Concierge Paula Nascimento, as she went out of her way to help us find a late night eatery when we were out-and-about at 10pm on a Sunday night and were calling her on a cell phone...She went the extra mile and checked in with several places to see who was still open and pointed us to a beautiful restaurant/bar called Chaise Lounge in Bucktown (http://chaiseloungechica). Truly a great call! The Hard Rock's rates were very reasonable if you book on http://hotels.com. In the past, we've also stayed at the Allerton Hotel and the Palmer House, both of which we liked. Overall, however, I would rank the Hard Rock on top, as it really gets the details right and has just the right amount of "coolness" to make your stay feel special.
