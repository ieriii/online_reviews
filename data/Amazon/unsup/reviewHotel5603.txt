Stayed here during a conference that was held in the downstairs area and everything was really spot on and luxurious feeling. First, my room: very nice. I was on the 10th floor with a view of the crazy round beehive buildings that are just across the street (and a slice of the river if you wanted to crane your neck.) The room contained a lovely chaise lounge by the window, an extremely comfortable king bed, a fluffy robe, a delightful high-pressure shower head, etc. Overall my only complaint would be that the in-room internet is on the slow side. Next, the food, while tending towards the heavy, meat-laden side (not that meat-laden is a bad thing) is delicious. Meals served during the event, a meal I ate in the bar and in-room dining were all super. The sushi bar in the lobby is a nice touch and the burger I got delivered to my room was huge and amazing. Room service took about 45 minutes to arrive, so that is on the longer side, but it was worth it. The conference facilities downstairs were classy. Good lighting and a high level of service from the staff at all times. But one thing: not enough plugs! Location is central and close to local attractions, restaurants, the river walk, etc. No complaints there. Overall, an excellent place to be if you have to be in Chicago for a couple days.
