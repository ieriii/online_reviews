If Ashton Kutcher popped out from behind the curtains and said "OHHHH YOU'VE BEEN PUNKED THIS IS JUST A HOLIDAY INN!!!" I would have likely replied "oh Ash, you scoundrel. You've done it again!" The room was comfortable but not terribly luxurious. Just looks like any other hotel room. Paying 12 dollars for room service cereal and it's just a bowl of cereal and some milk is outrageous. No fruit, no oj, no nothing. Expensive for what it is.
