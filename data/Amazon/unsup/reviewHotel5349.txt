We hosted our wedding reception here. For all brides and grooms out there- pass on this place. We had several issues occur- from being passed around among three wedding coordinators to the wrong chair cover color! HUGE mistakes were made, luckily we were reimbursed for our troubles. If you are willing to spend the money for a downtown reception- do not book here. I thought since we were the only event that evening, everything would be perfect but they managed to screw up royally by double booking my bridal suit and not being able to raise and lower the lighting. On a positive note, the wait staff was amazing. My husband and I were very pleased with the food and dinner service. The steak received great reviews from our guests. The chicken was delicious too. If you are a perfectionist like me, this place does not fit the bill.
