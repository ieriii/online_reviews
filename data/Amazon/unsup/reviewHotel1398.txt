I stayed here for a couple of nights during a business trip to Chicago. Actually our work meetings were held on premises as well. First, I have to say that I really loved the location. Even though downtown/miracle mile Chicago isn't my end-all and be-all of city destinations, I still appreciated that I was close to Michigan ave...especially when I had a night off to relax and enjoy some time meeting up with my transplanted Detroit friend.  (And I loved the proximity to Jamba Juice...I'm a freak, I know! but we don't have it at home, so I savor it when I encounter one!)  As for the hotel, the staff were super nice. The rooms were great, with beautiful, modern bathrooms (I loved the rainfall shower!) and big TVs. The decor was clean and modern but the beds did leave something to be desired...maybe it was the pillows but I definitely remember not being super comfortable.  Our work meetings were mainly held in the Crystal Ballroom, which is a beautiful space. I can imagine how pretty it would look for an special evening event. However, since I was in there all day for up to eight hours, I did have plenty of time how there were numerous coats of paint and plenty of wear on the carpets.... Oh, the cold, cruel light of day!  When I return to Chicago, I probably will not have this place as my first choice, more like 2nd or 3rd choice if I will be staying close to the Miracle Mile area.
