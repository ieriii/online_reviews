No free wireless anywhere in the hotel! Are you kidding me, people?! Given that the main purpose of this impersonal, convention-style hotel is to enable maximum productivity when a person is on the road, one would think that wireless Internet would be a given. As a Chicago native ... well, for a few months, now ... I assumed my time of tangling with the area's lodging spots (refer to my previous Travelodge review) would be distant, repressed memories. I thought wrong, as it turned out my parents were in town in connection with a recent business event that my dad had to attend. Necessarily, I needed to shuttle back and forth between the Hyatt, where they were staying, and my apartment (which, for the record, is lovely and has a fantastic, unlimited access high-speed Internet connection included with my rent). I'll also add that the Starbucks downstairs is a gouging one, that doesn't even have cinnamon or the full array of coffee drinks that I- along with every other traveler/consumer- have come to expect.
