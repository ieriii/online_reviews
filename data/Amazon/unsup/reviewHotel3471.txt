Horrible service. I stayed here this weekend and i would have to say one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever experienced. First off we called the hotel 6 times before showing up there to see if we could check in a little early, and they never answered. Then once we got there and let them know that we tried to call, they never apologized but said that our room was ready and we could check in. but not 30 seconds later we were told that we had to wait, and that they would call us when our room was ready. Once we got a call, about an hour later, we went up to the room (the hotel is old and elevators take forever! but its not too bad) which was small, but clean and nice. The room itself was not bad. Since the building is old everything is smaller, from the rooms, to the hallways, to the elevators. The walls are also SUPER thin, you could probably hear your neighbor sneeze if it was a good one. The worst part of our stay was that the hotel NEVER answered the phone. No matter if it was to ask for more towels or to verify the time of the check out. And if that wasn't bad enough, when we checked out they didn't even say 'thank you' or 'hope you enjoyed staying with us'. All we were told when we got down to the front desk was 'you guys already paid, you can go'. If that's not great customer service i don't know what is! I recommend finding another hotel in Chicago to stay at. You can find deals on hotels for about the same price all over the city. So save yourself the trouble.
