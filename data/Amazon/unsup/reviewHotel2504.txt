This is a great hotel to stay at in Chicago if you can afford their prices. The room we had was excellent, the view was great, and the food (when we got it) was good. The only complaint that I have is, the staff seemed busy and would "forget" to tell us about things like the free breakfast. Anyways I still enjoyed my stay there.
