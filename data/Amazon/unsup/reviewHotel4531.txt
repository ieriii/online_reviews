Truly a classic and elegant hotel, full of European glamor. The lobby is definitely a must see! I think the painter who worked on the ceiling also worked on the restoration of Michael Angelo's work in the past. You can see why. The rooms are old building style so not that large in size, but the amenities are decent. No wireless internet unless requested...kind of weak!
