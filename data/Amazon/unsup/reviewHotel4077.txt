Pretty sweet digs. I learned on my bus tour that this hotel has the LONGEST bar, interesting. I shared a double room and I found it to be super comfortable. My bed and pillows were comfy. Except those decorative pillows. Those are gross, I pushed them off immediately. I appreciated the curved shower rod which made the tub seem larger. I did not appreciate the ill flushing toilet. Also, 26 floors up and you would think I'd get awesome cell reception, but no. Living within concrete walls for a long weekend did not please my phone. Concierge was helpful, elevator was pretty fast, as long as you weren't stopping on every floor. Hairdryer is found in a black bag hanging in the closet, if you seemed to miss it in the bathroom. Careful though, my friend blew the circuits using it on high and was without power for 30 minutes. I liked the ipod doc, nice touch. Made our preparties a bit more lively. The LCD tv was in theory a good idea, but jeez, the picture on mine looked like I was looking through a fishbowl. Housekeeping knocked on my door at 9am each morning so boo to that. Otherwise, great place for a stay. :)
