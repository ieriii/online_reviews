My recent stay in the Congress Plaza Hotel in Chicago was one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. The trip started out with difficult to understand but effective check in clerks but went downhill from there. On the way to our room we were trapped in an elevator for 20 minutes. It took that long to open it even with a hotel employee in the elevator with us to call for help; if it had been just guests in there who knows how long it would have taken. Once we were freed there was no contact from guest services to reassure us or offer a discount on the stay, just hotel security demanding our names and room numbers as if we had done something wrong. We weren't spending that much time in the hotel, just sleeping overnight and cleaning up in the morning but even that wasn't great. The mattress and pillows were poor quality, somehow managing to be not supportive but too firm at the same time. The bathroom was cramped, the shower was cold, and the facilities all looked like they had been repaired shoddily more than once. The walls didn't seem to stop much noise; I was woken up more than once by someone in a nearby room urinating (awesome). On top of that, nothing is included: breakfast , parking, and internet are all additional and expensive. I do not recommend staying in this hotel if you can possibly avoid it.
