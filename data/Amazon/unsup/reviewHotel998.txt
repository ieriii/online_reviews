I prefer boutique hotels above chain hotels, and at the price point, the Amalfi is a fantastic value. The interior is trendy, but not obnoxious, the rooms are well appointed and sizable for a downtown hotel. The bathrooms are fabulous!  My complaints about the hotel are pretty minor. They have teeny little closets and itsy bitsy drawer space. I hate not being able to unpack. And I never realized how important room service was until I had to wander the halls looking for coffee. Seriously, providing me with coffee in the morning is in everyone's best interest. Don't make me get dressed and talk to random strangers in order to get coffee.) Those quibbles aside, the staff was magnificent, the room was nice, and the price point was more than reasonable for a hotel with such a great location. If someone would bring me coffee and a muffin in the morning, I would be a regular visitor.
