I thought this was a decent hotel for a first time visit to Chicago. Like just with everyone else, you can get a pretty good rate via Priceline. Despite all the numerous conventions and events going on, they still need to fill up those vacant rooms. Of course if I had to choose on my next visit to the Windy City, I would choose another hotel just for a different experience. Check-in was nice and easy. The lady helping us was pleasant enough. But before I could even request a bigger room or a nicer view, we were quickly handed the keys. They probably have a big red sign flashing in red on their computer screen saying "casual tourists, not corporate accounts." I asked if we could get access to the Regency Club for the free breakfast daily, that got shot down. Extra $75. No thanks. Our room was no-frills, with a nice big view of an office building. Big flat screen TV and a comfortable bed, that's pretty much all we need. The walls are as thin as tissue paper, as you can hear people flushing the toilet, sneezing, or talking in the hallway. No fridge, no free Wi-Fi, or any other "luxury" amenities. Safe to say, I wouldn't pay anywhere near the standard rates listed on their website. Priceline prices, yeah it's about right. Maybe even a little less. Of course, the biggest advantage with this hotel is the location. We stayed in the West tower, so the elevator conveniently spits you out to Wacker street and you're on your way. It's centrally located, so you can either go north to Magnificent Mile or south to the Loop, where there is Millenium Park, Willis Tower, Art Institute, etc. Plus, it's close to all the bus and train stations. Oh, and the workout room isn't too shabby either. Gotta work off all that deep dish pizza somehow.
