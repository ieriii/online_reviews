1st time @ The Dana, and my wife and I really enjoyed our stay. Good location and cool vibe make it a great spot. Love the room. Comfy bed. Great shower!! Nice amenities. Only issue we had with hotel was the elevator. They apparently don't have service elevators so there's a lot of traffic on the lifts which makes for some longer wait. Also would have appreciated a pool.
