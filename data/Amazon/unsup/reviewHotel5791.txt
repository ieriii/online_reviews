really a 2.5 rounded up to 3. nothing super impressive, but nothing horribly offensive either. the lobby smells a little funny and is not very attractive, but is better than the exterior might suggest. the rooms are the most important part of any hotel, and these ones did not disappoint. surprisingly large for two adults, comfortable beds, functioning tv (with a pretty decent cable package) and air conditioning. the bathroom was fine, but nothing special. shower temperature could have been better, but pressure was good. just don't plan on using the refrigerator to store leftovers - seriously the shallowest mini-fridge i've ever seen. worked just fine for our booze, though. also, wifi is incredibly spotty - i didn't even try after day 1. the breakfast was surprisingly not bad when we ordered room service/went down for the champagne brunch. however, be advised that booze cannot be served until noon in illinois, so you'll have to wait a bit for that mimosa if you go down as soon as brunch starts. would it be my first choice? most certainly not, but i've certainly stayed in worse hotels. for the price, we were quite content, and its proximity to the #6 bus and free shuttle to and from the loop 4 times a day were very nice surprises.
