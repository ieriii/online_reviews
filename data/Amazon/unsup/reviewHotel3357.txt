WARINIG!!!! HOUSEKEEPING STOLE $200 WORTH OF OUR STUFF!!!My wife and I spent last weekend here for business. The day before we left my wifes belongings mysteriously dissappeared, Now that we gotten back home we realized that much of clothes are missing also. Management was not helpful in either returning our belongings or reinbursing us for the STOLEN!!! items. Almost as though this crap happens all th time! DONT LET ANYONE INTO YOUR ROOM!!!! ESSuX is the king of all crap holes!! Thanks for ripping us off, Losers!!
