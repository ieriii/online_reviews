Hotel has a pretty nice lobby/bar area and the room was nice, great view of the lake and navy pier.  Problems: Parking is $52.00 a day which is outrageous, lots right next door charge nearly half that. Internet connection costs 14.95/day per device. So if I wanted to connect my laptop and my phone to the wireless in my room that would be almost $30.00 a day! When a standard room is $175.00 gotta make these other amenities cheaper. Even if I just used one device, $14.95 a day? The connection wasn't even that fast. If these things wouldn't bug you however, I would still recommend the hotel if you're looking for a great lakeshore view with modern decor
