Nice hotel. Pretty good service, not great but good. BUT, if you need Wifi go elsewhere...their Wifi is horrible! The beds are comfy, but the rooms are teeny tiny. Overall, worth the $ for the scene and the "coolness" - but the amenities are average (gym, room service, etc.). Very modern. Very cool, but not sure it's worth the $? Reminds me of a Vegas hotel...which is weird when the elevator is blasting techno at 8a on a Monday.
