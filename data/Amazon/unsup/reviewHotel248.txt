I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights recently. I am a business traveler that just relocated to Chicago and needed a place to stay while I was waiting to move into my apartment. I stayed in many different hotels before moving into my place - Swiss Hotel, Marriott, Hyatt - all downtown and I have to tell you, they really depressed me. Maybe they are geared for the business traveler and not a pleasure traveler, but God, I hated those places. So I decided to try something different and got a boutique hotel in the Gold Coast which is how I ended up at Hotel Indigo.  Wow, what a great little place. I looooved it. Loved the hotel and really loved the location - tucked in on a residential Gold Coast street. The decor is bright and you just feel happy as soon as you walk in. The decor is mainly blues and greens - very bright and beachy - it would really be a great place to stay in the summertime.  Anyway, the people were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were big and bright and nice and the location is to die for. You can walk to shopping in the Gold Coast, walk to the beach, walk to Old Town, you can even walk to Lincoln Park and the Zoo if the weather permits and you have comfy shoes on. And forget all those places above - you can just walk around the neighborhood and take a look at all the gorgeous old greystones and brownstones and have a great time.  Highly recommend. And check out Priceline and Hotwire - they have this place listed at times as the "secret" 3.5 star boutique hotel in Goldcoast/Water Tower area. I got a room on Hotwire here for $109 a night (usually their rates are $275 and up). What a steal!
