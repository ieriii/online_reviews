Busy, busy, busy. I think I counted seven large events going on at the Palmer House during the two nights we were there. Think a medley of professional salsa dancers, junior high cheer squads, and large wedding parties. I found that most of this activity was contained on the first few floors and didn't really translate to much traffic in our hallway. I agree that the rooms are small - but really, how much room do you actually need to sleep? - There is so much going on right outside the hotel that I find it hard to see why people would want to spend the entirety of their stay indoors. And if they did, the beds in the newly renovated rooms are plush and the shades completely darken the place.  One thing that bugged me was the lack of cell phone reception throughout much of the hotel. I could hardly get a signal - which either says something about Sprint or something about the bunker-like construction methods used in the 1800s.  Regardless, the rates we paid (via Priceline) were super cheap, about $80 before taxes and fees. So, I can deal with a small room and having to call for more towels or pillows. One thing that bugged me was the parking, it was super expensive (about $30 - and that was the special deal). Anyway, you don't really need a car here because you are steps from the El and a lot of other points of interest are right outside your door. Bottom line: if you get a good price, go for it.
