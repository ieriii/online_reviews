Great location, nice decor, and complimentary breakfast! It's within walking distance to Hubbard street where there are many bars and the shops on Michigan Ave. The complimentary breakfast is on each floor and we had coffee, donuts, and croissants. They also had fruit, bagels, and juice. My friend who forgot her razor and toothbrush, asked the front desk for these items and they promptly provided them. I would definitely stay here again. I booked my room thru Orbitz and got a good deal, they have better rates than the Amalfi website.
