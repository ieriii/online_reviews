Great for a group looking to be in a prime tourist location! Five of us shared a room on a Friday night in May 2012. As far as the room goes, beds are soft and comfy - I slept so well!! Had everything we could need (hair dryer, fridge, table, couch, etc) except free internet. Interesting room layout - windows overlook both the outside of the building and the walkways on the inside - a little strange, but understandable as the center of the building is filled with light secondary to the big atrium with skylights and a decorative fountain on the first floor that surrounds the seating for brunch. A nice bonus to the hotel - free drinks between 5:30 and 7:30 and a free breakfast in the AM. The breakfast was delicious - made-to-order omelets, potatoes, bacon, sausage, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juices. Definitely a good deal for a big group like ours who were looking to relax and have a few drinks. The location is ideal. We don't mind walking so we took a hike to Navy Pier, down the Magnificent Mile past the Trump Tower and Wrigley Building to Millennium Park and Buckingham Fountain, west to the Sears Tower, ending up at Giordano's (my favorite deep-dish pizza place in Chicago). At night we went out on Hubbard Street, a place with many bars/clubs to choose from. There are lots of restaurants nearby, making settling on a place for dinner difficult. We settled on Volare as it's not a chain and people on Yelp love it. :) Oh, and while the hotel parking is expensive (over $40 with no ins-and-outs), there was a small lot on the corner that let hotel guests park for up to 24 hours for only $25. Nice deal, but so small that it probably can't be depended on to be available. Overall, great location, nice perks, and comfy beds.
