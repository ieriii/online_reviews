I can't say I was thrilled with this hotel. Everything was just 'meh' and at one point - gross. The room was ok and the bed was nice, yadda yadda. Loved the horizontal mirror above the headboard. Bathroom was clean, city view was 'meh'. I was getting ready for bed and looked towards the wall near the ceiling, and next to the smoke alarm was a small towel stuck into what looked like a hole in the wall at the top. To gross and weird me out even more, there was brown stuff on the towel like the towel was plugging who knows what! ugh! I started to call the front desk about it, but it was so late (almost 1AM) I was tired and after a series of flights, I was done. I hadnt eaten either, so I decided to order room service. While browsing the menu options, the crab, spinach and artichoke dip sounded nice. Again, it was late, I didn't want anything too heavy - I had a big day ahead of me and needed to get some sleep. I placed the order and it was brought up in about 15 minutes. While I waited, I was admiring my view of the city. What I didnt know was that there were others admiring the view too. Yes, there were gnats near the window! gross!! Needless to say, I was not the only one enjoying the spinach and artichoke dip. Oh and the dip was cold. I put the crap right outside my door. What a waste. The next morning I noticed a couple spiders crawling on the window pane - INSIDE the room! I feel like if there were others in the room, I should've been notified. Didnt know my stay would include gnats and spiders. Disgusting. I will NOT be staying here again.
