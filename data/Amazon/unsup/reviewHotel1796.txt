Well, I have spent now 3 weeks at this hotel for work. The bed is pretty comfy, the TV is big, the channels are OK, the rooms are really small! The staff is quite helpful - ask for extra pillows! Be sure to try the Encore bar on the first floor, the food is good and tasty - as well with room service. Location is convenient but know that the Loop goes dead on the weekends.
