This is definitely not a 5-star hotel, more like a 2.5 to 3 star, but don't let that keep you from choosing this hotel. This is our first choice hotel every time we visit Chicago. This hotel ALWAYS has great rates and FREE parking and it's in PRIME location, a few block walk to the Magnificant Mile and next to dozens of great dining and nightlife! It doesn't get much better than that. My husband and I don't spend a lot of time at the hotel when we go to Chicago for the weekend, so I don't need luxury. But for the price, this hotel is better than expected!! The staff is super friendly! The hotel is clean. The beds are decent. BIG THANKS TO THE HOUSEKEEPING MANAGER KRISTY!!!!!!!!!! Our last stay was this past weekend and I left my favorite (expensive) pillow there. She called me within 2 hours of us checking out to tell me. They set it aside and a friend picked it up for me. I have never had a hotel "find" anything I've ever left there and I was so impressed with the honestly and prompt attention this hotel gave to my lost item. The rooms are a bit noisy, but it's Chicago....what do you expect. If you turn the fan on on the window unit, it drowns out all the traffic noise and any noise from the hallway. They have a GREAT swimming pool also! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. For the price, I cannot complain about ANYTHING!!!
