hola hermana! I am writing you from a hotel that may have been great once upon a time. It boasts to have once been the "home of presidents," but it has since fallen from grace. All that remains are the reminders of it's former glory, mostly in the form of it's "coat of arms" that is prominently featured on blankets, sheets, drapes, shower curtains, wallpaper, and at the top of this letter. I opted to stay here because I read it was one of the most haunted hotels in all of chicago. Unless the shrieks from the nearby blue line rail are the cries of restless spirits, i'd say the only real fright is the lack of air conditioning. Although it has lovely offerings such as a gym, a bar/lounge, two eateries, and whatever this "gold room" thing is, they neglect to offer what every traveler needs...FREE INTERNET! What is this, 1998? They are grasping at the past to prove their greatness, but everything looks like just that, including the strangely dressed staff. Everything looks like it should be cool, like in a wes anderson sort of way, but it falls short and comes off more as ironic than anything else. You know me, I am not above spending nights in my car, but as it is a dream of mine to live in a hotel and have a driver, this falls quite short of my vision. It lacks any sort of real charm. Maybe if it had some spotted mice... Love, Brian (Your brother)
