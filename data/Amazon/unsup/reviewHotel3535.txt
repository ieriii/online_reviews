GREAT location, but you can definitely find better quality. It's been "renovated" but it's like that barely renovated look. (Fresh bed linens but wallpaper curling at the floor type of renovation!) The bathrooms were nice but my door would not stay shut unless slammed. The rooms had VERY thin walls....do what you want with that information.  The customer service was decent, nothing crazy. The pricing was on point, I went through priceline and paid 159 for New Year's Eve. I wish I would have gone for another option, to be honest. One thing did stick out to me: my husband and I waited (LITERALLY) fifteen minutes for an elevator down. Not cool when your hungry and are wearing 5 inch heels. Overall, great for a weekend trip on a budget when you'll be staying little to no time in your hotel bad for a romantic splurge.
