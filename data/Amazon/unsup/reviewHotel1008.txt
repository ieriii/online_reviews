5 stars all the way. This was my first time staying in the River North area, and I wasn't sure how convenient it would be, but I am so glad I stayed here! My room did not have jazz and soul music like other yelpers have posted, but they did have a few award-winning novels, which I thought was unique. I used the business center to print out my boarding pass. They have a new Mac desktop! For those of you that can't get up early enough for the awesome free breakfast, there is an Einstein Bros Bagels across the street. can't wait to go back!
