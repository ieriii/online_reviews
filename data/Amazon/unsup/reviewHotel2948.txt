My Boyfriend and I spend our NYE here. The pictures on their website are deceiving. They told us that we could get an upgrade if there was one available, well we got the upgrade but the room was not what one would expect for a $200/day stay. They don't give you a shower cap or bath soap you have to call and request it. It took 45 minutes to arrive. The maid who brought it up looked like she just woke up and was sleeping in the linens or something. She looked at me like she was so pissed when I asked her if she could bring me an extra bath towel. The 1st thing I noticed when I walked into our room was a stain on the bed covers, that is not cool. Some one did come up and change it. Yes she brought new linen and everything but as she was putting that new linen on I noticed a blue ink stain on it, and I didn't care but about it, at least it wasn't a bodily fluid stain like the previous one. But in front of my face she just flipped the covers over, so that the side with the stain wouldn't show...disgusting. I have put some pictures up of the bathroom, why was there mold in the bathroom of a supposedly 4 star hotel room. The concierge's desk, what a B****. She told me the night we checked in that I could pick up some breakfast coupons from her, and when I went to pick them up the next day the B**** was like I don't even know what you are talking about we don't have such a thing as a breakfast coupon. I was so pissed. This place needs to seriously upgrade their rooms and get new maids that aren't so crabby.
