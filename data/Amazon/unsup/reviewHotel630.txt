I love Doubletrees in general because they have the best chocolate chip walnut cookie!! I'm absolutely obsessed with them. 5 stars for the following: -Cookies when you check in -Fast check in process and friendly staff -Rooms are clean -The beds are comfy and firm mattress -The location is great, right by Navy Pier and close to bus stops and Michigan -Cookies whenever you ask for them!! And I asked (....a lot) - Room price was ~ $150 a night -Check out was fast and the lady gave me two cookies!!! YUM. -Einstein bagels open inside -Good location for Lollapalooza Oh and the cookies here are good!
