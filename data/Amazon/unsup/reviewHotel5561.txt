Stayed here over our anniversary trip while in Chicago. It was everything we'd hoped for in a boutique hotel. We were immediately greeted at the front curb and again inside the lobby by friendly attendants who told us exactly what to do and where to go.  The king room we were in was a little on the small side, however they really made the most of the space and the room was decorated with a neat combination of paintings and drawings and pictures. Our room looked out onto the street, which was fine with us. And since the weather was nice we were actually able to open the window, only a few inches though, and let in fresh air and hear the city. The bed was very comfy and we got a great night sleep. All the linens were clean and pressed.  The room has all the modern touches you would expect, flat screen television and even an Ipod dock/radio on the nightstand. Free Wifi and a safe. Within walking distance of lots of great places to eat, or the lake or the zoo. There is a parking lot one block down that charges $28 a night to self park.  We loved it, and would certainly stay again.
