I really enjoyed my stay here. My best friend and I went here for a girl's night out and had a great time. The room is beautiful and roomy. We had a view of the park and a partial view of the marina on Lake Shore Drive. The location is great..nearby to Michigan Avenue and great restaurants and shopping in the area. We decided to eat at Aria, the sushi bar downstairs. I had never tried sushi, but I have an open mind and have to say it was very good. Also, we had the spa package...excellent spa and service A+++
