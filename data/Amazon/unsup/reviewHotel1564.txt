This is a very pleasant hotel, though it's not the most 'sought out' hotel in downtown Chicago. The staff there is great and I didn't encounter much difficulty checking in, getting my room or ordering when it came to dining at the hotel's restaurant located in the lobby. Price wise, this place is superb. Good deal. The rooms were super spacious and had nice contemporary decor. I had a basic suite with a king-sized bed. The bathroom was a girl's dream, being that it was spacious and included a sliding door closet. Wacker St., where the hotel is faces, offers a great view of the skyscrapers and the waterfront. During my stay, I was lucky enough to see the set-up of the filming of 'Transformers 3,' so this hotel was quite popular then. Wi-fi is also included at this hotel.
