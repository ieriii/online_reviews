Two things really stand out at Burnham: its location and its ambiance. The hotel is located at State and Washington, and the view down State Street from our corner room on the 12th floor was awesome! During the Christmas season, the hotel is right across from Macy's and a block away from the Chicago Christmas tree. It's a couple blocks from Michigan Ave. and Millennium Park. So, walking around right out of the hotel was great and then catching a cab was trivial as well. It's a max $10 cab ride to pretty much anywhere, for example, Lincoln Park. The ambiance is boutique: small and casual. The service isn't snooty or smothering. The lobby is tiny with a fireplace and a couple comfy chairs. Our room was a suite but was still smaller than a more modern hotel. That was fine; it was a great setup and the windows on a corner room were huge. And yes, Burnham has the practicalities down as well... comfy beds and good shower/water pressure. The room had two robes in the closet a leopard pattern and a zebra. Ha! My only complaint... the tiny bar and cafe downstairs were hard to get into. We didn't make reservations for Sunday brunch at Atwood and couldn't get in. So be it! Of course, staying at a downtown hotel ain't cheap, but I think Burnham is a little less than a lot of other options. Highest rating for the Burnham Hotel!
