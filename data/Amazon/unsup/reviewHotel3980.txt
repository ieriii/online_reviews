My friends and I decided to meet up in Chicago for a weekend and ended up getting a room at the Hyatt Regency from priceline. Not a bad deal for a pretty primo location near most things that you would want to do. So I showed up a few hours later than my friends and went to find the room on my own. Be sure to ask which side your friends are on (West or East) as there are two separate buildings across the street from each other. Naturally my friends were in the other tower so I had to truck it across the street. But no worries, it is fairly easy to navigate. Rooms: sensor locks, HDTV, coffee maker, decent sized bathroom, blow dryer, etc. Beds were comfy and I love the pillows. The room had pretty thin walls - we could hear the neighbor's conversation and TV show through the bathroom walls, and people walking down the hall could be heard very well. Just bring earplugs which, to me, is mandatory to get sleep in any hotel anyway. If you stay up high enough you will have really good views of the city. Oh and they have the blackout curtains like the ones you get in Vegas hotel rooms. This is the BEST. All places should have these. Hotel itself had a bar, a huge spacious lobby, a little market with Starbucks, ATM, gift shop, etc. Cabs were easy to get and there wasn't really a line. You can walk to the Pier and to the Magnificent Mile. Nothing wrong with that. If you are looking for a great hotel location with reasonable rooms and amenities, you can do a lot worse than the Hyatt.
