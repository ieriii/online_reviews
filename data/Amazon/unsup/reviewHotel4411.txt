I'm sorry... I don't see the big deal. If my bed were in the lobby I would give this place 6 stars, but it was not so... Valet:           GREAT Front Desk:     GREAT Cool Furniture:  Check Boutiques:      Check Room:         Small and decorated by my grandma Tub:           The best place on Earth!! I took 3 baths in 24 hrs Bed:           Like Sleeping on AIR! I was going to give this place 3 stars but the tub is Olympic size and carries two of the four stars. Third star goes to the staff and the fourth star actually goes to....... Millers Pub!
