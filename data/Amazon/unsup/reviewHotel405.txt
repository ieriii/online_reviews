I love Hilton properties. I just do. The best thing about this hotel is the pool. The first 2 nights I was there, it was closed for maintenance, which was a disappointment, but when they reopened it, it was IMMACULATE. Gorgeous, gorgeous pool. It's not big enough to do laps or anything like that, but the whole set-up is very clean, very open feeling, well lit, and relaxing feeling. One does not often find hotel pools this nice. I intend to stay here again when I go back to Chicago for the pool experience.  Also, the room service is great. the food comes from the Weber Grill restaurant downstairs and is very good.  My one issue is that I think there was a ghost of some sort who lived behind my walls and ceiling who made clicking noises at all hours. If the ghost would have just shut up and let me sleep, the trip would have been more enjoyable. Oh, and also, the Grand train station is right there, which is super convenient.
