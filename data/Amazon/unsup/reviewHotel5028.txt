Did my wife's Birthday party here in the Altitude Room and had a great time! The staff was fantastic and my entire experience was great. My wife turned 30 so we had friends and family come in and I worked with Rolanda to be able to get them to stay there which worked out well for the suprise for my wife. The room was beautiful and we ended up staying in a room ourselves which was really really nice (great views!). Could not have asked for a better experience. thanks everyone over there for making my wife's special day so great.
