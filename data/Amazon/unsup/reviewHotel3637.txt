Same review as the Palmer House, and must be indicative of all the hilton hotels. Grand beautiful lobby, nice ballrooms. But then you get upstairs, and its like the money ran out. Old dingy carpets, old wallpaper, old tvs, ugly bedspreads and artwork, just all around outdated. Had a window, but it opened up to a wall of another wing of the hotel. Bed was comfortable, room was large, and good water pressure in the shower.  Was here for a conference and heard everyone else had nice rooms, so maybe it was just me.
