I attended a wedding here in the Grand Ballroom which was absolutely magnificent...I told my friends that I'm having my wedding reception here! Everything is so elegant and pristine. We had drinks and unbelievable appetizers (in another gorgeous room) before we were moved to the Grand Ballroom. I can't wait to visit again. Hopefully, I'll be staying in one of the hotel rooms...Presidential Suite...?  =)
