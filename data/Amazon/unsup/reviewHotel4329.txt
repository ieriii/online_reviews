I stayed here recently. It is an iconic property, but I would recommend the lobby and restaurants over an actual stay here. The rooms just seem extremely antiquated and dated, and they are not as comfortable or visually pleasing as one would hope. It's probably just a matter of personal taste, though! The lobby area is one of the most grand and gorgeous in all of Chicago, and I recommend it without reservation for drinks/coffee/food/etc.
