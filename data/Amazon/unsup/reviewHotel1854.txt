Hmm, I wonder if the management has changed, because most of the negative reviews are fairly recent. I had my 30th b-day party here last year and the staff was wonderful to work with. The party went off without a hitch and it was a really memorable experience. I've also stayed here a number of times and it was great every time....granted, that was a few years ago, so maybe things have changed! They have the cutest plum pillows on all the beds. They're not plum colored, they actually look like stuffed plums! I fell in love with them and my husband decided to give me one for Valentine's day. Only, they weren't for sale in the W store. So, he got in touch with a concierge who bent over backwards to locate one. After a month of phone calls to various places, he found my plum!
