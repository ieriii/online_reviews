Our room was absolutely beautiful and what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Ok location, but if you plan on using the CTA to get around, it is a bit of walk to the transit station. The highlight for me was the bed/bedding...it was the most luxurious night's sleep I've ever had in a hotel room. BEWARE: Lots of hidden fees. Everything costs extra here (use of fitness center and pool, etc). P.S. The view was also pretty spectacular (and, yes that cost extra)
