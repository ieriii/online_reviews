Gorgeous foyer. Clean rooms. SMALL rooms. I prefer River North, except for the proximity to Grant Park and the ArtIC And there's a FANTASTIC Chop House in the same street (Something Chop House and Wine Bar.... hmmm... When I remember it I'll post it back), but seriously, it's in the same street (perpendicular to the lake, not parallel) and it's got THE BEST stuffed mozzarella appetizers. I still drool at them. And evidently they have really good steak. But again, this comment is lost on me...
