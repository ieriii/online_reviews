Full disclosure: I haven't actually slept in this hotel. I have, however, visited friends staying here, and let me tell you, this place is pretty dang swank. It trends toward new-money opulence--modern but luxe (I'm thinking of this in comparison to, say, the SF Fairmont, which feels like walking into Buckingham bloody Palace). My pals managed to get a suite with two double beds they seemed to love, plus deluxe bathroom, and separate parlor, which is awesome and, apparently, standard. Genius. Combined with great location--right on the Mag Mile!--it would make for a super shopping weekend or even a nice base of operations for any of the many summer festivals and events. Also, you needn't fear shoddy cleanup service. Housekeeping is very diligent. When my friends decided they'd rather stay in and skip the housekeeping, the response was: "What? You don't want housekeeping?! Okaaay..." It's a lot funnier spoken aloud, promise.
