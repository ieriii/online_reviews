Nice location, decent room for the price. We were in town to see a show at House of Blues, down Dearborn a couple blocks. We were able to walk everywhere we planned to go with at most a 15 minute walk. We did some shopping at Water Tower Mall, hit a few of the bars on Hubbard, wandered to Pizzaria Uno for late dinner Friday. We were going to take a cab up to Rush St bars on Saturday, but were wiped out from the House of Blues show we went to,.  The free breakfast was decent. We had a mini suite, 2 beds in one room, a living/dining room with sofa and armchair, tvs in living room and bedroom. The full sized fridge was handy for leftovers and to keep the booze we brought with us cold. Had we known we'd have a stove-top, we might have brought other stuff along.  Valet suggested we could self-park across the street for $25/night instead of their $42/night, and had in/out privileges.
