"Pretty average and ordinary for my taste. I've been here twice - first time, we were in the main lounge with a table service. Decor is OK, and there is enough space to move around - but music is quite poor. Too many pretentious, gel hair guys. Second time I went there, we had the private room with our own DJ for a b-day party, and it was better. The private room is cozier, especially if you can get a group of ~30 people or so. Be careful with the table service, they might rip you off (paid $250 for one bottle of Absolut!). Overall, I don't enjoy this place much mainly because of 1)the crowd, 2)poor music."
