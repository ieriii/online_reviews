I'm going out on a limb to give it three, as the hotel has potential. It needs some reinvestment and better help.I don't know if the housekeeping and food service has to do with the strike, but I suspect not. I stayed there in 1984 when it was the Americana Congress, and it was a little tired and dingy back then. I don't expect a posh resort, especially at the price point of Congress. If it were up to its full potential, I would have to pay two or three times the rate, as you might expect to pay for a room in the Gold Coast or on the river. But at the minimum, it is in need of new carpeting and better housekeeping. I didn't feel comfortable walking anywhere in the room bare-foot. The complimentary breakfast was mediocre, and the food servers were friendly but not terribly professional or efficient.  On a positive note, the location is great for tourists. Bus lines, taxis and trains are all within easy walking distance, and it's right in the middle of the great museums and parks. I would say it's a good location for the beginner who would like to see the more popular attractions, just bring flip-flops and spend the extra money and have your breakfast in a cafe nearby.I would not rule out the possibility of staying there again, but if I can find a comparable rate for a place in a geographically desireable location, I'll look at it.
