Great location. However their staff needs training. I took a red eye from Los Angeles to Chicago and landed at 5:30 am. I got to the hotel at 6:30 a.m.  When I checked in I was told by the front desk clerk that my room would not be ready until 3 p.m. I showed her my confirmation for a 6:30a.m. Check in. She repeated herself and tolde there was nothing she could do. I then asked for the General Manager and he told me he could not do anything but would give me the first room that was cleaned. At 9:02 am I was called on my cell phone and given an upgraded room.  The room was great and the service after the first incident was fine. The good here is just mediocre. OK for a Hyatt but might look to stay somewhere else next time.  DLR
