GREAT JOB Sutton Hotel on my friend's wedding. You have a great location going for you but the service was really above and beyond. I know the Bride was happy with all the attention to detail, but as the Maid of Honor, you were able to respond to all my silly requests quickly and efficiently as well. Beautiful setting, would like to stay there again the next time I'm in town.
