Have stayed at the Hilton quite a few times (for trade shows and otherwise) and the staff has been average, the building beautiful and location just fine if you don't mind walking or cabbing. It is a Chicago institution, that's for sure. It's not going to be a chic hotel; it's in an old building with smaller rooms. (It's bigger than the Allerton!) I do have to say the food at the restaurants is overpriced for what you get and the internet charge is outrageously high. Most hotels aren't even charging anymore and Chgo H and T needs to get with the times. Otherwise, we'll stay here again and always request a lake view room.
