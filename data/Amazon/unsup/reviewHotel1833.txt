I love these hotels, comfy soft bouncy beds... lol. Very Clean Very Spacious Rooms, Huge Bathrooms... Great service. Every each one is very elegant and they go from old fashioned to modern interiors. Price is always reasonable and it's always in a nice location, always close to best entertainment & dining spots in the city. All my friends stay at "The W" when they come to Chicago. I highly recommend it.
