I booked a two night stay here while in Chicago for business. I used http://www.getaroom.com for the first time because I managed to get a cheap rate and qualified for their $25 rebate. It's a good choice if you're looking for a Magnificent Mile property. Though my room was comfortable and well appointed, I could hear noise coming in from the hallway. I also felt the lobby was pretty small. It was also a pain to find parking, but it's the price you pay for staying at such a great location on Michigan Avenue. There are a bunch of restaurants and shops near the hotel, though I didn't have a chance to visit them. All in all, I'd definitely come back.
