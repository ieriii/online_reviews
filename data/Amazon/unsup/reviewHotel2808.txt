Not as good as other embassy suites we've stayed. More expensive, parking is additional $49 per night, rooms older and a little stale smelling. Had to get the manager to over-ride billing us twice for room internet use for both my wife and I - also free to members at other embassy suites. Room lacked power outlets in usable positions.  5.30pm happy hour & snacks is restricted to 1 drink per room key. Others have never had this restriction and the staff at other hotels friendlier. We wont stay here again.  At least the Italian restaurant next door is excellent - do go there.
