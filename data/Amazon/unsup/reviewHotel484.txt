I stayed here for 3 nights and while it's not the best hotel I've stayed at downtown, it has some perks. 1) Free breakfast. And I mean a full breakfast, including cooked to order items. I didn't take advantage of that, but they had pancakes, bacon, eggs, pastries, breads, etc. It can get really busy so it might be difficult to find a table at times. 2) Big rooms. It was very nice to have a separate living room and a bedroom with a door on it. The rooms also had a mini fridge and microwave. 3) Super comfy beds. I mean seriously, they were awesome. 4) Convenient location. 5) Fast elevators. This can be a challenge at some hotels, but the wait was never long here. I definitely wouldn't pay full price for these rooms, but if you get a good rate it's a nice place to stay. If you're looking for luxurious, go someplace else.
