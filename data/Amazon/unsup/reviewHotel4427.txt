When I won this hotel on Priceline with a $70 bid, I was pretty pleased with myself. The pictures of the lobby looked spectacular! I wasn't disappointed when I entered the hotel last night - it was super swank-or-rama. It lies in stark contrast to the rooms, however, which are outdated and unattractive. My room also smelled of smoke, though it was a non-smoking. I asked where the gym was, and the concierge said it was on the 5th floor, but that it was closed, and if I wanted to use it it'd be $18 anyway. Really? $18 to use the gym? Sigh.  I decided to go for a run outside (it was only two blocks to Millenium Park) and was chilled when I came back (it was 10 PM in mid-October). Fortunately, the shower was great - nice and hot with great pressure, in a clean (albeit tiny) bathroom. Things were OK for a while - I watched crappy movies on Showtime (Bound with Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon) since there was no HBO, and eventually crawled into my huge, soft, king-sized bed, sleeping peacefully until I was woken up at six by the phone ringing over and over - in my neighbor's room. It was a sad morning after that. To summarize: The Pros: Location, nice beds, good showers, pretty lobby The Cons: Ugly, outdated rooms, small bathrooms, paying $$$ for the gym/internet/parking, terrible sound proofing between rooms.  Except for the lobby, this is far from the four star hotel it purports to be.
