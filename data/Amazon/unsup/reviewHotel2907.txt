I stayed here for a conference recently. Very disappointed with the small and dated room, which reminds me of motel 6. The lobby was nice and fit the name of Sheraton. Location was convenient though I didn't have the time to walk down to navy pier. Walgreen one block away was nice for stocking up snacks and bottled water. Irregardless, a motel 6 room is not worth the price I paid for sheraton. Won't be staying here again. Oh yeah, no wi-fi in rooms? I was told free WiFi is available in lobby, I wasn't able to find it. Use of the gym is $20/day. Across the river, the swishotel and hytt both have lower prices, nicer rooms, and the gym is free at the Hytt.
