BUSINESS ONLY. Other than the friendly tip hungry Italian evening bartender - this place is all business. Large desks that you can work long hours at. The front room is quite a nice office. 8am is like a herd of cattle as high heels and luggage rollers rattle down the hallways as coffee slugging kids who take their jobs too seriously rush to another meaningless seminar. There is a lack of warmth to this place and I only stay here when working long hours.
