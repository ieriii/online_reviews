I'm writing this review early- I just checked in- because I'm so wowed by this hidden gem already! I posted photos-- such a homey feeling in the rooms!! VERY spacious for a downtown property, although I keep forgetting Chicago is not like NYC and San Fran in that respect. I'm a local- but I live in the burbs. I'm downtown for a conference and the hotel where the conference is was sold out, so I looked on TripAdvisor and Yelp to see about this hotel-- and wow! I've walked by here a million times probably and never noticed! How wrong I was! They have free Wi-Fi- which works like a charm - great speed. 24 hour Fitness Center (haven't checked out yet - will update later) and Biz Center. They have a restaurant in the building that opens at 6:30am- will report back later on that as well. This feels more like a very nice apartment than a hotel-- I'm so impressed and the rate we had was VERY REASONABLE.. Will update my review upon checkout but so far- I'm very impressed!!!! Update: The bed, while roomy and with great sheets and pillows does NOT have a good mattress. Very old and stiff and creaky. Bummer. It was ok to sleep in but if they replaced the mattresses this would be perfecto! Now- I ordered breakfast this morning. I give it 2 stars. Mediocre-- not BAD mind you but nothing yummy. I only got 2 eggs scrambled with toast and coffee but Ho-Hum. For lunch I got a fruit plate- EXCELLENT EXCELLENT and with a fresh bran muffin and yogurt. They deliver FAST here in under 15 minutes which is remarkable. More later!
