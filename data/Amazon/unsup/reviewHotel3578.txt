I haven't stayed here -- yet. But, I've been fortunate enough to have been the guest at some cool soirees at this fancy pants hotel and I'm quite impressed with the way they run shop. To begin with, no matter which side of the hotel in which you enter, you know you're in for a treat. Ample staff, click-clacky floors, lots of gilded stuff and mirrors that allow me to ogle myself and say, "D@mn, I'm looking good tonight!"... these are all pluses. From the check-in staff to doormen to waitstaff, I've never had anyone be less than helpful. I don't know if folks are, genuinely happy to work here or fantastic actors but, as a guest, I appreciate the charm and hospitality. It goes noticed. The ballrooms are exactly what you'd imagine a ballroom in an old, majestic hotel to be: opulent, historic, mysterious, and achingly romantic. I think my favorite thing about the ballrooms are the views. The windows are floor-to-ceiling and they look out at some of the most incredible views of Lake Michigan that you'll ever see. A nighttime view -- in the winter -- at the crashing waves, foamy crests and pitch waters can put a spell on you if you let it. Let it. After your betwitching is over, look up. Gaze high at the ceiling and then let you view go long. The rooms are so much higher and deeper than what they initially appear to be. Yet, despite the depth, acoustics are never a problem. I don't know whether this is a modern sound-engineering miracle or structural engineering foresight from long ago but whatever the reason, again, it's appreciated and noticed. Getting a chance to dress up in fancy clothes and attend fancy black-tie affairs is fun (for me). Getting the chance to do so in a historical, mouth-dropping venue like The Drake is an incredibly opportunity you should take, if offered. While things, in general, seem to go towards new! younger! hipper!... there's a reason why classics are classics... and why classics are classy. Be classy.
