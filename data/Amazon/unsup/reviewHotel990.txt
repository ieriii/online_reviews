Bring your Ipod because they have an Ihome/alarm clock/Ipod player to blast your music while you browse through the free internet -- Yes, none of that $14.95 b.s. internet charge/day. Complimentary breakfast AND cocktails-hors d'oeuvre? You can check out DVD's downstairs and watch them in your room. (and no, not THAT type of DVDs). They offered door-to-door chocolates service after happy hour. We got lucky, our room is right in front of the work out room. Overall, I've been here for 3 hours already and I'm loving it here. Its a smaller hotel than the Marriott (where we stayed last time in Chicago)- which I find it to be an advantage on customer service and attentiveness. I think the staff -job title being "Experience Designer, Information Specialist, Convenience Architect, Maestro " to be a little pretentious but I can't complain because they made reservations for us to TRU so we can blow $250/person. The view is pretty lame but the plasma television compensates the view of someone's living room. Location is good; Michigan Avenue is overrated so I do not mind staying a few blocks away from Miracle Mile. A block or two away from The House of Blues. I don't know what people are talking about when they mentioned Amalfi is in 'desperate need of an upgrade' because, its clean, sleek and chic hotel. Designer wallpaper throughout the room, granite counter top in the bathroom, dual high pressure shower head and ladies-- a little vanity chair for you to apply your make-up. CDs and books in the room for your pleasure. Robes and slippers for you to lounge around in (or not...its not like anyone can see through your window) $300/night during our May 28- June 3rd stay. (for a conference) $5-$7 Voss water. Highly recommended.
