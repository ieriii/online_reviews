Old World charm + great customer service = Hotel Burnham It's in the heart of the city (the Loop, none the less!) and close to the CTA's Blue and Red Line trains (both are less than a block away) which offers easy access to the rest of the city. Before you run off to book, check it: become a Klimpton InTouch member. This will definitely add slight, but appreciated, personal touches to your stay. Plus, you get a free 10$ gift card to raid their mini bar for doing this. I used it to nab a few snacks for my flight home. I notified them that I was checking in early and when I got there (around 4pm), I was able to get my picking of available rooms which included staying on their top floor: BINGO. The upper levels are maintained historically accurate to when the hotel opened in the late 1800's. Check out the old marble staircase; you can even see foot grooves on the steps! My room's window was huge! It felt like I was looking out in HD; everything was so crisp and clear. The room's size wasn't very big (reminded me of European hotels), yet we never felt claustrophobic probably due to the big windows and high ceiling. Also, we didn't stay in a hotel in the heart of Chicago to stay in and sleep the night away! The cleaning and reception staff were all very attentive and proper whenever I interacted with them. The hotel offers a bunch of stuff for free beyond the regular, complimentary soap, shampoo and conditioner. I borrowed a hair straightener (very clean!) and clothes steamer for FREE! Maybe this is something other places do, but I've never known of it.  If you're into history, you'll like this place even more once you find out more about this hotel and who it's named after.
