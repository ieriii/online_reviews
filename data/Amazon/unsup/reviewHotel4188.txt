I got a really sweet deal through priceline for $55/night. I stayed for two nights. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to explore and enjoy the hotel amenities and such. It is very conveniently located near michigan ave, bus stops, and el stations... which is a BIG BIG plus. The only bad thing about this hotel is the INTERNET. Ugh. They charge like $13 for it and it SUCKS. It works fine for a good 10 minutes and then lags. I mean really LAGGING...to the point of turning off my airport on and off a few times. I'm gonna complain about this tomorrow when I check out because it's not even free like most hotels. Other than that, I would definitely come back to this hotel....if I can get deal like I did this time.
