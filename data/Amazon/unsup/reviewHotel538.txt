You've probably stayed in hotels of this type: clean but absolutely no frills. Bathroom not glamorous (dayem I love those high-end hotel bathrooms) and my suite was slightly run-down (but clean) but here's the thing: the people who work here rock.  Helpful and accommodating...down to every last interaction. Impeccable. Forget about redecorating, Hampton Inn. Take that money and give your awesome staff a big fat raise. They totally deserve it.
