I went on a Thursday afternoon at 1:00pm. The server was nice enough to take my picture and was friendly. The Palm court was lovely and well The Drake is just one of those classic hotels. However I've done tea at some four/five star hotels and The Drake failed in meeting up to a high standard that one would expect from an establishment like The Drake. The bread was very dry on all of the sandwiches, the scones were cold, and the cream was lukewarm.
