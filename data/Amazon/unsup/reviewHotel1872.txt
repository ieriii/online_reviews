Wow. Um. I guess a lot of you hate this hotel. Maybe if I paid $300 a night I'd be pissed, but every time I stay here I book my room through Hotwire, and I get some sick deals. The last time I stayed here I got a room for $118. I've always found my rooms to be clean and nice. The service has always been very good, and it's really conveniently located. I know the rooms are a bit small, I can't deny that, but I don't spend much time in the room, so I don't care. I've never had anything but positive things to say about the W in the Loop. I highly recommend it to anyone coming to Chicago for any reason.
