During the second part of our stay in Chicago we elected to stay at the Westin instead of going back to Hotel Felix - it wasn't a good decision. Service upon checking in was not welcoming nor helpful. Two bell hops had more interest in cracking jokes among themselves than assisting us with the check in process. Once we did check in and went to our room, it was nice but in need of a renovation. The lighting in the room makes everything look jaundiced. In our particular case, there was an annoying, loud fan blowing which could only be turned off by calling maintenance, which I did 3 times, with a fourth stop at the front desk before the matter was resolved. Internet service was not free and the connection was not good, lessening the feeling that this particular Westin had any interest in offering value or service to us as patrons.
