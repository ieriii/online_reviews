Stayed here for a wedding and enjoyed a regular room with two doubles that was spacious enough that it felt like a suite. Loved the views, loved the location (right off Millennium Park, walkable to the riverfront, shopping, and shops). Great service (the front desk found us a pizza place that would deliver at 2am and they also helped us with an emergency wedding toast print out situation). However, a few quibbles: 1) room service that ends at 10:30pm (not good for those of us arriving late at night from the west coast - hence the needed pizza delivery above), 2) no vending machines anywhere in the hotel, meaning a bottle of water or a Sprite was nearly impossible to get late at night; 3) business center that closes before 6pm (hence the emergency printout situation above); 4) gym access by payment only - not complimentary for hotel guests; and 5) no in-room coffee maker. While I appreciate the extra service they provide to make up for some of these amenities, I have travelled quite a lot for both business and pleasure, and I have come to expect the above amenities to be standard. With this set of services, I imagine that they are targeting leisure travelers only, as this would not be acceptable for business travelers who stay on any frequent basis.
