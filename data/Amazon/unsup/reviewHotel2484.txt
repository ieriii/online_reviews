The reviews saying it's more a conference destination, good God you guys were right. This place was like a zoo and full of libararians and pampered chef people. I crashed in my friend's room for a night cuz I was too lazy to walk home, and... yeah, I think I like The Drake way better if I'm going to do a staycation in the future. The room I slept in was on the 11th floor and facing the direction of the train tracks which bothered my friend, but I liked it since I looove noise while I'm trying to sleep. But really.. you can hardly hear the train go by. I think this place would be perfect for tourists looking to be close to Grant Park.
