Clean spacious rooms. I managed to snag one of the corner suites on the 5th floor which was gigantic. Got a nice kitchen, dining area, lounge and gigantic bedroom. There gym is pretty nice. Got a lot of cardio equipment, free weights. Would have liked a bit more weight machines but it did the job. Swimming pool is nice. What I really like is that it's connected to Ruth Chris which is awesome. Walking distance to pretty much all the bars and clubs in River North. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Price was extremely reasonable considering that the other hotels in the area were more expensive.
