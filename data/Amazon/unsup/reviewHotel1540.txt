I'm not picky about hotels/motels--I've seen my share of holes punched through walls, leaky ceilings, the creative use of duct tape on a front door to make one feel especially secure at night--so when we were planning a trip to Chicago, I was happy to look in the HoJo/Travelodge/maybe-questionable-but-cheap range. And then my sweetheart found some kind of crazy Internet deal for three of us to stay at Hotel 71 for about $80-$90, making my mind boggle when I saw on their Web site that the going range is somewhere in the $200-$250s. Yay. It's huge and modern and the lobby helps you instantly forget the grody motels of travels past--there's art here! And a fireplace! And people at the desk smiling at you, waiting to help! We didn't have any of the mentioned problems re: lackluster desk attendants or elevator slowness, and we were charmed by the size of our room (you could do several cartwheels in both the room and the bathroom!--it was a corner room. Maybe that helped?), quality of the beds, and view. And they have room service that delightfully includes bread pudding ($5!) and sundaes ($6!) that we never got around to ordering. But just knowing it was down there if we wanted it made me sleep a little more sweetly. While there were a few minor bummers (no vent in the bathroom (three people taking showers in quick succession makes things awful steamy), $43 a night valet parking (I know it's the going rate but it bums me out all the same) ), the location and view and overall niceness of the place/lack of duct tape more than made up for it.
