Review of high tea: PROS: 1) GREAT selection of tea. I went with 3 friends (4 people total) and we each tried the others' teas. Everything was fabulous. 2) Good service. 3) Nice variety of sandwiches, scones, breads, and desserts. 4) A harp player!!! It really set the ambiance and made it a relaxing experience. We also came with a 2 year old who was entranced by the music and kept going up to the harpist. She was more than friendly with my niece!! 5) Nice bathrooms! 6) They refill our teapots with hot water quite often, so we always had lots of tea! And my tealeaves still produced yummy (and flavorful tea) even after the 3rd refill of hot water. CONS: 1) The person who brought our food spoke so quickly that we couldn't understand anything he said.
