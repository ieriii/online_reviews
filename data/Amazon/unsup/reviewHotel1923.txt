This was my first stay at a W Hotel, and I will definitely stay at one again. The rooms are fun, fresh and modern, the staff is extremely customer focused and friendly, and they have great lotions/soaps/shampoos etc. I'm only giving it four stars because this particular W hotel was a bit lacking in some ways. You could tell they had built into an ancient building and hadn't updated the HVAC system the ac/heat centers in the room were ancient and kind of ugly, the bathroom had this enormous counter and only one tiny sink I would have preferred two or even a larger one, they didn't offer as many amenities here as they do at the LakeSide W which is kind of dissapointing, and lastly I asked for all the down products to be removed from the room since my boyfriend is allergic and the second night there we found out (after lots of watery eyes and sneezing) that the foot pillow they had left in the room was down if you are supposed to be a top calls hotel you have to pay attention tot he details.  however, I will leave you with the positives I saw: Cookies and Fresh OJ in the afternoons in the lobby Lovely bedding/towels, etc I loved the bathroom (besides the sink) They have free water in the gym that you can just go grab at anytime I will definitely stay at a W again if I have the chance/good deal to do so- but if I was going back to Chicago I may look into other hotels, as the downtown area isn't really happening at night and it might be fun to be in a hotel near some night life.
