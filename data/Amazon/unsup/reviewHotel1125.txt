My family was amazed with the rooms. Clean, great views, super-nice people. Valet - super. Bed - amazing (my Uncle said I knows for sure they're going shopping for a new one). Bathroom - great. For two guests using canes and/or wheelchairs it was as easy as pie to navigate. They felt like rock stars. And the breakfast buffet was a nice surprise (we had one diebatic guest was in great shape before our day of fun). We've put other guests at the Swisshotel, I think the bathroom wasn't as easy to navigate, the bathtub was really high. Wi-fi wasn't important for us.
