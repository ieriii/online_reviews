My review is specifically about the 17th floor rooms. I think all the other floors have been remodeled and the rooms are probably decent. But if you're lucky enough to get a 17th floor room like I did, you will be sorely disappointed. These are probably the ugliest, most outdated rooms (and bathrooms) in Chicago that still cost $170 a night. What a complete ripoff - not what you expect when you see the modern lobby. The front desk experience was unfriendly, and the hotel internet is horrid. Don't even think about VPN - you'd be lucky to have 2 webpages load up simultaneously on your browser. Not even the incredible river view is enough to save this whole experience. Hilton Honors - please take me back.
