We reserved a room with a king bed 5 months before our trip. When we arrived, they said they didn't have any kings available. We took a room with two "double beds" though they were the smallest double beds I've ever seen. The next day, they said they would switch us to a room with a king and they said they were sending up a bellhop to move our things. We waited. And waited. After 3 calls and a trip to the front desk, a bellhop finally arrived--it took an hour. We're here for three days; we don't want to waste our valuable time because of bad service. I would not recommend this place.
