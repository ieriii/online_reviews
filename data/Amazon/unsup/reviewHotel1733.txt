Booked this hotel at a GREAT rate through hotwire.  The hotel seemed to be in a good location. About 20 minutes from Midway. The welcome was wonderful! My first visit to Chicago and the front desk people were very helpful with how I could get around the city and some great places to see while I was there. Over the next four days they showed that they remembered me specifically. The room was perfect. Not too big, not too small. Well equipped and very comfortable! The only downside is that they seem to rent out what should be common areas to groups. I had arranged to meet a friend that I hadn't seen since we were children in the lobby on evening. When I arrived back at the hotel to find her... she was lost in a sea of conventioneers. We did find each other of course... we were the two people looking confused. I would recommend it to anyone. :)
