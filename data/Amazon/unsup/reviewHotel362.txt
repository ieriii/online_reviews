I stayed here during my last two visits to Chicago because it's consistently the best value for the location. The rooms were clean and spacious but clearly aging. The front desk staff is friendly and speedy and the hotel is an easy walk to the Loop, Grant Park, and the subway. If the price is right, I would stay here again for my next visit.
