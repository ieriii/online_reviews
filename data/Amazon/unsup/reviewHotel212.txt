I don't usually result to Yelp but after attempting to contact the manager of Indigo and not receiving a return phone call, I am actually taking the time to write this in an effort to save others from this uncomfortable and somewhat bizarre experience.  I happen to be a physician as are my siblings who were also staying at indigo. I'm only mentioning this because I feel like the cost of wouldn't be such an issue for me if it didn't seem like highway robbery. One of the nights cost 200$.  The reason it feels like I was taken for a fool was because the staff was so rude. It almost seemed like a joke. I kept looking over my shoulder to see if there was a camera crew. When I would go to the front desk to ask a question, the woman working made it seem like I was bothering her. At first I thought maybe she was having a bad day until the same cold shoulder attended to me when I had the misfortune of requiring front desk services. When I tried to relay an issue I was having with parking, she requested that i sign a valet parking receipt that didn't have my name on it . The next day, I brought to her attention the fact that she had charged me for 2 more days than I had utilized. She still seemed bothered and definitely did not apologize.  Did I mention it was over 100 degrees and only one elevator worked. not for one day. or two. It didn't work for 3 days. I understand things happen, It seems that in the business world there is some sort of compensation. or at least an apology. Speaking of apology. The valet driver allowed me and my sisters to get into a car that was not ours. Sure it was the same make and model, but when we finally realized that the car wasn't ours, we quickly exited the car, informed the attendant who responded, 'I know."  Aside from that
