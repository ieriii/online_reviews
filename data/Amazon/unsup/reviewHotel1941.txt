Stayed here between Christmas and New Year's. Starwood Gold membership gave me a free upgrade, and the much larger room on an upper floor was great - absolutely no complaints. Unfortunately, I had a REALLY ANNOYING experience with the keycards they give you for access to your room. At first, it worked only after about 10-15 attempts. Finally, shortly before checking out, it stopped altogether, and of course, I was experiencing nature's call at the time. Called down to the front desk and waited nearly 20 MINUTES for someone to come up let me into my room. They're REALLY LUCKY I had not wet my pants. But the Bliss Spa welcome kit was really great (enormous bar of soap that is still enormous after using every day for a month) and the staff very friendly and helpful. Also, they allowed me early (11 am) check-in and late (4:00 pm) checkout, which was really cool and not always possible at other hotels. Would definitely stay here again.
