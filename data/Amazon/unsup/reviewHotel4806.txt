Just spent 3 days during at theWit while on business. I could walk or take an instant cab ride to every appointment and meal. Super convenient. The staff was great and I felt like I got to know them personally -- even O.C. the awesome doorman. I liked the rooms even more than a W -- stylish, great beds, nice HD ... but more functional than a W. StateLake (server Sarah was great), the community table at Ciba Mato was way fun ... and David, Eric and Mike at the ROOF top bar were just fabulous -- I can't wait to go back in the summer. theWit is now my only place to stay and party in the Windy City.
