This was a last minute weekend to downtown Chicago, I prefer boutique hotels over large big box hotels. I found a great rate on Expedia $180 per night and their website looked like a place I would like so I booked it. I was pleased when I arrived, my room was ready, staff was friendly and the entire hotel was clean. I loved the beachy decor, made me think I was out in California by the ocean. About my only complaint was the laminate flooring in the rooms, it was a little warped and looked cheap, otherwise the furnishings, bedding and other amenities were nice and upscale. I will keep this hotel on my short list for future trips downtown.
