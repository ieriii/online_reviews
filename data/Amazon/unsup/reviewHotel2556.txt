I'm a bit of a sucker for the area with all the history and the grittiness of the hood. The positives: The decor is nice and I did like the meat freezer bathroom doors...a nice touch. From the outside you'd never expect anything like the place you find inside. The negatives: $10 cover for guys only. Okay...if the place has some people inside. I visited this joint on a Friday night and was a bit disappointed. The place was probably about 15% full and the crowd was a bit older/tamer. Maybe I caught the place on a bad night, but I'm going to have to take pass on this place in the future.
