For starters, this is a beautiful hotel on truly prime location (just across the wrigley building). The exterior is flawless and there is even a starbucks inside (major plus in my book). Now, the service is OK at best. I was in a hurry to go to a meeting one morning and got lost. The flow of the meeting space is horribly designed. I then asked for help from employees who could not help me. To top it off apparently some elevators go to a certain floor and I got mixed up there too. The rooms were too small for my liking and I heard they finished renovating... hmmm I think they need to start over. My lasting moment was meeting their GM, Edward Andrews. Best words to describe him is rude and sloppy. How in the world he got his position is beyond me. Sum things up, historical hotel with character but it definitely needs some fine retuning from the top down. Not very impressed and won't be staying here again. Restaurants were yummy so if you want a quick bite or some starbucks go here otherwise don't even bother wasting your time there.
