This is a grand old hotel. Grand in the sense that the lobby and common areas are sort of spectacular. But it's like that person at the bar before last call....at 2:00 am after a few beers, he or she may look very good. But peel away the beer goggles and the 10 you went home with suddenly becomes a 6, 6.5 tops. Of course, I'm happy with a 4 so I'm not really complaining. Having said that, this isn't a bad place. The staff is nice, beds are super comfy, the place is very clean (though some of the areas are a bit worn) and the location is awesome. This place is giant...with so many wings you may get lost going to your room.  You are very close to Millennium Park, the waterfront, theaters, even the Miracle Mile is a short walk away. The lobby is truly breath-taking. But it's not all lollipops and unicorns....the breakfast offered on the Executive Level is incredibly weak. Oatmeal is the only hot food offered and the set up is almost aggressively inefficient. Speaking of inefficient, you'll spend more time waiting for the elevators than sleeping in your bed.   I've stayed here twice and my first room was very tiny, but my second room was nice and spacious. If you get a good deal, it's definitely worth staying here.  I also think it's funny that the Palmer House is located a few blocks from Wacker Drive, but that's just because I'm incredibly immature.
