I stayed here for two nights in Feb 2010. Hotel is in a good condition. I got a room on 6th floor which faced toward State St. Room was clean and spacious. I loved having two TVs with mini fridge and microwave. Having free continental breakfast is a plus.  Location is awesome. 2-3 blocks from N.Michigan ave, half a block to Redline train, across the street is Jewel Osco where you can get your groceries, snacks and CTA card! And Trader Joe's is nearby. I loved it! Definitely recommend anyone to stay here.
