Maybe there's a reason I haven't rated this place even though I've stayed here before: it sucks! This is supposed to be the better of the Westins here and I'm going to be staying at the one on Michigan Ave a lot more. First, the bathtub is clogged and the AC isn't working properly. I asked them to check it out while I was out, came back and they either didn't come up or whatever they did didn't work. Second, the food is taking forever:forever on hold, forever to order, forever to get here, forever! Third, the wifi isn't working and apparently it's only MY room. A room, btw, that I was told was an upgrade because of my "status" and really there's nothing different about it from regular rooms. Oh and the best part? There is no freaking comment card in the room so I can bitch about it in writing! WTF!
