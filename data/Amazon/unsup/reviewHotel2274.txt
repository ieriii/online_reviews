I stayed here when I was on business. The lobby is huge (large bar area in the middle of the lobby). They even have a Starbucks inside the lobby...not a fake coffee only SB's either...a legit SB's with all the fixins. Location: Very convenient to shopping, restaurants, tourist attractions and a leisurely stroll to the "loop" or "miracle mile". Rooms: Their rooms are very cookie cutter when it comes to big cities. But they are definitely bigger than ones in NYC. The bathroom is very tight quarters...door hit the toilet, yeah, that small. Shower is good size. The rooms are clean and beds comfy. Overall: It's a good place to stay whether on business or pleasure. The bar in the lobby area does charge "hotel" alcohol prices but it's spacious and lots of TV's to watch sports...
