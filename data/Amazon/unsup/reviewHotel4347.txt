Talk about strong energy, check out The Empire Room, their historic show room circa 1910, Liberace,, Durante, Sanatra and Sofe Tucker have graced that stage. Located just off the lobby and up the Grand Staircase. If the walls could talk, I'm sure you could sit and listen for years. Very Nice Historic Hotel, Very Small Rooms, tiny bathrooms, but, the service was wonderful. The Vibe, It's there ! This hotel was featured in the 2007 Movie "The Fugitive"
