The 5-6pm free wine happy hour is getting to be the standard at hotels the world wide. Hotel Allegro has a gorgeous multi-room lobby space where they offer their version of happy hour and it's definitely what stood out most about my stay. There's a Wii, which is a great conversation starter and a fun idea in general. After checking in and seeing the lobby I was a bit disappointed by the room. The decor was nice, but the room was quite small and unfortunately the view, even from the 18th floor, was an eyesore. But I've come to learn that's pretty much par for the course in Chicago. Otherwise, the snack bar offered some healthy, organic treats and the toiletries weren't tested on animals which is important to me. The gym is impressive for a hotel and I was able to get a decent workout. I didn't eat in the attached restaurants in part because the breakfast was outrageously expensive. A coupon for dinner is provided for the attached restaurant, but I didn't have an opportunity to eat there. The menu looked decent. I would stay here again and recommend it for sure. I found a great deal on http://hotels.com, it's in a great location near an L stop and the shopping district on State Street, and I looked forward to coming back to Allegro after work each day. The only qualm I have is the surcharge to use the internet. In this day in age, most travelers bring their laptops everywhere they go and it's a common courtesy for any hotel to provide free internet access.
