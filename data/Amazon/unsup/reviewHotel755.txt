I really do like the Westin more than other business class hotels. The heavenly beds are fantastic, but they really need to figure out the heavenly shower thing. It's not that heavenly or different from other hotels. This hotel in particular was great! It has a prime location on Michegan Avenue, next to the John Hancock building. The only thing that I might complain about was the noise from the elevators (try to get a room away from them), but I won't dwell on that, because the staff was fantastic. They were very helpful and supportive during a very bizarre incident that involved my husband losing his mobile phone on the street and the attempted extortion from the crackheads that found it. The staff performed outstandingly, and, for that reason, I would stay here again.
