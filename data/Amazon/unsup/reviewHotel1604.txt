decent boutique hotel in chicago. staff was friendly & helpful in helping two inebriated souls acquire lost key cards at 2am. fantastic bleu cheese burger. i am not kidding. i was, however, hungover. perhaps that's a biased account. great shower in the room. great view. great location. i'd reccomend it to out-of-towners who want to stay mostly in the heart of the city, but not to folks who want to do some off the beaten path exploring.
