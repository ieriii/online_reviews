expensive. pretty. fun. the bed is amazing. the rooms are nice. but the shower and toilet sucked big time. the front desk is slow at picking up and not very polite. they need to do something about this. anyways, i love it that the 11th floor has a bowl full of apples everyday in the hallway for people to enjoy.
