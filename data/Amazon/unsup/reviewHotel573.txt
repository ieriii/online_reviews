Worlds collide. Old dog, new tricks. In a nutshell, well done Ian Schrager, well done sir! I have always been a fan of the Ian Schrager Hotel group and I was thrilled to hear that they were opening in a grand old dame of properties, the former Ambassador East.  I wasn't quite sure how a finger on the pulse, New York second kind of guy would treat the aging beauty but I was dumbfounded by the gentle transititon that holds true the elegance of the days of grandiose with slick and contemporary style. Gratefful a dear friend was touring with an old school rocker that was housed in this gem and got to take a mini staycation while hanging out with rockstars.  So yes, the Pump Room was not my Grandma's cocktail salon and Kup and Harry Caray were just hovering from the heavens above but it was a definitely a hot crowd full of "all the young dudes" and lots of smoking hot beauties holding court.  Staff was fantastic as is expected from the Rockit Ranch crew and service was fast and furious. Rooms were spacious for a Schrager property says the girl who has spend extended stays at Paramount, Royalton and Morgans in my day.  Like double the size. Ikea like in nature but sleek and comfy none the less. Exquisite linens and lux robes and towels were my saving grace.  I will note I mistook a mirror for a door at one point and may or may not have lifted it off the wall but we'll leave that for later.  Staycation was amazing....... Public rooms are exquisite with soft yet sleek design elements, engaging staff and absolutely gorgeous finishes.  Clean, chic, sophisticated cool. Worlds collide. In a nutshell: old dog did new tricks quite well.
