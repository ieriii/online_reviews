This is the only hotel I will stay at in Chicago. For one it has basics that some hotels might make you pay for - gym and internet. Second, there are perks - breakfast on the floor every day, and happy hour drinks. Finally, the foyer and rooms are beautiful and the location is fantastic. I think the price is reasonable too.
