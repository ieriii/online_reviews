Stayed here for an insurance seminar in late April (lucky me!) Hotel is in a great downtown location with lots of good shopping and dining options. Front desk was courteous and efficient. My room was very comfortable and had a nice view of the river and downtown buildings (I kept the old Bob Newhart Show theme song running through my head). Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size. The room was clean throughout. The concierge desk was a real bright spot. Friendly, helpful, and easy on the eyes. I had a great stay and will come back the next time I'm in Chicago.
