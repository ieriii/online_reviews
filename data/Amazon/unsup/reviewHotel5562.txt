My husband and I just enjoyed a great stay here over the weekend. We got a good rate over the weekend from Hotwire. The room is big enough, though by no means spacious. We had a view of Lincoln Park. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the toiletries were awesome. The flat screen tv seemed to have some issues with some channels, but we weren't there to watch tv. Front desk is definitely chaotic. We tried to check in about 45 minutes before check in and were told our room was not ready. However, people after me were able to check into their rooms. I get that we paid less, but it still seems insulting that you will give other people a room before me. Also, I called for a recommendation on where to get a massage and I am pretty sure the guy was googling it on the internet. It took about ten minutes. I can look stuff up on the internet, I was wondering if your hotel had a spa they had a discount set up with (or better yet, a masseuse who would come to my room!) You can't beat the location and the room is just as nice as any other hotels in the area. We would definitely return.
