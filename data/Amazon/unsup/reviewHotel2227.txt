One of the best hotels in Chicago, the Intercontinental boasts old world charm with contemporary elegance. The four-story lobby, which features a grand staircase and bronze embellishments, makes you feel as if you were a movie star. After a long day of shopping on the Mag Mile, you'll have to cool down and take a dip in the gigantic pool. A must see for all those traveling from abroad!
