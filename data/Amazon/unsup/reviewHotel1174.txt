I couldn't say it any better than Erin C. What I would add is the Wi-Fi is intermittent; whether it is the hotel's fault or the enironment I could'nt say. The attached restaurant serves as their bar and is nice and has good deep dish. Drinks and beer are very reasonable. We will stay here next time for both free parking and location.
