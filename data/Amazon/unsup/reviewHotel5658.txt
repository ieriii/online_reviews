The staff here (front desk clerks, bell men, concierage) are extremely nice and helpful. The male housekeeper/delivery food person who works late night (graveyard shift) is a little creepy though and not so friendly. He brought my girlfriend food after midnight when she ordered off the late night menu and didn't let her pay cash wtf? I asked her to pay cash since we were splitting everything when we checked out. Besides him everyone else was wonderful and the rooms and the hotel itself is extremely well kept. They had molton brown amenities in our room and the hotel is in a great location walking distance to Michigan ave, restaurants and stores.
