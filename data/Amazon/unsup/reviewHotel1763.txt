A boutique hotel located in the theatre district of Chicago with the usual feelings of one. The hotel is somewhat spotty when it comes to chic and then downright cutting corners, you will notice them. The TV is out of date along with the mini bar and look - feel of the room. It's a quite small room and tiny. That's all i really have to say about this one, try The St. James if you want the boutique experience, or even the Burnham Hotel
