Ah, the minute I witnessed the the entryway to the Palm Court of the Drake Hotel. The words spoken by Mr. Bryan Adams started singing in my head: I'm findin it hard to believe that we're in heaven!!! It was absolutely a magnificent Experience! Of course, the cost was staggering but this is something you should expect from a place like the Drake (which empowers them btw so that they may do no good, but that's why we have reviewers, right? :)) I had the palm court black tea...great choice. Then the little sandwiches and scones came out.. The best thing was that these sandwiches that would normally get me sick of eating for a while (roast beef being one example) were served in small finger size portions. Just delicious! Oh, and did I mention that a harpist was playing right behind me???? Whaaat?? :D One thing that they could improve on is including an ingredient in the egg sandwich that could make the taste more strong and palatable. As it is, it did not live up to its companions. But I was in heaven for a few hours...it was a Mid Summer Day's Dream.
