Positives: close to many attractions, free breakfast and managers reception, very nice staff Negatives: $41/day parking, needs a little TLC Stayed for the long weekend with family. If we had to get somewhere and feed breakfast for the nine of us, would have been time consuming and expensive. You could have cooked to order omelets or buffet style scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, biscuits and gravy. Also had a managers reception with free drinks and snacks. Was nice to unwind after being out in the city all day. Some minor issues with soap rack in shower loose, toilet seat loose etc. I know that it is expensive to park in the city but at least cut something off for staying at the hotel vs. just parking there. Easy walk to shopping, site seeing or dining.
