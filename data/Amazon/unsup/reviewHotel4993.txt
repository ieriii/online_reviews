Good - Recently remodeled rooms, nice comfy beds, nice pool/deck, friendly staff, close to everything, kid friendly, a great rate.Not so Good - Noisey neighbors at 4AM (Not the hotels fault, don't bother with the restaurant lots of better choices nearby. They could clean their rooms better, the lamp was falling apart, no drain plug in the sink or soap in the bathroom.A good stay, a great value in my opinion. We will be back.
