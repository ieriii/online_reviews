Oh, Westin. How I want to love you. Really. But you don't make it easy. You don't have connecting rooms (even though that's what we originally booked). Ok, we can deal. But your heavenly beds weren't that heavenly (dare I even say it sloped a little?) and your housekeeper forgot (refused to?) clean the fridge that housed the drinks that was messy before we arrived (and never did get cleaned). And the power outlet or two that didn't work. And the spotty wifi in the room (that still cost $10). So why even 3 stars? Because the rooms are otherwise good and spacious (nice TV, nice showers too), the location is great, the staff was quite friendly and helpful and the downstairs restaurant exceedingly friendly to small-ish kids. And the room rate was fine. So, it's not a bust. You'll enjoy a stay here. You just won't say "wow" when you leave.
