I LOVED this hotel. The room was small but if you are in Chicago then you should not be in your hotel room. This hotel was so cute and really made my first time in Chicago. It was clean, modern yet vintage, and the service was excellent. They even had complimentary hot chocolate with real marshmallows at all times. The location couldn't have been better it was a short walk to everything:) I would stay again.
