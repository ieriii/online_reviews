The Allegro is nice and I had one pleasant stay here in 2005. I truly love the Kimpton chain, but I have found myself not returning to this hotel when I am in Chicago. There are so many places to choose in the loop and near north, and the Allegro really doesn't offer anything you can't find done better and cheaper. It is a nice enough hotel, but the only reason I would return is if they have an incredible deal.
