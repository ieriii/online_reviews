Great location right on the river. They told me the hotel used to be a Hotel Nikko which made the lobby decor make a lot more sense. It's a better than average Westin, plus the location makes this a good deal. I was there for a conference and the downstairs conference rooms were terrific and the catering was better than average. The only disappointment was the restaurant which seemed disorganized and not well run. Food was not interesting. There was also a sushi bar in the lobby and while I was there I never saw more than one person eating there. You have to wonder about that... There are way better dining options within walking distance.
