Went to the Rooftop bar/lounge at the Wit Hotel in Chicago and want to say, don't go there on a nice day at happy hour....it's more crowded than a Chucky Cheese on Saturdays. Nice place, nice looking...nice looking crowd, but good luck sitting at a table and hoping your waitress/waiter is going to come by often. Obviously, service is not the forte at this place...more like try to look good and network. Our waitress was awful and I saw her come near our table 1 time in 2 hours. You might as well sneak in some booze or order liquor take out from Old Town Liquors and have them bring it to the lounge. haha
