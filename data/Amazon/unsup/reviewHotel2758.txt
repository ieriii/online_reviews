i was really annoyed that housekeeping kept knocking on my door the entire morning. i put my "do not disturb" sign the night before because i didn't want anyone to knock on my door the next morning.  but when i opened my door to leave, someone removed my do not disturb tag thing! no wonder housekeeping kept knocking on my door. smh i love the room, the decor, the huge mirror, the soap w/a hole in it, the king size bed is so comfortable, and the lighting.  i love the decor in the lobby & how everything is just so modern. i'll definitely come back to stay here. stayed here 3 times already.
