Pros: -In the heart of the loop near Millennium Park -Extremely friendly staff -Fairly cheap rates (I paid $116 a night which is much lower than the average hotel in that area -Large clean room with comfortable beds Cons: -There's a lot of noise from the hallways and other rooms that doesn't get blocked out by the door or walls -Free Internet was neither wireless nor functional. The internet literally crawled. I would have rather paid for wifi that worked decently but that wasn't an option.
