I arrive at the W late on a Sunday night. Even though the lobby is completely empty, terrible 1996 house music is throbbing full blast through the speakers. The girl at the front desk is half-asleep. Looking rather confused, she checks me in. Everything is tan, beige and eggplant like every other W, completely lost somewhere in the late 90's. Internet bubble 1.0. The lift takes me to my floor. More bad techno plays. The hallways are completely dark, in a failed attempt to set the mood. When I find my room, there is a knife and fork on the carpet in front of my room. Light shines through the crack under the door. My card key works in the lock. I enter to discover a completely wrecked room. bare mattress. sheets on floor. mini-bar items strewn about. shower running! I march back downstairs and explain the situation to the same girl, who apologizes and gives me a new room key. Another elevator ride. Still more techno. Another dark hallway. Finally a clean room. Two minutes later the phone rings. They want to offer me a free breakfast for my trouble. That would be very nice, I say. I order breakfast for the morning, request a wake up call and fall asleep. The next morning, no wake-up call, no breakfast, nothing. No thanks W. I'm never coming back.
