I cannot believe this place gets such high reviews. Maybe everyone who gives it 4 or 5 stars stayed in suite?? Or is hard of hearing? Or enjoys using a converted closet as a bathroom? I only booked this hotel bc I got a special deal, at full price it's a total rip off. I have no idea what a suite looks like, but the rooms are teensy tiny, even by urban city hotel standards. The bathroom is even smaller and the sink splashes water on you. The walls are paper thin, I was woken up at 2 am by a girly laugh fest (I decided it was the universe paying me back for the hotel guests my friends and I woke at 4am when I stayed at the Hilton in SF).  And the service isn't all that great either. I put in a request for a rollaway when I checked in and when I went to check on the status was told that they had none available. I still can't figure out why I can't request one ahead of time. It took a good 30 seconds of hard staring at the lady bf I got an apology. I had to ask multiple times for late check out and despite the fact that I got the ok to check out at 1pm, I got a knock at the door at 1230.  Yes, the lobby is beautiful but I'm not sleeping in the lobby. That hardly makes up for the shortcomings of the place. I loved Chicago and will come back, but def will not stay here again.
