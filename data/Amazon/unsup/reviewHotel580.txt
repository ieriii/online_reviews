My fianc and I have stayed in several Ian Schrager hotels in San Francisco and New York. I thought it'd be hard for any hotel to knock the Clift in SF off thentopmof the charts, but Public does! Great staff, nice big clean rooms makes for a great weekend getaway. My fianc and I had a great time here! Having the Pump Room downstairs helps too!
