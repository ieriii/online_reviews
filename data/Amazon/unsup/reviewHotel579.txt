I stayed here for a few days in October 2011, shortly after it opened. I saw a great deal on http://hotels.com, and though I didn't know anything about Public, I was familiar with its predecessor, the Ambassador East, and read a few articles about Schrager's remodeling plans, so I decided to take advantage of the great price and make a reservation. Overall, it was a very good stay. The place is quite clean (as it should be, since it's practically brand new!) and sleek. The staff was friendly, though no one went "above and beyond." The fitness room was great, and I really liked the location - walkable to the Gold Coast/Mag Mile area and an L stop, but in a very nice residential area rather than in an entirely commercial area of downtown. Some of the decor was a bit too Euro trendy for me -- I could have done without the fake animal skin throw on the chair in the room, and a real bed instead of an almost-on-the-ground no-box spring Ikea-type bed. But all in all, the room was comfortable, if small. Computer area and library/coffee bar in the lobby was a nice touch. Biggest complaint: My room was right next to the elevator, and all night, I could hear the clank, clank, clank of the elevator pulleys and the doors opening and closing. Next time, I'll ask for a room away from the elevator. Overall, a very nice stay at an unbeatable price.
