A lovely hotel, although the rooms on the higher floors seem to be more recently renovated (it would probably have only gotten three stars if I'd stayed in my friend's room down on the third floor instead of my lofty one with the fluffy comforters and down pillows on the 16th). It's really close to Michigan Avenue shopping and the feeble contemporary art museum, but a bit of a walk to the Art Institute and Millenium Park.
