Where to begin. This place felt like a hotel that thinks it's all that, but in practice stinks like a wet fart. We arrived promptly to check-in, and were told that we would have to wait for up to 2 hours before our room would be ready. This was pretty inconvenient given the fact that we had solid plans for that evening already (dinner, concert) and really screwed up our evening mojo. When we relayed our distaste over the delay to the concierge or whatever you call it, they offered no kind of consolation (free parking, etc.) other than 2 free drink tickets at their hotel bar. We didn't have time to enjoy the drink because of our rush at this point. After returning from our otherwise excellent evening, we went back up to our room. It's got this very funky design which was kinda cool, but the carpeting is this super thick red/maroon stuff that looks like it's just rife with problems that only a blacklight would reveal. The bed was pretty comfortable, minus the fact that it didn't even have a proper fitted sheet. That's right, they just placed a sheet over the mattress, probably thinking, "this won't be a problem as long as they don't move at all while they sleep". On top of that, the comforter was given the appearance of a duvet cover by sandwiching it between 2 plain sheets. Did somebody forget to do the laundry or something? Ah, this would be a good time to mention that when we arrived back to the hotel from our evening out, we wanted to use our handy-dandy free drink tickets. To our dismay, the bar was CLOSED. At 11:30. On a SATURDAY. In CHICAGO. Seriously? Anyway, long story short, my wife raised a s**tstorm the following morning about all this business and they covered our breakfast in the hotel restaurant - which was pretty good. Other than that single redeeming factor, I was pretty disappointed with the entire experience. I won't be back.
