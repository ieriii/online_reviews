quite possibly one of the best Ws... the front desk staff was very accomodating and efficient. the refurbished rooms are spectacular. i love that they have lit up the hallways better than they were years ago. everything was perfect for my stay - and it was sad when it was time to check out. this is the place to stay in chicago. you wont be disappointed...
