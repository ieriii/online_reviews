Location is excellent. Right near the Magnificent Mile and Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due. There's even a Starbucks and a Trader Joe's across the street. Rooms are small. Beds are small, more like a Full rather than a Queen. Bathrooms are small and smelled kinda weird. Walls are thin. Breakfast was pretty awful. No waffle bar. Price is kinda expensive but location is great!
