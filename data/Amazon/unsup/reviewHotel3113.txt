Okay, I've stayed in some pretty run-down places, but come on W! I expected much more from a 5 star hotel than a window with shutters in the bathroom, that opened into the bedroom, right next to the bed! Who designed that? Were they thinking when they did that to the room? To the bathroom? A bathroom is a sanctuary of peace and private business doing, not a place where everyone and their mothers can hear and smell (sorry people!) everything you do! I can't tell you how many times my companions and I talked about using the facilities up stairs. COME ON! W, you are not what you claim to be. Oh, and did I mention the cycling air conditioning system? It was loud and wouldn't turn off! I was totally uncomfortable. Ugh, never again!!!!!!!
