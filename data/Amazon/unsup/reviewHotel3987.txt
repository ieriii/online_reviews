My home during my first visit to Chicago. Nice staff, very clean and great amentities. The location was perfect for where we wanted to go. The room was a good size with a nice view. The bed was heavenly. And, don't forget to check out the Big Bar! I would give it 4.5 stars because there was no pool on site, but I'm rounding up because I wouldn't have had time to spend there anyway!
