With at least three bona fide 5-star hotels in the immediate vicinity of the Talbott I know that throwing out my own 5-star rating might seem a little generous. But those other 5-star joints are internationally known and with that comes the crowds, the lack of personal attention and outrageous prices. And then there is The Talbott Hotel. I'm a big fan of boutique hotels and The Talbott is one of the best I have ever experienced. No you don't have a massive lobby or numerous restaurants and shops inside the structure. But you do get a wonderfully appointed room with a large bathroom. The furniture is new and above all comfortable. Flatscreen televisions might not be the norm at all hotels but they are at The Talbott and they are HD. But I think it's the little things that really make the Talbott special. Their bath towels are huge and soft. They have complimentary Aveda products in the bathrooms. There is a full sized umbrella in the closet. There is a telephone next to the toilet just in case you need to do business while you are doing business. If you stay at the Talbott expect to be warmly greeted by everyone that works there. And I'm not talking about simple hellos but "How are you today?" and "Where are you travelling from?" types of questions. Every employee at the Talbott made me feel welcome which you don't always get at bigger hotels. I am already looking forward to my return trip in 2011.
