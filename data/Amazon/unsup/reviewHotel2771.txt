This was an awesome hotel!! We spent New Years Eve weekend there 2010/2011 and had a wonderful relaxing time. My boyfriend proposed on New Years Eve and the hotel was just perfect to relax all day on New Years and enjoy David Burke's Steakhouse that night which was incredible - such a unique and delicious menu - definitely try the bacon appetizer. We will make sure the next time we are in Chicago we will stay at the James!!!
