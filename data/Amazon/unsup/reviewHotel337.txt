Sigh. What a pity. I was searching for a hotel in the downtown area for my trip to Chicago and Expedia threw up this Travelodge which was almost in the heart of downtown and good subway connections. With such a great location, they should be trying to make the best of it but instead, this hotel seems to have given up competely with any other effort to create a good hotel experience. This started off at check in when they observed the 3pm check in time to the minute. Any classy hotel chain would allow some leeway if the rooms are ready. So there was a huge queue of disgruntled customers all piled up at the desk at 3pm. There seemed to be little effort by the staff to appear helpful or particularly friendly. The room was adequate in a hostel standard type of way. In a way, it was good beause it forced me to get out and explore Chicago more althought I was feeling tired and jetlagged. Thank goodness I was only in Chicago for a night. Like any good Chinese person, I love a good bargain but this place isn't even worth the reduced price I did pay.
