I honestly would have expected more from the Hilton Family of hotels. Again the living areas in the Embassy Suites seem to be lacking in updated furniture, but again the bedroom was emmaculate. The managers reception was a little overcrowded, as was the breakfast in the morning. All together a well maintained hotel with a great location and spectacular views from one side of the building. A great place to go if you're looking to stay a weekend in downtown, not pay incredible Chicago hotel prices, and still have a semi-upscale hotel stay.
