I stayed here for an ABA convention for work and it was a great experience. The Hotel staff was excellent and did everything i requested. The room was spacious and had great amenities like, flat screen tv, memory foam bed, and awesome views. the location was great. walking distance to everything. great bar on Hubard St, again all walking distance. if you are looking for a place where u can have a peaceful time and no need for a car this is the place.
