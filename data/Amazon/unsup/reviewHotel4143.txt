Definitely above average in terms of the mid-range hotels I've stayed at. Our room was clean, notably quiet, and BIG (also $40 less per night than the recommended hotel for the wedding we were in town for). Excellent & friendly service and tons of amenities in the same complex, plus we couldn't have asked for a better location in terms of being able to walk to stuff, including public transportation. Do be forewarned, though, that it's a business hotel, not really vacation spot, so there's no pool or breakfast area for example, and wi-fi isn't free ($13/day). I would stay here again in a heartbeat, though.
