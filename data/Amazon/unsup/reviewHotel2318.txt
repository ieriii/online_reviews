I stayed here w/ a friend during the labor day holiday. It's definitely the best location for a hotel if you want to be right in the middle of downtown Chicago. There were about 2 conferences going on in the hotel during my stay. So of course you will be taking the local elevator during the peak hours of the conference due to people going back and forth. It wasn't as bad as one would think. The hotel staff was definitely friendly during check-in, walking around the hotel, and check-out. they cleaned the room everyday immaculately, to the point I thought I walked into a new room. The room was GREAT! The view from the 35 floor ROCKED (although a bit scary b/c the window goes from floor to ceiling)! The only drawback is that $33 a day parking...def a hott mess! We stayed 6 days so that's $198...so not what anyone wants to pay on top of staying at over $100.00.
