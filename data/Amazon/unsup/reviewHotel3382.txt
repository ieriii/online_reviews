I was very surprised by how amazing this hotel is. It is PERFECTLY located right on the magnificent mile. Staff is super friendly and accommodating, I had both room service, went to the bar and to the restaurant and found all the service really great. I got a good deal from http://hotels.com and slept on the 5th floor, loved my room, it was not super big, but perfect for me and my luggage. There is a fitness room on the 25th floor. The elevators can be a bit slow, but the main reason for only giving 4 stars is that they do not have free wifi, you have to pay for it based on the connection speed you want. Will stay here again for sure next time I visit Chicago.
