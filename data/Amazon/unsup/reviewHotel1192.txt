I pricelined this hotel and was very pleased. Yes it's off the beaten path but waking up with the entire Chicago skyline each morning made up for it. Cabs to the loop were about $7-9 before tip and always easy to get one. The room was clean, the staff were nice. About a 10 minute walk to Soldiers Field and the lake. For a weekend away, this hotel definitely works. I was in Chicago to see the city not the inside of a hotel room.
