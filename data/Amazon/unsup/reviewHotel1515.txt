Love, love, LOVE this hotel. When traveling to large cities for tradeshows, I'm pretty much expecting higher hotel prices. Still $230/night for what I got was a great deal. Plus, it was on the shuttle route to McCormick Place. The regular rooms were booked and since it was getting close to show time, I upgraded to the junior executive suite for only $20 more a night than the regular room. Couple that with a 20% discount for pre-paying and it was a pretty good deal. Posh interior, working elevators with low wait times and generally really nice looking. The suite had a wet bar and fridge, very nice lounge/desk area, huge sleeping area with chaise lounge and a phenomenal bathroom. Garden tub + seperate shower with rain head - LOVED it. Hotel 71 is close to EVERYTHING. Seriously, the best location. The river is across the street, the Tribune building just to the right and fantastic architecture all around. Nice little restaurant/bar extended off the lobby and an array of food/drink choices all around. The staff was super friendly and my room was fantastic. I will say I can see how others reviewers may be irritated with the thermostat - I had it set on cool for the most part but I'm pretty sure it stayed the same temperature the entire time. It was comfortable for me, but I can how others might find it a bit stuffy. The business center was a little on the small side, but had everything I needed and everything worked.  I'd definitely recommend this place for business or pleasure and will for stay again the next time I'm downtown.
