I really like it here: The music is great and it is a very diverse crows (most days). Yet, let's be real: this is a place for people who like to spend money. So if you are cheap- go elsewhere! If I'm in the mood to dress up and get pretty- I know Victor's the spot, but I know I'm gonna pay a little bit more for a beer or a glass of wine than at other places, It's just that kind of spot. So really, lf you have a problem with that- there's a lot of other places in Chicago!
