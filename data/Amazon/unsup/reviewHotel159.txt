Beautiful clean room. Very attentive service. After I has been in my room for 20 min the concierge called to see if I was happy with my room. Lots of toiletries, superb location. So many restaurants are within walking distance. I always book this place through hotwire. They describe it as a four star hotel in the mag mile area.
