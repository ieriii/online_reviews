Great location if you have a car. Really easy to get on the 90 and/or lake Shore Drive. Front desk manager appeared genuinely insulted when she saw how great my hotwire rate was (it was really great, less than half the price of valet parking at the other Hyatt...) Room Window opened 5 inches-good by today's standards. Air conditioning was adequate through the night. (some hotels cut down on AC late at night) Only one front desk person was outstanding. Two were rude. I rented two rooms, one for me, one for a friend. In order to get to the room at night, if you have a rental car, you must pass your key card to get into the parking lot, pass it again to get into the elevator and again to get into your room. the key failed at one of the three key points, on nearly every trip. At one point i had them make me three keys, and NONE worked. my friend made through the three-key gauntlet only once without a front desk change of keys... other than that, the beds were great, room was clean. soaps were a little heavy--if you want something unscented or not waxy bring your own. All in all, a fine generic hotel experience with the usual chain store problems--no one in the hotel seemed to take responsibility for the issues.
