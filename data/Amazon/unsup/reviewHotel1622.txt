We got this hotel for a stay cation in the city, there were 4 of us girls. The lobby is really small but decorated in a boutique style, very cute. The guy behind the counter was super friendly and he even upgraded us to a river-view room even though we just got the city-view room (which was just basically view of buildings). When we got up to the room the view was amazing and the room was very spacious, great for a group of people, for a pre-game or something. We got 2 double queens. It was pretty entertaining to watch the view down to the river. You could tell that this hotel was revamped, meaning you could tell this was a hotel that was prob very crappy before and attempting to be something nicer than it is. Everything looks really nice but there are some things if you really want to be nitpicky, like the size of the shower, small, the water pressure did not change at all. The carpet looked dirty, there was even a stain, and they had haphazardly covered the chaise (leopard print) with a navy blue cover. But hey, it is a pretty nice hotel in a very good location, close to everything and at a decent price. I could find myself staying here again.
