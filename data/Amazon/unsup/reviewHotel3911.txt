I asked my Airport Express driver what he knew about the Congress Hotel, to which he replied, "You mean the strike that's been going on for five years?" Um, yeah the hotel workers have been on strike for FIVE years. The owners of the Congress are the only ones in the entire city who will not negotiate w/ the union. That's effed up. But I didn't know that when I booked this super cheap hotel on Michigan Ave for a conference recently. For its location and size, you can tell that the Congress must have been nice in its heyday...now it is pretty dilapidated and has a very strong, persistent Lysol smell. The rooms are pretty minimal and the beds...well, let's just say that you can tell how old they are by how small the double bed size is. Not too much you can even say about service...this place is like a ghost town. At least it's clean and conveniently located hear Grant Park, the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. But even for how cheap it was, I still feel guilt for crossing the picket line (which they still walk EVERY DAY). And that's just not worth it.
