I'm not really into the W-thing. I've stayed in some W's in the past that didn't pass muster, so I wasn't expecting much and ended up being pleasantly surprised. I prefer classy older hotels over urban hip establishments. But, having said that, I actually enjoyed my recent stay here while attending a medical convention. Overall, this hotel suited my needs as a business traveller. I was greeted very warmly by the receptionist upon check in . The lobby was contemporary/ minimalist, but beautifully decorated with flowers and candles that made a good first impression. I found my room to be pretty standard business class, but the bed was extremely comfortable with thick down pillows and eqyptian cotton sheets. The room had a full mini-bar, an LG flat screen TV, DVD player (hotel had a nice video library that I did not sample), an IPod docking station, nice bath robe, bliss bath toilettries, and 24-hr room service. As a single traveller, I did not mind the window with shutters that opened to the bedroom from the bath. I actually liked to have the shutters open so that I could watch TV from the bathroom while brushing my teeth in the morning.  The elevator ride down to the lobby was usually awkward in the morning, as strangers in business attire crammed in next to me in this dimly lit minidisco with piped in sexy disco musak. The entire lobby turned into a night club on most evenings during my stay. It was a lively scene, and I found that my colleagues were all eager to participate. We tried the restaurant "Wave" for lunch and dinner and I would highly recommend it. I sampled many of the dishes from the tapas-style menu and they were excellent, including hummus, spinach and feta pastries, flank steak, and octopus.  The hotel is conveniently located a few short blocks from Michigan ave with it's fantastic shops and restaurants. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would probably stay here again.
