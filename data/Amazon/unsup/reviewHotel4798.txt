This is just a review for the rooftop bar...we were there on Saturday night...a couple of days after they opened. The views are nice, but the drinks are truly the worst drinks I have ever had. I ordered a lemon drop martini. Not only did it taste funky, but I had to send it back to be shaken, because it was tepid when it was sent to me. tepid!! Our friend's mixed drink was pretty nasty as well...another one of the worst mixed drinks I've tried...not sure how he choked it down. Stick with beer or wine if you go.The decor was nice, lobby looked great, and had overenthusiastic greeters welcoming everyone...but we won't go back.
