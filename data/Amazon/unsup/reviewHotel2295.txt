There is one word to describe this hotel. Functional, at best.  As a business traveler who stays at Marriot's all over the world- this hotel is just okay in my book. Now granted- they are in the process of remodeling and they will have another chance to impress me when I stay here again in July, but for now? Functional is the best I can say. From the time you pull up to the entrance- and you wait and wait and wait for the valet to come and get your car- to the mess in the lobby from the remodeling (bang, bang, bang!) to the front desk staff who acted like they were bothered that I was there, this place needs a major overhaul. The guest rooms are small and the one I was in had not yet been remodeled so it felt tired and old. Room service for simple items took forever and no one ever did show up with the extra blanket that I requested. I also attended a banquet here and although the space was large and remodeled, there are certainly better banquet facilities in this city. The banquet food was cold and tasteless and we couldn't get a refill of our water or wine glasses throughout the entire evening. When we asked for additional rolls because there were not enough for everyone at our table- the server told us that it was "planned that way". What? They planned to have 5 rolls for a table of 8? On the positive side- this hotel is in a great location at Rush and Ohio close to all that a tourist may want to do in our fine city.  But as for me? I think I'll let them finish their remodeling and give it another shot this summer to see if the "facelift" that they are doing goes deeper than just the surface.
