Hmmm, didn't get any of the same perks from my first visit, wonder if we downgraded our corp perks. This visit I was in the newer tower and had a great view of the Hancock building. My wireless was super spotty and I was ready to dislike the place when the front desk removed the charges. All in all, clean, comfy, safe and convenient.
