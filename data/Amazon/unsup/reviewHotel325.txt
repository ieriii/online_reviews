A recent visit shows City Suites is still as good as ever. Friendly staff, clean rooms. The TV was a bit stubborn but we were able to get it going. For the first time in many visits I stayed on the 'El' side of the hotel. The windows seal tightly to block out most noise from the train- I was rarely aware of it. The convenience to the train is a huge plus! Belmont is as busy as ever, but here are tons of great restaurants within walking distance.
