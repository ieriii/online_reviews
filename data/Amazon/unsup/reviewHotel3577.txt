The High Tea at the Drake is an amazing experience. We loved our time spent here. We enjoyed a three tiered lunch with a variety of amazing culinary delights. The egg salad has a mango chutney in it, it was so yummy! The pastries and desserts were also amazing. Each table received home made strawberry jam, lemon curd, and cream, and all three tasted amazing on the pastries. The scones and banana bread were made fresh in house, everything was made fresh, and all of it was delicious. I ordered the Bombay Chai to drink and it was literally the best cup of tea I have ever had. For thirty six dollars per person, this is a treat, however, it was worth every penny, the service was amazing, and I loved the experience. There was a harpist who performed during the entire tea service and the fountain and flowers were beautiful. On our way out we stopped at the Ladies Powder Room, each bathroom stall had its own sink and seat to freshen up one's makeup, what a luxury! Definitely will come back the next time I want to do something special!!!
