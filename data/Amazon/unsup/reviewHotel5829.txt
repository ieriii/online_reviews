Very clean and super helpful staff. The rooms have nice beds with down pillows and decent duvet covers. The air conditioning in my room didn't seem to keep it as cool as I would have preferred but that did not hinder my review much. The single room with a queen sized bed was a little small, but for staying just two nights and being in the room only to change and sleep, this was not an issue.The hotel provides free bottled water, free Wi-Fi, and free computer/printing usage. Quite helpful for quick information and a drink.Right off of Michigan Ave., we were super close to the "Magnificent Mile" and had a beautiful view.I will definitely return!
