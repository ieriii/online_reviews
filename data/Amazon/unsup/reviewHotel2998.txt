A solid hotel, near Navy Pier. Good for business during the week, and a happening nightspot on the weekends (anticipate Vegas style noise from the drunks in the hallways Friday and Saturday nights). The bar had the usual mix of great bartenders and crappy, unattentive ones. If I recall, Mich Ultras we're $6 bucks, which seems kinda high, even for Chicago. We were there at the same time as an instagram party, which meant we got some gratis apps, and watched as people attempted to look more important than they really were, a la Hollywood style. The hotel room itself was nice, clean, everything as it should be, though as with many of the W chain, the bathroom is not sealed, rather has plantain shutters between the toilet and the bed...which when paired with the lack of a vent fan, can be awkward for a romantic weekend. The gym was small, yet well appointed. Wifi is free in the lobby...but they try to make you pay in the rooms. No surprises here.
