The location of this hotel is great, but unfortunately that is the best thing it has going for it.  We booked through hotwire, where this is billed as a 4.5 star hotel. It most definitely was not. I would say it is more of a 3 or 3.5 star hotel. Our room was acceptable, but certainly not what we were expecting for something that calls itself a 4.5 star hotel. The was incredibly small, the furniture was worn-looking, and the walls seemed to be paper thin.   It was also annoying that they seem to try to squeeze as much money out of you as possible. In particular, they charge about $13/day (or something like $17 for your whole stay) to use the fitness center, which seemed completely ridiculous to us. (They also charge a lot for the internet, but since we didn't use their internet, I can't comment as to the quality of that).  Use of the pool is free, and the pool is stunningly beautiful. It is worth taking a look even if you are not going to swim. Unfortunately, the morning I chose to use the pool, it was extremely crowded, and they only had one lane set up for lap swimming, so it was challenging to actually use the pool for exercise. Also, there weren't any hotel employees to monitor the pool and I saw several people in the pool in street clothes. I got out when I noticed the baby that had a regular diaper (not a swim diaper) on--yuck!  My biggest issue was that this hotel was just not what we expected. Had we booked a 3 star hotel, it would have met our expectations  But since we were expecting something on the level of a 4.5 star hotel, we were disappointed.
