Stunning hotel. Knowledgeable and helpful staff. Room was 'ok', taking on a minimalist decor which i did not mind as much as the lack of comfort i experienced, particularly on the bed. Had breakfast in the restaurant once. Great food, good service and gorgeous setting, but I noticed they put up a 15 minute fuss when I wanted to pay in cash for what was a little more than a $20 meal. i didnt really quite understand what the fuss was all about. Sure, most customers will pay credit card for most payments, but surely a hotel establishment will make arrangements to accept cash as a form of payment. Really? I did think that was was totally ridiculous. They also made me wait 10 minutes before being seated when the restaurant was completely empty; table for 1 that is. However... coffee bar is fabulous with very yummy treats and a beautiful seating area with chess boxes and books to enjoy with your coffee. Excellent location. So close to everything you need.
