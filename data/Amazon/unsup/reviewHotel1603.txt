Just stayed here Last weekend and had the best view I've ever had in a hotel! Good service: When we checked out they let us check our bags at the front desk so we could take a boat tour. Great location. The bathroom was great 2 sinks and the overhead shower rocks. The only strange thing (which is not a huge deal) was that ice was only available on one floor and it was not our floor. So it was a bit inconvenient. I would definitely stay again.
