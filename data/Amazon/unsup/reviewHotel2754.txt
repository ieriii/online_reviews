We really enjoyed staying at the James. The decor is very sleek & minimal, like a "W" Hotel but with better lighting. The room was well designed and had lots of nice little features, including two comfortable spots for reading and an iPod dock that my husband was glad to see. Despite its downtown location the room was relatively quiet and it's certainly close to lots of hot spots. We found the staff to be very helpful and pleasant. We took advantage of the free wifi in the room and it was hassle-free, and we also used the free PC's downstairs to print our boarding passes--all very convenient. We also loved the library of interesting books, plus the assortment of available guidebooks, WHERE Magazines, etc. All in all we had a great time and have already recommended the hotel to our friends at home in San Francisco.
