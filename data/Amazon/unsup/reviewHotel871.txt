This hotel was ideal for my stay -- great staff, beautiful rooms, and a great location. And keys! Real keys like the ones you have on your keychain! I'm not sure why that had such a big impact on me, but it did. Nice view of the Trump Tower from my room. Great restaurants and Millennium Park within easy walking distance. My room wasn't huge, but it didn't need to be -- great work Kimpton.
