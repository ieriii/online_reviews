On the outside this hotel is quite nice, compliments the neighborhood very well and is relaxing to the eye and mind. Inside is nice too but kind of looks on the cheap side but it's a Best Western so I wont be too hard on them. The folk at the desk were nice and chatted guests up when appropriate which was nice. The folk at the desk seemed to actually care about peoples stay and were helpful on questions on where to grab a bite to eat and get around. The room I got was a standard room, nothing fancy for me. My view sucked but the room was clean and comfortable enough to catch a Bears (GO BEARS!) game in the room and just relax from my flight before heading out for a bit of booty shaking at Berlin (see review) for Madonna night. The hotel is a distance from the red line about a mile but not a bad walk weather permitting but there are also buses near by the hotel. i didn't take the buses as everything was within walking distance from my hotel or I just grabbed a cab. If you get hungry or a bit thirsty there is a Jewlles and a Treasure Island just within walking distance from the hotel. I'd love to stay here again but it books up so fast and during baseball season (GO CUBS!) good luck cause prices go way up.
