It is said; that you learn more about people when there is a problem, than when everything is going smoothly. I am a huge fan of Westin and W hotels and they are my first choice wherever I travel. Unfortunately, I ran into some problems while attempting to check-in with my family last week. We were faced with a couple of reservation mishaps and billing issues. I want to commend the managers, including the General Manager Peter, for the manner in which they addressed my concerns Admittedly I was a tough customer, and I was caught up in making a point instead of appreciating their gracious understanding of what had happened. A bottle of wine, along with a thoughtful note were sent up to the room immediately. This hotel was lovely and their staff is a first class. Our stay was enjoyable and I would recommend this hotel for their beautiful rooms, excellent food, and trendy atmosphere. I can honestly say that they will go above and beyond to assure you a memorable visit.
