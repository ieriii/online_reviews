The hotel itself isnt bad. I was a little disapointed though that I didnt get an ocean view instead i got a city view. The adjoining door between the rooms were a little thin. I could hear everyting that my neighbor was talking abotu through the door. They probably heard me also. The shower was also a little messed up and kept leaking everywhere even after I asked them to fix it. The drinks at the bar were also a little pricey for my tastes. The people/concierge there though were extremly friendly and top notch. My hats off to Ramon in Concierge for making my stay as good as possible.
