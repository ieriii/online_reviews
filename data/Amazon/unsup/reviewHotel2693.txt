Loved this place. I got a great deal through a website so I decided to take my husband here for a little "staycation". The room was bright and modern, not huge by any means but not small either. The bed was ridiculously comfortable..I didn't want to get out of it. The bathroom was big with Khiels products, which promptly went into my bag. The mini bar is unlike any mini bar I've seen. There weren't just airplane sized bottles, there were large bottles of Grey Goose, Johnny Walker, Patron and more. And there was a wine opener, martini glasses, and wine glasses which was key as we brought some wine to drink. The service was top notch. We didn't have a remote for the stereo to listen to our ipod so we called the front desk...the remote was at our door in less than 3 minutes. Turn down service includes a tasty little cookie and more Khiels products if needed. I loved that check in and check out was 2pm. It really allows you to enjoy the room. If I ever need to stay downtown again I'd stay here in a heartbeat.
