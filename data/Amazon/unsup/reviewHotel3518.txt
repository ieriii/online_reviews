Pros: Great location Comfy beds Clean Helpful bellhops Cons: Amanda at the front desk wanted to put a $50 a day hold on my DEBIT card for incidentals for my 5 night stay in my prepaid room. I know she was just trying to do her job, but when I questioned the large amount she said there was nothing she could do. One of her co-workers overheard our discussion, came over and said to just put a $50 hold for the entire stay. Amanda's eyes lit up and said, "what if something happens"? Um, hello, I'm standing right in front of you! Her very nice co-worker said it was fine, helped her set it up and walked away. At that point Amanda was PISSED!!! I asked for two keys, she just glared at me and angrily grabbed another key. I went up to my room and that was it. I did t see Miss By The Book Amanda until I was checking out. I understand there are rules, but c'mon a $250 hold on my debit card, which will take 7-10 days to fall off- I don't think so. Other than that issue, our stay at the Avenue was fine. The water pressure was pretty good and when the shower wouldn't drain, they fixed it immediately. Despite Amanda, I'd stay there again.
