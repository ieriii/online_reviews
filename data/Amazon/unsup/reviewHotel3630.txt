Sooner or later we all grow up - so you might as well do it over tea and biscuits. The Drake Hotel, aside from being an awesome hotel, offers a great High Tea. Never tried it before? It's simple, you dress up and drink tea with the who's who of Chicago.   Insiders notes: try the Earl Grey - its great!
