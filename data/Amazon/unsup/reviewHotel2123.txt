I was expecting a 4.5 star experience; here's why it was a 3.0: 1. We stayed downtown overnight to treat the kids to a "staycation" with a pool. We checked in, got to our room, and saw a note on our desk that the pool was closed indefinitely. Really? They couldn't have put that on the website or told us when we checked in? My husband complained and they took $80 off the room rate, which was nice, but we wanted the pool. 2. There was writing on the bathroom wall above the bathtub. In marker. Big letters. 3. The TV programming did not work and the issue was not resolved before we all fell asleep. 4. No moisturizer in the bathroom. It's the little things...
