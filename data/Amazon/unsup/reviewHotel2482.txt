Nice hotel in a great location! My only problem was the breakfast on the executive floor was too crowded and ran out of food and coffee quickly. You had to bus the tables yourself before you could sit in one. I think anybody can go up their whether they are supposed to or even are staying their because they never check to see if you are even a guest.
