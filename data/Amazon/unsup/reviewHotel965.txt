As far as I am concerned, I do not need to ever stay in any other hotel in the Chicago area. Chicago is a great place to visit and, at least in the summer...those cold winds blowing off the lake in winter are not fun. But summer is great and there is always something to do. On a recent trip we stayed for the first time at the Amalfi Hotel...and this is now my favorite hotel ever. It is very small and the staff is just fantastic. They were ready to help at any time. I almost wish we had a problem while we were there so that I could have seen how they handled it...but I never got the chance since the approximately one week stay there was just perfect. The hotel has the perfect location on the near north side and everything of interest is either a walk or a short taxi ride away. In the evening you can enjoy free cocktails and munchies up on the 5th floor...you have got to try their Amalfitini...I just had to go back every night for more, it was so good. I guarantee that you will love this place...and, by the way, get there in the late afternoon and try the cookies at the registration desk...but no fair eating the whole platter full!
