Perfect location, rooms were nice and clean, but wasn't overly impressed with it. Believe it or not, I've had better service at lower priced hotels. "24" hour business center was closed, breakfast was so-so. It's a nice hotel for downtown, but I don't think I'd go back. There are plenty of other hotels DT or cheaper that I've experienced better service at.
