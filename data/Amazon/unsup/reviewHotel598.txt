Many positives to this hotel. The service was great here, the rooms large, nice fitness room, great location, views, safe area to walk around at night (woman travelling alone, so very important).  The room was modern and took a bit getting used to with the very low bed and more austere deck chair, but ended up being pretty comfortable. While quite spacious as far as square footage, the area for clothing was tight, so would have been difficult with more than one person.  As often happens in the older hotels, the bathroom also was tight, small shower and very little counter space for hair drying make up application, etc. Net is I would definitely stay here again as a single, but would look for something with more clothing and bath space if travelling with my husband.
