Nothing beats the location to Michigan Avenue! The hotel was kept up very nicely for being an older hotel. Our hotel room was right in front of the elevator, and we could hear people if they were talking in the hallway but we were fortunate it was very quiet. The rooms are very small, and with a double bed it was cozy.
