My wife and I just stayed here for our honeymoon and we had a wonderful time. We weren't used to staying in such a swank, chic place, but it was totally worth it. The location is great - just a mile or so north of the Loop - and it's conveniently located near a Whole Foods and Starbucks. Our room was moderately sized, but the bed was huge and comfortable. The shower was amazing - maybe the best one I've ever used. If you like ergonomic, eco-friendly hotels and rooms then this is the place for you. The food was also exceptional. We got $20 off our breakfasts for two consecutive mornings and the food was great. The portions were huge and absolutely tasty. Try the chocolate chip pancakes and the Dana Breakfast (their fried potatoes were magical, like pixie dust was added to them or something :).
