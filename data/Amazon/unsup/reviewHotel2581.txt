So....this place is interesting. It could be fun with the right group of people...just don't let anyone show you any "cool pictures". All of the photos on the walls are of naked folk in very odd positions. You can't really tell unless you are standing very close but it is odd none the less. I would be willing to go back but won't take the advice of any dapper appearing gents asking you to look at a large woman's naked backside.
