I stayed here while on business. Our room had been updated and was very comfortable although the lighting was horrible. I understand the 'mood lighting' and don't mind it generally, but I draw the line at the bathroom. You've got to brighten up the bathroom at least. I couldn't see to put on make-up. Annoying.  Everyone was super friendly and accommodating during our stay. I didn't dine at the restaurants but I did feel the in room meal prices were too high. We spent $55 on (2) egg breakfasts and a pot of coffee (after gratuity). $55, Really?! Are you kidding?
