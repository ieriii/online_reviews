A hidden gem boutique hotel! Modern feel and luxury amenities, great location just off Michigan Ave. Excellent service and friendly staff. I loved my daily Happy Grams they give you. The rooms are small, but very chic with a NYC feel. Price was right as well! $99/night for a Fri and Sat night in downtown Chicago at an upscale hotel - Unbelievable! I would give it 5 stars if the walls weren't so paper thin.......go there to party, not to sleep!
