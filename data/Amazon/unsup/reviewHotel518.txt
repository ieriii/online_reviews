At one time or another I've stayed at nearly every major brand hotel in the Loop and this property would rate in the top 20% in terms of staff, value and location. The staff couldn't have been more pleasant, from the front desk to the bell and door folks, they were simply nice people to be around. The property itself is a good value considering the great location. The room was clean and nice, not extravagant, but I don't always need extravagant every trip. Very happy the WiFi worked well, which is not often enough the case everywhere. Free breakfast was... well free. As is often the case the guests can descend like wild beasts when free food is involved, so no surprise with the feeding frenzy and it's not the staff's fault it can get crazy in the dining room. (Hint: Rick Bayless's XOCO is one block away if you want a phenomenal breakfast) In short, you're unlikely to find better lodging at this pricepoint downtown. I'm quite sure I'll make a return visit.
