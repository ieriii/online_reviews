I went with one of my good friends to the spa for a massage the Thursday before my wedding. My girlfriend originally was just going along with me since she was from out of town but at the last minute decided to get one as well, they were booked but after explaining our situation managed to squeeze her in, I just spent extra time in the relaxation room so that she could go before me. We spent about 3 hours there in between using the sauna/steam room and getting our massages, it was a great way to start off the wedding festivities. It is also very competitively priced for a basic massage compared to other downtown hotels.
