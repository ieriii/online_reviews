Fabulous!! They now have a Starbucks in the building for coffee in the morning!! The lobby bar is a gorgeous place to go and just relax. It almost makes you want to put on that ballgown and head to a party. The rooms are very comfortable, the beds felt so cozy, and all the extra pillows made everything feel like home. It seems as if everything is within walking distance, or at least a short cab ride away. The history of the building is seen in every turn, and it is exquisite. I could live in this hotel. It is one of my favorites.
