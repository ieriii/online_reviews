I booked a room at this hotel prior to reading the reviews and was a little nervous rolling in. I have no idea what half of these reviews are talking about. Parking: its downtown Chicago, deal with it. Every hotel I have stayed at downtown charged at least $35 a night, so they aren't out of line. I stopped by a few self parks near by, and there was almost no savings, so I just valeted every night. Plus you get in and out. Elevators: Either they changed this problem, or other people stayed at a different hotel then I did. It was a concern of mine after reading the reviews so I made sure to time them. The longest wait I had was 45 seconds. They had 4 elevators 2 serving the first half and 2 serving the other. It worked well. Rooms: Mine I believe was an older one. It was still clean, fairly updated, and without any complaints. My view was of some surrounding buildings and a bit of Michigan Ave, but I didn't care. The location is stellar (within a short walk to every el line in the city), and the price is right. If you're not a chain hotel points whore or some super high maintenance jerk, you should have no problem staying here.
