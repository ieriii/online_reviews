Old. This place was decent priced for location. It was indeed older and small room but pretty clean besides hair I found on the bed. The walls are paper thin here so expect every conversation to be heard. No sightings of bugs or anything breaking . Would stay again if they get some new comforters that I can be sure are cleaned properly first.
