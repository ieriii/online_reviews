Wow. If zero stars was an option thats what I would have. I really cant say one good thing about this place except that their food is ok. If you're looking for a hotel and not just a good restaurant do not stay here. Being from New York and knowing what Ian Schrager is capable of is clearly not a good thing. Our expectations were high and this place didnt even come close. The 24 year old staff was completely unhelpful. In all honestly, you could get a better bathroom at a Holiday Inn. There are a lot of great hotels in Chicago, don't let a reputation like Schragers lead you away from them. This hotel was a waste, felt unfinished and was an overall lazy effort.
