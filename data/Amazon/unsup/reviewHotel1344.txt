Our stay was greatly enchanted by the staff of this hotel. The service is fabulous, the location is probably one of the best ones and the decor is pleasant. The only thing where they lose some stardom is that it is very humid. Our clothes were constantly damped and the odor in the hall of our room proved that it was humid. Also the rooms are very small and though the modern deco makes you feel like a million bucks, there is little storage place and in the bedroom and the bathroom. Last point that surprised us was that a simple coffee was charged at breakfast. The breakfast price was quite expensive and I would have thought that the coffee would come with it. Or at least not been charged for a refill. So in general, totally in love with the staff, but hotel has its ups and downs.
