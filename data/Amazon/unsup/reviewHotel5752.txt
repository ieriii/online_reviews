My favorite gay bars are located in Rogers Park (Touche & Jackhammer), so when I come to Chicago, I like to stay somewhere within "stumbling distance" to my favorite raunchy leather bars: Heart O' Chicago fills the bill. It's a scant 10 minute stroll from the motel to the bars that I like. This is a motel, people! It's very outdated, but it's CLEAN. The bathroom appliances (toilet, tub, sink) in my room were all 70's chic gold.  The king size bed was pretty comfortable, and the huge window was an added bonus. The walls are THIN, so you get to hear the dude in the room next to you bang his girlfriend at 6:00 AM -- which is an odd way to wake up. For me? I could care less -- it's all about the experience! The breakfast is pretty damn rad -- simple, but good. Oh, and the WiFi is powerful: I asked the front desk, and their provider is Comcast, so you get uber fast cable Internet. I'll never stay anywhere else in Chicago
