When we arrived we saw a sparkly huge W that made us get even more excited. We headed to Chicago for a smaller family vacation, only taking us an hour to get from the northern suburbs to Chicago, Perfect location!! The also give you Bliss prouducts, which smell very good. Now onto the bad side.... We found cut toenails on the floor of our hotel, I was thinking maybe even the cleaning ladies didn't want to clean it up so they left it there. That was on our first night so we were not pleased. They charge you for calling out of your room, and DOWN THE STREET. not happy about that either. The atmosphere was good, down the street from Navy peir, and we almost stayed because of a gymnastics meet I went to. Okay, Not recommmended, but a place stay.
