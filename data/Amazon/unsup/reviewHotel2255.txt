work brought our satellite location crew into town for the weekend and everyone camped out at the Intercontinental. i was lucky to have gotten to stay here since i am local but i summed it up as a comped staycation. the hotel is really two hotels. i stayed in the tower and i saw both sections, and like it better than the newer section. the hotel offers commanding views of downtown so opt for the highest floor possible. throughout the course of the weekend i had fully explored the entire hotel. a few of us at at their zest restaurant. it was quiet and had a very american menu with nothing too ambitious. while it was expensive, the quality of the food and service unfortunately did not match the price. ENO on the other hand was very nice. their impressive wine list was deciphered with ease by their knowledgable waiter and glasses were complimented by some of the finest cheeses i have ever tasted. i felt very relaxed because the atmosphere was not pretentious. i believe the menu might have had a few sandwiches but we didn't try them.
