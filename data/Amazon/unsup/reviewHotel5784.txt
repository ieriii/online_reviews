Horibble hotel. The wireless internet will not connect in the room. The signal is to weak. The hotel room has a funky odor and it is very noisy. You can hear every little sound. I highly recommend you look to stay somewhere else. Don't let the cheap rates fool you, you get what you pay for. It is old and in need of a major update.
