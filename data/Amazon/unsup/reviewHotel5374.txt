This Travelodge should be closed and then imploded Las Vegas style.The staff lied to me and told me there were no smoking rooms at any Chicago hotel per city ordinance.They do not know what they are talking about and I am lucky I did not just trust them at their word. I googled around and found the lovely Essex Inn around the corner, which is 20 dollars cheaper a night and has a whole floor of smoking rooms. So I moved hotels and the Essex was orders of magnitude better than the Travelodge.There are no refrigerators in the Travelodge rooms. The elevators are slow.If you are a smoker, they offer no designated smoking area nor do they offer any smoking rooms. You will be out in the cold smoking on the street getting pestered by street beggars.The hotel was built in the 1920s and has 90 years worth of paint layers in the rooms and around the windows. Noisy elevated train line right next to your room window.Lousy. Worthless. Lackadaisical. Poor. Bad Value for Money. Lame. Dingy. Dank. Rubbish. Crummy. Delapidated. Deteriorated.In the dictionary under rubbish, there should be a picture of this joint.
