I will never stay here again. My girlfriends and I came downtown for a birthday celebration and got a room for a night. I got a pretty good deal on the room with a travel site, but given the price that it should have been...not worth the money. It was less than impressive, I've stayed in nicer hotels in Cleveland. But regardless, the main reason for my rating is that they have a ton of hidden fees, and on top of it all, they charged my credit card for items from the mini-bar that I did not take. When I called to ask if there may have been a mistake, I was simply told no and that I would be charged anyways. Moral of the story, I have a hard time giving this hotel anything but one star when they cant admit their mistakes, or they are just simply ripping people off on purpose. Either way, they will never get my business again.
