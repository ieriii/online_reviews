When I looked for a hotel downtown near navy pier and michigan avenue, the Hilton Embassy Suites kept popping up with pretty good reviews. I found a price that I could live with in a downtown hotel and it had a free breakfast. I decided to take a chance. What I got was a corner suite with a lake view. It was immaculately clean, spacious and away from the noise. The king bed was so comfortable and I slept through the night for the first time in weeks. The "free" breakfast was not just free, it was darned right awesome. One line led to an omelet station and home-made egg orders, while another buffet line of eggs, bacon, and pancakes suited several fares. Fruit, cereal, juices, fresh coffee, donuts and toast and more and it was all free. THe manager said they served up to 1500 guests a day, so get there early.  BTW, the restaurant manager, Vadym, is fantastic. He not only sets the tone for the friendliness his staff is known for, he sets the tempo for detail and work ethic. His staff are constantly patrolling the seating area hoping to help by clearing dishes and whatever they can do to make your stay even better.  We highly recommend the Embassy Suites Lakefront for your next stay. Keep in mind, there are two embassy suites downtown chicago and many different hotels with the Hilton connection. But there is only one Hilton Embassy Suites Lakefront with the great breakfast, great staff and manager's reception that others have mentioned.  Truly a gem worth visiting.
