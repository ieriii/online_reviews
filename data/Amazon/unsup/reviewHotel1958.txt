If you like staying at a hotel that feels like a night club this is for you. Lobby had the music and light show going on and then it carries into the dark elevator with 3D effect walls that'll disorient you or keep you entertained till you reach your floor. Room was clean, modern, WHITE, and WHITE. Used the Acura experience a couple times, that was a nice perk. As far as overall service, it was great.
