OK, got a suite for a bachelorette party....lets say its pretty dark and dingy in the suite....I was like where is the lights or the windows in this place. A friend hooked us up with a good price so really I cant complain. The room wasnt ready until 230PM...yes, I know check in isnt until 3 but we called to see if we could get in early and they said no problem....it was a different story when we arrived. The staff is nice, however, there was definitely a communication barrier which made it pretty hard to try to find out about the murphy bed, etc. Its an ok spot and to be honest, if we would have paid full price, the stars would definitely be lower. Its a pretty nice location and thats about it.
