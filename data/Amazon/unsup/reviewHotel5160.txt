I was first introduced to W hotels a couple of years ago and this was acutally the one we stayed at. My wife and I enjoyed it and the beds really were heavenly. Fast forward a couple of years and though the bar and lobby hasn't changed much, the rooms sure did. They no longer have the heavenly beds or at least it didn't feel as heavenly as we remembered and the room we stayed in was no longer urban and hip but more like IKEA. Seriously, it looked and feel like something straight out of an IKEA catalog. I still rate it 4 stars though because it was comfortable and love the bar and lobby atmosphere. Very chill and their drinks were delicious! The Acura service was also nice. We did have to take a questionnaire but it was better than paying for a taxi. I think we'll try out the W Lakeshore next time.
