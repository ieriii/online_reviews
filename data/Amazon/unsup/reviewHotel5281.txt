What can I say -- this hotel is CUTE.I stayed here on business. All in all it was just okay. It's not my idea of upscale, but rather a decent, no frills, moderately-priced facility.WHAT I LIKED:1. If a random person asked me where's a good place to shower, I'd say "Amalfi!". Yep, folks, the dual head shower provided great pressure to get me squeaky clean.2. The soft bed and two kinds of fluffy pillows (one round, one flatter). It's hard to sleep in most hotels, but that bedding cradled me like mommy's bosom.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:1. I picked the Amalfi because of its breakfast on every floor. Man, was I disappointed. Cold continental breakfasts don't suit me. I couldn't even heat up my croissant.2. That darn TV had a severe delay, plus I had to contort my body into odd positions just to get the precise angle for the remote and tv to communicate. In the middle of a program, the tv would reset and take me back to the menu screen. Aaargh!3. I had a corner room and loved how the entire wall was windows on one side. Beaming with excitement, I peak out and find myself with an unobstructed view of a brick wall. smhAmalfi is okay. Definitely not my top pick in that area, but I'd stay if I had too.
