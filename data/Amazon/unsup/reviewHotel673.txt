Was in town for a week for a convention and decided to stay here primarily to build up my Marriot points. I was very happy with my stay here. It's very nice to be able to walk a block west and enjoy the Michigan Ave. shopping. It's also a very short walk from one of my favorite places, Corner Bakery. The rooms were very spacious (no different from any other big-city downtown Marriott) and the staff was incredibly helpful. I bought a few groceries at the nearby Whole Foods and realized while I was there that my room did not have a refrigerator. I called the front desk and they were able place one in my room before I walked back! Even better, as soon as I walked into the lobby the concierge said, "Mr. Etim, you'll find the refrigerator you requested next to the television." Take a bow. The attached restaurant, Viand, was okay - the eggs and sausage were a little pricy compared to other restaurants a few blocks away. Will definitely consider this place for a possible vacation stay.
