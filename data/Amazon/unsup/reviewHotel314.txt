I got a great rate for this hotel on Priceline and I really wanted to like this place for the deal I got. AND in all honesty we should have said something to the management the second we realized what was going on. So we get checked in and everything, the hotel is really convenient and I really like the placement as it was really close to everything we needed to go to. It was a cute hotel and our room was a little small but hey, it worked for us. The issues first started happening when I tried to connect to the wifi in the hotel. I couldn't get it in our room and I was frantically trying to do something on the internet when I couldn't get to the internet. I walked down to the lobby and accessed it there. I soon found out from my bf that we could get it out in the hallway outside of our room but not in our room. Okay it's an old building I can deal. Then they had window units for the AC in the room. Yes, I know it's Chicago but come on. It was fine the first couple of days cuz it was cool outside but when it heated up, there was no way to get comfortable. All the unit did was spew out uncooled air from outside. We slept in our own sweat. gross... That was the thing we should have brought up immediately. Also as a hotel they should have central air and heating, but hey. We liked the hotel and the staff but the air and the wifi need some work. We MIGHT come back but there is no guarantee.
