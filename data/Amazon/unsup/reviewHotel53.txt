I really liked the location and the building is super cute and rustic but that's about it as far as the positives go. Each and every single time my boyfriend and I left the room, we could not get back in using our keys. We know not to keep them near cell phones, etc. so something is amiss with their key/lock systems. It was quite annoying having to go all the way up our 4th floor room only to have to go back down to get another key, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm not exaggerating. Also, the furnace or whatever it was (sorry, I'm a FL girl so I have no idea what it's called) seemed to work only when it wanted and it got extremely hot in the room at times. Each night we had to leave the the window open so the temperature was tolerable, but even opening the window didn't work very well. After alerting the front desk to our issues, they simply shrugged it off and said it should be working. This place wasn't expensive, but I've stayed in equally inexpensive places and never had these issues. I think I will pick somewhere else when staying in Lincoln Park.
