First the good: 1. Great location. Very close to Michigan Ave, where all the stores & restaurants are, and the river. It's a beautiful walk from this hotel to the river and other locations. Navy pier is a 20 minute walk. 2. The hotel is huge, could be a plus or minus for some, for me it didn't make a difference. 3. Extremely nice staff at check in 4. River view if you are on a high floor and if you get a room with a view (duh) 5. Could be great value if you get a low rate The bad: 1. The person who designed the lay out of the bathroom should be fired. The toilet paper holder (w/ the toilet paper naturally) was behind the toilet. That was really annoying as you can imagine. The water pressure was bad. They had a curtain instead of a glass door in the shower. The sink was not comfortable to use. 2. Parking was extremely expensive - $50 per night. 3. No refrigerator. If you open the mini bar and take something out, even without opening it, you get charged because the bar is activated by a motion sensor. 4. Kind of felt like they nickled and dimed you for everything. 5. Bad TV channels, nothing to watch, no HBO. 6. The coffee shop down stairs was expensive, but I guess it's not the hotel's fault. 7. No pool. Overall, I am not sure if I would have stayed here over another similar hotel in the same price range, but if the price was low I would stay here just because the location is so great. Tip: "like" their FB page and you could get discounts for the room and/or parking and you can even make requests.
