I was going on a booze cruise Saturday night and didn't want to drive. I had made the reservation about a month ago, but didn't realize that the LaSalle run was on Sunday. The place was packed to the rafters. I checked in at 3:45 and the line was pretty long but it moved quickly. I asked for a king size because I was told on the phone that doubles were the only thing available. I was very suprised when they gave it to me with a full bar and living room overlooking Grant Park. Score! I was going to put the bag full-o-liquor in the washroom. I called everyone over for a pre-boat party. We almost didn't make it. The room was nice. It had a bed that folded into the wall? It was a little low, but very comfortable. The decor? Hmm. A little dated. I know that they spent 185 million 22 years ago to gut the joint. But. It's 07 going on 8. Spring for some curtains at least. What would Paris say? But, who am I to bitch. I just got jacked up. It's a beautiful hotel. Just not as nice as the competition. And that list keeps growing.
