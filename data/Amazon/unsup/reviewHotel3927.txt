Stayed here for the U2 concert in 2009 at Soldier Field. Our first room was okay, if you're fine with less-than-lukewarm water. We called down the the front desk to tell them about it. No one came up to check on the situation after 45 minutes, so we called again. Lo and behold, 20 minutes later, a maintenance guy shows up, saying he was checking on the wrong room. He checks our hot water, which was about 70 degrees and asks us if that's okay. Maybe for the end of a shower...so we got another room, 10 floors up. This room had hot water, and frightening paintings on the wall. Naturally, we covered them up with towels.  I had high hopes for this hotel, with it being fairly old and having some history to it. But the fiasco that went on with our rooms, and the non-stop strike that seems to be going on outside the hotel let us down. That and it was ridiculously expensive for what we got.
