My partner was offered a free night here, which we spent this weekend. Overall, our stay was fine. But nothing exceptional. Our room was oddly arranged, with the TV facing the desk and the chairs facing the bed and nothing facing the view. The chairs were highly uncomfortable, too. Also, $13 for a small pot of coffee in your room? LAME. I found the lobby rather ugly. It was nice to stay here, but I won't recommend it.
