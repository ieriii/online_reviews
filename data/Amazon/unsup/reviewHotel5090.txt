We really liked this hotel during our recent stay in Chicago. Very upscale and beautiful. My only issues were that the duvet covers on the beds were missing so it had one sheet on top and one on the bottom with out any other covers. Additionally, the blinds didn't pull down and we were up early with the sun in our east facing room. The computer screen without an off button was also a challenge to sleeping. Otherwise a great stay.
