My favorite hotel in Chicago! The service is EXCELLENT! They will help you up the elevator, walk you to your room, ask if there is anything you need, anything at all. And where else can you order room service @ 3am? Love those turkey croissant after a long night. Gorgeous, large rooms- great city views. Wonderful linens. Spa bathrooms. Impeccable service. Underground valet parking. Gotta love it.
