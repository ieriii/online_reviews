I found this place online while looking for a good rate for a bachelorette party for my girlfriend. We loved it. The colors are bright and cheery, the beds were SUPER comfy and the staff was really nice. It was also ridiculously convenient (literally half a block) to the Gold Coast bar scene, which is where we were headed for the party. We wanted local Chinese takeout and the staff was really nice about giving us menus and recommending somewhere local. We called and asked for more towels (there were plenty for two, but not for the four of us) and they were brought up immediately. Parking was $39, which is pretty reasonable fr 24 hours downtown. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to a friend. I'm not sure why people complained about the "beach theme" - I liked it and I think it would be welcome in the bleak Chicago winters especially!
