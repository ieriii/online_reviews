I really liked it! It's a beautiful old piece of Chicago history. I stayed there just this week for the fist time ever, and was immediately glad I didn't spend the extra money for a boutique version of a national chain hotel. Our room was clean and inviting, the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly and the location at the price is excellent. Call me a nerd, but if you research a bit of it's back story, it's really a neat destination. It is an 1893 building that has hosted numerous celebrities, notorious historical figures, and presidents. Complete with interesting, outdated (yet well-made and likely very expensive at it's time) decor, it is a must. You can hardly walk through it without picturing yourself in a completely different era, and not many places can boast that.
