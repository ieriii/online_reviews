This place is unique and great. I was here for 5 days and had I been at a lesser hotel, it would have really worn me out by the end. Instead, the bed was so fantastic that I slept like a baby and didn't really feel the traveling effects that set in after day 2. My only complaint is that the bathroom was tiny. I mean, really, really small. When I sat down on the toilet, I had to rest my arm on the top of the sink because I was so squished. GREAT place
