This place has a ton of perks! - It is in a prime location in Chicago - Clean and cozy hotel rooms - Free WiFi - Molton Brown shower products and lotions - Attentive and friendly staff - Late night menu - DVR is a nice lil' bonus - Quiet - Strong AC units in the rooms ...Overall, I had a really good experience at this hotel. I would stay here again.
