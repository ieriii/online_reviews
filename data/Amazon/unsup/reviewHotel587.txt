Because I think Peter W's comment below is quite misleading, I wanted to make clear that I never had any conversations with him. The extent of the explanation provided to me of the issues is in full pasted below. I remain very interested in hearing what the alternate explanation of the power situation. All I have been given is a carefully worded response hinting that the issues were MINE. I believe I am very much owed this as a matter of customer service. Email received from event staff of PUBLIC: Dear Jeff, Thanks for your time on the phone yesterday. I am sorry that you had trouble with the sound for the party and with the bathroom incident in your guest room. Because I would really like you to return to the hotel and hopefully keep us in mind for other events or hotel needs, we would be happy to waive the cost of the speakers completely. Everyone seems to have a different story but I enjoyed working with you and would like to do so in the future. I will have a revised invoice sent next week when accounting returns. Happy Holidays and please let me know if I can be of further assistance.
