There are many, many bars and clubs all around Chicago and I haven't been back at the same place as much as I've been to this place. First, I love the artsy atmosphere. It's decorated like a museum with huge paintings and interesting photography everywhere. I guess I love the minimalistic style. I also love that they have a large area and a bunch of smaller areas so you have option to mingle with strangers or be with your friends. Second, I've been there both Fridays and Saturdays and they seem to have a good selection of DJ's that DJ there on a regular basis. The ceiling in the main room is pretty high so the sound obviously is amplified there but the music selection is great so who cares. Plus, it's a bar so it's supposed to be loud? Third, their bartenders, both female and male, are attractive which I consider to be a huge plus and a draw. Who doesn't need eye candy when they go out to bars? Bartenders and servers were all very friendly and accommodating so that's a major add as well. Even their food was delish!!!!
