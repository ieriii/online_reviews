Right off the magnificent mile, cheap, but seriously outdated. Friends stayed in the room next to the fire escape, and they heard every time someone used it. Our room was bigger, a bit ifs better view but the windows are extremely drafty. Took forever for the heat to kick in. Elevator shook the whole way up & is tiny! Front desk staff wasn't very patient & I have no idea where my car had been parked for the night.
