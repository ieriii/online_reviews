I was upset about not being told i had to pick my vehicle up from valet by 2pm the following day. We went to pick it up at 3:30 and were charged an additional $20 (a total of $70 for less than 24 hours of parking!) The parking attendant woman kept saying their sign says to pick the car up by 2pm. We NEVER saw any signs because we used the valet at the hotel. While $20 isn't that much money it still left us with a bad taste in our mouths about the hotel. This hotel was clean, staff was friendly, but the bathrooms were very small. It's an older hotel so a lot of things weren't up to date. I can only give this hotel 3 stars at best.
