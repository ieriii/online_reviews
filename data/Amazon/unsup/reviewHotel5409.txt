My husband and I stayed in this hotel on the night of our marriage. We had actually just booked a small room, but were surprised to find out that they had upgraded us to a penthouse suite at no extra charge. This was a nice thing for the hotel to do, and not something that you can find at most large hotel chains. Customer service like that is unique to boutique hotels like the Whitehall, and we will definitely be staying with them again.Thank you,Elyse
