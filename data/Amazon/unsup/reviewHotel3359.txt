Pros: the location is stellar (right on Michigan Ave, by Grant Park & Millennium Park, and an easy walk downtown), beds are uber-comfy, rooms are clean, staff is very friendly, and they have a big pool & exercise room Cons: the initial price is pretty cheap for a downtown hotel (we paid $80/night), but the additional fees were kind of bogus -- $36 for mandatory valet per day/night, and an additional fee for holding our bags past check out time (I've never been charged for this before at any of my previous hotel stays).. after tacking those on, the "low" price wasn't as big of a draw Overall: I'd definitely stay here again for comfort & convenience, though I'd look around for cheaper prices
