Service is impeccable! :-) Here for the NRA convention - glad we pick this hotel. Very convenient to McCormick Convention Center! Staying for 3 more nights so maybe this is a "premature" review. However, if I don't rate it now, I'll forget! LOL. Love the "energy" of the staff here! Locked myself out of my bathroom though (ooops) -- apparently the way the handle of the lock hits the wall when you open it automatically "locks" you out, but the handy person came immediately and fixed the problem instantly. This is a "common" problem, he said. He even thank me for choosing Hyatt and "keeping him employed". What a gem! :-)
