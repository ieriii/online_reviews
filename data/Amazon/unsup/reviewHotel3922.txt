Fantastic location, especially during Lollapalooza 2007. The service is top-notch and the room is quite comfortable. In our double bed room, there was no mini-bar. No big deal, though. There was, instead, plenty of room, a flat screen TV, a roomy-enough bathroom and ample lighting. Downstairs you'll find a game room, a bar/lounge, a restaurant and a gift shop. There's also access to Internet, if you fork over the monies. The lobby, along with the room, is clean. This place has character. If you prefer to stay in super upscale places with a modern touch, don't book your room here. This place is full of history and class. And after a long day at Lollapalooza, the bright, red sign "Hotel Congress" beckons warmly... It's definitely a nice place to stay. After all, Grant Park is nearby. You're also within walking distance of great places to eat - whether you're looking for a smoothie stop, deli, pub or authentic deep-dish pizza. Also, if you want the L, you're only a mere couple blocks from the Red Line. You can't go wrong with Hotel Congress.
