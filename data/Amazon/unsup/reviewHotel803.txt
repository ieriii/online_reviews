I've stayed at this hotel a couple of different times for short stays. It's a nice spot on Michigan Ave and close to shopping, food, etc. The gym is very small for this size of hotel, but works. The last time I stayed here I got upgraded to a three room suite that was very nice. Overall I would come back here next time I am in Chicago.
