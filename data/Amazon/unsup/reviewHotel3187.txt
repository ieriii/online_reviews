oh my cheese! could the lobby bar be any more cheesy? when i showed up recently to stay the night it was about 7:30 on a saturday night. the lobby was full of the following: -some sort of teen beauty pageant contestant complete with tiara, tears of joy and full trashy family posse -large gathering of high end, hip hop mogul wanna be's, sunglasses at night and brightly colored leather jackets...i swear i saw the gotti brothers there -skanky suburban young ladies dressed in flashy, low cut tops with bad hair and boy band beaus in tow BUT, once i exited the "lobby" and got to my room, it was all better. the rooms are small but nice and i love the beds...good sheets, nice decor, decent shower and bathroom, LOVE THE VIEW! and the bliss products....can't beat that lemon sage body butter, can't beat it so all in all, i like it, just don't go to the lobby if you don't have to - oh, and i LOVE the shop they have on the main level....so many cute things! i bought the CUTEST coat ever, i adore it, and so i will always remember the W......p.s. if you HAVE to go to the lobby bar late at night to meet a friend and have a drink as i did....then please order the cheeseburger, it's mighty good and the fries too, that helped :)
