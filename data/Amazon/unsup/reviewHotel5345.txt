I like to stay in unique, one-of-a-kind hotels that give me a feel of the city/country I am in. That was my only hesitation for choosing to stay at the Hampton Inn - a chain. But we decided to go for it for 3 reasons... Location (walking distance to downtown, the river, Mag Mile and free trolley to Navy Pier), Free breakfast (huge choices and rotating hot entrees that changed each of the 6 days we were there), Pool and jacuzzi and small, but adequate fitness center (to relax after a busy day and keep up with our exercise routines). We got that and so much more. This renovated hotel has a lobby that made me forget it is a chain - tastefully done in Frank Lloyd Wright style - beautiful! Every staff person we met - front desk, conceirge, kitchen, housekeeping were so friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable (true, the firetrucks can wake you up now and then...) The convenient and free business center made it easy to print our boarding passes and keep up with the kid's homework and the free in-room wifi was great. Very reasonable price for the location, value, and quality you receive. I wanted to live here! Now my only hesitation is telling everyone how great it is and risk not having a vacancy next time I go to Chicago!
