I stayed here with my Husband while he was attending a conference. The hotel is quite large and rightfully has plenty of quick elevators and a few escalators. There are a few bars, one of which has a great view and is decorated with a subdued elegance. The other is quite funky and boasts bright colors and a more retro vibe. The rooms are large and the bed was super comfortable. The location is great, off the beaten path enough to be quiet but right next to the "Magnificent Mile" and the Pier. We had an issue with a phantom phone that, for no reason that I can find, turned itself on to speaker mode and blasted the dial tone in the middle of the night. Three times. The manager stared at me blankly and apologized. Um, care to offer us another phone or perhaps send up a repair man? The gym fee is not included in the price of your hotel stay, which is a pretty big turn off for us. Luckily, the weather was nice enough for a run outdoors and that run was much more enjoyable and memorable than a hotel treadmill could ever be. So if you keep up with your workouts while on the road, consider the additional gym fee. Overall, the hotel is in great shape and I can deal with a freaky phone but the gym fee is downright nasty.
