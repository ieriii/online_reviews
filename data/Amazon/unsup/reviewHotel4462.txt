The Palmer House is a beautiful, classic Chicago hotel. The lobby is spectacular and the rooms are always spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The staff is friendly and I have had 2 good stays here -- once for work and once on vacation.  The reason that I am giving three stars is that I can't believe that they don't have free wi-fi. In fact, they don't have wireless internet at all!! I understand that the hotel is a classic, old building but if you have electricity and running water, there is no reason not to provide wireless internet. And at they prices they charge for one night, it just doesn't make any sense. During my most recent stay here, I decided that I would just suck it up and pay for the wired internet in the room to do some work only to find that the cord was broken and wouldn't stay connected to my computer without some MacGyver-like maneuvering with duct tape that I was just not in the mood for. Sigh.  As beautiful as this hotel is, I probably won't stay here again because of the internet situation.
