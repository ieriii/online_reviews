The hotel staff was less then helpful, the room was small with a cramped bathroom and the airconditioning didn't work well. the views were nice and the location is good. but the little things. we asked them to put something in the outgoing mail, took over a week for it to be sent. wtf? calling them on the phone results in getting hung up on. I would stay somewhere else, the cost doesn't metter the quality. skip it.
