Remember the cousin you had that was always loud, obnoxious, dirty, and drunk? The one that ruined every family gathering for all? You wouldn't wish this place on him.... that's how bad it is. There is a reason why it's half the price of other hotels in the area. As others have said, the staff IS very good. But they can't make up for the lack of eveything else. It's cold, dirty, run-down, and very, very noisy.
