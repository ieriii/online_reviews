Nice hotel, nice staff. My friend considered having her wedding here because they have so many different ballrooms and it is the quintessential Chicago hotel (and has lake views). The staff was friendly, especially the sales/banquet team and a woman by the name of Carolyn or something...can't recall. There is also a Chanel in the hotel...score!
