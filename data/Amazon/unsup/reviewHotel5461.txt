This place is in a really nice neighborhood of Chicago. The outside of it has many restaurants where people ate outside providing a great atmosphere at night.  There were only 2 elevators, which weren't very fast. The rooms were clean, but some of the stuff is really dated (the tv was CRT). Also, the room wasn't very spacious. The sitting chair is quite upright, and not comfortable to sit for extended periods (nice to look at tho). The good stuff is that they provide an umbrella, robe, bathroom is really nice (tub and shower - NICE), great toiletries, and the bed linens were quite nice. It is a great business hotel, and if you stay here, you'll feel pampered. The front desk staff is really nice, the doormen are also very nice. The Sutton Place comes recommended.
