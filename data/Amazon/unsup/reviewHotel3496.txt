Location and price were great, cant really beat it. The common areas of the hotel (lobby, bar, lounge, etc) are pretty nice, although the bar doesnt open until later in the day. Their bloody maries are horrible, def NOT recommended. In order to get to the rooms, you have to use 2 separate elevators which can be just a tad annoying. The rooms are clean yet tiny, bathrooms are excellent offering the usual stuff and a large walk in shower, closets large, and the sound insulation sufficient. I wouldnt recommend this place for business travelers, however for a quick getaway weekend this place fills the need.
