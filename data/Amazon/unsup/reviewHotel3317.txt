Love the bar here. The atmosphere is super chill and the bartenders are awesome. They had killer specials on St. Pats including $7 carbombs, $6 Irish smashers, and $5 Guiness drafts. They definitely know how to double pour a Guiness here..the head was poured to perfection. We ordered the sliders, which for $12 was good, but not great. They were served on a pretzel bun (good start), but they described them as being "Kobe beef" sliders and I just didn't find the quality of the burger to be at the same level of some other Kobe beef burgers I had in Chicago (Sweets & Savories has an incredible Kobe burger by the way). Regardless, the service is superb, and drinks are strong, so will definitely be going back.
