M husband, our dog (extra $75) and I stayed at The James for 1 night on Christmas Eve. We understand that the hotel might be running on skeleton crew but these are the things that happened that should not have for $199 a night: 1) Bathtub did not drain, had to call hotel to fix it. They did but left the tub dirty and took away our bath mat without replacing it. 2) Hotel was NOT full at all, but housekeeping left the cleaning supplies cart outside of our room unattended for half the day. 3) We were not told about a complimentary breakfast deal until I picked up a postcard at the front desk. 4) We were provided a comp breakfast card (for a full breakfast) at that time, and was told to redeem it the next morning at the restaurant. BUT found out the next morning that the restaurant is actually closed, after sitting at the restaurant for 10 min waiting. 5) We were then told that the comp breakfast can be ordered to be delivered to our room, but it will be continental only. 6) Breakfast arrived at our room, with $54 on our bill. We called the front desk and they took it off. 7) The milk they gave us was spoiled.
