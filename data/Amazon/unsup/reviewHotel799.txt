it's just that it's crowded. i think that's really it the rooms aren't bad, though a little smaller. but it's a downtown hotel, at maximum capacity, all the time. as long as you don't need any servicing for anything, it's fine. but if you want anything (fix the shower), be prepared to wait an hour, or (i need deoderant) it may not come at all
