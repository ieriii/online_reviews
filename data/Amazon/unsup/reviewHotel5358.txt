I had a wonderful time staying the the Wheeler Mansion Hotel Chicago. The accommodations were exquisite, quiet and clean. The new manager, Stephanie, made sure all my needs were met. It was perfect for me as I was attending a McCormick convention which is only one block away with plenty of bus/taxi transportation.
