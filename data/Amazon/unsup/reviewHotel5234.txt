One of the cheapest hotels in downtown Chicago. If you need a place to sleep and not much else then this is for you. The rooms are small and the walls paper thin. You hear everything which forced me to explain some sounds coming from next door to my 6 year old. Not the conversation I wanted. The place was clean for the most part but the hotel shows its age and there are virtually no amenities. There is free wifi but it is sooo slow. The attached restaurant is so bad it's almost funny. Avoid it at all costs.
