The Drake is famous, and justifiably so. The lobby is relatively small, but more importantly it is tasteful and refined. No riff-raff lounging around as in New York's Waldorf=Astoria. However, some of the aspects of the Drake that can be cited for their traditional charm, such as the mirrored elevators with their upholstered benches, also betray the need for some updates. Service, including check-in, was as it should be-- quick, seamless, and nearly invisible. The rooms are highly variable, but even the standard ones are large enough. Quality everything, from bedding to bath supplies, but some things felt a bit in need of an update, such as the carpet and chair upholstery. It's possible to be traditional without being fusty. Where the Drake really shines the most, though, are in its restaurants. The Palm Court is a true delight. Beautiful room and furnishings, delicious tea and food (it's far more than it initially looks), impeccable service, and a harpist. It's quiet and relaxing while being social. Even if you don't stay at the hotel, come for the tea. Breakfast at the Drake Bros was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had, with an enormous selection and, again, impeccable service. You get the privacy you want, too. Considering the price and the reputation, this is everything you expect. No less, but not much more, either.
