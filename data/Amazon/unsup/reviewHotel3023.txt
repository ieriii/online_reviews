The service at the w is the worst. Checking in no porter or bell man. Checked in at the front desk and told the lady. She said would you like help with your bags. I said absolutely and told her no one was out front to help. Waited. No one shows up. I take them myself. Concierge is totally unhelpful and completely overwhelmed. The front desk, they live here but don't know where anything is. I just travel advisor it or google map it. Unreal. The wave restaurant is opposite. Food is delicious and service is excellent!!! Checking out, waited 25 minutes for luggage assistance and guess what no one shows up and again I take it downstairs myself. I tell the front desk again. They say they'll send someone up and again I bring the luggage down myself. Worst service in this hotel.
