I've been meaning to review The James for almost a year now. My husband and I stayed here the night of our wedding. We, being designers, wanted to stay in a modern hotel. After doing a little online research, I found The James and it looked like a place that we would love! OMG, The James was heaven! We stayed in the penthouse. It has beautiful walnut furniture, walls and floors. The bathroom is all marble. I love the combination of walnut and marble. It's full of designer furniture, clean lines, flush closets, pocket doors and beautiful materials. The concierge knew that it was our wedding night, so when we walked in, completely exhausted after a long, but wonderful day, there was some cool lounge music playing lightly throughout the room and there was a bottle of champagne on ice and a nice little tray of cookies. We proceeded to enjoy our champagne while enjoying the wonderful view of the city. And then, like the design nerds we are, we completely examined all the well-designed features of every nook and cranny of that room. The interior design is really great. I want my condo to look exactly like that someday. And I want to have my iPod streaming music through every room! Even their music selection was totally us. The bathroom was awesome: big, clean shower, huge, marble bathtub complete with an LCD TV. They have Kiehl's bath products. It was all just so beautiful! We also ordered room service. We filled out a little card and hung it on our door before we went to bed. And at our requested time, they delivered our breakfast and we ate it at the dining room table while, once again, enjoying the amazing view of the city. Check out time wasn't until 2:00 so we milked that one! We wanted to stay there as long as possible! I'd like to move in :)
