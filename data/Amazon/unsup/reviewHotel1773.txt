I have never rented a room here, but I have been here about a dozen times for different events - birthdays, political events, and most recently, a luncheon for a newly appointed judge. No matter what the event, I have been very pleased at the event space at this hotel. The food has always been good, and even though the place doesn't blow me away, the nice convenience of having it downtown is a plus. Every event I have attended is in the ballroom on the lobby floor, and although it is not a giant space, it has a great old school charm to it that many of the newer hotels do not have.
