4 stars for the music and venue 3 stars for the crowd! This past weekend was the second time I've had the pleasure to visit. The music is what made it for me...a great jazzy house set by a DJ I can't remember (sorry). But def good! Although the crowd was very unapproachable and three quarters of them stood around and mingled it was a good place to people watch.  I would have expected it to be much more happening on a Saturday night. Maybe next time?
