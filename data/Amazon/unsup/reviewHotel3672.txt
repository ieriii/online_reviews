Well, it is know for being the RItz carlton of Chicago, and had played the host to Diana, Monroe, Sinatra but those were years ago. Saying that you had staryed at the Drake is cool to flaunt to your friends, but at some point where you are at the intersection of classic, chic, prestigous and quality driven, meets old, in need of repair, and dated, you have a slight problem. Chicagos architectural splendor is all around and the Drake still looks cool, but the stay is only for those who are willing to spend money for a name and a Burger, not a quality stay. I would stay at the swiss instead of the Drake. it is still a must see for the city though and when you are coming down into the city and pass the playboy building, its hard to miss.
