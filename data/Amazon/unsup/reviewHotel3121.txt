On a recent trip to Chicago, I stopped and asked a guy who looked surprisingly like Clark Kent what a fun place to go to was. He said the W and, naturally, we trust Superman. Off we were on our adventure. In the cab, my cohorts and I are throwing out some mojo to the cab driver. He laughs and is in love with us. He says, in a creepy tone, "You guys like to have fun?" We reluctantly answer, "yes." He pulls over and starts rummaging around. "Great," I think to myself, "we're gonna get offered coke." Imagine my surprise when he busts out a card with an address underneath a silhouette of a topless girl. "This is a great club," he says, "a very PRIVATE and EXOTIC club. You will have fun here." Uhh... We finally stumble upon the W. We mingle, we talk, we have fun. It's a great looking, very sleek bar. Like out of the Jetson's or something. Upstairs there's another small club. The drinks are weak and expensive (just like the rest of Chicago, what the fuck), but that's what you get at a hotel bar where you have absolutely no juice. Later on in the night, I meet some German dode and he explains, "jaah, the gurrlz weell bee coming in soon, jaah." I am a little exasperated, "Girls?" "Jaah, zee gurrls, you pay, kroners." Great, just great. The W: fun bar, just watch out for hookers!
