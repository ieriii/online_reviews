I was a little weary of staying at The Drake Hotel after reading the reviews here on yelp, and seeing how they tended to be all over the map. I was pleasantly surprised though! The Drake is charming hotel, with a very helpful and courteous staff. It is very centrally located to some great shopping, dining, and cultural attractions. One downside is that there is no free wi-fi in the rooms. The hotel is pretty luxurious, but has a little bit of that old school vibe (or charm).
