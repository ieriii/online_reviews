The location of this hotel is excellent. It is one block from N Michigan Avenue and around the corner from one of the best pizza restaurants in the country. You cannot do much better in the city of Chicago. The only negative (and it is a small one) is that it is close to Northwestern Hospital, so there are a lot of sirens in the area.  The staff of the hotel was incredibly friendly and helpful. The doorman quickly hailed a cab for us, walking down to the corner to do so.  The room was clean and bright. Wi-fi worked good. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels. I had a corner suite and I found that the room was rather drafty (hence 4 stars instead of 5). I had to turn the heat up higher than I normally like to in order to compensate for the draft.
