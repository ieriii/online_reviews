Wonderful common areas and exterior facades make the Drake a historic and popular stopping point along the Magnificent Mile. The rooms and conference venues are acceptable, if not exceptional, but the real stars here are the Palm Court and the bars and restaurants. It's a nice base of operations for exploring downtown Chicago.
