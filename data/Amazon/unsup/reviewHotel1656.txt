A little older, but still charming. I got a suite once with two bathrooms and one had a jacuzzi tub, which I took advantage of. Big comfy bed! Their evening wine hour is cozy, and casual offering beer wine. Sometimes, servers circulate with little bites. I tried the Zumba class once, which was a fun work out with 8 or so other women (including a couple Kimpton staff). They had pitchers of water in the back of the room. As other Yelp reviewers have noted, it can be cramped, but seems like a decent room rate for its location and excellent Kimpton service.
