5 star views. 4 star room. 2 star noise. 1 star parking charge. Spent 2 nights here last week an averall had a very good experience. Let's start with the bad though. I know parking in Chicago sucks, but 45$ a night? Felt like I was just throwing money away. Now the great...got a room on the 37th floor with a river view - spectacular. Great river view-decent northward view - see pics. The location is also great - near the Loop, River North and Mich. Ave. 4 Blocks to Art Institute. The morning noise was pretty bad starting at about 8am. LOUD shuddering construction going on somewhere across the hall. nOt good but we left each day by 10am so not intolerable. Room was $184 a night.
