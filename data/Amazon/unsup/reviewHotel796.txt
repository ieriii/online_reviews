The hotel itself was nice, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was convenient to shopping. If not for the following inconveniences and lack of service, I would probably give it 4 stars: Check-in was a huge hassle because I unwittingly used http://getaroom.com, when I thought I was calling the hotel directly. Eventually, after waiting over 20 minutes, the people at the desk were willing to put a hold on my credit card while they waited for http://getaroom.com to get back to them about my reservation, which was already paid for. But they could have done that from the start, rather than making me stand in the lobby for all of that time. Also, I was told internet would be free in my room. It asked to charge me at log on, so I called to the front desk. they told me to accept the charges, and assured me that I would not be charged. At check-out, the charge was on my invoice. The person at the counter printed me a new invoice, and assured me I would not be charged. Two days later, I notice that my bank account has been charged $13 for internet usage. I am now waiting for the hotel to refund it. In addition, very early on Sunday morning, the housekeeping attempted to open my door, because I forgot to put up a "do not disturb" sign. I thought that was rude and I am glad that I had latched the interior door lock, otherwise she would have walked right in. Also, be aware that parking is $60 per day and valet only. When I got my car, the window was rolled halfway down on the passenger side, which makes me believe it was probably left that way all night.  Overall, not the worst hotel I have stayed at, the room was clean and comfortable, and the location and price were ok, but the service really kind of sucked.
