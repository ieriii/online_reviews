I've stayed at several Kimpton hotels and I'm a big Kimpton fan. This one had good service, nice lobby and they quickly brought a yoga mat after I requested it.  The room and decor seem a little long in the tooth, very small and some of the snacks in the minibar (you get 2 up to $10 free when you're an in touch member) were out of date (blech!) Not my favorite Kimpton, but they definitely had the lowest price of the Kimptons in Chicago while I was visiting.
