My first review of a hotel. Had a really great experience at the Dana. The entire staff was so attentive, from the door man to the receptionist to the waiter. Good location. good deal. I booked on Tablet & got some nice perks like 10am check in & 4pm check out so felt like I really got money's worth by being there a full 1.5 days. Didn't try the complimentary breakfast, but it's a nice plus, right? Best part was when I came back to the room one night totally hammered I wasn't even tempted to break into all the amazing looking snacks because there were 2 chocolate covered fortune cookies waiting on my pillow. Bonus! Note: if you share a room, make sure it's with a significant other: the shower is a glass panel open to the entire room.
