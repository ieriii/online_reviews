I was pretty disappointed with the hotel. I discovered bugs in the bathroom and in the bedroom. The breakfast on the 40th floor is not worth the money because the area where you eat is dirty and littered with bugs on the window sill. My main problem is currently my trying to get back the $50 in valet fees they have charged me. I flew in and did not check a vehicle in. Yet, on my bill was an additional charge for $150. It took me two separate times with two different people to get that $150 removed. It is just this past weekend that I discovered that they still charged me $50. I have left messages. Called several times only to be directed to voice mail and now sent an email hoping to resolve this matter. This is the first time I have been disappointed with a Crown Plaza and do not intend on ever staying there again while I am in Chicago.
