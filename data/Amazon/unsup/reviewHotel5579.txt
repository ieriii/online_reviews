Westins are great for business or pleasure and this one is good for both. It is centrally located to a lot of business - right across the river from Wacker, which is a short walk across the bridge. It's also walking distance to tons of great restaurants. Nice sized gym, clean rooms, free wifi in the lobby and there is a beautiful courtyard. This property could use a facelift in my opinion and could benefit from a good restaurant inside. Other than that, it's an excellent option for Chicago.
