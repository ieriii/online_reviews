I stayed here several years ago and was not impressed by anything but the location, which is on Michigan avenue and its cheap(er) price. It was New Year's Day and we were happy and surprised to have found the room. Though it is far from the main tourist drag up north, it is next to two art museums: the Art Institute and the Museum of Contemporary Photography. It's also close to State Street, and a few blocks from the lake. Thus the two stars. More recently I went here for a wedding. Must have been a great cheap deal. I must have stayed here a long time ago, because this place has really gone down from even the basic quality I remembered. The first thing you get to see is a bunch of strikers picketing. A few people at the reception were grumbling about having to cross that line, and I heard later that was because they were union themselves. I was told that to cross a picket line is an insult against the strikers and makes a particular political statement. Despite the strike, which apparently has been going for a while (their strike signs looked worn) the place is operating, but not fully. There was an escalator going up to the hall that did not work. There were toilets that did not work and were covered with plastic. You could tell these items had been not functioning a while. The place could have been cleaner, maybe it just needed some paint. The food at the reception was ok, but even in the dimmed lights you could see that even the mashed potatoes had been made carelessly: they were dark and oxidized.  Just a small careless error, a detail, but it was another piece in the puzzle. They could have tried harder. Congress neglects their building the details and apparently their employees too. Overall, I'd describe the place as worn and depressing.  Someone should buy this place and fix it up; take advantage of its location. Has potential. As they say in real estate "fixer upper". Needs some TLC.
