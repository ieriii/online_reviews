Like all of the other W properties, I love the Acura "driving experience" chauffeur service (although the times at this property are rather limited). The rooms were spacious, a little bit bare/empty. There was a pocket sliding door from the room to the bathroom. If you're visiting as a new couple, keep in mind that the bathroom doesn't provide much "sound privacy". I love how they kept the old fashioned mail drop by the elevators. Lobby was very noisy. Check-in area was rather small. I was there for an event, the 2nd level "foyer" has weird ceiling heights, so keep that in mind when planning!
