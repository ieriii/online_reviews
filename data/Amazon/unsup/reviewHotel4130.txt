This is a nice enough hotel. I recently stayed here for 5 nights on a vacation and it was not a bad experience. Our room was, according to the girl at the front desk, recently renovated. I believe it, it was pretty swank and modern inside and had a nice view looking out at the river. The Bathroom was a good size. The afforementioned front desk employee was very nice. It was pricey, which is understandable given the location, but that price not does not include wi-fi. Very dissappointing. It may seem like a trifling complaint, but in this day and age wi-fi is as basic as cable tv in hotels. Also, housekeeping comes by very early, which is no big deal unless you forget to throw the "privacy" sign on the doorknob the night before in your drunken stupor. The location is very central and convenient to the all the train lines, but is more shoppy and businessy than anything. Not a lot of exciting bars in the area, but cabs and trains are everywhere so it doesn't really matter. Parking looked like a giant pain, the front check-in lot was always a tangle of poorly places vehicles. In short, not a bad hotel by any means but i will try someplace else next time.
