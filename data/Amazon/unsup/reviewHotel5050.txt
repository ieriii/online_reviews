This is the worse hotel we have ever had to deal with. Our friends received a special rate which was half the special rate that we received. The corporate office told us that the representatives at their 800 number do not know all the deals that are offered. So, our friends were lucky enough to get a representative that knew about the rate. We called the day before and the rates were already in their system. It is a joke. The people were rude and did not care about losing our business! I do not recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Chicago area!
