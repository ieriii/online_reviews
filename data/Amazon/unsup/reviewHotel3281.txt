Stayed at the hard rock hotel because the W was full and it was a good, central location. The rooms are nice and roomy though the hotel itself is quite cheeseball. Not overtly tacky but just being there left me feeling a bit of a poseur surrounded by impostors. The guys at the front desk were friendly and flirtatious and full of information. There were absolutely no mishaps despite my preference to pay in cash up front. The rooms are large. The bed is super comfy. Pillows were perfect. The bathroom was nice but no tub. I could see the Bean and Millenium Park through my window (and through the skyscrapers). If it wasn't a cheesy hard rock hotel I'd highly recommend it.
