This fine property is in the Gold Coast/Rush Street area. The hotel is not that large as far as number of rooms, yet it is contained in a glossy highrise. Its nice rooms have a cool and contemporary look to them, and each bathroom has a bathtub and a separate glass shower stall. The modern lobby is smallish, but perhaps to push you towards its extremely popular Whiskey Bar & Grill.
