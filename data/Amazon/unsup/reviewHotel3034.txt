Wow....We have been very pleasantly surprised by the W here in Chicago! Been here the last few days to catch a Cubbies game and are glad we stayed at the W. When we walked in this last Thursday night I had a flashback to walking into the first W in NYC on Lex in the late nineties!! The place was just buzzing! Music playing, people everywhere, a total scene. The Staff is EXCELLENT...I have a problem dealing with brain dead hotel people. The staff here actually appear to enjoy their jobs which reflects in how they treat their guests. The rooms are quite nice! LCD TVs, large comfy beds and a very nice view of the lake! We will definitely be checking back in next time we're in Chicago!!
