From the outside this hotel looks out of place compared to the newer buildings on magnificent mile but the decor inside was well done and the staff was really nice for the most part. The rooms are pretty small but I booked the hotel for a really good rate compared to other hotels on michigan ave so it wasn't one of my biggest complaints. My biggest complaint was the damn elevator! I think that this hotel has the worst elevator in all of Chicago, I was only on the 7th floor and it still took forever for the elevator to reach the floor. Although there was a computer room with free color printing, I would have loved to have wifi in the room as well. The bathroom was tiny and reminded me of those small bathrooms they have in most hotels in europe, with no bathtub and a really small corner shower. The gym was nice and had super clean equipment and free weights. It was always quite and had a great view of the city. What was great about the Allerton was the location, it was easy to get around and was close to most major attractions.
