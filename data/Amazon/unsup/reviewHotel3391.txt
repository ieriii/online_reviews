Just got back from our Honeymoon and both my hubby and I agreed to write an update on our wedding reception/weekend experience at the Allerton! The food = AMAZING..from our mother/daughter lunch at the M Lounge to our hordeuves, 1st, 2nd, 3rd courses, wedding CAKE (MMM!) and our brunch on Sunday in the Buckingham room...all of our family and friends cleaned their plates and had nothing but rave reviews about the food....delicious!!!!! Even this bride got a chance to enjoy each course thanks to a fabulous happy hour where I spent time mingling with our 140 guests while munching on baby lamb chops.. We are big foodies... :) Service = best I've ever seen at a wedding reception! The staff was on top of everything and the courses were served and removed with out anyone having to wait...food was hot and delicious and each table was eating at the same time as our head table was eating. No one was at need for a drink either ;) Great servers & bartenders! Hotel = gorgeous...what can I say? We had the most beautiful reception room (Tip Top Tap) and everything was how we had dreamed but MORE spectacular!! It surpassed our expectations and I am forever grateful to Beau B. for helping our vision come to reality. Oh and our wedding suite that night was amazing....we walked in to classical music playing, dimmed lights, rose petals leading to our bedroom, chocolate covered strawberries, delish & chilled champagne and even some slices of our wedding cake :) SO special!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only downfall? One elevator was out of service...but it gave us an excuse to use the stairs between floors 17-21 and gave us a little exercise from all of that food. :) THANKS ALLERTON! We love you guys and can't wait for our 1-year anniversary to see you again for breakfast in bed and a freshly made wedding cake! MMM..told you that we love our food ;)
