PUBLIC hotel is Ian Shregers project of transformation and new beginnings but is it all its cracked up to be? Or is it just a mirage in the shariah desert?  I booked PUBLIC hotel on http://bookaroom.com, loving the price and wanting to try something new besides the occasional Hyatt or Hilton. Being from Ohio and having lived in Los Angeles, I wanted something that was moderately priced, but had a trendy flair. As far as appeal, PUBLIC exceeded my expectations. I liked being greeted by men wearing trench coats and chuck Taylor's and being waited on by beautiful people in a Tom Ford add ( remember I did live in LA), however I felt a ltittle betrayed and left with slight bad taste in my mouth. Everything was great the free wifi throughout the hotel, the clean modern gym, the nice hospitality, but when I payed for the hotel two weeks ago, I thought that was only charge I was going to receive. They didn't mention that there was a 150 dollar holding fee and being that it was a debit card the funds were withheld. You can imagine how I felt when I found out that the card I was swiping for shopping and eating was running empty. When I approached the hotel they were very apologetic and handled the situation very timely. I understand there was a lack of communication and telling people that their is a holding fee is something that is not top of their list. I am really not here to beat down on PUBLIC hotel, throw a few punches yes. I just wanted to warn people of this fee because if this happens again and you caught say a "New Yorker" on a bad day, the hotel will not hear the end of it.
