The outside of the hotel looks like it belongs in a haunted movie. But inside, hotel is very cute (by that I mean, nice but very small rooms). I liked the decorations throughout the hotel. Overall, the room and hotel was very clean. I'm an OCD neat freak so this is very important to me. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I really loved the location of this place. It was within walking distance to great shops and food. This hotel is very unique (in a good way). I read the reviews before staying here, so it didn't surprise me that the rooms were small. The TV was in a very odd position, at the side of the bed, but we didn't come to Chicago to watch TV so this didn't bother me. The only problem we had was after the second night, both of our room keys stopped working. We went down to the front desk and they took care of us right away. I would stay here again.
