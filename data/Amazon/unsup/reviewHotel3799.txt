This is definitely a hotel in its beta launch phase and still needs to figure out some details on their service: In our first room the shower would flood the entire bathroom, but dont worry, they will give you a room with a leakproof shower if you ask for it:-) Our toilet in the first room also did not flush properly. Also, the roof deck they are talking about is not open yet, although promoted on their website & expedia. But these are the only reasons for deducting a star, other than that it was a great experience, especially because they made up in a great way for these little failures. This is what really makes me like them: Great friendly staff, in a very chique hotel (interior is modern & tasty, great coffee in the room), and in the end mistakes are just human. Admitting and knowing to apologize for them doesnt come naturally to most people and businesses, but they just do it. I also would love it if they had a pool, we had to stare jealously at the roof deck pools of our neighbours :-) But they told us they decided to go for a Spa instead. I think a pool would perfectly complement a Spa like this. The hotel is in a great location, the rooms are comfy, the interior of the rooms as well as the bar/restaurant downstairs is very modern, urban and tasty. Unfortunately we never ate there, its pretty pricey, also for the guests staying at the hotel. As for the hotel: You get great value for the price, if the rate does not exceed 300/night, everything beyond 330 is just too much for what it currently offers and right at the threshold of pain.
