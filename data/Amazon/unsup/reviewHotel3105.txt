Oh how I love the W. Have stayed here numerous times and have enjoyed every moment. Yes the rooms are small. But have you seen the view? We have been lucky enough to always get a lake view and it is just amazing. I have rearranged my schedule just so I could have a "hang out in the room" time in order to enjoy the bed. The sheets, the pillows...perfection. All but cured my sleeping problem. For that weekend anyway. I have frequented the bar in the lobby a few times, usually when I'm not staying there. It is sort of hit or miss. The drinks are always spot on, and it depends on the crowd. Sometimes there are the usual shiny guys in striped shirts and very tanned girls in tiny black tube dresses. Each to their own. Overall its usually a fun wind-down type of place. Oh and in nice weather, do check out the chairs outside. At night, with good friends, the Lake, a nice cocktail. Beautiful.
