We were part of a wedding block. Let's put it this way, I wouldn't pay full-freight for this place. Pros: 1. Great service. Guest services responded promptly to all requests. 2. Free Wifi. I wish every hotel had this. 3. Drinks in the bar were good and we had some small plates which weren't bad. Cons: 1. Place needs like two more elevators. At least. 2. Walls are paper thin. 3. Everything in the room is a bit "off". One of the lights in the bathroom (not a lot of light to begin with) went out. Twice. The bathroom door kept sticking. They gutted this building and they couldn't replace the bathroom door knobs/hinges? 4. Also (and this may sound strange), but they include a body lotion tube but not a shower gel? I feel like shower gels are the norm these days so I was surprised to see a bar of soap in the shower. 5. Did I mention they need more elevators? Just an FYI, as noted in the other reviews, the whole lobby basically turns into a club at night on Friday/Saturday.
