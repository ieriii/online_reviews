Location. Location. Location. This hotel sits on the ever famous Michigan Mile, and is within blocks of the red line and other trains. It's within walking distance of Grant Park, Dunkin Donuts, restaurants, shopping, banks, museums...do I keep going?  Size. Size.Size. Be warned, this is not your mom and pop hotel. It's massive. Conventions are held here year round. I stayed during some kind of a real estate banking gig, and I was almost swallowed by the seat of suits...not that I am complaining. Bigger is better, and in this case you can bet the farm on it. My room was spacious. 2 beds, and 2 matching bathrooms. Yup, 2 matching bathrooms! Girls need not worry about having to share sink space. The Extra's: Customer service was stellar. The housekeeping staff, the room service, the front desk, the bell hop, and even the guy opening my door and getting my cab. I was impressed. Originally, I checked into the 12th floor but was not too thrilled about the smoke smell in room. Not sure if the past guest was smoking or the 10th floor was creeping through my vent. I called the front desk and was moved promptly to the 17th floor. I appreciated the immediate attention to my concern.  The Filler: -1 star for $50 dollar for late check out fee to 1PM and $75 to 3PM. Yeah...wait what? I also didn't appreciate having to pay a $2 fee for each bag I stowed. It helped, but shouldn't this service be free? Nonetheless, this hotel is historic. It's spacious. It's old school. It's friendly. Respect the game, and enjoy the craziness. If you got the cash, stay here.
