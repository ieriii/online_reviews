I prefer the Westin River North, but this one on Michigan avenue is great if you need to be on Miracle Mile. The staff and amenities are fine, but the location (and shopping!) I think is what's best about it. There's no spa, sauna, steam room, etc., but they do have an ok gym, and in-room spa where an outside spa company sends a massage therapist or aesthetician to you. I'd always wanted to try this and it was definitely worth it (especially after a long business trip and being sick). The in-room spa probably runs about what you would pay at a regular one. The price of the rooms are comparable to other Westins and I got upgraded to a very nice room. The hotel restaurant (Grill on the Valley or something like that) was much better than other hotel restaurants and it was very lively.
