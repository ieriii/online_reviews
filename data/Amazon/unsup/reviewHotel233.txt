I LOVE staying at this hotel! The beds are always amazing and the staff is wonderful. Tom checked me in on my last trip--super nice guy who offered me a room even though it was prior to check in. He said if I didn't like the room I could wait for something else. Room was spacious and beautiful, but no view...and when I'm in Chicago, I need my view. Tom got me into a smaller room with great views of the Sears tower. Totally happy. Internet was included--yay--and if I have any complaint, it's that the parking is tough in that area and valet is too rich for my blood. I go here because it's cozy and friendly and makes me feel at home...i do not go there because the rooms are big. Its one of the best boutique hotels around and the location is second to none. Forgot to say...the above and beyond part was the fact that I was STARVING after traveling all day and could have eaten my shoe, I was so hungry. When Tom saw me eyeballing a plate of cookies and cakes (a staff reward for their high accolades on TripAdvisor) he kindly offered his cupcake to me. How nice was that!
