My first and last experience in a Sheraton. This is a review from 2009 but I was not yelping then and I feel that it is important that other people know about my experience. I was booked along with two other rooms for a conference, I am a student and we were traveling in a group. I had a room with another girl and we were taking a nap in between panels when someone walked into our room. Luckily we were awake enough to realize someone was walking in the woman said sorry and promptly left the room. Me and my roommate wondering what the hell is going on went out into the lobby talked to the woman and apparently they gave her our room after being there for two nights. We went to the front desk quite pissed off and even though all three rooms were booked at the same time according to them we only booked our room for the two nights. So without even knowing that we left or that the room was cleaned up our room was given away. The woman at the front desk was a bitch to say the least. She acted as if it was our fault and made us feel grateful that we were not being kicked out of the hotel. I wanted to choke her. The situation was fixed but the fact that someone just waltzed into my room pisses me off. Next year this conference is again being held at a Sheraton, I plan on staying at a different hotel. Also NOTHING was included at this hotel and at the time when looking at the website it gave the impression that things like pool and internet were.
