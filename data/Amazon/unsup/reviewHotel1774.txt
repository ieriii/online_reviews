Hotel Allegro, you've won us back. After our lackluster stay last year, the snob offered us a complimentary two-night stay in a king suite. We obliged. We arrived on Saturday October 10th. John at the desk was very nice and helpful. He answered a few questions I had about which streets would be closed with the marathon the next day. We headed up to our king suite! (I would've given five stars, but I had to take one away for the scary elevator experience. I heard others on the elevator say that had happened to them before....) Our suite was on the 18th floor. I'm not a big fan of elevators so being that high was a bit of an "oh crap" moment for me. Anyhow, we jump in the elevator with a bunch of others and head up. The elevator goes to four. Then three. No doors open. People start to panic. Then it goes back to four. Doors open. I hop right on out. There is no way I'm getting stuck on an elevator with a bunch of people! We truck it up the stairs to about the 12th floor and decide to either die on the stairs or try the elevator again. It's empty. Thank God. We get to the room.....awesome!! It has a huge bed, two rooms, two big tvs, a jucuzzi tub, and my favorite....Aveda bath products!! I changed and we headed back down the scary elevator for the free wine tasting! Yeah, that's right....freeeeee!! The white wine was delish! We had a couple of glasses and headed down to Encore to have an appetizer since we were a few hours early for our dinner reservation. The artichoke mozzarella dip is awesome! I loved it. We had a few drinks, scoped out Dennis Rodman who was also there, and headed out to dinner. We were really impressed with the staff, the room, and enjoyed our stay this time around! Even the bed-linens are superbly soft. Me likey. I'll be back.
