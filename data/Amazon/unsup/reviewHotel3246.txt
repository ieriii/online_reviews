I went here for a fundraiser last week. The appetizers were not very good, there was one bartender for the entire event so getting a drink was very difficult AND....the bathrooms are located right next to the kitchen doors (now I know!). I was coming out of the bathroom with a friend and BOOM a service lady plows through the doors knocks my friends drink out of her hand, her drink spills all over my fancy dress and all over and IN my Sam Edelman shoes. I think I will be sending them a bill....
