Ugh. Where do I start? I came for a conference and this place was significantly cheaper, so I took a chance and stayed here.... bad, BAD idea. The thermostat was broken, and it never got about 62F in the room - FREEZING! Can you imagine what it would be like if it were snowing?!?! WTF? You'd freeze your b@lls off! The rooms were moderately clean, but again, nothing impressive. I've you're looking for a good deal, go to the Inn of Chicago which is a block away. It's nicer with more competitive rates..... plus you won't freeze.
