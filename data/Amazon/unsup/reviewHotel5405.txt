I loved this hotel, the beds were super comfy, the room was larger than expected. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a comfortable stay in a great location in Chicago and would definitely stay there again. I'm only giving it 4 stars because as its an older building, the walls are thin and I could hear my neighbors alarm clocks in the morning; which didn't bother me as I wanted to be up and exploring Chicago anyway.
