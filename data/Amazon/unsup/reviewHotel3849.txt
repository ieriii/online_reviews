1) Great location. A couple of blocks from the El and surrounded by restaurants and bars. Walking distance to Rush St. and Michigan Ave. 2) Great rooms. Flat screen TV, iPod docking station, and lots of space. Loved the big shower, but the only concern might be the floor to ceiling windows looking across the way into an apartment building. Also, the see through shower to the toilet is definitely for the adventurous. 3) Most of the staff was great.....friendly, helpful, and curteous. Only one douche works there, and unfortunately he was working the front desk on my visit. If I had avoided the foreign guy during check in I would have given 5 stars.
