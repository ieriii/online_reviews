I did not know about the complimentary breakfast either :\ Either way, this boutique hotel was a great treat. I live in Boystown but decided to have a night away and stay at the James. I felt like I lived in the modern condo of my dreams with the room's decor. The Kheil's bath products were great for a little pampering. We requested that a lamp be fixed and an additional vanity kit be brought to our room and it was done when we arrived home that night.
