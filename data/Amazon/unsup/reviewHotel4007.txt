Great hotel! For what we paid (Priceline, HOLLA!) I thought this place was a steal. The location is perfect, too! Chicago winter aside, it was within walking distance to Millennium Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, Sears Tower, and like 50 million pizza places. Also, there's a bar downstairs and it's called BIG. You do the math on that one. ;)
