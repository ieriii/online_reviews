Pleased w/the hotel despite the initial biatchy front desk gal & the miscommunication about the type of room, got smoking. ICK!!!  Transferred into a non-smoking room after the first night & it was literally what the pillows stated, 'Sweet Dreams': -Lots of pillows -Neutrogena bath products -Fluffy towels -Chewy, warm walnut choco cookies, that STAY chewy. OMG. -Numi tea bags -Wolfgang Puck coffee -Super friendly doormen -Location, location, location. Check out was seamless & I wouldn't hesitate to book nights here again.
