Came here last night for the World of Chocolates AIDS Foundation event. The decorations were gorgeous. The food was only so-so though (except for the vegetarian chili. That was awesome!). Granted, they probably had outside catering... The cool thing about the event was that I got to sample a lot of chocolate AND I got to shake Governor Quinn's hand and take a picture with him (and my friend). Too bad I forgot to ask the photographer for her contact information... Would have loved to post that picture up here on Yelp. The hotel itself isn't bad. I probably came here at least three times in the past year. The first time I was working for a destination management company, and I had to show our guests where to go. I thought it was pretty easy to navigate throughout the hotel (though I suppose it does get a little confusing with some of the elevators). The second and third times, I came as a guest. The rooms were good (had a king-sized bedroom the first time, and two queen-sized beds in my room the second). I enjoyed the amenities. The concierge was also very knowledgeable about the dining places they recommended to us (although Mercat was a disappointment, as you may read in one of my reviews).
