This hotel is in a good area close to some of Chicago downtown's magnificent mile shopping and restaurants. The room was small with a little balcony overlooking the city, which was nice since it was cool out, we just kept that door open. The only thing that was a negative for me is that the room was very dusty. Looked clean otherwise, but dusty. The staff was very helpful and courteous. Overall I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again.
