I stayed here for a conference and was happy with all aspects of my stay. The building was beautiful and being inside McCormick Place made life much easier. I enjoyed great service from start to finish - the doorman, bellman, front desk, concierge and room service. The room was a good size and clean. Best of all, I had an excellent view of the Chicago skyline from my room. I did find the room a bit noisy at night though, which made it difficult to sleep. I also want to bestow extra praise to the housekeeping staff. They found and returned something of value to me that I had left in my room after checking out. There are still honest people in this world. I highly recommend staying here if you are going to be at the convention center. It's a lovely hotel and so convenient to be able to return to your room and relax for a while after being on your feet all day.
