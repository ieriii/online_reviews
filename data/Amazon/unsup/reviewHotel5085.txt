Jerry Kleiner is a restaurant god in Chicago- Gioco, Red Light, Opera, Marche, Sako (now closed). He is part owner of this spot. Don't be intimidated by the line out the door, dress code, or guest list. We found ourselves sharing a drink with the owner by the end of the night. Don't expect much in terms of music or dance, you're here for the ambiance. A memorable step away from the usual, worth the cab ride. Difficult to find if you aren't familiar with the area.
