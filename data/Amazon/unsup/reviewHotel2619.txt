Ok The James Hotel is your place to go. Nicely sized clean rooms in the middle of downtown... what more could you ask for?  Front desk, bellmen and concierge are all wonderfully helpful. There is a Trader Joe's across the street (which to be honest you could put a Trader Joes across the street of a hovel and I might consider staying there), and you can rent bikes to visit the city if you are too lazy to walk. Oh and did I mention a 2pm checkout? Yes that's right my friends no waking up early to pack up your crap you spread all over the room to make sure you are out by 11 or 12. Relax. Grab a mimosa at brunch and enjoy your last day. Would possible deduct 1/2 star for the amenities if Yelp would let me be more precise though. Booked expecting Kiehl's (understandably a HUGE fan) and instead took a shower with what felt like some crazy blend of Organic, Paraben free ICY HOT. Had to walk across the street to Trader Joe's to buy soap and shampoo. Seriously, Mr. James Hotel....bring back the Kiehl's...that stuff burns!!! Anyways, with the exception of the unpleasant initial shower everything else was wonderful. Will definitely return.
