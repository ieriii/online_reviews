OMG can i live here? my mom was in town to see jersey boys and instead of staying at my small apartment, i got a room at the intercontinental for us! through hotwire, i got a room that regularly books for around $350 for $104. SCORE! it's an over the top hotel and very comfortable and accommodating. i HOPE that i will be able to go there again!
