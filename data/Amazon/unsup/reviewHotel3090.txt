I have a love hate relationship with this place. I went there last year to catch up with a good buddy. He ended up paying with his frequent flyer miles which was good because apparently this place costs a mint. Good:  Beds. They are amazingly fantastic. I haven't had that good of a night's sleep since.  Water. The showers are awesome and the bath room pretty cool. TV. Great HD tv with this hypnotic trace music set to soothing visuals when you first turn it on. Bartender. The upstairs bartender was possibly the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.  Bad: Pretentious. Pretentious. Pretentious. They turn the lobby into a mock night club with a live DJ at night. If you're not wearing clothes they consider appropriate, you'll be asked to leave. Its a god damned hotel lobby?!?!?! Are you kidding me? As a guest, I should not feel awkward about being in the lobby of the hotel I'm staying at. Not only that, but the bouncer was incredibly rude about it. Saying anything like, "We get sports and movie stars in here all the time and they can't wear their hats either." is not cool what so ever. You're a bouncer. . . GFY. Generally the staff did not look interested in being helpful and had more important things to do than express interest looking after this guest. Don't judge a book by its cover people. . . Funny Anecdote- As I was leaving, I noticed a huge tour bus parked outside. I didn't think anything of it until I got a call from my buddy. Apparently I was leaving just as Snoop and 50 Cent were on their way in. If I had known that, I would have stayed another night. . . I'll give'em that as a plus.
