To echo everyone else - absolutely no reason to stay here if you're not attending an event at the convention center. - $45 cab ride to and from O'Hare. Luckily on my way back I split it with anoter conference attendee - When I checked in, I threw my stuff down in the room and went to sit in the desk chair but it had been smeared with grape jelly. Gross. Thank god I noticed. It almost felt like a prank, you know, like unscrewing the cap on a salt shaker. . . - Incredibly overpriced food at their restaurants. A chicken and pasta in tomato sauce with a side salad was $37 through room service - "Late" checkout is 1:00 instead of noon. Super helpful. - No newspaper at your door in the morning - You have to pay for internet - The pool is a joke - The entire hotel and convention center are kept at meat-locker temperatures. I lost feeling in my extremeties several times. - Considering you're a prisoner to the hotel, you'd figure they'd offer more TV channels. Nope. There were like 10 channels, 4 of which were ESPN. No Comedy Central, no MTV or VH1, no Toon Network, no Food Network. . . The only two redeeming points were that - - The fitness center was pretty nice, not the best I've had at a hotel but nice. But the water cooler they have is WAAAAAY over-lemony, like sucking on a lemon. Gross, especially coming off a hard workout. - We got continental breakfast in the mornings of the conference which was actually pretty good. Fruits, cereals, parfaits, pastries.
