Recently stayed at The Congress for two nights just as a get away into Chicago. The hotel was beautiful, quiet and set in time past that was fun to see and be a part of for a short time. Convenient walking distance to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, Grant Park and all the downtown shops and restaurants. Had a Lakeview King Suite - gorgeous and the view from the 8th floor overlooking Michigan Avenue and out onto Grant Park and Buckingham Fountain was amazing. Paid a little over $320 for the two nights and it was worth it.
