I had a great time here. The rooms were small, but I live in the Northeast, and it's comparable to a New York or D.C. hotel room. I wish they had free wifi. I don't understand places that do NOT have free wifi in today's day and age. But I was able to pick up a rogue signal, or go down to the lounge with my laptop. The staff was very nice. The hotel had so much character. I would definitely stay here again.
