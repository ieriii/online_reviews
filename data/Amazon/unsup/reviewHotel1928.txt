This not the best W hotel I've stayed at, but it's not bad. I stay here for business trips and it's convenient. I've been warned that the rooms are very small so I've always requested free upgrades as a Gold Member and gotten them. The beds are super comfortable, and I horde the Bliss products because I love them so. The gym also has free Voss water, which is great!
