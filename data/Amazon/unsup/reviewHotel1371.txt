This hotel is my new go-to for Chicago. Not expensive BUT spacious and well appointed. This location is right off the lake and VERY close to Michigan Avenue shopping etc. This location is FAB if you want to see the city The bar downstairs was SO much fun AND they have a jazz trio there on the weekends that really gets people in a good mood. The room had a ginat comfortable bed, closet and a SAFE (I saw that one reviewer said their computer was stolen - SO you should put your computer etc in there just to be safe because you never know) Now onto the front desk because THIS is why they lose a star with me. They said they would authorize my debit card for incidentals at $75 per day. Instead, they authorized $15o per day (double what they said they would). That was CRAZY, when I called them, they said the "authorization" was just a hold and would fall off after 48 hours since nothing was used. I take issue with this because hotels routinely hold your money whether you are using it for incidentals or not. There should be an option to block incidentals.
