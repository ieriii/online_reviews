I stayed there one night because I had to take train back to L.A. the next day. Before I made reservations I specifically asked if they had washer and dryer. They assured me that they did...after a two day train trip my first thought when I walked in was to wash my clothes so I would have something to wear on the trip home....I was told the washer and dryer had been removed several weeks prior! I wound up washing what I could in bathroom sink then spent half the night and part of morning trying to blow dry my clothes with a hair dryer! Not good! Also when I checked in I gave my Amtrak card to the gal at front desk to make sure the points go to Amtrak...this was not done! They put my 'points' to their hotel instead even tho I made it clear as I was giving them my card! I then received a e mail form letter asking about my experience from a Gary Platt...manager,I responded by e mail...no reply...I left two messages...never got a reply....why do they bother???
