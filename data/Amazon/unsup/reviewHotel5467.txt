Poorly organized, ineffective front desk which left my step-brother on a couch the night before his wedding. As for our room, we were promised it would be ready at 12, but it was still not ready at 3:15, and there were 5 of us getting ready in one hotel room for the 5pm wedding. There was no compensation for our inconvenience.
