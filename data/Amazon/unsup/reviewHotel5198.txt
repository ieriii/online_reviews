Wonderful experience even with a 2 and4 year old! We went for breakfast 2 days in a row and our server Shawn was awesome! The food was excellent! The portion sizes are a good size and not overdone. The prices are above average, but the food is not boring by any means. Would come again!! The hotel was actually very kid friendly which we had our doubts about. There were cookies and milk the first night, the concierge was good about knowing the family friendly places to go, the pool was wonderful! The workout area was very nice!! Great experience! The backpacks filled with toys were a lifesaver! We were close to navy pier and the Disney store! The girls loved it!
