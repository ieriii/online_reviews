What a cute place! I was completely caught off guard by this classy, boutique hotel nestled in the Chicago Gold Coast. And speaking of coasts, this place had an uncanny resemblance to Alexander's Guesthouse on Key West. Hotel Indigo was VERY beachy, but also quite classy. Backwards script discussed "phi" along the walls (luckily, I can read backwards), which I thought looked cool but was weird (why was it backwards?). We approached the counter and the two men stayed near the back and glanced at us with a silent question in their facial expressions. "Can we check in?" That's when they jumped to attention. Weird that they didn't make the first move. The entry area to our room was the best. There was a small foyer area with a long table and mirror. To the right was our bathroom and the bedroom was to the left. The floors were "wooden," and the walls were a pretty periwinkle with green accents. One wall had enlarged pictures of mussles. The view from our window was to a fire-escape with a brick wall beyond (not the beach I expected). Other things to note: - Aveda soaps/lotions/shampoo - comfortable bed - tube tv - unpopulated bar - breakfast place also seemed unpopular (there's a great breakfast place just two doors north of the hotel) - free wifi - we could hear other guests down the hall, but not loud enough to be bothersome
