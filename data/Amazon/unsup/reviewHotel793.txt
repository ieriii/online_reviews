DO NOT have your wedding room block here!!!!! We had our wedding room block here in August for our wedding (our wedding was not at the hotel though). We had nothing but issues, issues, and more issues. It was the biggest problem that we had in all of our wedding plans. The hotel itself is nice, clean, and the beds are very comfortable. I have no complaints about the quality of the hotel and furnishings. Our first issue was that we were misled about the nature of the room block. We were reassured that when the initial block was filled, we would be able to add 5 more rooms at a time, no problem whatsoever. What they failed to mention was that they would hassle with us about the room rate. Next issue, my grandfather needed a handicapped room. The reservation was made 8 months in advance, and when he checked in....no handicapped room for him. Had to wait 24 hrs. for a handicapped room. Unexcusable. Next issue, multiple guests were not able to check in by 3 pm. One guest had driven from Canada and was not able to check into her room until 7 pm. This was because someone was still occupying the room. They reassured her this person would be charged. They did not however offer her another room, or offer anything to her at all! Again, unexcusable. Next issue, the gift bags I provided for the guests were not properly delivered to the right guests. I had provided a typed, very clear list of which guests were to receive bags to the bellman (this is the Westin's policy). I had to speak with the bellman multiple times about gift bags not being delivered. I should not have to do this the weekend I am getting married!! The biggest issue...they charge $2.50 per gift bag. When I'm paying for this service, it should be done correctly. The service at this hotel is ridiculously unexcusable!!!
