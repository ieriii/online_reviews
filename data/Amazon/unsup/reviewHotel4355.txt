Went here for tea. We had a groupon. Of course, who doesn't go ga-ga over the lobby at the Palmer house! What a beaut! So we sat up on the sort of balcony and had a tray of finger sandwiches served to us. Most were really good. The tea was a nice selection.  I got an excellent pot of jasmine tea. Then we got a tray of delicious desserts. We were stuffed by the time we left. Nice ambiance, nice food. Fun!
