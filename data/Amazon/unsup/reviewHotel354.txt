If you see pictures of this place, it doesn't really look that bad, it actually appears to be pretty decent looking... wrong!!!! Really, the only word to describe this "hotel" is DINGY. It is horribly outdated and although the bathroom looked like an attempt to renovate had been made, the toilet was the kind with the thin metal lever like you would find in a gas station. The door looked like it had clearly been kicked in at one point and they restuck the chain link on there to make you feel safe... um yeah. which brings me to my major point of contention with this place because sometimes all you really need is a bed to crash in at the end of the day and in that case who cares if it's not the ritz, but I have never felt more unsafe in my entire life! It truly felt like any minute could have been my last staying in that place. The windows were small and extremely dirty, the a/c unit turned on and off all night. Honestly, I would not recommend it and I would never stay here again.  The "upside": Pretty good location - right off S. Michigan Ave, across from Grant Park (which is beautiful). We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do, including the Sears, restaurants, shops, a trolley tour, etc. The location alone is why it get's that one star. Also, the parking garage guy is really nice but the whole garage is a little bit of a sketchy scene too... when you go to pick it up in the back, there is this whole pulley system that looks like they drop your car 20 feet underground. It's a little awkward (also fairly expensive - cost us $65 for 2 nights - which maybe isn't that bad, but we already felt like we were being porked on the crappy hotel).
