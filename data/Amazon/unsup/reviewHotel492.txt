Very modern hotel, beautiful sky ceiling to look up to from the lobby. Looks nice inside and out. The lobby bar has free drinks from 5 to 7pm, which would have been nice, had I not been working until 8:00 most nights I was there! The free breakfast is made to order omeletes with sausage, hash browns, bacon; other dishes include hot oatmeal, fresh fruit, bagels, toast, and yogurt choices. Starts at 6:30a.m.  Rooms are all suites, which makes it nice and roomy for two, and decent for a third or fourth person. Plenty of closet space and an extra sink in the master bedroom. Two tv's make it nice when sharing or if entertaining.
