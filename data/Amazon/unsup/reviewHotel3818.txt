We stayed here during a recent trip to Chicago. The hotel is very conveniently located, within walking distance of numerous restaurants and shops. As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms have floor to ceiling windows which have black out shades, clean/modern bathrooms, and comfortable bed/pillows. The staff were all very nice and friendly during our stay. Would definitely stay here again in the future.
