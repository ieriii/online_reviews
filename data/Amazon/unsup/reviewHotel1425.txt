Wonderful!!! We stayed in the winter time (obviously, very off-season), but we scored the room for $70/ night from Hotwire. It's in a great location, the staff was wonderful, and I found the building to be quite charming. The bed was unbelievably comfortable, and the bathroom was one of the nicest I've ever encountered. I would definitely stay there again!
