Hello Chicago! On my 1st ever visit to Chicago I stayed 3 days/ 2 nights with the girlfriend at Hotel Allegro. She was there for work so I tagged along since I'd never been to Chicago. Hotel Allegro has a prime location in the Loop & was only a short walk after getting off the CTA Blue Line. The lobby & common areas of Hotel Allegro are grandly & sharply dressed. The girlfriend & I arrived early morning so our room wasn't ready yet. Front desk service was thoughtful as they offered to stow our luggage & call us as soon as our room was ready. Free coffee, tea, etc is available in the lobby in the morning. We grabbed coffees & set out for some breakfast & exploration while our room was prepped. The call came while we were still eating breakfast. That was fast. Back at the hotel, service continued to be thoughtful as staff confirmed that the girlfriend was on an extended business stay & made sure she had a quiet room high enough from the street, on the corner & away from the elevator. The room itself was clean, smartly decorated & felt like it had been recently renovated, but smelled faintly of paint. Being a Queen Deluxe room, it was on the small side. While it had all the basic amenities, there was no coffee maker or microwave in the room. Free Wi-Fi is available in the room if you're signed up with Kimpton's Loyalty Program. No problem. I see this as a better option than paying $10 - $20 for 24 hours of internet access. So I signed up, got free Wi-Fi & Kimpton has since been nice enough to not assault my email inbox with loads of junk. For my 1st time in Chicago, Hotel Allegro was a great place to stay. It's a hotel that's been deftly redone, is centrally located, pays particular attention to service & has nice but smallish rooms. Any future trip to Chicago may also include a stay at Hotel Allegro.
