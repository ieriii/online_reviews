I was hesitant to go with the three star vote because frankly, there isn't much to get excited about but Heart O' Chicago Motel fills a niche as a budget friendly motel in the city of Chicago - something there is a huge shortage of. Our experience was positive overall. Here were the pros and cons. PROS Relatively inexpensive when compared to city hotel prices. Our room that had two double beds was $92 plus taxes. Our room was clean and in the morning I saw several housekeeping employees starting on the rooms so that told me they have adequate staff to keep the motel looking its best. It's on the city's north side, not far from Andersonville. The Clark and Ridge location puts you convenient to many popular north side eateries, shops and of course, Wrigley Field. CONS It can be a bit noisy, especially if you're not used to "city noise". Parking. While they do have a private lot, there is an equal number of spots per room, which means if two cars of customers are staying in one room, two spaces are used. We saw cars blocked in (ours included) in the morning due to this. The bathroom is pretty small and the shower curtain was a bi-fold style, made of hard plastic that, when closed, made the small shower area even more cramped. The Four Seasons it isn't but then again, it's about a quarter of the price too. It's a budget motel in an expensive city. If you're budget conscious, you might want to check it out.
