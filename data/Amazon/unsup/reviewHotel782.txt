The lobby here gives you the impression that this is a fantastic hotel (although a bit cramped). The floor I was on, not so much. The halls looked like they hadn't been renovated in the past 20 years and the room was updated, but not very well-laid out. The bathroom was tiny and the hallway (in the room) was huge, but useless. The tub shower didn't work properly, nor did the ventilation (didn't have any). Now THAT works out nicely if you had a bad meal of spicy Indian food the night before. I also didn't like that they didn't bother to replace the soaps with new ones when they cleaned the room. The bed was very comfortable with down pillows and duvet. It was pretty quiet for a downtown hotel too. Staff was very friendly and had me checked in quickly. The workout room here is fantastic. And the hallways on that floor looked so much better than the floor I was on (9th). So I am wondering if the fact I bought the room through Priceline had anything to do with the room I was put in? Probably.
