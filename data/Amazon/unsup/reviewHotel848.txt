This place and http://hotels.com totally screwed me. Booked and paid for room Oct. 12 and received confirmation. Got e-mail 6 p.m. on Nov. 15, the date I had booked, saying there was a problem. http://Hotels.com said Silversmith had overbooked. Both Silversmith and http://hotels.com said they would help find another room. Never heard back from Silversmith; http://hotels.com said closest is 30 miles. I have a meeting 2 blocks from Silversmith at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow. No car, unfamiliar with transit system. Will never ever do business with either again. Anyone who does risks same treatment.
