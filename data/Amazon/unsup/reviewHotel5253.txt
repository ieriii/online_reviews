I know some of the workers at this hotel. They were treated so badly, they filed a class action lawsuit against the management. Instead of resolving the situation, the management fired all 25! They were told they could get their same jobs back if they went through a temp agency... for less pay and no benefits of course. I urge you to look for a hotel that respects workers rights. Unfortunately Best Western is not one of them.
