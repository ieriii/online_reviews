This is an amazing hotel! Our room was very spacious and comfortable. The pool and hot tub were also nice. My boyfriend LOVED the breakfest! The location of the hotel is wonderful. It only took us about 5 minutes by cab to get to our appointment on Jeweler's Row to select a center diamond for our engagement ring. The best part is that we had reserved a city view room, but got a regular view. They were sorry for the inconvience and took $20+ dollars off a night. We will be going back! A great hotel at a great price. We have decided that this is our offical hotel.
