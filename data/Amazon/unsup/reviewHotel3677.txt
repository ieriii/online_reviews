This review is for the bar only. Maybe my expectations were to high considering this is a very well-known hotel with a lot of history, but I found their bar to be lame, shabby, and just kinda depressing. I guess they were going for a saloon feel but it came off more like a big red cheesy mess. And the prices were insane. We also had appetizers which basically sucked. I hear they have some kind of high noon tea in a tea room there or something like that. I'll try that next. Anything is a step up from this bar experience.
