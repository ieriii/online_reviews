As a Starwood whore I never miss a chance to stay at a different W. The rooms are a little on the tight side. The bar is well done, roomy and flows nicely into the living room. Scene is what you would expect..tools wearing sunglasses inside with anorexic sacks of skin stuck to their arms. Great views of the lake and Navy Pier.
