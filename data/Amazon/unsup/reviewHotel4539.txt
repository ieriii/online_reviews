We hesitantly booked through one of those discount hotel websites, boy were we surprised at the outcome. When we arrived we were bumped up to the executive towers, with private express elevators and lounge. The lounge had complimentary hors d'oeuvres each night, non-alcoholic beverages throughout the day, a wonderful breakfast and a private concierge. It has been quite sometime since we have had such an amazing experience at a hotel. The one downside was a pool under renovation.
