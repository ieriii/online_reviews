I arrived 10:30pm last night to the Westin. The beds were super comfortable and indeed heavenly.  The restaurant downstairs (aka "The Grill") is a bit generic as you would expect from a hotel restaurant. I ordered the 18oz new york strip and it was tough! For $80 (1 steak + drinks) I expected a much better experience.
