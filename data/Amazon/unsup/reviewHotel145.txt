My boyfriend and I got a Groupon to stay here for New Years Eve. Our Groupon was expired but they ended up honoring it anyway. The customer service was great. They were able to squueze us in for a late dinner. But when we got to the dining room, it was pretty empty; I'm pretty sure they could have put us in earlier time slot. And then the staff rushed us out really quickly. It was understandable becuase it was 10pm on NYE, but their boss should've just put us in earlier. However, the food was awesome! Overall, we had a great stay!
