I stayed here for a week and it was awesome... The good thing about the hotel is primarily the location. You are at the downtown (near michigan street) and all the day/nightlife awesomeness that is Chicago is around you. Public transportation, restaurants, tourist attractions, bars, clubs, weird people and you're on the chicago river. Also, the rooms are fairly spacious, but older. Oh and Batman Dark Knight was filmed at this location. The down side is it is pricey and there are only a couple elevators that service the hotel - so mornings are a pain in the ass to get up and down from say the 30th floor to the lobby. The service is ok, but come on - this place is ideal for a Chicago experience. Go Check it out...
