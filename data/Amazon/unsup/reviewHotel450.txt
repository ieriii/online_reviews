A very classy place to stay in Chicago. Friendly staff and an amazing find! I would definitely recommend this hotel. Might be out of your price range, but worth checking out since the amenities more than make up for it and they offer some awesome packages. Worth the splurge if you want to experience Chicago and leave relaxed.
