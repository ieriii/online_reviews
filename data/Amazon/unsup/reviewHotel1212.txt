Overall, my experience here was decent - the hotel room was pretty spacious and since it was comped - not too sure on the price of it. It also has massive underground conference facilities that can cope well with 5,000 people. Yes, it is connected to an underground shopping mall so you don''t really need to leave the building at all. Unfortunately the whole complex is massively confusing and I got lost a handful of times. edit: I just attended a beautiful wedding ceremony and reception here - the catering was done really well and the entire setup of an ethnic wedding went very well.
