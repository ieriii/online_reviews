This Hampton Inn was great. The room was clean and comfortable, the free breakfast was good. Outstanding location !! It was a 2 block walk to the Grand red line stop and this made it very convenient for me to get to work each day (and it saved me $18 per day parking at my job site). Tons of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. My fav restaurant was Bandera. The only thing that I didn't like about this property was the $42 per day for valet parking. I think this is on par with other hotels in the downtown area, but that still doesn't make me like it. I parked at the public lot next door to the hotel for $30 per night (another steep price for parking) - this lot doesn't allow in/out. I walked everywhere or caught the train, so next time I probably wouldn't even rent a car. As mentioned in other posts for this hotel, the Fire Station is right next door and I heard the fire trucks every day. They were loud, but luckily they weren't going out frequently. I have to give a shout out to Andrew who was very helpful with getting an AAA room rate assigned to my reservation.
