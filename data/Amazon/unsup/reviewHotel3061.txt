Just finishing up my stay here and it's been pretty enjoyable. Let me first tell you I got a killer rate. $109 (free parking & 2 drinks tickets) a night so since parking is $48 and each drink runs your about $10 at the bar it's a pretty good deal! The staff here is great and they really try to take care of you while you are staying here. The rooms are nice - and if you get a lakeview room the view is pretty amazing. The odd thing is with all the windows open in your room while you are taking a shower you can look at the view at the same time! I would totally stay here if - especially if I got the same rate!
