My wife and I spent a few days at the Burnham last week as part of our annual pre-Spring Break spring break. We couldn't have enjoyed it more. With a location close to just about everything, friendly and accommodating staff, wonderful rooms (we stayed on the 11th floor where the view included just a bit of the lake between the buildings on Washington), not to mention the history surrounding the building, we had a thoroughly relaxing and restorative stay. Having the Atwood Cafe on site in the lobby was a definite plus as we had breakfast each day, cocktails and dinner on our last evening. See my review elsewhere on Yelp.
