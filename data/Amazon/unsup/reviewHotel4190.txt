I really enjoy staying at this hotel. I have stayed there 4 times in the months of March and April. Never had a problem with anything. They even upgraded me to the 33rd floor this last time I was there because I made a comment about the high school kids running around and I didn't want to hear them. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. They always make sure you have been taken care of. The room service is great too. I love the grilled cheese and fries. :) Great meal and not highly priced because its on the kids meal. It really has been my home away from home.
