Tiny rooms, an impersonal and rude staff, extremely slow service among other flawed characteristics of this hotel make it almost entirely avoidable. The only plus was that it was two blocks from the office from which I was working when I was traveling to Chicago. This hotel is so massive that one could lose ones way in its cramped and labyrinthine halls that span across three wings. The bathrooms were claustrophobic, the TVs had poor reception and the room service food was less than mediocre, thanks to the average 1-1.5 hour delivery time, I'm sure. Oh, and the air conditioning was so affective that I had to wear a sweatshirt in my room in the middle of the summer. They seem to cater well to their conventions and conferences than individual guests, probably because these conferences/conventions bring in a lot of money, but it is not a legitimate justification for the lack of appropriate attention towards the rest of their clientele. It is the hospitality industry after all, one has to have some basic standards and principles, which this hotel certainly lacks. STAY AWAY if you can help it.
