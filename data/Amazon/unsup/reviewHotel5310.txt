i made a reservation for the silversmith through travelocity and was charged through travelocity for the hotel. i checked into the hotel, was asked for my credit card, and told that because my reservation was made through travelocity, my card would only be charged incidentals. a few weeks later, after my return home and after my checking account was overdrawn, i realized that the hotel had charged me as well. i called them and was put through to the accounting department. this "department" appears to be an answering machine. no one ever responded to my calls and i have called a number of times. i'm now trying to straighten the whole thing out with travelocity. the hotel, staff, area, etc. were all nice. nothing to say against any of that.
