I've stayed here many times because it's right across the street from our Chicago office. The building is beautiful! The lobby is grand and welcoming. The front desk staff are always kind and act like they don't mind being at work (gasp, what a concept!). I've stayed in both towers. The older tower has smaller bathrooms, but all in all they are about the same. Although, I do have an affinity for large bathrooms with tubs AND a glass shower. My most recent stay was in the older tower with the smaller bathroom. The room service is always good, albeit a little pricey. Thank goodness for expense accounts. The decor in the rooms has been updated to a nice modern motif. I love all the pillows on the bed--I tend to surround myself with them while I sleep. I too had a problem with the water in the sink and in the shower. The pressure and temperature would change, but I can deal with that.
