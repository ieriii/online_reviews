This hotel was okay but not fantastic. I was expecting it to be a lot like the Drake (which is directly across the street) because they were both built in the golden age. But, believe me, it isn't anything like the Drake!  My best friend and I were in town for the Shamrock Shuffle. We first checked in and walked into a smelly smokey room. I went to go open up the window to get some fresh air circulating...well that's why it smelled like smoke. There were cigarette butts in the window sill! We went downstairs on our way out to tell them (I also took a pic with my phone and showed them as well) as I didn't want to be charged anything for the smokey smell thinking it was us who left the smell. The receptionist apologized and said she would let a manager know but that was all the communcation that was made. I would've thought a manager would've at least contacted me or something.  When going to take a shower, watch out! You either have too much water pressure from the shower wand or not enough from the shower head in the ceiling. I, got blasted in the face from the shower wand. You apprently have to have a engineering degree to use the shower!  About the only positive of the hotel was David the bartender downstairs. He was funny and hospitable. Go see him! Overall, not a great Chicago hotel. Will definetly find somewhere else to stay next time! Location was great though!
