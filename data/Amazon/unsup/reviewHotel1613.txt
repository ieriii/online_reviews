I want to start out by saying that my first visit to Hotel 71 was one of the most magical experiences that one can have in Chicago. It's located right on the river and the Premiere River King suites have breathtaking views, rainforest showers and modern Kuerig coffee makers, a welcome relief from those Hotel coffee makers that sound like someone is violently gargling as if choking to death only to produce a cup of coffee that tastes as if it were strained in a traveling salesmen's soiled sock. I have however deducted stars for two reasons. 1) they no longer serve adequate room service (my first trip they had this wonderful lox served on wafer-thin bagels that I am yet to locate in any health food store) and 2) my last trip they put me in the wrong room and then transferred me to a small Premiere room that was nothing near what I had come to expect for the same price. Repetition is required for excellence in my book. I want to state that I fully intend to try this hotel again and update my score if it improves since my first visit was so memorable for me. I still recommend this place over some if the others I've tried on the river. Please Hotel 71: bring back the lox on thin bagel crackers, upgrade the room service and keep your promises when people book a room. Thanks.
