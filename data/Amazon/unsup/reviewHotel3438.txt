Normally I stay at the Westin on Michigan Ave. when in town, but I could not resist trying the Allerton, just a couple blocks away, when I secured a $75/night rate. Yes you read that right- I kid you not. I just had to see if this was too good to be true. Double bed, yes, and room cozy but not too small. Bathroom much larger than expected with nice variegated tile. Wireless internet in room $10 for a "lite" option that provides quite speedy service, though not hardy enough to stream Netflix. You can upgrade for $5 or $10 additional. Even if you get the fastest option, the total bill for this location ($75 room + $10 internet + $11 tax = $94) on Michigan Avenue is quite a bargain in my book. Solid wood bedroom door to the hallway still permitted me to hear conversations as people walked by, but I was close to the elevator and for the most part my stay was very quiet until my second night's neighbors arrived. I could hear a decent amount of conversing through the shared wall. Elevators are numerous and very fast. Five blocks from the Chicago/State stop on the blue line, so you are merely a 45 minute, $2.50 train ride from O'Hare. Exercise room is huge and adequate. Very nice pre-cor elliptical machines and several treadmills-- all equipped with personal TVs. No pool, but for less than $100 a night, Westin Workout, eat your heart out! I really felt like I was getting away with something every time I strolled out into Michigan Avenue. I found the staff very pleasant. I was very pleasantly surprised and glad I took this chance, and would happily stay here again. Obviously not a luxury hotel, but it not a budget hotel either. It is more than adequate. The value combined with the facilities easily affords a 3 out of 5 recommendation and I'm inclined to give it 4.
