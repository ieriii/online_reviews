The customer service is EXCELLENT and cost was great (got my room for only $127 a night on Travelocity). I think they've got a litle happy hour in the evenings as well, but I didn't take advantage. The location is ideal and central to a lot of downtown attractions. Oh, and did I mention free internet??? You have to join their Kimpton program, but it's a snap. The rooms are charming, Art Deco-ish, and Euro-sized but that's cool as long as you're not a bigger person. The one thing that I would change about this hotel is the soundproofing. It gets kind of loud sometimes!
