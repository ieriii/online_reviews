Mixed feelings about the Sheraton. First of all, the bed and bedding was VERY COMFORTABLE. I slept like a baby swaddled up and happy. The towels were not crunchy or hard as hotel towels can so easily be. The view from the 14th floor was great and I enjoyed waking up to the view of a bustling downtown sprawl, without the noise. The luggage check and valet staff were great - very efficient and courteous. The downside to the Sheraton is that beyond coffee in your room, NOTHING is included in the $259/night price tag. That's one expensive bed, pillow, and morning coffee. You want Internet? That'll be $12.99/day. You have a third party payer who paid your stay in full? Be prepared to remind them of that, because they will ask for your credit card. You attend a conference? Be prepared for burnt coffee and stale bagels. I wouldn't voluntarily stay at the Sheraton again...unless my company gave me no choice. :-\
