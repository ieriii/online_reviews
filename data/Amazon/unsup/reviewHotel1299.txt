I haven't stayed at the hotel, but came by for drinks in the lobby recently. I have to say, it is breathtaking. I absolutely love hotel lobbies, and the Ritz Carlton may be my new favorite. The area is grand, very large with a huge fountain right in the center of the room. Classic moldings, gorgeous floral arrangements (although I am pretty sure the orchids are fake), and picture perfect seating arrangements makes the lobby a great place for a drink, a date or afternoon tea with friends. I had a dirty vodka martini and my friend had the toasted almond martini... both were delicious. Service was excellent, very attentive :) I like that. What I love most about this place is that it's not a place to be seen. Just an elegant setting with great ambiance and service. I'll update the review when I stay at the hotel.
