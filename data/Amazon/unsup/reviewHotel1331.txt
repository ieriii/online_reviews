I had the pleasure of staying here for a work function. The place lives up to all you would expect for a Ritz. The staff are super friendly, the rooms decorated well and comfortably outfitted. The price was not too bad but that might be because i got a corporate rate. If you are heading to Chicago ...check them out!
