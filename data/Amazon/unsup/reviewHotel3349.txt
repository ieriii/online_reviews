My latent belief that it's inhumane to live anywhere but New York had reason to rear its head about eight seconds after I entered the ruthlessly no-frills lobby of the South Shore's least expensive hotel. The staff's mild Midwestern manners didn't ameliorate my impatience at my check-in time being delayed, or the elevators crawling at snail's pace, or the unimpressive (but clean) room. They definitely didn't stop me from kicking myself -repeatedly; with vigor- that I'd shelled out considerable greenbacks for a Shore address - and gotten considerably less than any of alternatives situated on lesser avenues. Take my advice and book a room off the Shore - they're guaranteed to beat the lowest-end Shore offering.
