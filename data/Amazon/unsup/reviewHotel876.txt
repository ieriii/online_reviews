Darnell at the front desk was friendly, and offered dinner recommendations when he saw me with fast food. He told me that the gold fish at the front desk is known by a different name by different employees. Darnell called that fish, Nemo. Service was excellent, and I love that they offer Mighty Leaf teas. The metal tea is a fun, vintage touch. When my tub wasn't draining, a quick call, and they had it fixed while I was out. The location is great for shopping and restaurants in the Loop. The reason why I'm not giving it more stars is because my personal preferences are for more modern interiors, and a more spacious room. For my hotel rate, I was expecting the Palomar.
