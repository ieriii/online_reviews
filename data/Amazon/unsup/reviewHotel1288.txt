Not my favorite. This hotel is old and is starting to show its age.  Minus one star because it doesn't feel completely clean to me, though I can't quite describe why. Minus another star because there's no coffee in the lobby in the mornings and the walk to Michigan Avenue, though only half a block, feels really long for some reason. Picky, I know, but I just don't see why one would stay here when the Four Seasons on Delaware is so much better.
