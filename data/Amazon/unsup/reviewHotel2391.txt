As Bill B said on 10/20/11, do not waste your money on this place. I paid around $250 a night for a small room with a King sized bed The bathroom was clean Sheets were clean Minimal amenities My room had no mini bar just a half fridge that was empty and not even plugged in. Room service selections are minimal and not too tasty...breakfast faired a bit better because lets be real, scrambled eggs are hard to mess up The absolute WORST was their terrible internet service which they make you pay through the nose for ($8 an HOUR!!!) which kept cutting in an out during a business meeting. I travel to Chicago frequently and I will NOT return to this hotel EVER. This place is a tremendous disappointment and for the money you can stay at a nicer more up to date hotel with better amenities, service, and internet that works. I consider this place a major FAIL
