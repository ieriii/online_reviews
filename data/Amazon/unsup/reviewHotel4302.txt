I was able to negotiate my way to a decent deal for a three night stay in Chicago at the Palmer House Hilton. It was my first time negotiating on Priceline, and I believed it to be a great deal on a long Summer weekend that would get me out of Cedar Rapids. The Palmer House proved to be a great experience, and not just because its a Hilton either. After doing some research I found there was certainly some history to the location, and I have to mention that they have done a decent job at preserving it. I was given a room clearly meant for one person, partly because I told them it was just me and also because I didn't mind not getting extra space. My first thought after entering the room was more a long the lines of "This is the most perfect 1 bedroom you could find"! One could argue that another perspective would be- "This is an extra store room"! Don't get me wrong, it was a small room that I greatly admired...clearly for one person. Other than that, the amenities and everything else was pretty good. You do notice the age of the property at times, but it does sell itself as a historic venue in Chicago. The lobby itself is quite a beautiful! The ceiling tapestry, the swanky bars, and the excellent decor makes it a place to be on any given night! Definitely a great place for a few drinks with friends to start off the evening. The service was very good and attentive, although I hardly needed anything after my initial check in. And you cannot beat the location that the hotel is in! Fairly close to the CTA lines, and being right in the Loop is a big plus!
