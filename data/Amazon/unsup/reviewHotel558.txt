Nice swank hotel especially if you can get at a discount. I came to Chicago for one night and got a great deal on Public from Jetsetter. Located in the middle of everything, within walking distance to Rush Street, shopping, bars, restaurants, and many good things in Chicago. Cool lobby bar with great drink options in a pimp setting.  The room itself is nice - spacious, decent view, comfy bed albeit on the floor. It's an older building that was upgraded to make this hotel, but with a nice staff, sexy young bar in the lobby and good enough rooms this does the job quite well. Plus a quick walk and you're in the heart of good Chicago.
