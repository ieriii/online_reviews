Yes, it's late morning and I should be working on contract issues and rifling through heaps of paper but I'm entitled to a break! Besides, I'm basing this review on my stay at the Marriott Downtown for a couple of business meetings last week so it's completely work related. Ugh, yeah, that's it... In any case, as other Yelpers have already noted, the Marriott Downtown costs as much as it does due to its location! Two nights and you're looking at throwing down half of that rent check if not all of it. Yes, the Marriott certainly is on Michigan Avenue (aka the Magnificent Mile, which isn't so magnificent when you don't have any ducketts to spend) and it's in the middle of a lot of goings-ons but the interior is quite a labyrinth of amenities. I felt like a Hobbitt looking for a gold ring!  Upon arriving, it took me a good 20 minutes to find my room. I asked about 4 other people and they were lost too. Well, I found it, finally! I have to say that I LOVED the view. However, it was considered a Club Room upgrade and I didn't see how. The room was rather small. I mean, I can't complain but then again when I'm paying a couple limbs my last two nights there, I would have loved something a bit more grand than what was received. So, why did we pick this place for such a large business meeting (approximately 300 attendees!)? It is one of the only hotels in Downtown Chicago that can accommodate parties of that size. Oh, to top it off, let's confuse guests even more by having an escalator from the 7th floor spit you right out onto the 5th floor!?! Wow, really? I have to cut them some slack though because the staff was really nice and helpful. However, along with check-in, they should give hotel guests a Tom Tom GPS navigation system to find their way around.
