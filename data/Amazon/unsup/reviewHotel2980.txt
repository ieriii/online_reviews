We stayed here in July 2010 for a conference. My young daughter and I tagged along with my husband and had a little vacation. Our experience while there and after trying to contact someone about it was mixed.  The maid staff was horrible and I never had the door held for me in all of the in and outs despite pushing a stroller. The location is terrific and the pool was nice, but I would highly recommend the Chicago Hilton or the Allerton if you want good service and a comfortable stay in Chicago.
