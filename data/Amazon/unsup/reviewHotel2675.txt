what a lovely place. it's very modern yet eco-friendly...which I totally loved. I enjoyed that place two nights in a row...first night was in a suite for my sister's last night before her wedding. It was such a cute suite. however the seating was very uncomfortable. :( The second night was the night of the wedding and the bride and groom decided to have an afterparty at their presidential suite (they were upgraded as a surprise from the hotel)...which was amazing...I swear P-Diddy or Puff Daddy would have showed up! this place was insane...the bathroom itself seemed like a whole 'nother world...hot tub...stalls for the toilets...huge counter spaces...this suite was very sexy and modern just like the bride and groom...eventually the bride and groom kicked us out to enjoy themselves. :)
