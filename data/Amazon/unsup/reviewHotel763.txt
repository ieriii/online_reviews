5 star location!!!! 3 star accomodations -rooms need to be updated and not everything was working in my room on this visit. I always base part of my experience on whether the room really calls to me to stay in and relax...this place doesnt do that. BUT the location of the hotel is stellar. Theres no better location in terms of being 1/2 block away from Michigan ave and close to all the shops. So, you pay for the location which will keep you out of the room so you wont mind the room if thats the case. ;)
