My husband surprised me with a stay at Hotel Indigo for the weekend. First, I have to say that this is a good hotel for a weekend getaway but I would not reccomend it for a long extended stay, since there is no closet space. I loved the lobby, it had a modern pallete and is scented based on the season. The scent was pineapple for the summer and it was just so refreshing. The front desk staff always remembered us and always said hello to us, which is a nice change from large chain hotels. The room itself is cozy, but I loved the king size bed and the great comforter that was on it. Also Aveda bath products were a plus. The few cons I have are the shower curtain never seemed to keep the water out. They really should just put a shower door. The air conditioner was either really cold or not cold enough and it was a bit noisy. The ice machine is on the 2nd floor and when I went, it was out of ice. I called and they brought me a HUGE bag of ice (way more than any one person could consume, so I had to put it in my sink), but they were quick in bringing it. Last, we said we were staying for our anniversary and they really didn't do anything for us. I don't expect anything, but always give props to hotels that go the one up. Also, since it is a boutique hotel, I would have thought that they would have done something special for us. I would definitely go back for a weekend getaway.
