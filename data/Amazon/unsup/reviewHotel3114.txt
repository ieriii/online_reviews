I'm a W hotel fan. If I ever go out of town, I try to stay at the W if my budget can afford it. I just love the style of that place! The W Chicago is great-- right on the lake, slightly tucked away from Michigan ave, but close enough that you can get to some of the great shopping areas. The real reasons I come to the W: Bliss Spa, and the Mojitos. Some of the best in the city, and I'm a snobby mojito whore. They do some great variations, with crushed blueberrys, rasberrys, or mango... and one wednesday a month they do special mojitos with a medley of pineapple and some other crap... and part of the proceeds go to The Humane Society.. getting drunk for a good cause?? Can't beat that. I will say they tend to be rather expensive, and you can't really go there dressed uber casual without looking a little out of place. Throw on some lipgloss, a cute top, and your good to go. Another thing= The bathrooms are awesome. I'm pretty sure the glass between the mens and womens rooms are see through, so if you look hard enough, you can probably get a free show... not that I would know or anything. Bliss Spa is great too, and kudos to them for associating themselves with such a great name in the Hotel industry!! One more thing, the bar upstairs, I think it's called the Whiskey- has an amazing view of the skyline. Everything in the bar is black, so if your drunk enough, it feels like you are floating in the black abyss. I love it.  If you ever get a chance, check out the W in LA... that's where my love affair began!
