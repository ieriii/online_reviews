First words out of my mouth was wow! I was blind folded all the way up to the penthouse suite by my bridesmaids that had planned an amazing night out. When they took the blindfold off all I could say was "wow...omg this place is amazing". We had a great view, Awesome room, and the staff was great! Its not your typical downtown hotel room. Really felt like someones condo. I could totally live there. The shower was an experience. I'm so glad they persuaded me to get in. I didn't want to get out!! You must try their Steak & Eggs for brunchas well! Their amazing!! Perfect place for a weekend getaway. I'm going back for sure!
