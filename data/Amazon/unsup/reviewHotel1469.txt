I would never stay anywhere else in Chicago! My husband and I came here for a weekend trip while he was home on leave from Iraq. We already had a room booked (at a VERY affordable rate!) but when we arrived, the front desk clerk found out the reason for our stay, and we were upgraded to a deluxe suite! From there, it was pure heaven. The concierge was more than accommodating with helpful tips on where to go, best restaurants and tourist traps to avoid. I felt like the staff was anticipating our needs before we even had to ask! Room service was delicious and beautifully presented. We even spent one evening relaxing in the hotel bar with glamorous martinis and yummy herb popcorn. Can't wait to go back!
