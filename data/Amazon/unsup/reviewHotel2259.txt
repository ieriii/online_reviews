GREAT location, that's worth it in itself. Clean rooms, comfy beds. They have a nice bar in the middle of the lobby, and a Starbucks as well. Our concierge (Matthew, I believe) was incredibly accommodating and gave us a jump the line (and free appetizer) coupon to Gino's East (YUM), which was much appreciated by an out of towner like myself. This Marriott is walking distance from tons of shopping (Zara, Topshop, H&M, etc) and dining spots. I would definitely stay here again.
