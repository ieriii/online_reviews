DO NOT PAY THIS PRICE FOR THIS HOTEL!!!!!!! We stayed at the River hotel from 1/2 the price we paid at Allerton!! Do NOT waste you time here! This hotel is easily comparable to a 2 star hotel NOT a 4 star one! Parking is $50 a night! No fridge. The best service was the bell hop and valet. Again, NOT worth $300 -$500 give your money to Trump if you want what you pay for! Room was small, ice machine was broken, stains all over carpets, closet too small and couldn't hang long clothes inside. Internet is $10 per 512kb. Check out all other hotels first.
