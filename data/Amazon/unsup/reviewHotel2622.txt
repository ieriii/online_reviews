I booked this hotel after blind bidding on Hotwire. It was fine, but definitely not great- even at the bargain basement price that I paid. The bathroom doors are heavy sliding doors that don't close all the way- about a 1/2 inch gap. That was not wonderful. They provide turn down service complete with dim lighting, some music playing quietly, etc. It really wasn't necessary for me when sharing a room with my mother. Parking is pricey- $55 for valet. However there is a garage on the same block for $35. The beds were super comfy and the location was great. Overall, the hotel was alright, but I would definitely try someplace else next time.
