Oh what a great time! If you want to check in standing next to east coast rap-stars amongst down to earth people celebrating their epic birthday event - try this place! Waterfront view, humid weather with a nice breeze, and staying over on a street-fair weekend was a WONDERFUL time.. While the W in Seattle is by far my favorite one - (I am biased for family reasons) - I have to say that the concierge (5 Big and Bright stars) at this hotel really know how to treat you right.  R & I had a great weekend, slept amazingly well, and felt right at home with the fun times we had and hopefully we'll come back next year for 'Taste of Chicago!'
