View from my room on the 31st floor: most of Chicago, plus Lake Michigan. Hey, I could get used to this. Too bad I was in the hotel room, and awake, for maybe 3 hours total. Wait, actually, that's a good thing, but for other reasons. Huge room, separate shower and bath (and makeup vanity, but I didn't use that), nice LG flatscreen wall-mounted, very decent bed. Downsides: bad pillows (I HATE soft and squishy pillows); shower had one of those ceiling-mounted rainfall shower heads, which look awesome but don't function that well; there was a black extension cord just running along the floor to power a lamp. None of these are big things, but they are enough to warrant 4 stars instead of 5.
