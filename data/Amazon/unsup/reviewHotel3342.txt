My girlfriend and I stayed here in November 2009. The building and hallways were interesting - the rock and roll memorabilia mixed with the deco-like building decorations. The room looked a little worn and tired, though the bed was comfortable. Beware - simply opening one of the food drawers and closing it triggered a charge that we had to have taken off at the end of the visit. The day concierge was friendly and helpful when we were looking for breakfast. The night concierge was a different guy and, truthfully, was sort of stuck up when we asked if he'd heard of a specific burger joint (Moe's).
