Valet Parking $15 in a place that is tucked away on a side street, $8 for a beer, $11 for a well drink...segregated awkward crowd...priceless. I was amazed how this place was set up. Walking in, you're in a room that looks pretty nice with tables and lounge chairs, then you walk into another room which is the size of a walkin closet and then a big room with a huge bar and dance floor. Each room had different music and a different crowd. The drinks are ridiculously overpriced and I will NOT be returning anytime soon. I was here for a friends birthday, my friends birthday. I wouldn't recommend this place, aside from the occasional good song, everything else is just. MEH!?
