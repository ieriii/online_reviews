Probably the best hotel stay so far. I'm generally unimpressed with the price to service ratio at these fancy-ish hotels, but I think this is my new favorite. Location: AWESOME. Right across the street from the Hancock Observatory and the Water Tower Place. There's no lack of food in the area, from cheap (mostly in the mall), to the more expensive, to the moderate (cheesecake factory). There's "The Grill" downstairs but it's pretty expensive. I took a cab to all the major landmarks for around 10-$15 (cabs seem to be rather expensive in this city, the places weren't very far away). Rooms: My room was great, I couldn't hear any neighbors and the bed was super comfortable. Room Service: Food was awesome, and I was surprised that when I got hot chocolate with my breakfast that it wasn't a couple packets and some hot water. It was served in a caraffe that stayed hot all morning. They also have EVERY necessity that you may have forgotten that you can have delivered to your room. Price: My room was discounted at $195 for an event, definitely worth it if you ask me. I was very pleased with my stay. The hotel was on a scent theme of "White Tea" so the corridors and everything smelled marvelous, and all of the in-room soaps and shampoos smelled like White Tea also (my favorite scent, btw). If I had to complain about anything it would be that during the day, the paid wifi internet is VERY slow, but I was able to hook into the wall for no extra charge so no big deal.
