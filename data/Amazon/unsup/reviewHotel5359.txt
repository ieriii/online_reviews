For a person that spends so much of her life living in and out of hotels, it is easy for me to say that this place is totally out of the ordinary. It is super conveneintly located to where I do most of my business when visiting Chicago and since I left, I keep thinking about how I cannot wait to come back and visit this hotel again. What really got me excited was the interior design and overall elegance that the entire place had. I am looking forward to the next room I will get at the hotel--all of them are designed and decorated in unique ways with totally different decor. Plus the staff that helped me during my stay could not have been nicer or more thoughtful with basic things like directions. The only downside to this hotel is that I wish I had known about it sooner!!! Years of coming to Chicago and staying in generic places that are not worth the money at all is a total letdown when you find places like Wheeler mansion that has so much personality and charm! If i was from around here, I would probably come take a look at this place from time to time just for the visual appeal and woodwork, hand carved and hand painted ceilings, stained glass ceiling, etc. You will be blown away by the elegance and attention to detail that this hotel has as soon as you walk in.
