Wonderful! The staff is so attentive and friendly. We felt welcomed from the moment we stepped up to this great hotel. The decor was contemporary and industrial. The ceiling in our room was concrete. The room service menu may have been a bit pretentious for late night. Raw bar? Beds were awesome and the shower was spectacular! The roof top bar was gorgeous, but the pumping techno was not really conducive to chilling over drinks and the amazing scenery. Half of the lounge was closed off which cornered us in and eventually led us right to the elevator. Other than that, we absolutely LOVED this hotel.
