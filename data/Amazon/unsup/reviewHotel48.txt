I arrived at the Tremont this past weekend for one night only. I was staying in Chi Town for 2 nights but due to a convention in town this was the only hotel that had availability for the night and for $155 for the night I was more than willing to stay since I was getting rooms around the area for the rate of $350 and up! Lets just say here you are only paying for location. I ve learned that the "older" hotels are just NOT MY THING. The hotel lobby is pretty and leads you to believe the rooms will be the same. The staff was meh and the room, oh God the room. The room was so outdated! We had a one bedroom but for whatever reason it was two rooms combined into one (score!). For just two people it was pretty spacious and with two bathrooms and two tv sets then I guess I cant complain, but really I have to! The room smells like your grandmothers house and with the fixtures to boot! The carpet stunk, the sheets were stiff, the fixtures were old and dusty and lastly the bathrooms were old and falling apart. One of the bathrooms showers had brown water coming out of the faucet for the first 2 min! Since I only stayed a night I guess it could have been worse...thank goodness. - I also wish I can write a review about Ditkas since its downstairs but it was packed the night I wanted to eat there so I guess that says something good!
