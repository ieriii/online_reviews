I just finished a two night stay at the W Lakeshore while job hunting and networking in Chicago. It's a nice hotel with some minor problems, and thank goodness the rate was as good as it was (for the W, anyway). It's a great option for those looking to stay near the Magnificent Mile and the Navy Pier. Not so much if you're heading to the Loop. Pros: -The bed was the best hotel bed I have ever slept on: super comfortable and very plush -Hotel gym is one of the best I've seen: great views of the lake for the cardio equipment and a really nice indoor pool -Desk attendants downstairs were very attentive and willing to respond to any request -The restaurant was decent -Magnificent views of Lake Michigan and the Near North -Shower designed so that you can steam your clothes in the bathroom and not burn your hands trying to turn off the water. Underrated but really nice feature! -Great location if you're doing business in the Magnificent Mile area Cons: -Shower itself was ok; not strong enough -Shampoo/Conditioner smelled terrible; seriously thought about going to Kiehl's nearby to get samples instead. -Wicker/Bamboo accents in the room were one shutter-slat away from being a Hollister. -Because the hotel building was rehabbed to be a W, there are some dings and older, slightly broken features in the rooms. -Desk staff RARELY answered the phone when I called down from my room. I had to go downstairs to request anything from them. -Horrible location if you're spending most of your time in The Loop; also really far from the El -In room WiFi was kind of expensive -Ceiling in the gym was too short Overall: Hotel has some great features and plenty of room for improvement. I'm sure there are better W Hotels elsewhere, and despite a really awesome bed, will likely stay elsewhere next time I come to Chicago.
