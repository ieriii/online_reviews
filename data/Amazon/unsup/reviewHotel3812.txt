The Hotel... AMAZING!!!!! Walking into this boutique hotel (2nd floor) you're taken back from the beautiful modern decor, swanky!!! Look around, the interior decor is phenomenal, you recollect your memory "Am I in the right place for the price?!" This hotel is one of the most affordable and upscale in Downtown Chicago. I booked a regular guest room, I was sooooooo impressed! The rain shower which was glassed to the entire room view was so inviting, amazing, relaxing, spacious and so sleek. You can shower 5x's a day! No worries if you share the room with a guest, there is a curtain to hide your sexiness from the room view lol! Floor to ceiling windows were breath taking with semi-dark shades, your choice. High end speaker system (bring your iPod/iPad) to connect to this jammin radio! Flat screen tv. The best part..... THE BEDS. HOLY DANA its like sleeping on clouds - Heavenly!!! I slept so well!!! Soft and cushy, everything feathered!!! Sleek dark wood floors. Minimal storage for clothes and seating. All they need is the bidet and toilet seat warmer hehehe Jk Jk. Everything was amazing!!! You must stay here! I always do when I'm in Chi-Town :)
