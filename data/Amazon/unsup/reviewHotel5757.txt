This place is a great homebase for those on a budget in Chicago. Clean, but pretty bare bones. Free parking is an awesome bonus. BYO shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, hairdryer,etc. And be sure to coordinate your PJ's with 70s yellow. Stayed there in Aug and the AC kept it totally cool, but was crazy loud.  It's not a luxury retreat, but it's also under $100/night for a king-sized room. Would definitely stay here again.
