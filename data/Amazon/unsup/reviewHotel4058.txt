We stayed here for the National Restaurant show which was in town. Yes the hotel was quite busy, but is that an excuse for terrible and downright rude service?? The only hospitable person was the guy at the front desk, Michael I believe who gave us a great room, he gets one star. Our room was on the 33rd floor, it was well decorated and had a great view. The bell men were beyond rude!!!! The only one who helped was Miguel who was very courteous, another star. When we tried to check our bags so we could explore the city, the bell men argued that there was no room? WHAT!? This place is huge Jesus open a closet and throw it in there! Whats worse is that we could see the room's interior which was only half full!! I really didn't want to tip this guy but i was obliged so i gave him $2 for my ONE piece of luggage and he blatantly gave me a dirty look! This guy really ruined my experience at Hyatt.
