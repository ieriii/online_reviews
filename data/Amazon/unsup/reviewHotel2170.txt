I can't figure out how many stars this hotel has? Is it considered a three star or a four star hotel? If it is considered a four star, its not a very nice one. I was here on business, so I didn't pay for the room (not even sure how much it was) but I found it adequate. I didn't use the pool or the gym, but ate quite a bit hotel food and found it to be about as good as hotel food gets. The bathroom sucked; I found the toilet a little gross--it had one of those handles you push with your foot, and the tub wasn't quite clean enough, the lighting was awful and the bath products smelled awful. As other reviewers noted the televisions are flat screens, but the programming isn't HD. Luckily, the bed was one of the more comfortable hotel beds I've stayed in and I liked the little couch in my room. I was on the 22nd floor of the main tower, but even there most of the views were blocked by adjacent buildings. I found the service to be a little slow, perhaps they are understaffed. However, the concierge was quite knowledgable and helpful. I find it annoying to wait in a line to check-in or check-out. I probably wouldn't stay here again. Compared to other hotels, this one seemed to lack some degree of polish.
