This Chicago hotel is a classic, but had seen better days until the recent renovation of the historic building. I was in town for a meeting at the property otherwise I probably would have selected somewhere else. When I checked in and the receptionist indicated my room was in the 'historic tower" I got a chill up my spine. She most have noticed because she then went on to explain the recent renovation. While my room on the 17th floor was still a bit oddly shapped, it had in fact been lovingly renovated. The hotels old signature grill work and other decorative pieces (see the ballrooms) are still in place, but the guest rooms are modern and comfortable. The pool, if you haven't seen it, is certainly worth a visit. The hotel location with a door right out to the center of The Magnificent Mile makes its location unbeatable. With a great new wine bar (serves great wines with nice little cheese, olive or sweet plates), the hotel is once again on my list of favorite historic properties.
