Best hotel ever!!!! seriously, the place is beauiful and the rooms are huge wih great bathrooms. The beds are the best, they are beyond comfotable. The room service is fantastic, expensive of course but so is all room service. The food is amazing though and when my mom and i ordered breakfast one morning, we were not very satisifed with the food so we complained and they fully reembursed us.
