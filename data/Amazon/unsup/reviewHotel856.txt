I stayed here in April 2008, and it was really beautiful. I've been in many hotels throughout my life spanning from cheapies to luxe. I've also had experience in real estate, enough to know when a place is in good, clean shape and has great fixtures (I can't help but notice the little things). The ceilings were wonderfully high and the complimentary desserts in the lobby truly blew my mind. Amazing! I've paid three times the price for "luxury" hotels in Las Vegas that weren't even as nice as this. It is noisy if you sleep in a room beside the L train, but I stayed on the opposite side and slept peacefully. I'm coming back here some day!
