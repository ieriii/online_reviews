I didn't stay here, but I love this hotel. I can only imagine, based on the common and conference spaces I've been in over the last two days, what the rooms are like. The lobby is beautiful. Look at the ceiling and fixtures. Breathe it in. Sit a spell. And the conference areas are solid. The catered food is good, and the coffee strong. And the wifi? Provided by the conference organizers, sure, but the signal has been strong in almost every single room I've been in, even the breakout session rooms with awkward pillar-dominated designs. Minus one star because the traffic flow for stairs and escalators isn't always clear. Outside of using the elevators, the floors don't connect well, and it can be hard to find your way around.
