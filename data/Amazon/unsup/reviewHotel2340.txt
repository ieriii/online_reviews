Gorgeous property. Magnificent lobby. Great rooms. Free breakfast downstairs at the restaurant for higher status members. Great concierge food. Right next to the mall. Walking distance to everything. Only annoyance I've found is that bath tubs are slow drains, meaning 30 sec after turning on the water your feet will be under water.
