From all the hotels I have stayed at (everything from the W to the St. Regis), this particular hotel ranks #1 when it comes to concierge and front desk service. 1. Bill, who works front desk, certainly went above and beyond my expectations. Upon check-in, I made a request for a top floor room with a view of the city. Bill was more than obliged to get accommodate my request. However, when I got into my room, the view was only a building. Ironically, a few minutes later, Bill called and wanted to make sure if the view was to my liking. While the room was very spacious and in the corner of the hotel, I admitted to him that the view was not to my taste. Bill then decided to call me back in a few minutes so he could look over the hotel layout in order to find me the perfect room. A few minutes later, he called back and presented me with a room that could be a hit/ miss. Not only did he come up personally to show me the room, but he also brought up the new keys and offered to carry my bags. This by far is the best "above and beyond" experience I have ever encountered. Major props to Bill! 2. Concierge was awesome! Eden was very sincere and helpful when it came to planning my brunch/ sightseeing. She also gave me her business card and hand wrote her name on the card so I could give to the hostess at the cafe, in order to be 1st on the list. Concierge connections such as that definitely brings value to rate! Thank you, Eden! 3. Stephen Bee (manager on duty), thank you! I want to personally thank you for listening to my feedback and recognizing the W-Team. Your follow-up e-mail was also very much appreciated! Thank you once again and kudos to Bill, Eden, and Stephen!
