As a retired Hotel General Manager and owner of 2 hotels I want to express my appreciation of the service and quality of the hotel and food operation as excellent. The total staff from the front door to the bellman, front desk staff, and food service peronnel was one of the best hotels I've stayed at. I have traveled plenty and must say for a young operation I give them a 10. The room cleanliness as the entire hotel is spotless. Go see for yourself how great this hotel is. I'm going back. F.
