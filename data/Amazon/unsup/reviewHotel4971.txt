This hotel is fab.I'm on my way back to the UK via USA from backpacking and I can still afford to stay here. $77 per night for 2 in a petite room. The room is way bigger than I expected and is lovely. Air con/heater, clean, super dooper shower, comfy bed and we even had internet access in the room for free which I don't think was suppose to happen but try your luck if you have a lap top. They do have free wi-fi in the looby though and free fresh coffee in the morning. The in room service menu is also pretty reasonable (mains for about $15).It's quiet at night apart from the odd siren of the ambulances going to the nearby hospital but it's not disruptive at all.Location is great too. Red line metro is 2 blocks up on Chicago st, the buses are right outside and it's easily walkable in about 20 mins to Sears tower and Grant Park etc.If you stay here I would recommend going to The Soupbox up on East Chicago st, that was a fab place to get gorgeous soup for $7 and I'm picky about soup.
