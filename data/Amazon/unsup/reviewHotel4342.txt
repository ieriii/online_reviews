Golden peacock embroidered doors and bright hollywood like blue illuminous lights entice you, elegantly into the world of the Hilton. Not just any Hilton but the Palmer Hilton. Door men available 24/7 becking to your every call, every eyelash, every breathe. Monroe street, named after one of the most iconic women in the world, her beauty bedazzled and created a vision. A vision many like to recreate, renew in her honour. The same can be said by the centre piece- A golden statue of Romeo and Juliet. This hotel was made in the name of love. Sure the ending was no fairytale, but what real life story is? Its the journey that counts...I dont think any couple could put that across better. This is what the Palmer is about, falling in love and leaving. The lobby was sensational, something a Leonardo Di Vinci would be proud of. In fact I don't think I'd be surprised if someone said he heard this place was being constructed so he came to life to leave his final masterpiece. A bold statement I make, true as hell I mean it. It wont disappoint you. A historical fact about this outstanding and prestigious hotel, Its the birthplace of elevators. That's right, the man that constructed this hotel had a dream. To build a hotel that kissed the sky and gave people a taste of heaven, in the most versatile, incredible city in the world- Chicago. The winds may shake my faith, they may shake my soul...But the windy city will not shake my love for it.
