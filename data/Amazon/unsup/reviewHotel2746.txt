Stayed at the James on our recent trip to watch the Cards maul the Bears. Great location with lots of food options nearby. Very friendly staff, and nicely appointed room, though quite small. The bed was super comfy and the linens and pillows were awesome. Big-ass flat screen TV, but as is the usual deal in a hotel, no HiDef, meaning crappy-looking stretch-o-vision. Wouldn't normally care but we did catch the Sunday night football game in the room, and could have used a decent picture. Oddly, the TV kept turning itself off randomly. But enough about the TV, it's quite inconsequential. The bathroom was great, with a nice shower and high-end toiletries. All in all, a very comfortable place to spend 3 nights, and would definitely do it again and recommend to anyone without hesitation.
