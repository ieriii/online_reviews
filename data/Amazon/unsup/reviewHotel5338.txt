I have never had such a positive experience. Every single staff experience was off-the-chart positive. They were all extremely helpful, made every accommodation possible. I can't say enough nice things about the front desk staff and Todd the chef concierge. The staff of Public are the best ambassadors that the city could have, and made my vacation.
