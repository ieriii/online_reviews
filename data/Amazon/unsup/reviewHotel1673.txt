Very tasteful and "funky" decor. Staff was super nice. Wine hour is a wonderful touch. Rooms were a little on the small side, but larger than I was expecting for a downtown "historic" hotel. We had no noise problems (maybe we were the ones making noise for others though?! LOL) Cabs readily available. Walking distance to Union station and Ogilvie transportation center - and madison st. water taxi.  Overall, nothing was amazingly outstanding, but everything was very nice.
