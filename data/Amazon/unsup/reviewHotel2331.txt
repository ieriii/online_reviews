It's a great budget option if you're really looking for proximity to the Loop and Mag mile. We spent a night here just to get away, and overall I was pleased. The hotel is bustling, the service is attentive and efficient, and the space is very clean despite heavy traffic. The room is very small, and we paid extra for a 'large room', but that doesn't bother me for a short stay with 2 adults. However, the room really lacked basic amenities: no mini fridge, blow dryer, silverware or glassware. Just would have been nice to know ahead of time, so I could have planned a little better. Nice space, and I would stay here again. I can't imagine having kids in the room, though - just too small for a family space!
