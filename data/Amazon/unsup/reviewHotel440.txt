The reason I am giving it 3 stars is my housekeeper was amazing. She was there outside my room every morning and I could get anything I wanted towels what not. When I first arrived I didn't have a do not disturb sign. She was just walking down the hall and I caught her and she returned with one in no time. On the other hand the food establishment inside the hotel was lousy. They cooked everything on Coleman camp stoves and hot plates plus it took over 45 min for a breakfast sandwich. On Monday when I got back to my room my key no longer worked. So I had to go stand in line at the front desk. It seemed there was always a wait at the front desk. If you stay here make sure to get your reservation on http://hotels.com or Travelocity or what ever your favorite travel site is. It will be cheaper than calling them. I called just to ask about getting the same price they said they couldn't which I found odd. But hey what ever floats their boat. The price was very good for staying in Chicago plus free parking. Our tab was $82 a night. It was near china town which was great because I love chinese food. Plus it was only like a 10 min walk to the red line which I used during my whole trip.
