Another non-snarky review from a proletarian Yelper-- The South Loop Hotel is quite a bargain and much nicer than some reviewers might suggest -- it has free parking! The staff works hard to be pleasant and accommodating. The desk clerk Kierra was very sociable when I checked in, and within five minutes of getting to my room, she called to be sure everything in the room was acceptable (I've never had that happen before). At dinner, my waiter, James, was equally nice: when I asked him to wrap up the few remaining mini-corn muffins for later, he threw in a few extra from the kitchen--a great midnight snack. The other few people with whom I had contact were equally helpful. The whole staff--clerks, bartenders, waiters -- try hard here. (And there's free parking!) My room was quite comfortable and spacious, and even though there is an el just a block away, the room was quiet. The bed was quite firm, which I liked. But others may find the beds here a little too hard. The bathroom appeared to have been updated recently. The bathtubs are rather deep, so be careful stepping in. The hotel is in an isolated part of Chicago, so you can't really walk anywhere. But then, as I've said--free parking! I paid only $90 for the night. Yes, I could have paid 2X (or 3X) that for an uptown room with minibar free Starbucks valet service room service in-room pedicures and gilt-edged Bibles in the night-stand. But all I want when I stay over in Chicago is a room in which I can sleep comfortably and safely. And free parking. And two hard-boiled eggs.
