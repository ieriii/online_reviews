The Allerton had a great staff and everything that you would want in a Hotel. The location was also handy and the bar and restaurant on the second floor were pretty swanky.  I had read that the rooms were old and small. It is an old hotel - but recently refurbished. So all the furnishings and paint are bright and shiny, but yeah, they are small old-school rooms and bathrooms.  Because I suspected this was the case after reading reviews - we stayed in a Jr. Suite. Still not a huge room - but it really gave us all the space we needed. The bed was great, room service was prompt. Front desk and bellmen were helpful.  One Note: For those of you coming to Chicago and don't realize it - parking is expensive. We paid $48 a night to park at the Allerton. The cheapest overnight parking in the area was $36 and a couple blocks away.
