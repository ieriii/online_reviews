I came to stay at the Essex Inn for a wedding, and the group rate was very reasonable - especially for a hotel in the loop! It was completely comfortable, and the staff were courteous. They were quite understanding and helpful while working out a little error in our reservation. The concierge (Bill) was remarkably friendly and helpful!  Little inconveniences keep this from being a five-star review: sometimes the elevators were slow, the bathroom was awkward to share, the wireless internet wasn't free (I know - but if it had been, I'd have been impressed!), and the television channels had a strange numbering system that I never figured out (no channel guide in the room). Those are little things, but in the interest of saving a five-star review for a truly wonderful place, I'm holding back in this case. I'm not hard to please, though, and I'd recommend this place/stay there again.Other useful things to know: 1. The room (king bed) had a fridge, iron & ironing board, single-mug coffee maker (powder creamer), and hair dryer.2. The bathroom came with plenty of linens of course, face soap, body soap, shampoo (which didn't lather a whole lot but got the job done), and conditioner.3. The weight room had exercise bikes, treadmills, elliptical trainers, nautilus-type machines, and free weights. There wasn't a space with mats to lie down but I liked the rest of it. It looked out on the pool.4. I never saw a room-service menu. But I didn't look hard; just went across the street to Kitty O'Shea's (in the Hilton) and ordered out.
