We reserved a block of rooms for our wedding here. We did have some initial issues with reserving the block, but it was during the first week that the hotel opened, so I am willing to chalk that up to growing pains. Once we got there, everything went very smoothly and we received top-notch service. There are plenty of common areas, indoors and out, to gather groups in. The fitness center is fantastic. The location is prime. The restaurant/bar is tasty. The price is average for the area, but the decor and facilities are brand new. We also took a lot of our wedding photos in and around the hotel and they are beautiful! I absolutely love the aesthetic of this place!
