I rented a room here for new year's but it seems as if the Best Western is a hotel chain suited for college students and twenty somethings to have parties at. This is the second BW I stayed in since the first one was in Charleston in southern IL and even they were the same way college students renting rooms and just being an overall disturbance. Because it was new years the pre and post drunken behavior is a given especially for those who don't have much in the way of being considerate of other guests who would like to have some peace and quiet. The hotel should make college students sign waivers so they're put on notice about being asked to leave if they're being disruptive and disturbing other guests and destroying hotel property. Not to mention the train going by every 10 mins which makes it hard to sleep at night. Breakfast was mediocre it could have offered healthy choices like egg whites and skim milk. Not to mention it was rather weird to have some homeless guy saluting buses as they passed on the street and harassing pedestrians as they walked down the street and then dancing in front of the window as me and my boyfriend ate breakfast. Either way the stay could have been better.
