We used theWit as our "host hotel" for our wedding on January 7, 2012. We also used one of the suites for the on-site hair and make-up for the wedding party. My husband and I also stayed at theWit on our wedding night.Overall, I was very happy with theWit. It was easy to set-up a group block of rooms for our guests and we received quick responses from the event office when we had a question about the group block. Unfortunately, after our group block sold out (before the cut-off date), theWit was not able to add any more rooms to our group block and, as a result, several of our guests had to pay the rack rate. This was all in accordance with the group block contract and nothing that theWit did wrong, however, make sure that you understand this if you set-up a group block at theWit.theWit also successfully delivered all of our guests bags to our guests. Our guests had a lot of compliments on the hotel.The only reason that I did not give theWit 5 stars is because our room service for lunch in our suite took over 90 minutes to arrive. It was a very large order, however, they stated that it would take 45 minutes and did not call when it got delayed.Other than this small hiccup, we were very happy with theWit and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a hotel to use for a group block.
