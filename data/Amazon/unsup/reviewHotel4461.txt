The lobby is beautiful. Other than that, this hotel kind of sucks. Our 14th floor room smelled *really* musty. The bedding would have been beautiful, except for the conspicuous stains on the throw pillows. One can only imagine... No coffee maker in the room! WTF? It was really loud as well. We asked for a room away from the elevator to avoid hearing people trekking in and out all night. But nonetheless, constant noise. And there was some mysterious whirring noise all night long that I think was an ice machine. Luckily I brought ear plugs. The room looked nice, and the lobby was beautiful, but all-in-all, not a comfy stay at all.
