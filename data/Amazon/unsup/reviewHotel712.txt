I just got back from a week long convention at the McCormick Center in Chicago. I was very satisfied with this choice for a hotel. I typically stay at Marriott properties when I travel. This was one of the better Courtyards I have ever stayed at. The rooms were clean and standard "Courtyard" setup with the exception of the beds and linens that seemed brand new. The bed was really comfortable, rivaling Westin's famed heavenly beds. The staff was bright and attentive no matter if I was wearing a suit in the AM or crawling back from Rush Street in my jeans and a ball cap at 1:30 in the morning. Location wise this hotel was perfect. Shopping and nightlife is right outside the door. Most other attractions are walking distance or a short cab ride away. The fitness center is small but clean and functional. Actually it did have about six (6) treadmills plus free weights et al. The hotel restaurant, Viand, has a nice bar and half priced wine special on Tuesday nights that is such a value in Chicago it drags in some friendly locals. I would definitely go back.
