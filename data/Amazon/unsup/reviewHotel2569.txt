What the heck! This place--when it was newly opened--was such a delightful breath of fresh air. Now they went cheapo on the alcohol for their martinis leaving a most unpleasant taste in ones mouth. :( You can't tease us with the grey goose and break us with Skyy! It's just cruel. So, one recommendation: specifically request your martinis with your liquor of choice lest your sense of taste be bombarded with clearly subpar alcohol. Eh, I still come back time after time. It's just something about those Mies Van der Rohe Barcelona chairs--gets me everytime.
