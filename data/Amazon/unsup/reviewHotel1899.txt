I attended their NYE 2009 party and I had a fabulous time. I really loved the way the hotel looked when you walked in and the fact that its in the middle of the city--a lot different then Naperville! The decor is very nice and makes you feel good when you walk in.  The rooms were very nicely decorated; however, were kind of small (negative 1 star). We didn't get a view from our room so that was another downfall.  Also, being NYE, we could totally hear our neighbors until 6 am in the morning partying.  I would def love to come back here for NYE 2010 just because I had so much fun with friends and our neighbors. BUT, I would not stay here any other time just because the rooms were so small and the walls are thin!
