Loved this hotel! It was in an amazing location considering we didn't have a car. We were close to many attractions, the train, and several bus stops! The staff was amazing... so nice and helpful! The train is right in front of the hotel and our room faced it but you could barely hear it. It never woke us up or anything. Very clean and would stay here again when in the area!
