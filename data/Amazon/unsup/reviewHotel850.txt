Excellent value for the money. Price was easily $50-$100 less than comparable hotels. Location was outstanding, right on the doorstep of the el. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Housekeeping was good, concierge did her best to be helpful (Peggy) but maybe didn't quite hear what it is that we were interested in. Perhaps because we didn't fit the demo of what was in the hotel at the time. I'd definitely recommend it to the budget traveller who wanted to be in the middle of it all and not stay in a fleabag motel. My only gripe would be what others have said-no coffee maker in the rooms. Tough to go down to the lobby in PJ's and grab one and the time frame negates sleeping in.
