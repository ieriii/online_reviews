OK.... 29th floor, awesome view of Lake Michigan, Bliss Spa treatments and an awesome breakfast at Wave... this was purely a wonderful and pleasurable weekend get-a-way for us. Service was spectacular, bathrooms were very cool and modern and the room itself was spacious and warm! This is the only hotel in Chicago that sits right off Lake Michigan with an amazing view! Not bad for the W in Chicago!
