Small rooms, loud street noise from the El, old furnishings, and expensive "extras" make the Palmer House a plain rip off. The lobby is impressive and gorgeous, and yes, some of the rroms have been renovated, but I've been stuck in an older room for a week, which sucks. Throw in another $18 for internet per day and another $18 per day for use of the health club and the cost adds up. I would definitely look elsewhere!
