I'm giving the Congress Plaza Hotel three stars because it was the only place in Chicago that had a suite that could fit 16 people. Mind you it technically on slept 6 but we shoved 16 people into this two room plus foyer and bathroom with one king and two double bed suite! And after the 16 of us divided up the cost of the suite I think it was only $35 a person. Not bad for a night in Chicago! Plus I believe the management caught on to our little charade but they never said a word. Not to mention we all slept comfy on air mattresses, the floor and the beds! If you are looking for a cheap way to stay in Chicago this would be the way to go. I just suggest getting along with everyone that you are staying with! The hotel itself is okay but does need some up keep especially the bathroom. It's an older hotel and I would suggest dusting but I can't complain we got a great deal!
