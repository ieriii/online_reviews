Pros - View of Lake Michigan - Food was solid combined with outdoor seating - Location - great location - close to Navy Pier & Michigan Ave Cons -Rooms/bathroom are small (even with upgrade) -Air-conditioning obscenely loud (according to the wife) -Rooms look dated but they tried hard to update them (Used to be an old Days Inn) -Wife thought the room smelled (1st room was smoky and we got switched; second room has carpet cleaner overkill) -Service was poor - specifically bell desk shuttling us a new key that never happened and I ultimately headed down there. Conrad & Blackstone are still my go-to properties in Chi-town. Still figuring out the best SPG option.
