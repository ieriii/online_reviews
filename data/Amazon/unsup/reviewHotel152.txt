this is a clean hotel with comfy pillows and beds. Everything was clean and the staff was helpful. Only weird thing was the service came in and cleaned up the room but didn't leave new toiletries. Upon request we got all we needed! The rooms were a good size and we were on the 3rd floor. Due to some decorative awnings we could only look down out our window to the street. I would have liked to have been able to look up as well. It's located in a great spot close to everything. Navy Pier was our farthest walk at almost a mile. I will say the window glass must be pretty thin because there was a bit of street noise. I would rank this hotel somewhere between Holiday Inn & Marriott. It was a nice place I would go to again and was well worth the 110.00 rate
