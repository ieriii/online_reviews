This modern Embassy Suites features very fast glass elevators, so just riding up to your room is cool. Look down upon the atrium space to the main floor below. The rooms are all mini-suites, and the buffet breakfast is a big spread. The hotel is connected to a large movie theater complex and is not too far from many of Chicago's attractions, though it not really next to any of them.
