I was born and raised in Oak Park, and my dad still lives there, so I had actually never been inside the Carleton until I booked a block of rooms there for out-of-town guests that attended my wedding in June of 2011. The Carleton is pretty sweet! It is old-fashioned without being run down. Our guests enjoyed staying there. It's in a nice part of Oak Park, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby (as well as the Harlem Green Line and Metra stops- easy access to Chicago). I liked the variety of rooms (and prices) that were available for our guests to book. My husband and I booked the hot tub suite for two nights before and after our wedding. The hot tub was really nice and the room was perfect for all of the hair and makeup needs of my bridal party. The front desk staff was so nice and accommodating of us and all of our guests. Everyone recognized me as "the bride" and was especially considerate of my needs throughout the weekend. Their customer service made me feel special and very taken care of. We definitely brought the party back to Poor Phil's on Saturday following the wedding, and all of our guests had a blast. Thank you to the Carleton for putting up with us. We had a great experience there during our wedding weekend, and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Oak Park!
