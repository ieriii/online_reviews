Second time staying here. First time was solo for a conference. This time I was traveling with my 8 year old son and our Labrador. I wasn't sure what to expect this time! Actually, had a great experience. My son loved the Microsoft Surface tables in the lobby and the hotel's proximity to the Lego store on Michigan Ave.! Our room was great -- spacious with a spectacular view of the river and the City. The hotel staff was great about us having a dog. They even gave us a special door hanger (see pic) to use -- probably to alert room service staff. BTW, room service food is solid and the deep dish pizza is great. If you are traveling with a dog, this hotel is nicely situated for some ood walks either along the river, down to Navy pier, or along Michigan Avenue. There is also a park with some grassy areas just in front and down the hill from the hotel. No walking for blocks to find a place for your pooch to relieve themselves. Two bits of advice. First, don't self park. I chose to do this to save money (not sure that I did) and to better maneuver the dog after check-in. I should have taken it slow (they would have let me leave the car out front while I took the bags and the dog up) and let them valet the car. We never used the car again while we were there -- opting to walk or take a cab. Self parking was a pain. Second, try the Javatini in the Java bar (open after 3PM). It's incredible.
