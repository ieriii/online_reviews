So I didn't say here, I just attended a conference. As far as conference facilities go it seemed nice. The rooms were generally clean, there were clean glasses and water for the discussants. When there was a coffee bar set up, it was replenished. Same with food at receptions. Over all it seemed on par with what I would expect from a hotel's service during a conference.
