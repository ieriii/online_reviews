Hotel Allegro is the one shining light in my whole Chicago trip. I knew I could depend on Kimpton to save the day. As with all Kimpton properties, the hotel is very chic and the rooms have personality. I booked a double room under a promotional code, so rate was about $119/night, which I think is a great deal for the location. It's close to the CTA, so traveling around is super easy. The only negative I can think of is thin walls, but I can live with it since I'm a deep sleeper.
