Although it's not the newest or hippest hotel in the area, it boasts of a convenient location and good staff. It's not too close to the craziness of Magnificent Mile, but it is just close enough. Although it sits right North of the river, it is not far away from the attractions on the South side. The Navy Pier is also close by. Rate are affordable and the room is more than adequate. I will stay here again.
