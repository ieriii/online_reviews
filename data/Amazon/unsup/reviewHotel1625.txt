After both getting some surprisingly great holiday bonuses, my husband and I decided that while we had to attend a wedding reception here, we would make it a staycation. We used http://Hotels.com for booking since they have the frequent traveler 10-night-get-one option and were working towards our free night. The rooms at Hotel 71 were modern and spacious. Usually stark modern hotels are not cozy but 71 rocked it. We had a small issue (they oversold our room type) which was immediately remedied and we got an unexpected upgrade which was a win in our book. We got the premier king river view room and when we walked in, I was pinching myself wondering if a room this nice could really exist at the price we paid. Its hard to find anything worth complaining about so I am giving them a solid five stars. For the wedding reception room there were about 100 people and it was not crammed and the views were great especially since our friend's family came in from out of town.
