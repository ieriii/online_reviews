Solid hotel for the loop! The rooms are updated and clean but nothing out of the ordinary like a boutique hotel.  Besides being walking distance to Millennium Park, the Sears (Willis) Tower, etc. I also liked....  - About a block away from the Madison CTA transit station (Brown line)  - The Starbucks and sandwich/coffee shop across the street. - The included continental breakfast - comes in handy especially on Sunday where most all nearby restaurants are closed. (waffle station, bacon, eggs, muffins, cereals, etc)  - Pool is cool - Jacuzzi for 2, yes you are soaking in my foot water.  - Free Wifi - Decent rates @ $150 / nite - Primarily in the Financial District part of downtown, it get's pretty quiet after hours and weekends. Sundays are barren (everything is closed). Solid 3.5 star rating. Rounding up for they had an ice cream vending machine! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_)
