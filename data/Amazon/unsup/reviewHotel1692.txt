Trying SO desperately hard to be hip and upscale, but there's only so much you can do with a shoebox, I say.  On a sidenote, I once crafted a Star Wars figure village fashioned out of shoeboxes. Spent four nights at the Allegro and I really didn't find anything to complain about, save for the peak time rush hours on the three small elevators. I also can't find the words to really rave about any particular aspect of the place, either. It was a solid three-star experience. My room was small and a bit quirky (two separate closets and only three small drawers to work with), but it was clean, quiet, and the bed was comfy. Huge flat screen TV and iHome were nice touches, but the flat screen is WAY too big for the room I did not unlock the minibar for fear of setting of some kind of remote alarm and starting WWIII, and then getting a bill for having done so. The third star is solidly-earned for the 5:00 - 6:00 FREE wine happy hour. A very nice touch. I attended a conference in the hotel as well, and all of the various fixin's were ok: coffee and pastry in the mornings; cookies, soft pretzels, and chips and guac in the afternoons provided a nice variety of sugar rush fixes. All in all, a solid hotel, but $289 per night seemed like a stretch. This is the third hotel at which I've spent significant time in Chi-town in the past year, and The James still holds the torch.
