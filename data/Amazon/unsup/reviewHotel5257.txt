In short: the only hotel in downtown Chicago with free parking as far as I know. Given that hotel parking ranges anywhere from $15-40 in downtown (last I checked) this is an extremely attractive option for motorists.For the real review:I stayed at the hotel for six days, sharing a two bed room with a friend, that came with a bathroom with a shower and a bathtub, sink, small TV, coffee maker, hair dryer, an iron and an ironing board. Oh, and the heating, which was crucial in the January Chicago. The location is a few blocks away from the Grand/State metro stop on the Red line, which took about five minutes to walk there. As much as I appreciated the closeness of it in winter, I am sure people would love it in a fairer weather. The room was adequate sized, perhaps a bit small for two adults, but the room was mainly for catching some sleep and watching some TV. The room does have free Wi-Fi, but I had trouble getting the signal, and even when the signal was there, it was not fast. I think the place has a business center as well, but never tried it. There is a computer on the lobby for guest use that is fast, but certain sites were off limit, like facebook. There's both surface and underground parking lots, medium sized and free access to go in and out with a parking pass if you are staying there. The place also has a pool, which I never tried, and also has a pizzeria, which I did not try as well. The cleaning service is top notch.Is there a better hotel for the price range in downtown Chicago? Maybe. This is very much your average hotel, but I'm sure the parking option will attract customers. The location helps too!
