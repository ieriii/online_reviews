Stayed here for one night via http://Priceline.com for $59. For the money, it was obviously a good deal. The doormen are very polite and on the spot. Bar is a cozy little place to escape the city on a cold night. Decor has a very modern/upscale feel to it and is nicely done. Front desk clerk was very helpful as well. The rooms, while nicely appointed, are a little on the small side. The rooms come with flat screens, free wifi and a work desk. Bed was very comfortable. Outside noise from the hallways entered the room pretty easily, and my room was at the end of the hallway. Can't imagine what staying across from the elevator sounds like. Showers are awesome, but the sink is very small with barely enough room to fit your hands under the faucet to wash them. Also, there is no room around the sink to keep any of your stuff on. They have a spa, and I tried to set up a massage. Was told they had 3 appointment for the next day in the late morning/noon area. Got off the phone with them, called the front desk to arrange late checkout, called right back and supposedly they were all booked. Talking about a 2 minute window here. I don't think it was even physically possible to field that many calls that quickly. Don't call yourself a full service spa if you can't fit in one massage in an 18 hour window. Overall, nice place that I wouldn't have a problem staying at again.
