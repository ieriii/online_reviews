Love the pool at the Intercontinental Hotel on Michigan Avenue. The pool is back in business after being shut down by the city of Chicago for a few months (like many other pools in the city). Well, now the most famous pool in Chicago is back and so refreshing...not small kid friendly so bring water wings, floaties, etc for the small kids. Health club staff, Robert and Tereza, are exceptional. Always friendly and courteous....a great asset to the hotel. Locker rooms are clean and have dry saunas in both the men's and women's sides. Always good for a sweat! Would be great if they could remove the massage room in the men's locker room and replace it with a steam room. It's too noisy in the locker room to have the massage room next to the showers. Ask to have your massage in the more private space. Also, the health club is getting all new flooring and new equipment this week. Can't wait to try out the new state of the art equipment.
