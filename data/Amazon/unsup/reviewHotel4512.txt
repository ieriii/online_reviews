We just had a long weekend getaway to Chicago and the Palmer House took good care of us. We prepaid online for a room on the Executive Levels and got a great deal. The room was large, the bed was so comfy, the sheets were very nice. The lounge on the 23rd floor had cookies out in the afternoon, hot hors d'ouevres in the evening (plus a cash bar), light breakfast fare in the morning, and coffee and drinks all day long. This was a really nice bonus to staying there. The lobby is beautiful, the bar closes a bit early though for a city like Chicago. The staff was friendly, the location is near several train lines for zipping around, the nearby restaurants weren't the absolute best but overall I am very glad we chose to stay here.
