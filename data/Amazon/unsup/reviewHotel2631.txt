I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff is great, the rooms were spacious and really cool, and the food / bar are outstanding. The details in the decoration and food presentation make this place really stand out. Chic and modern while also cozy and welcoming, the decor is really to die for. Finally, the music played in the lobby and in restaurant was really nice. The people here really try to make you feel welcome, and they obviously take a lot of pride in their work. Overall just a really fabulous hotel.
