This hotel is amazing! Granted, I worked here, so that might be why I'm biased, but everyone from the housekeepers, to the front desk staff, to the location couldn't be better. Where else can you have Ann Sather's Cinnamon rolls, the Cubs, Angelina's and the lively nightlife, within a place to crash that isn't your own.The friendly staff keeps everyone happy and in check, and not to mention the cinnamon rolls!This place is a great location for someone that wants to stay out of the down town area (honestly, Chicagoans know there isn't really ANYTHING down town anyways...) and still with the charm of a neighborhood inn. Careful though, there are only 59 rooms, so it books up FAST!** They are adding more suites soon...
