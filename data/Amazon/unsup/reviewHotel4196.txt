the good: *convenient location *when they didn't clean out the room in time, they upgraded us to the top floor. the bad: *they forgot to bring us another comforter, and when they did, they literally left it tossed on the bed *it could've been a lot cleaner *there was a mysterious charge that showed up on the bill (it was erased, though.) i suppose i would give it 3.5 if possible, but i'm rounding down to a 3.
