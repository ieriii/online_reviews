Got a good deal on a room here--decent location, but a bit boring in the Upper East Side kind of way. Rooms are very nice and spacious. I'd stay here again. The building used to be luxury apartments way back when, but then morphed into a hotel, and now a "luxury boutique" hotel. It's got a nice wood-paneled lobby that used to serve as a private restaurant for the former luxury apartments.
