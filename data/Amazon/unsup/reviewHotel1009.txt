This is a very nice hotel in a central location for a decent price! I just returned from my thanskgiving holiday in Chicago and was very happy there. Staff are friendly, the rooms are clean and the free extras are great: free breakfast, free internet, free cocktails and antipasti in the lounge on the sixth floor, and every room has a collection of jazz and soul music that you can play over the dvd player. It is a five minute walk to the Magnificent Mile and a very nice 15 Minute walk to Millenium Park. I loved Chicago, and this hotel was part of my experience - a real deal for what it has to offer.
