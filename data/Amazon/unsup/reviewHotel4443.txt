A beautiful hotel right in the middle of downtown Chicago. I've been to several meetings and conferences here and everything is top-notch. It's also a very historical hotel so gives you a really nice feeling of being part of something older instead of all those new, fancy, "edgy" hotels you can find elsewhere. I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you are visiting Chicago.
