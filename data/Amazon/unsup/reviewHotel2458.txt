Loved this hotel! Why? I was staying here on a business trip for a trade show and sharing a room with a colleague. When I asked about an upgraded room, the front desk gal said "no problem". I went up to our room and it looked pretty standard. I thought to myself, "maybe she thought being on the club level was a good enough upgrade". And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a door on the other side of the room that was half open. "What is that?", I thought. I walked over and opened the door and looked in. Woo! Hoo! It was a second bathroom!!! It was a dream to be traveling with someone and we were each able to have our own space. The best Hilton upgrade ever. Aside from that, the pub in the hotel has pretty good food (and beer). The location of the hotel was great for what we were there for. The fitness center was $15 for a day or $25 for the entire stay. At first, I hesitated. I paid the $25 and was not disappointed. It was actually a gym for people in the neighborhood. It had an indoor track and a ton of cardio machines and weights. Worth every penny.
