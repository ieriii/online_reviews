If you want a clean, well-located, efficient hotel with all the essentials of modern life (i.e. complementary wireless, printing and fitness center), this is your place. I don't care about the small size of the rooms, as long as they are affordable. The liberty office chairs are very comfortable. Two suggestions: Everything that I needed was in the room except a cork opener. The hotel should provide a better body wash. The soap leaves your skin very dry.
