We booked a room at the Tremont through PriceLine. Our room faced the John Hancock Tower. We enjoyed the stay. I would book another room there. I liked the location. The staff was very helpful, the room was clean and nice. There weren't a lot of amenities, but I didn't need them. We were here on a business trip and this hotel was perfect for us.
