This was my first time in Chicago and I was very impressed by the service at the Marriott! Neil the doorman even shined my shoes with the workers kit because they didn't have anything available to the guests. The because he didn't think they looked too different offered to take them down the street for me to a professional. He made a cab wait for me and they hap ply held my bags for a whole day. The room was nice spacious and warm! I highly recommend!
