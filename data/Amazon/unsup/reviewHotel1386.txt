Went to the lobby bar with my cousin last night, around 1amish. I was dressed up, and she was in her pajamas. Was unimpressed with the round bar just sitting in the lobby, and very unimpressed with the menu that had $14 drinks.  That is when the very character-y bartender (stout black guy who has a lot to say and I approve) told me that his drinks were certainly worth it, and I'd be buzzed after one. I have alcoholic genes, so I can drink most men under the table and never catch a buzz, but I digress. The one tasty, fruity martini got me beyond buzzed. I was drunk. So this yelp's to you, Mr. Bartender. I am only taking one star away because I still am unimpressed with the vibe. But the bartender himself, gets 5 stars. He even flirted with my shy cousin. AS FAR AS THE HOTEL ITSELF: I don't know what to say about it. There was a swingers ball going on, and that was pretty exciting. What kind of establishment is this? Added to my "hotel bar" experience, in a cool kind of way.
