Now that's better. This is my second time staying at La Quinta. Room: Spacious, with an LCD TV and a workstation. The beds were average, but they did their job. The bathroom was nice but the shower was awkward. The glass was transparent. FAIL. The glass is supposed to be translucent, of course I was in the bathroom by myself but the glass (and mirror) took forever to steam up. It would have been one thing if the mirror wasn't in front of the shower but it was. I felt so weird showering. Pool and other amenities: There was an indoor pool, but Chicago is a pretty chilly place at the end of September. You really don't need to go swimming. (And who goes to Chicago for the pool in their hotel anyway?) The "continental" breakfast had eggs, bacon and sausage. Now THAT'S what I call a breakfast. Not waffles, fruit and assorted breads. Location: LOVED it. It was in the heart of Downtown/The Loop. I was in walking distance to State Street! There's also a Walgreens, Dunkin' Donuts, Jimmy John's, Starbucks, Chipotle and several other regional chain restaurants all right outside the front door. Miscellaneous: It's right next to an eL train station. It's pretty reasonably priced for a hotel smack dab in the heart of Chicago too. Had a great time staying here. Would definitely consider using this hotel again, if it wasn't for the self-voyeuristic shower.
