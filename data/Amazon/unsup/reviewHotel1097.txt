A Definite Winner! Stayed here for 2 nights (Friday and Saturday), and had a wonderful time. The grand entrance is a small bar area with check in to the right and a dual restaurant bar area to the left. A set of grand stairs directly faces you, you know you are at the right place. The rooms are decently sized, the sheets are organic and bed was soft; I loved the small vanity area as well as dual shower and bathtub. Let's not forget the adjustable flatscreen! Loved it! The room resonates modern minimalism, clean lines, simple colors and plenty of compartments for all your needs. This hotel is walking distance to the train and plenty of buses to get around the city. Here are 2 small complaints: 1. Towels could use some downey 2. Restaurant/bar called Aria is below par and over-priced Nonetheless, I would recommend this hotel for anyone who's visiting the city for a weekend and looking for a great place to share in the moment.
