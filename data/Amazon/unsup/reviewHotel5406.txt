The price is good and by good I mean inexpensive. You pretty much get what you pay for. The hotel needs to updated. Personally I love newer looking and moder hotels and the Whitehall is not that at all. But the location is awesome. It is right by mag mile, the Hancock, the water tower and walking distance from many more Chicago landmarks. The staff is very nice and welcoming. There is no ice machine. You have to call the front desk and they will bring you ice. It was convenient that there were 2 restaurants connected to the hotel. One elevator broke for awhile and I had to wait awhile to go back up to my room. Overall I would stay here again because of the price and location.
