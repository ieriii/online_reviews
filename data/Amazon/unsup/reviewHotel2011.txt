My husband and I stayed at the Radisson Blu Aqua last weekend for two nights. We loved this hotel! Everyone at the hotel was very nice and helpful with questions or quick to respond with requests for additional towels. The rooms are beautifully decorated and very very quiet. The beds and pillows were high end and very comfortable. We loved the book lights on each side of the bed too. The bathroom had a spa like zen feel. The restaurant and staff were fantastic. One evening we went down to the bar for a nightcap and found the ambiance very romantic and relaxing too. We will definitely be back!
