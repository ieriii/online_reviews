We used this as the cheap hotel option for our guests for our wedding. I think we had a rate of $89 a night the weekend we had it, which was great for those that didnt want to spend too much. No complaints on the rooms from anyone that I heard of. It is a little bit of an older hotel and not too many amenities, but they have updated some things and for the price it was great. One guest got turned away because he arrived late, which is something that should not happen for a group. I never followed up on it, so I'm not sure what happened exactly but thats what I heard. Either way they should have made some arrangment to get them situated. We also had some problems with guests getting rooms in our block, people saying that the block was full when it really wasn't. So it was extra work involved on our part to get that figured out, which having extra stress when planning a wedding isn't so much fun.
