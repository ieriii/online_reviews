I just had my wedding at Hotel Allegro and it was perfect! I cannot say enough good things about Kerry Craig, their wedding coordinator. Kerry was on top of things on day 1. She is organized, professional and so nice to work with. My husband and I could not have done this without her.  The food was really good (every guest said something about it) and I feel like their prices are comparable to others around town. The rooms are a bit small but very nice and the room block rate was amazing. It was a great venue that I would highly recommend to anyone. I would not have changed a thing about my wedding and I definitely thought that the venue was beautifully done.
