It may not have the same celebrity rep as the "Peninz" down the street but this hotel is fantabulastic! It's clean, trendy (but not TOO trendy)and the rooms are a cute suite-style with a separate "sitting/pullout couch" area. A major star for location - right on Michigan Ave in the Magnificent Mile Zone. My favorite part of the Omni is it's lounge - it's a swank but comfy bar on the 4th level. The lounge looks over Michigan Ave so you can check out all that hustle and bustle while you cocktail! Totally reminds me of why I like drinking in hotel bars - guess I will have to go on a new party circuit ASAP.
