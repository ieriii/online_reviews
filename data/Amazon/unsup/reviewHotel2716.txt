I'd recommend this spot to anyone. It's a hip little property that isn't trying too hard, staffed by people who are trying just hard enough. Husband and I took a mid-week vacation here when they had a ridiculous anniversary sale that we couldn't pass up. Every person we came into contact with throughout our stay was fantastic: friendly, helpful, and thorough. The staff at the door, at the counter, in the fitness center, in the halls, all professional and courteous. The room was how I like them: modern but comfy with cookies on the pillows and great entertainment centers. We made ourselves at home and lived picnic style off the Trader Joe's across the street. The bathroom was amazing, sporting the best toiletries possible: 4-oz bottles of Kiehls shampoo, conditioner, and body wash with a Garden Botanika oatmeal cleansing bar. First time I have EVER used a hotel conditioner on my hair. Thanks to the maid for hooking me up with a few for the road... The gym smelled like ranch dressing, but I'm sure there was a perfectly legitimate and temporary reason for this. It's small but wasn't crowded any of the times we went. Individual TVs on the cardio equipment, with better-than-airplane-quality disposable/free (depending on your perspective) headphones. And pitchers of orange water, so refreshing. :) Will definitely be back as soon as I can convince a visiting guest to pay for lodging and let me stay with them, for a change.
