Standard room is very small and basic and comes with some bare-bones amenities. I did my homework beforehand so I wasn't expecting much more than a centrally-located place to crash. As other reviews have noted, don't touch the mini fridge unless you really want something in there, it runs on sensors and will charge you automatically if you fiddle around with it. Elevators are small and slow. Mixed bag of a crowd. Didn't bother with the restaurants or breakfast because of other reviews. But for the online bargain price and location, it's a perfectly serviceable hotel. I also avoided the valet because of what other reviews said and just threw my car in a nearby ramp and I could go and get it on my own time.
