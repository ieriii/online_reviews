I LOVE this hotel! It is brand new and could have been a disaster (service is lacking in this day and age) BUT they are amazing! I would come to have drinks with my boyfriend on The Roof several Thursday's a month and loved the atmosphere and even the service at the lounge even though it was ridiculously crowded and had always wondered what the rest of the hotel was like. So I ended up doing a photo-shoot there for one of my wedding gowns. The hotel gave us a large suite and had us shoot all over the vicinity. The room was beautiful, large and clean. The hotel is filled with wonderful pop art and beautiful colors. The ballroom is long and narrow and has floor to ceiling windows, so much great light and so romantic at night. There is a screening room, library, spa and restaurant. All of the employees were so accommodating and pleasant. I will definitely have relatives stay here or recommend this place for special events.
