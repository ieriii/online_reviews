I have stayed in this hotel ever since I became jealous of another publishing type who had put authors up at the Burnham while me and my people were at the Embassy Suites. So I began my exploration of Chicago hotels. Love and hate. Hate the W Lakeshore for their pretentious, sometimes just mean staff. Love the Holiday Inn Silversmith for really nice and affordable rooms and the unexpected diner and weird, tucked under the L feel. Love what they did to 71 now as much as I hated prior to renovation (and that view from the penthouse rooms -- yea!). LOVE the Sax because you can get food from Bin 36 -- for reals, that is worth the stay (have breakfast there!!!). Love the Monaco even though is like every other Monaco -- but the service is so perfect and what a location. Hate that giant Hyatt, love the Palmer house, love that place that USED TO BE the Nikko but is stil so nice. Well, anyhow, I could go on and on and on. I love the Burnham because the staff is wonderful at all times. I leave to go to the drugstore and they wish me well, I return ten minutes later and they ask how things are going. I love the tiny space you cram into for the happy hour wine. I love the nest of pillows I make in my bed. I loved the view of the Chicago theater out my wndow. I love the way the Atwood looks (even if food is spotty when too crowded). I love my clunky hotel key clanking in my pocket. I love the frosted glass on my door. I love the metalwork on the stairs. Traveling a lot to Chicago and not staying at least once at this 150 year ld place is a mistake.
