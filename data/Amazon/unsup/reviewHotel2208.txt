This review is not for the hotel but for the event space. Their main ballroom is just beautiful!! It is magical. When we were outside, having cocktails, I wasn't all that impressed. Then when our party was allowed to proceed into the ballroom, phwooaar! It was love at first sight. The dance floor is big, the columns impressive, with two sweeping stairwells that curve oh-so-sweetly. I think they have a small platform too, perhaps for a band, or just some drunken exhibitionists who want to do the electric slide for everyone to see? It is a really beautiful space for an event - I highly recommend it for a big party. ___________________________________________________ UPDATE 6/9/08 : my girl friends and I went to the wine bar in this hotel last night because it was close / convenient. I did not find the seating arrangement ideal, as we were jammed in between two parties (a drunk, touristy group, and an awkward first date). I'm all about a "howdy" meet-your-neighbor communal table, except...not in a wine bar. Wine bar is for intimacy and intrigue! How can you get that when you hear every whisper, or non-whisper, to your left and right. However, I will forgive them somewhat because they had great chocolate (pepper! jalapeno! raspberry!) and decent cheese selection (Blue Haze, yum) and I had a really rather sublime Oregon pinot noir that came in just the most delicate bowl of a glass. Ahhh, bliss. Then we kind of wandered into the pool and fitness center to check out their pool. Wow, it's awesome. Very Egyptian meets Spanish tile. Very Indiana Jones meets King Arthur's Court.
