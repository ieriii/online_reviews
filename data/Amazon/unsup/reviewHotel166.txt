Mom stayed here on one of her visits and she LOVED it. View of the Hancock. She found the location exceptionally convenient. We had a car and driver at our disposal - scheduled times. Everyone was authentically friendly, but ultimately service-oriented and elegantly mannered. I brought flowers for her and the maid went out of her way to find a bottle/vase for us which worked out perfectly. I sometimes wonder if real service still exists in this modern and too egalitarian society (meaning disrespectful and/or just poor or absent etiquette) and then I think of the Whitehall. Hats off. I suggest setting up your parents here if they like a smaller-scale more personable hotel, someone who remembers what real service is, or anyone you wish to especially impress in subtle and quiet ways without having to choose the modern and massive usual suspects.
