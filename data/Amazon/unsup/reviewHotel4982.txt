My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights in March to visit Chicago. The bed was extremely comfortable with four pillows and a very clean fluffy comforter. The room had a nice flat screen tv with HBO and a lot of channel selections. Very clean and comfortable. Hot shower and clean bathroom. Coffee maker and refrigerator in room. AMAZING city and Lake Michigan view! You could see the Willis Tower (Sears Tower) from our window. The window also opened for fresh air.One of the fewer hotels that had a pool. It was very clean and pretty big sized pool. Lifeguard at all times and opened from 6am until 10pm. There was also a sauna and a weight room with multiple different machines to use for almost any workout. TVs in weight room. Only negative things about the hotel I could say is that the sauna wasn't working when we stayed there and the air conditioner and heater were controlled based on season and worked by water pipes hot or cold. You could choose automatic or manual fan settings. When they put on the cold air it worked very nicely. I would definitely stay here again only about $120 a night and extremely nice for the price
