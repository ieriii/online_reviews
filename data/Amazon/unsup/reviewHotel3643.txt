This hotel was really a great experience with the history that it comes with. The rooms could have been a tad bigger but it was plush and comfy and those windows blacked out if you wanted them too. The bar downstairs stays open fairly late as well as being able to get some food which is always a plus. The biggest gripe I had was the 55 dollars it would cost to park including the fact that the attendant did not take any form of credit cards. The Drake was everything that people say it is, it is more of a historical place to stay and those who appreciate things of that manner would like it but it wasn't the type of place you get pampered at either.
