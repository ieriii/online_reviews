Pretty basic. Good staff. Clean. Short 1 mile walk to the McCormick convention center. Quiet. Shower head and water pressure not that great. La Quinta grade linens and towels. It REALLY IS in the middle of nothing. You'll have to take a cab everywhere. Wireless internet is craptastic at best. You get what you pay for. Don't be a cheap bastard. Spend a little extra for a nicer place.
