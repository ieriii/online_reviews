This is not the average Courtyard. The rooms are pretty typical in terms of layout, cleanliness and quality. The location is in downtown Chicago, so you can get to a ton of restaurants and theaters easily. They do have a full service restaurant and bar, which you normally don't get at the Courtyard. Because they have a restaurant on-site, room service is available. They also have the usual courtyard market and a mini Starbucks.  They also have a doorman. I really don't like this because I have to tip the guy $1-2 bucks every time I get in or out. He hails a cab for me, but this is downtown Chicago. You walk outside and put out your arm, three taxis show up; pretty much any time of the day.
