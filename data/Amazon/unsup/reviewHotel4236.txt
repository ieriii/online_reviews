This hotel is a complete waste of money - consistent with my experience at most big chains these days. No personality. Guest are treated like cattle and nickel-and-dimed. Unbelievable. You'd think in this economy they'd actually try to win/keep customers. The Hyatt charges $250+ a night then has the nerve to charge another $15+ for Internet use (PER PERSON in the same room!), and the rooms aren't even that nice - there was actually construction going on in some places. What is shocking is how people put up with this crap - they must not know better. When I was unable to find a place to sit down and eat lunch at the main bar/restaurant during lunch (the place was packed for a trade show/conference) I noticed a bunch of tables that were blocked off. I asked if our party could sit at one of these tables. The answer was no, they are not open until later. Are you kidding me? And forget about using your cell phone in the main conference rooms - they won't work. Amazing. I checked out after one night, went around the block and found a nicer hotel at a third of the price that offered free wireless (even free access to desktop computers in the lobby so you can print your tickets prior to departing), unlimited bottled water and had superior service - like they actually cared about their customers. Well, they won me over and thankfully they have locations in most major cities. Never again Hyatt. Bye.
