Overpriced, poor service. Generally when I go to a place that costs around $400 a night I expect to be treated well and it to be a memorable experience. When I got there the king size bed I reserved was not available so my girlfriend and I had to spend the weekend sharing a double. The concierge had attitude and offered nothing for our inconvenience. We go into the restaurant to get more attitude from the waitress, who forgot out drinks and made us feel unwelcome. I travel a lot, and often get better service in more stylish rooms for half the cost. I'll never stay in a fairmont again, I suggest anyone who has a choice do the same.
