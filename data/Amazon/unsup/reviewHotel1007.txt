I'll start with the negative, just to get it out of the way of the heaps of praise coming... I am very light sleeper; if you are not, completely disregard the next paragraph. This hotel is noisy. Not so much from other rooms/hallways - but the outside noise was awful. We were in staying in the back of the hotel with our window facing the alley, and at random times throughout the night (sometime multiple times) garbage trucks would come along and smash and crash through the approx 30-40 garbage bins lining the alley. After enduring the clanging a couple of nights, I asked to be moved to a room at the front of the hotel, but was told that there was nothing there in the same price range (apparently you pay more for a "non-alley view"). But after another couple of sleepless nights, we were finally moved to another room. It was on a lower floor, on the front side of the hotel and was definitely better without the gargabe trucks, but still suffered from late-night party goer noise. Other than that - this hotel was fantastic! Nicely decorated, high end bath products and double shower heads. The continental breakfast was good, more than adequate, but the real kicker is the nightly manager's reception. Wow. High end booze and fancy snacks (hummous, bruscetta, meat & cheese, etc). The hotel signature drink, the Amalfitini, is addictive. Don't be surprised if you wobble out of there after downing 4 or 5 of them - they go down so easy. The staff were friendly, and our room was cleaned every day before we returned from our touring (coming back to a still-dirty room is a major pet peeve of mine). And the location is fantastic - walking distance to countless bars and restaurants, and so many of the city sights. The Amalfi is a great hotel (just bring ear plugs).
