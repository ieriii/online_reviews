Talk about the essence of Old Chicago. This hotel is absolutely GORGEOUS. The front desk agent was super helpful with suggesting places to eat and upgrading our room for a view of Lake Michigan. The concierge was even MORE helpful with bus routes, subway routes and best ways to get to certain sights to see. Sitting at one end of the Magnificent Mile and right on the banks of Lake Michigan, this old historic hotel offers so much if you want to experience a luxurious, elegant visit to Chicago. From the high ceilings in the lobby to the live music in the lobby lounge to the breakfast at the Drake Brothers restaurant to the track record of amazing celebs and royalty that have stayed beneath the roof, this hotel can in no way leave you anything but breathless. Definitely a must-stay hotel at some point ... in your life. :)
