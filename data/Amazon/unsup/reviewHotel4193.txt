I went here for a conference and enjoyed everything they had to offer. The staff was attentive, courteous and discreet. The luncheon meal was one of the best I've had at a banquet of any type (FYI: caeser salad with creamy caesar dressing, baked chicken breast with a cream sauce, steamed vegetables, roasted herb potatoes, NY cheesecake with a chocolate covered strawberry and mixed berries) The facility is huge, has plenty of space, and is in great condition.
