This hotel was much better than the one in San Diego which seemed a lot louder to me.  The lobby does funnel music from speakers but it isn't too overbearing where you can't hear the front desk staff (I had to yell in San Diego). The rooms are way too dark (grey walls and dark carpets) but I love how each floor is dedicated to a rock star. My bathroom tiles could use updating. (There are some things the darkness can't hide) When the weather is nice they have a rooftop party. I didn't go so I can't really say how that is.
