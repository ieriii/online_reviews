I'm glad I discovered this little gem nestled in the heart of River North. Hands down the location is amazing... and if you're able to land a deal via an app like "hotel tonight" or any travelocity-type site you'll be set. I would rate the service 4 or 5 stars, but the rooms are extremely small, contain a nook in the wall that is called a "closet," and extremely shallow sinks and showers in the bathroom. If you're on the hunt for a staycation this would be perfect, just travel light. Your bags will have to be stored in visible sight and the space is TIGHT!! Also, the decor is very nice and I wish I spent time in the lobby and bar. The free wi-fi is an added bonus.
