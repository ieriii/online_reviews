Make sure to ask for a newly renovated room! My boyfriend and I checked in later in the evening and we received an older room. No frills, no dresser, no view. However, the next night we asked to be moved and were given a room with a killer view of the river, a fridge, microwave, safe, flat screen TV, plus it was much nicer and in the shower, the paint wasn't chipping. We got an insane room rate through http://Kayak.com. The best part is the hotel is right in the middle of Everything! Great location to walk anywhere. The staff was always helpful and friendly.
