We stayed here one night using a deal we got on Expedia. A parking package was included which really came in handy. the hotel was absolutely lovely. It has such a classy vintage feel throughout the whole building. In the lobby there's a really cute cafe that serves Starbucks. We stayed on the 8th floor which conveniently was on the same floor as the pool. Unfortunately the pool and hot tubs were run a muck with children, but the deck outside of the pool is absolutely amazing. the view is breath taking. We originally ordered a room that was a single full-sized bed. THe man at the check in counter upgraded us to a room with 2 beds no charge because he said it was a larger room. The room was very clean and so was the bathroom. No complaints. The location of the hotel is totally perfect. A 10 minute walk to millenium park and the museums. Grant park is right across the street.
