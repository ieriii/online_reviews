We went to Chicago for our first time just recently, and of course we had to stay at the historic Drake Hotel. It was certainly very beautiful. The next night we actually ended up staying at The Talbott hotel because this place was booked, so after that stay, I could see why I prefer boutique hotels better, like The Talbott. The Drake had a lot of beautiful chandeliers and the atrium was amazing. I enjoyed the many references to the Queen of England, which made the place seem more regal. I did feel like I was on a special vacation being there, but the nice luxury 'special' touches that The Talbott had were missing from The Drake. Perhaps it's because it's owned by the Hilton and every Hilton hotel room is standardized the same, so that charm was kinda missing. Either way, it was a beautiful hotel and our view of Lake Michigan was really nice. We also snuck a peek of all the ballrooms and wow, are they BEAUTIFUL! What an amazing place to get married in! The one thing that really made it seem less charming was their breakfast buffet. Our waiter took a little while and the buffet was a little over $20 for nothing outstanding at all. I think the menu food is quite a bit better so I would order from that instead. All in all, it was a nice stay.
