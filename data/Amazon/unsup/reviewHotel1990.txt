Great location if you are taking the commuter train to Chicago. I actually drove this trip and parked in the Millennium Garages. We walked out of the north end of the garage and the hotel was just in front of us. It was great. We could see Lake Michigan and the end of Navy pier from our north facing room. We did not get a room with a balcony, but since it was only 20 degrees F, we didn't need the balcony. We did not use the indoor lap pool or spa, however, it looked inviting. It is truly a lap pool, which I have not seen in a hotel before. Not much room for the kids to splash around. I suspect the outdoor pool would be more fun for kids in the summer. The decor is modern and a little "flashy" for my taste, but it is a well appointed room and large compared to some we have stayed in downtown Chicago. Free wireless throughout the hotel. Easy access to bus and train stations.
