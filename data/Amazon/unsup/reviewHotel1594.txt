Location and view were top-notch, and the lobby at 71 was impressive. Staff was very kind and helpful. However, the facility leaves much to be desired. The large rooms are oddly shaped, leaving lots of space strangely unused. The furniture was a bit dated. Walls are PAPER thin; you can hear all sorts of noise coming from the hallway. Staff put us next to the Fitness Center, which also caused all sorts of noise. Doubt I'd go back for the price.
