I would totally stay here again if I got another sweet deal via Priceline or such. Go lower than you'd think! It's got a happening lobby where the bar and restaurant are integrated and it's energetic to say the least, even on Thursday nights. Old school glam... our double had two full bathrooms included, and the materials are heavy, rich fabrics. *I'd avoid valet if you can... you can park 24 hours and go in and out as much as you'd like, but it's $51.
