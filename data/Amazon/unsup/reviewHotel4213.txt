What more great things can I say about the City of Chicago? If you are looking for a scenic (right off of the Chicago River/Lake Michigan - - request the West Tower!) hotel with prime customer service, look no further. From the top to bottom, the staff demonstrates their goal to satisfy. If you have the means, I highly suggest the executive suites and access to the top floor lounge. Hyatt Regency is perfect for convention stays, tourist, business trips, or just a weekend get-a-way a half block off of the Magnificent Mile.
