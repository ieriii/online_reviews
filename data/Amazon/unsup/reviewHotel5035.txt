I was put up here for a business trip awhile back. I actually have family in the area, but didn't want to totally invade. I heard this was top-notch and thought, "what the hell, why not?"I was glad to hear that they were open to pets. Because I do spend quite a bit of time with family/friends in Chicago, I wanted to extend my business trip a bit and bring the fam/dog along with me. The dog thing earned them 2 stars, but the rest of the hotel was fairly unimpressive. I am not one to bitch a moan about a free trip, but if I was coming out-of-pocket with that kind of money, there are far nicer hotels in Chicago I think. I wouldn't call the staff "rude" as much as "inattentive". No one is jumping up to help you or offer you exemplary service. Which, hey, if I'm at the Red Roof Inn, I'm not looking for it, but the W? come on people!I guess the design/layout is nice for the modern feel they are going for, but it's simply not my style. In addition, location-wise, it's good for the view, but there are far better options close to the mag mile.
