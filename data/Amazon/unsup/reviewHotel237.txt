The Hotel Indigo had a pia colada feel, with a smoothie-shop-decor, and the lobby smelled like coconut lotion. When hotwire notified me that I had made reservations for the hotel Indigo, I went to check it out on-line. The pictures scared me a little. I thought It would be too girly or cutesy for me. I was prepared to not be amused by this hotel. Once I arrived, It wasn't as bad as I thought... It was kind of cheerful. The service: was ok, nothing to complaint about or rave about either. No stars there. The room was one of the smallest rooms I've had in Chicago. But it was neat, clean and had everything I really needed. Nice small room, with a small window, but for the price I paid it was ok. Loved the location. Good restaurants, shopping, and the beach are all so close. Just take Division and it takes you right to the beach. After a long night out, my friends and I came back to the hotel area and decided to go to the beach and see the sunrise before calling it a night. It was a nice thing we could do since the hotel was a few blocks away. It was a nice hotel to stay at once, but I think I saw other 'nicer' hotels around that area that I might want to try next time I visit Chicago.
