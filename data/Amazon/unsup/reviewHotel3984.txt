I love Hyatt! Im a gold member for a reason. You get perks if you're a member, such as late checkout, room upgrade, and free nights :) If you are a member sometimes they award you with free passes to their spectacular breakfast buffet which is usually just as fancy and expensive as the rest of the amenities. I have loved the Hyatt in any city I've stayed. Always very clean, and modern. This specific place was perfectly located close to everything. Of course with that said, it was packed and they couldnt accommodate us in our room when we arrived, therefor we had to wait around town after arriving from the airport until the occupant for the room wanted to leave. To make up for the inconvenience, they offered me and my mate one of the prestigious hotel's suite on the top floor. Too bad there were only two of us to enjoy such a treat because that place had room for about 4 families. lol it was def a good night! And there is a bar in the hotel, so you dont have to go very far If you dont want. Every Hyatt ive been to has been superb in all aspects; customer service, appearance, & top of the line comfort.
