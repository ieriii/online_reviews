The Hyatt is one of the largest hotels in Chicago, so there are tons of business people sporting badges on their fronts as they shuttle to and from their conventions and seminars. This is a very big and busy place, so one can easily get lost amongst the various public levels, escalators, and meeting rooms. The main lobby is enormous, featuring what was known as the largest bar in the world. The rooms are pleasant enough, but there is no excitement in the overall standard design at all.
