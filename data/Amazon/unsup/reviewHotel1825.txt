Service Service Service, Oh and like all W Hotels its swank as hell. How do you take a 75 year old building and make it this cool. You give it to Starwood Hotels. TK - Our concierge did such an amazing job. Transferred our bags from the Westin Ohare, were we had to stay for one night cause the whole town was booked, having complementary beer in a bucket of ice and snacks when we came back from the trade show, SO NEEDED!!!!. Running down to CVS to get meds for us and all weekend car service. I will never stay anywhere if I can help it.
