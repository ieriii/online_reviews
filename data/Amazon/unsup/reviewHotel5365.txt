I booked the Hilton Garden Inn online prior to my first-ever trip to Chicago. I wasn't really sure what I would get. I'll break it down on what I liked and what I disliked.Likes: Great location! Walking distance to the subway, loads of shopping, dining and bars. Very comfy beds with an adjustment switch for softer or firmer. Spacious rooms. Nice price. Super friendly valets and bellman. Text to valet service. Soda machines on every floor. Excellent city views.Dislikes: Awful construction immediately outside the hotel. Rude concierges. Pricey "Pavillion Pantry." Outrageous parking costs. $39 a day for self-park or $45 a day for valet. The rental car was almost not even worth it. No free shuttle services.I loved the valets. If you text down to them 5 minutes before leaving, more often than not your car was there waiting for you. Also, they didn't creepily stand around begging for a tip. Spending $45 a day for valet PLUS tipping EACH time would have just been too much. I tipped the final day. If you needed a cab, the bellman would hail it for you.If I came back, I would probably stay at the Hilton Garden Inn again; however, I think I was expecting just a "little bit more" because it had the name Hilton.
