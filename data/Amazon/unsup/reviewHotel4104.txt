Big, big, big. I don't typically stay at super hotels like this, and I tend to like a bit more personality in my lodgings, but this Hyatt is perfectly comfortable and acceptably furnished with comfy beds, standard amenities, and some decent views if you're in the right rooms. Staff service is generally good, though when a convention comes in, it can slip a bit, thanks to all the demands made on their time. Both times I have been in this hotel, though, there have been conventions, and service quality remained fairly high. Big Bar is passable, though not terribly exciting. The club/dancefloor space was rather popular when I stayed, but I wouldn't want to spend any time on the lower floors on club nights--it is tremendously loud. All in all a solid option for a short stay.
