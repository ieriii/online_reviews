I have stayed here multiple times thanks to Hotwire. It is traditionally a conference center, but this is a great budget stay for people wanting to be on Michigan Ave. Great views of the river, the longest bar in America, and great location make this a good stay. There are two separate wings so remember which one you are staying in. Overall a great experience, but can be overwhelming for some due to its size.
