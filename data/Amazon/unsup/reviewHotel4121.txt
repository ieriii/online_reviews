I booked on Hotwire for $80/night, and for that price I don't think one could do much better. We lucked out and were on the 33rd floor with a great view out the window. The room is oddly laid out, with a desk facing away from the window along the back of the bed - unconventional, but a cool way to create two spaces in a small-ish downtown hotel room. Didn't have any issues with cleanliness like some people report. Yeah, $13 for internet is a drag, but if I'm staying in a 4-star hotel right downtown, that's kind of to be expected.
