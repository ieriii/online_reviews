I stayed here with friends for a concert for two nights and have to say for the price, location and quality, the Whitehall Hotel is tough to beat! It markets itself as boutique hotel and it is indeed just that, so you can expect great 1:1 service but it's not going to be a systematic as your neighborhood Hilton. Maybe it's because I live in NY, but the room were much bigger than I anticipated and we had a great view of Chicago's Gold Coast. The beds were insanely comfortable and I found the bathroom to be clean (and also spacious). As I had last been to Chicago when I was a kid, I wasn't too familiar with what to do but found everyone at the front desk and concierge to be very helpful in recommending places to go visit/eat. I was initially unsure on how near/far the hotel was relative to other things in Chicago but quickly found its location to be very ideal. It's right off Michigan Ave so you have all the shopping/Maginificent Mile right there and only a few blocks away from the water. In fact, the only time we used a cab was to get to/from the airport and then coming back from going out at night. They do not have an ice machine on each floor so you have to call the front desk to order some which is fine with me but when we did call, we had to do so twice before it finally came up. A light bulb was out in our room and we also had to call twice before someone came. I am not sure if getting to the ice machine/mechanic just took that much time but that was only some significant "complaint" I had. Also, the TV was severaly outdated (think late 90's) and was angled to the left of our bed (opposed to in front) which was a little strange. Overall, an excellent hotel - highly recommend.
