I had the chance to stay at the Allerton for a business seminar. It is located on a great corner, which was fabulous since I was walking everywhere, and my bearing for Michigan Ave. were right on. The downside is that the hotel is next to the Northwestern Medical Center, so we heard sirens all night long. Since my company booked the seminar, I had a single room, that was truly meant for a single, but my husband came with me. The room was very nice, well appointed with nice linens, bathroom supplies from L'Occitane, and since the room was meant to be part of a suite, set back from the main hall. But it was SMALL! The foot of the bed was only inches away from the wall, so in order to get out of bed, I had to climb over my husband to get to the bathroom.  It was great that the room had an Ipod Home so I could charge my Ipod and listen to my music. There was a problem with my bill that was unforeseen. My company paid for my room with the corporate credit card, but the hotel couldn't find the folio with information. The room was charged to my account, and only when I returned home was everything cleared. The Allerton had done a conversion on their accounting system two days before, and my information was lost.  I would stay at the Allerton again if only for the location,. The hotel and staff were wonderful. Thank you.
