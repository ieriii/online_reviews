The hotel has a great location right near the water. The staff is helpful. The rooms are cozy and aging. You have to pay for the internet. The reason I gave it two stars is because the walls are paper thin and you can hear the hollering and heavy breathing and almost everything from your neighbors. The gym was better than expected but crowded with business type workers. Even though it was non-smoking - the place can't help but smell of it.
