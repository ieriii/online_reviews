One of the worst experiences I've ever had. Reserved a non-smoking room, king bed with a view, got a room that reeked of cigar smoke with no view. When we complained we were moved to a smaller room, no view and double beds. Again complained and were "comped" a meal that was average at best. Then had a hard time getting a coffee pot for the room (I believe that they thought we'd stolen one) and getting housekeeping to change our room within the 6 hours we were out at a conference. Holiday Inn is not a place I'd recommend to others if they are looking for a good experience.
