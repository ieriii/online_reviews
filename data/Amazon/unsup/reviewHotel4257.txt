Currently staying at the Palmer House Hilton during a conference and as old as this building is, I am very pleased with my stay. You can tell that the staff is proud of the hotel because every single staff member, I had the honor of meeting, was very friendly and eager to assist and the hotel is beautifully maintained. The lobby was exquisite...if you appreciated art the way I do, the art on the ceiling will have you walking straight while staring at the ceiling...needless to say, I bumped into a lot of people. Check-in was pretty smooth. Tyler took good care of us allowing us to check-in a few hours early and was happy to answer all of our crazy questions. Our room was on the Executive Floor. Key entry to ride the private elevator to heaven :) The elevator even had a bench for those people who are to lazy to stand lol. We arrive on the 23rd floor and excitement sets in. Let me tell you, Exective level is where its at! Snacks, soda, water available 24/7, Hot hor d'ourves available from 5-7pm, Complimentary contiental breakfast available every morning (not talking bagels and juice...Cold cuts, boiled eggs, plain yogurt, granola, breads, muffins, cereals, juices, coffee, hot oatmeal...sheesh What a spread!!), The room was very clean with a pleasant scent. The bed linens were plush which made it very difficult for me to leave each morning. Only gripe I had was it took me at least 5 minutes to at least turn on the shower each morning....I even had to call the maintence man one morning to demonstrate how to turn it on....he mumbled something about a German design...blah blah. Also, enjoyed a wonderful and filling lunch at Lockwood Restaurant in the lobby. Try the Ahi Tuna burger and fries.....do yourself the favor, you deserve it! :)
