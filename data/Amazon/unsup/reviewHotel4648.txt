For a quick trip down to Chicago for the night Hotel Felix was perfect! When I was having issues with Priceline, the staff at Hotel Felix were beyond accommodating, even called Priceline with me on the line to help solve the problem. My first impression was the staff going above and beyond for me as their customer and set a great tone. The reviews are right, the rooms are small. This is not a luxury suite by any means. It's a small space but we weren't staying long and with just the two of us, it was plenty of room for us and our stuff. I wouldn't stay here for an extended amount of time, but for a weekend trip - the space is plenty! The best part about the hotel was the location - we were within walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go.
