I stayed here b/c my friend was getting married nearby and was nice enough to keep us close to the activities...at first, I wasn't sure if I should just commute to the wedding but after checking in, I'm sure glad I decided to stay here! The rooms were large, clean, and had the coziest beds! I wanted to forget about the wedding and take a nap! And the hospitality was superb!
