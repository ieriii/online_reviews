Wow. I'm a Diamond Hilton Honors member so I arrived, got an upgrade to the Executive Level and a fabulous rate on a good-sized room with free internet. The Executive Level offers the beautiful people complimentary coffee and a light breakfast, sodas, bottled water and snacks in the evenings. There is a cash bar. I would have liked free drinks but that would have been too good to be true. The lobby is beautiful and romantic and I enjoyed a few cocktails at the Lockwood bar in the lobby. Every staff member was smiley and friendly and helpful. I had a little orgasm in my pants over the whole experience! I stayed for three nights and I cannot wait to go back.
