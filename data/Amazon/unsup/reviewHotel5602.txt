Walking about a Chicago winter you quickly learn - jeans do not keep out the cold, girls can still walk around in boots without slipping on the ice, -1 is not a freaking temperature, and exposed skin will freeze and fall off. Other then that Chicago ain't bad in the winter on a clear sunny day. Staying at the Westin also makes it so much more pleasant. Especially at the Club level. The door man is bundled warmly and the front desk are very helpful and the concierge was nice enough to recommend a 'walk about' route. The Club level room is palatial with a sitting area and an abundance of hot water for a bath after your 'walk about'. I gotta find out where the doorman gets his hat. I would stay here again for a Chicago winter.
