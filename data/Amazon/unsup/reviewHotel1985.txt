One of my favorite hotels in Chicago....and we have stayed at a variety of hotels in downtown!! Staying 1 night at the Aqua made us want to move to the building permanently....if only ....*sigh* Location is great, it's close to/lovely walking distance to River North and the Mag Mile, yet you're separated from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Although our view was directly of another building, we could still see Navy Pier and the Lake. Morning swim in the indoor pool and dip in a jacuzzi is the perfect way to start a Saturday or Sunday morning!!! The lobby is GORGEOUS!! I couldn't get enough of it! Intricate gold chain designs over mirrored walls with brick column type structures and delicate flowers atop low tables...haven't seen anything like it in Chi yet. The room felt very fresh and clean, loved the modern design of the bathroom...felt very European. Great service. Delicious food and drinks at Fellini. Can't wait to come back.... another Groupon perhaps? :)
