While the renovation at this place looks great (you can see they poured all their money into the lobby/restaurant area), there were more than a few issues with the room. First off, the view, was excellent, from the 32nd floor, peering thru the Chicago skyline and looking down at the Chicago River. The beds were also comfortable but that's where the good stuff ends. First, parking. The only on-site parking is via valet ($35 each time you park) or $50 all night valet. You can park at a nearby parking garage for around $25-$30, but for a major chain in a major city, I expected some on-site parking that didn't involve ridiculous parking fees. Next, the amenities. The reception on the TV is terrible. Some of the channels barely came in. The water pressure on the shower was weak (weaker than the usual hotel water pressure). The air conditioner/fan would still circulate air into the room even though the panel had the thing turned off. After two nights, this resulted in a very dry/sore throat. Finally, the concierge. Hit or miss with these folks. A couple of them were friendly, polite and knew what they were talking about. Then there were those who just didn't belong behind that desk. From the guy who gave us the wrong directions back to Midway (if we followed his directions we would have ended up in Indiana) and the lady who told us parking across the street was ony $23/night (it was actually $30) and the guy who sarcastically joked that the fitness area didn't have "cool stuff" like a jacuzzi or sauna to a whole list of other tidbits that I've since pushed out of my mind, the conceirge service at this hotel is questionable. Also, I'm not sure if they're still there, but there's a bunch of strikers/picketters outside the hotel and from a brief conversation with fellow guests who were staying on the 16th floor, they could hear them banging their pots and blowing their horns at night. No problem up on the 32nd.
