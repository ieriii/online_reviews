Having spent plenty of time at downtown Chicago hotels, I cannot recommend Hotel 71. I stayed in the Executive Suite and was very disappointed by downtown Chicago standards. The hotel itself seemed as if it were under construction in some of the hallways; ceiling tiles pushed in with wires exposed, the door to the meter room on our floor was open and not secured. Walking the hallways you could hear conversations in every room that you walked by. The suite itself was way below standard, it contained four closets, no of them were in the bedroom, seating for guests around the table in the sitting room was limited because there were only two chairs for the table, there were two televisions, but of the were both tube televisions. The bathroom was sub par and must have been inspired by a motel. There was nothing high class about this suite. I suggest if you want to experience a true hotel suite experience you go somewhere else. Hotel 71 is overpricing what they offer in their suites, you can find better for their price.
