This hotel had a great location walking distance to the Shedd aquarium. We walked to the aquarium though the park and used the tunnels under Lake Shore Drive to get to the aquarium in under 10 minutes. The room I booked was a queen bed with a very small side room with a table and loveseat. The decoration was outdated and with a more detailed glance at doors, countertops and floors, you could see some a need for updates. We used the pool which had not been cleaned that day - however it was a little chilly that day. The staircase was creepy, but I think most staircases are creepy. There was a charge of $29/30 each day to have your car parked. This is the latest in hotel charge trends, but it still seems a bit much. However, it was easy to park the car with blinkers and then jump out to check in and let them park the car. The front desk did offer to get my car at any time. Wi-fi was free and the front desk gave me the username and password upon check in which was great. This was an easy and great surprise as I just stayed at a Hilton that charged for wi-fi.I think the noise level of the city was easy to hear from the hotel. I heard some loud noises at night from the city and hotel which didn't make for the best night sleep. The TV was not outdated as the other reviews suggested, but there seemed to be limited channels.The best dining option was the diner behind the hotel and a block south with great breakfast, dinner and dessert options. For other dining options, it was easy to catch a cab.
