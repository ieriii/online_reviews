One of my favorite hotels in CHI- it's your standard cookie cutter Marriott as far as the rooms are concerned, but the location is excellent, right in the middle of Michigan Ave. Also, the staff are really friendly, a cut about the standard Marriott. Lastly, the concierge lounge is pretty big and serves up a good spread. Overall, a good place to stay in downtown unless you want to spring for the Westin.
