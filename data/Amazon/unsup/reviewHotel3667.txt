The tea at the Drake Palm Court room is awesome!! We go every year and it's top notch every time. The best service, best quality, best tea and best pastries. You can get champagne or mimosas to enhance your tea experience. It's so fun all the generations of families enjoying there time together. The best high tea in Chicago!! Thank you Shaun Rajah for always making our experience spectacular!
