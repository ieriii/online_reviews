great hotel, really enjoyed the stay. we exhibited here also, and the concierge was so nice - i needed a vase or fish bowl or something for our drawing, and the lady found me a flower vase from some one's desk, and cleaned it out and let me use it! i mean that is nice! also the restaurant here in the lobby is decent, even though we ate pizza the WHOLE time we were there. bell hops were great and very nice, remembered me and my co-worker the whole weekend and helped with suggestions of places to eat, shop, etc. the room and bed was great also. they are exactly as pictured.
