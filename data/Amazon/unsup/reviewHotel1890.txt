So many ups, so many downs. I've been here a few times for drinks in the lobby and parties in their ballrooms. I love the space and always have had a good time. My 30th birthday was held here. It was good but there were a few glitches. I was pleased that they let me bring in cupcakes from Sarah's. Most recently, I was in a suite. The rooms are very nice. The customer service was outstanding. I would definitely head back!
