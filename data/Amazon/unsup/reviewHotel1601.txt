So I stayed at this Hotel back in September 2010. While the hotel itself is fantastic, the location is fantastic, the staff is friendly and accomodating...if you have an issue with anything specific to service and follow up keep your expectations LOW! I parked a rental car in their overnight valet throughout my stay. My last night there, the car was damaged. I didnt notice it until after I had left the hotel, and stopped at a gas station. Despite multiple assurances that the issue would be handled accordingly, five months later I still receive phone calls and other correspondence from the rental car company, stating they still have an unpaid repair bill. The service at valet attached to this hotel is sickening. I waited for 30 minutes to get the car one day, AFTER placing the requested phone call ahead of my departure. When I left and checked out from the hotel, the car tenant had this evil grin on his face I and was awarded an open door to my rental car. Gee, I wonder why. DO WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED ME AND MAKE THIS ISSUE GO AWAY!
