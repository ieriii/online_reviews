My experience was with their lobby bar, I have not stayed at the hotel. I was working with an out of town News Crew for elections, that was stationed outside of the Tribune Tower next door for two long 14 hour hour days.  And it was very cold. Since the News Station had the team staying at a hotel all the way down by Hancock, it was impossible for us to go back and forth all day long. We hung out in the lobby bar for two days, and ordering all of our meals and coffee drinks. I was so surprised at the quality of the food and the service. When you have to be outside every half hour in the cold, you need a warm refuge. And this was the spot. Even though we were not guests of the hotel, the staff treated us as such.  During the second day, as I was getting more and more harried, I rushed in to look for one of our crew and a waiter met me at the revolving door, saw the look on my face and said "Ma'am, your guy is over there." Talk about paying attention! Great stuff!
