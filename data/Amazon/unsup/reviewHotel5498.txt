This is a first for me! I'm going to give a Best Western 5 stars! Now wait a minute.....Before you snub your nose read the rest of the review! Again a tiny hotel in an obscure location that does not look like much from the road! Then to have the Best Western Name on it, most folks would not give this place a second look! Well you would be sadly mistaken on this one. Ken at the front desk was great, my corporate travel department messed up the reservation and they did not have my room. Ken fixed everything with a smile and made it perfect! Thank You Ken! Then to walk into my room is when I was blown away! A suite with a living room, kitchen and bedroom very well appointed with all the modern conveniences that worked and looked great! Dishwasher, Microwave, Stove, Sink and refrigerator. Flat Screen LG 42 inch!, King Size Bed very comfortable and great bed linens and pillows! AC did not blow on my face! Love that! Then to get to the bathroom took it up even higher, beautiful appointments, Granite, two sinks, great lighting, huge modern shower with two shower heads one a rain shower, plenty of thirsty towels waiting to be used!  The bonus is I get a front row seat to the Chicago Marathon this Sunday, it runs right passed the hotel!
