Looked at this hotel for our wedding venue. The ballroom has amazing views - Navy Pier, the Lake, the City lights. We almost booked it strictly for the Saturday Night Firework Show that we would have just for our wedding (not the rest of the city of Chicago). :) The reason we didn't book here was just that the room was too dark and a little on the small side. We were told we could fit our 150 guests but just didn't feel like it would work. And we would have needed to invest in a lot of rentals (linens, chair covers, and draperies) to brighten up the space to fit our look/feel. Would definitely recommend this ballroom for anyone looking for a modern, city, stylish, and intimate wedding reception.
