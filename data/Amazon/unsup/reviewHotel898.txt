My folks (and sometimes I) always stay here when they are up in the Chicago area. Nestled in downtown Chicago (and basically across the street from Macy's for all you shoppers), this is a great place to stay, unwind, have a drink, or grab some dinner. The Burnham is more of a boutiquey type hotel with a lot of quirky nuances. The decor is very Algonquin Circlesque (I know that isn't a word, but whatev) due to the fact that it used to be an office building from the 40s-50s. The rooms are cozy and the service is fantastic :) Also, they are pet friendly so feel free to bring along your trusty travelling sidekick!!!! Bonus: They offer a free wine hour for all their guests at, I believe, around 5pm for most (if not all) nights :) A great way to unwind after a long and eventful day in the city!!!
