Want to stay in a quiet, almost private hotel a block away from the mag mile? This is your spot. It doesn't have a grand entrance and everything here is lowkey and under-the-radar. The Westin is a block away if you want something flashy...this is about comfort. I wouldn't shell out a ton of money to stay here as I got a hotwire deal ($68!) but it was a very nicely appointed room with what looked to be newer furniture and fixtures throughout. Also a view of John Hancock and just so close to all Chicago has to offer. I've only stayed at the Sheraton in the River North area, but I'd gladly pick HS over the Sheraton. Better location, better rooms, less crowded.
