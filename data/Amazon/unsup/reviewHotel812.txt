As everyone says, great location......I will review the hotel. I agree with most everyone, the beds are great, the rooms are small and uninspired and the lobby is just that....a lobby. We had a very good experience with the staff, they were nice and helpful. Room is loud with the hallway noise, but it didn't bother us too much. We were on the 4th floor with a roof right outside our window....in case of fire we would be in the perfect room....however, no view in the meantime, and luckily no fire. I am sure most rooms have great views due to the location. Overall, I would stay here again for sure.
