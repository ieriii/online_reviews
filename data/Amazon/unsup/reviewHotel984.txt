Nice place. Styling was standard hotel. I found it interesting that the decor was so nondescript, almost like what you'd find in a dictionary picture for "hotel". Cocktail hour was really good, heavy appetizers like a big tray of meats and cheeses. Their signature martinis were good. The continental breakfast on each floor was great too, you can run to get a coffee and a muffin or croissant and back to the room to get started on your day. Front desk staff was great. Saved us on cover charge at Andy's Jazz Club right around the corner with the hotel business card. Everyone was really friendly. Location is near a few river-north clubs, and we had a street-view room so it did get noisy right about closing time but only for a few minutes. A lot of people were in town for a clothing show at the Merchandise Mart which is only about 4 blocks away.
