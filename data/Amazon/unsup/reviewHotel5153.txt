Our room at the Blu Aqua was modern with hardwood floors, contemporary furnishing and many nice touches. The bed was super comfortable. The room was also spotless. The employees at the front desk were more friendly and helpful than I have found in most places. They went out of their way to make sure everything was OK. Of course, the location is terrific. Close to Millenium Park, tons of restaurants, theaters and everything downtown Chicago has to offer.
