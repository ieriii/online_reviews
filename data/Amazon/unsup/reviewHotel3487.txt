Let me start off by saying that I did not stay here, this review is only for the experience I had with booking my wedding room block here. So of course Hotwire was running some deal, where you could get a fight and a room at the Allerton for some really ridiculously low rate. So rather than booking directly through the Hotel, my out of town relatives booked through Hotwire. Knowing this, I called my contact at the hotel who will be called "MK" in this review and added everyone to the list. I spent a significant amount of time on the phone with MK so that everyone that was checking in would get the out of town bag etc. So when check in date came along, I was told by my mother-in-law that no one was getting bags!!! As you can imagine this is the LAST thing I wanted to deal with after having spent HOURS on the phone with MK and being charged $3 bucks a bag so they could sit there and not be distributed. I had to call the hotel after my rehearsal to iron out the issues. It appears that MK left no list at the check in counter and no one knew what to do, even though I had dropped off 20 bags to be given out. The best part is that I was still charged for "distribution" after having gone through this pain in rear experience. MK was less that pleasant to deal with, so please be cautious if you are ever considering a room block here. Be prepared to make phone calls and supervise the night before your wedding. NEVER AGAIN!!!
