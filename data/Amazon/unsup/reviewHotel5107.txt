nice posh seeming hotel in lobby, semi decent conference rooms with dirty,plain bathrooms for a luxury seeming conference center BEWARE! no safes in rooms, be sure to lock your luggage or utilize safe deposit boxes. had items stolen during turn down service, so if your liking turn down service ( which was just fruit snacks on the bed)look somewhere else. maid service -horrible. bed haphazardly made and clearly rummaged through our luggage.( somewhat our fault, lock broke on suitcase) pool very small. not handicapped friendly, which you will find in most of Chicago. offers wifi only in lobby, is actually 14.95/day in room , not advertised on web sitebeds were comfortable, food good but outrageously priced as are drinks for a coke. staff extremely friendly, but overall not worth the price of the rooms!! be wary of the go van service- the hotel offers as free transfer to o'hare which was really $28 when you get thereif you want to be nickled and dimed without being informed, this is the place to stay
