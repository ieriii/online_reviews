You may want to look at another hotel for a wedding reception. It is a beautiful spot and the ballroom is large with a view which is rare in downtown Chicago, but the service is lacking and it is way overpriced. I placed several calls and emails over the course of 2 weeks to set up a meeting with their event coordinator and received no response. I never heard from her until I sent an email to her boss. When we finally met she gave the impression she didn't like her job and was unprepared. She then floored me with the 5 star hotel price and they are only a 4 star hotel. She also told me other events could be booked the same day, only food can be put to the minimum (which you will only meet buying the highest priced package), and anyone can walk through the cocktail hour (the residents enter through that door).
