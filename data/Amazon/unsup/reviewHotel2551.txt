I was conflicted on rating this establishment "A-ok" or "Meh". Frankly, it's possible to experience both in one night depending on what happens. The Victor Hotel was good, the music was lively, there were a barrage of lovely women dressed beautifully and the music almost seemed to compliment their desire to feel gorgeous and enjoy a night of fun. To this I salute The Victor Hotel and promise that I will return.  Additionally, I had a chance to have a meeting with Carlos Zambrano, I bought him a glass of red wine, I had never expected that he would be a wine drinker but you know "Qu'il en soit ainsi, ainsi soit-il". I digress, this experience too increased my fondness of The Victor Hotel. Conversely, The Victor Hotel tried to put one over on me and maybe it is not the establishment per se, maybe its the management, maybe even the staff. Whomever it was, I was brought down quickly from a sense of enjoyment to the bitterness of reality. Bartenders, in my experience in communications both verbal and nonverbal one intentionally expresses amicability and in the service industry it pays off. Wrong night. Bartender was not friendly, she threw drinks at me, and she visibly rolled her eyes at me when she could not hear me over the music. I am not saying here reaction was targeted at me. In fact, I think everyone likes me and everyone wants to be my friend. So, I continued on my way and use this yelp review as a sort of awareness blog. Check your ego at the door. Oh and ask for an itemized bill. The Victor Hotel adds both gratuity and service charge...suspect I know
