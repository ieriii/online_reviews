Nice property, $89/night on hotwire during a busy period in October. Room with 2 beds accommodated 5 people (2 adults, 3 young kids) - no problem with the hotwire reservation. 25th floor, nice room, flat screen tv with real HD. Nice location - walking distance to North Michigan shops or Navy Pier. We used buses down to the museum campus and up to the zoo - no problems there. Several breakfast places nearby and tons of restaurants in the area. Had a nice stay, really positive for the price.
