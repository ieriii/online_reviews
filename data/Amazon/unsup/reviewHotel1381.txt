I stayed here during my visit from Boston in the early summer. My friends and I thought it looked good online and the location seemed good (well, coming from the Concierge). Watch the progression of my rating...(we'll start off with 5 stars to be fair) When we checked in, the front desk gave us a hard time about our online reservations and were quite rude. After arriving upon our room, we discovered that it was a smoking room, when we clearly requested a non-smoking room (my friend has really bad allergies). When we finally switched to another room, the view was crappy and was tiny (especially for four college girls with about two suitcases each :P) -4 stars However, the rooms were very nicely decorated and the pillows were ridiculously luxurious! +1 star Bathrooms were tiny; my closet back home is bigger (that's saying something!) For the four of us (where at least 20 minute prep time is needed before going out), this became *quite* a hassle. -2 stars We barely needed our rental car; we could walk everywhere! Location is very good, as everything was about 10 minutes away. +2 stars The restaurants in the surrounding area were yummy and we enjoyed ourselves immensely with all of the culinary delights and nightlife choices. +2 stars Parking is crazy expensive, especially when you're on a student budget like we were. Even if you parked at a nearby garage instead of having the hotel valet do it, everyday parking came to be pricey. That definitely put a dent on our spending for going out, shopping, etc. -2 stars The upstairs area and the lobby are gorgeous; chandeliers, velvet, gorgeous draping, etc. Very nice; imagine the effect it had on us the first time we stepped in! :) +1 stars So, all in all, 3 stars. Next time I'm back in Chicago, I'll probably try somewhere else.
