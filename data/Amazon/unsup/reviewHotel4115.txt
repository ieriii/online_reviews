I had a very enjoyable experience at this hotel. Booked on Hotwire for an incredible rate; was able to use a kiosk to check in and receive my room key. Room was spacious and stocked with a mini bar. Hotel staff were extremely friendly. Room service was prompt and tasty. Can't beat the location!! Had no trouble storing my luggage at the end of my stay. Got a taxi out front in less than one minute. There's a conveniently located grocery store behind the hotel which stocks juices, salads, and snacks. I would definitely stay here again!
