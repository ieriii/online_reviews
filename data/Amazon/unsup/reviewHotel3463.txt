Location location location! This place is right on Michigan Ave., and it's a breeze to walk anywhere in the Near North side, out to Lake Michigan, down to the Chicago River/Millenium Park. Thumbs up right off the bat. After that, it starts to go downhill a little bit. I should have been forewarned when I walked down the 3' wide hallways, but man, the rooms are tiny (and I mean TINY). Upon walking into your room, you pretty much fall into your bed. Eep! They had large 40" flat screen TVs in every room, which would be super awesome...if they had cable. Sorry guys, but the local news in HD really doesn't do it for me. The hotel has a pretty small fitness center on the top floor, with a couple of ellipticals, treadmills, and free weights. There's no free wi-fi (ACK!). Wi-fi is $9/day for 0.5Mb/sec, and $19.99/day for 1.5Mb/sec. Yuck. Some pluses were the iPod alarm clock, free morning coffee and USA Today newspaper, super plushy pillows, and Bath & Body works shampoo/conditioner. A few simple upgrades (cable, wi-fi) could make this a 4 star. Until then, it's exiled to 3 star land.
