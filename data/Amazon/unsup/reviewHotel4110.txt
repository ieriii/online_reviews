I booked this hotel on Priceline for only $70 per night, much better than the $219 that was posted on their website for the time we were staying. The hotel is a convention center, with a huge lobby and separate elevator banks depending on the floor you're at. It's located directly downtown, close to a myriad of amenities. As usual, hotel food is very expensive, so go outside to get a better price. And overall if you're going to stay in downtown Chicago, leave your car at home! It's extremely expensive to park there. Overall, hotel and room were clean and we received quick service. I would highly recommend the Hyatt for a downtown Chicago stay.
