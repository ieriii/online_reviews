Hmm Where to begin.. I like the positives so I'll go that way.. The Good - The room was comfortable.. There is a good amount of space inside the rooms, the shower/bathroom were pretty good. All in all the room was ok.. The Bad.. and it begins. Staff - I didn't encounter one person that I would say did a stellar job. The problems started with the shitty attitude of the bell hop and went from there.. The Pillows - Painful. Seriously horrible. The Location - It's really confusing to try and find the actual hotel inside the merchandise mart.. there isn't enough signage. The location is also pretty shitty in terms of access/things you would want to do. Sure it's on the brown line.. but that's the problem, I NEVER use the brown line.
