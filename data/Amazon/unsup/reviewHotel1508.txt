Upon check-in there was a flood above the fitness center. Causing havoc for new arrival guests. Fitness Center was filled with water buckets. Hotel staff is not attentive. Front desk concierge blatantly rude when you ask for city directions. You need to figure your own way around town. Don't expect recommendations or directions from the hotel staff. Hotel housekeeping keeps room service trays in hallways for a full day before pick up causing the hall to smell. Bellhop staff not helpful. Toiletries are not refreshed unless you specifically ask. Toilet water pressure is extremely low. After a two weeks business stay with no other options, I was glad to check out of the hotel.
