Great hotel in a great location. Walking distance to so many things like Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier , Hancock Observatory, and some great restaurants. Rooms were clean and spacious with nice views (we got upgraded - ask for one too!). Staff was helpful, especially the concierge who booked excursions for us and had some great recommendations for food and drink. Sadly, they charge for Wi-Fi access. Price was really good for a long weekend compared with a lot of other hotels in the area.
