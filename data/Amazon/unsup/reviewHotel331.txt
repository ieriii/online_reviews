Very old hotel. Decor is aged and is in need of repair/replacement. Our AC was missing the whole front of the unit & it was filthy, the carpet was worn bare, and the walls had about 20 coats of paint on it. Very dirty rooms (could write my name in the dust). The hallways stink horribly, so does the lobby. The employees were friendly for the most part, and there is a good/simple diner attached to the hotel. I would not stay at this hotel again, I would find another option.
