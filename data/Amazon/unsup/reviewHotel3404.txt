We were staying in Chicago for a friend's wedding and wanted a hotel in the heart of things and the Allerton definitely fit the bill -- the location was perfect for us and enabled us to do a lot of exploring on foot. Rooms aren't large but were clean and pretty. We didn't have a view to speak of BUT they did give us a free upgrade to a king without being asked, which was very nice. While I was waiting to meet up with a friend I had a drink at the bar which was very pleasant. The main lobby is on the 2nd floor so it is a little off-putting when you arrive at the ground floor and aren't quite sure where to go but the staff was pretty helpful. Also appreciated the coffee in the lobby. It was a little pricier than our usual hotel budget but for a splurge it was definitely worth it. Bell hop was very helpful.
