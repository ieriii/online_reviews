3 friends and I stayed at this hotel during a recent trip to see a few cubs game. I was very happy with the choice.Outstanding location. The best part of the city unless you're here on business in which case something in (or closer to) the loop would be better. This hotel is also 5 blocks from the red line, which goes straight to wrigley field.I see no downsides to this hotel. I got a pretty good rate by prepaying via "expedia.com".I'd stay again.
