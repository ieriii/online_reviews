Like someone else said, don't expect frills here -- Best Western Grant Park Hotel is for the budget-minded (like me). Good downtown location at the South Loop, and Bears games at Soldier Field are just a short walk away. (My boyfriend likes booking here for that very reason.) My room was comfortable (booked a standard room at http://www.getaroom.com) and I was pleased with the service I received.
