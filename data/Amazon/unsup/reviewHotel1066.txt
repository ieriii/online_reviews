I stayed here for 5 nights last week for a conference and it was quite an enjoyable experience! The rooms are spacious, clean and tastefully designed. I loved the huge bathroom with both a shower and a tub. The food from room service was surprisingly excellent! I had the hummus plate one night and the lobster roll on another night. The conference rooms were also spacious and well equipped. The hotel catered our breakfast and lunch everyday and it was some of the best conference food I have had. There was a lot of variety for each meal, and there was dessert with lunch everyday! My one and only complaint is that my room was never restocked with the essentials. I had to call to have more coffee brought up. Also, the cups I used disappeared but new ones were not put in there place. A minor nuisance in the grand scheme of things, but it is those small details that make all the difference! Otherwise, I would LOVE to stay here again for business or for pleasure.
