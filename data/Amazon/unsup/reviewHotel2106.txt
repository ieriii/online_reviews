The nickel-and-dime jackassing over the fitness center and mini-bar... not cool. - I had never been asked to pay to use the fitness center in any hotel, ever. - Any device in the room should be there to serve me. There was no space to put a single item in the fridge. The spring-loaded charge detonators attached to every item in the fridge was disturbing. I had nightmares about whether I would be charged arbitrary amounts for having jiggled a can while trying to squeeze a cucumber into the fridge. Is it too much to ask that I have a place to keep something healthy to eat? The front desk assured me there was space in the fridge for me to put something. This was not a large cucumber.  Whatever MBA dreamt up these margins should be sentenced to hard labor because it adds no value whatsoever. My employer puts me in a nice hotel so I can focus on my work, not so I can be shaken down.
