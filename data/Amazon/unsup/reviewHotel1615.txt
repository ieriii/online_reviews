What a great view! The room and bathroom were spacious... nice lobby... overall the hotel was chic but did not have that "I'm-trying-too-hard" feel to it like some other boutique hotels.  The staff was great and very patient with some day-of-arrival schedule changes caused by weather delays and cancellations at the airport. Good customer service from the desk and door staff (I know it is their job, but they handled it well-- including hailing cabs and making sure we had umbrellas during downpours).  The only downside about the hotel is that the rooms do not have in-room safes.  I'll definitely consider staying again for business or pleasure, especially considering the rates. It was convenient to the Hyatt and within walking distance of good restaurants, shopping, and the river walk.
