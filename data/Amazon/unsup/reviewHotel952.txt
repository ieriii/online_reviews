We stayed here for $50 a night while in Chicago checking out apartments. It was mostly clean except for a few hairs around the shower and sink. The wifi is T-mobile and is extremely slow. They have Lodgnet with a physical lock on the connection so you can't plug in a laptop and watch your movies from your macbook. Room was small yet cozy. Staff was friendly. Location wasn't as convenient as the Travelodge I stayed at a few years ago but still a good choice for downtown Chicago.
