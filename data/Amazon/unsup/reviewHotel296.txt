City Suites is a fairly small, but affordable, boutique hotel. That said, I think boutique is just fancy speak for old. It's not that things are run down per se, it's just definitely not modern and has some quirks as a result. My room was spacious enough, had two mini fridges (one empty, and one filled with reasonably priced beverages and snacks), two LCD TV's and a comfortable bed. However, it also had uneven floors, older furniture, noisy steam heating and certainly didn't do a lot to absorb outside noise. Overall, friendly staff, free continental breakfast (though pretty bare bones), somewhat slow Wi-Fi, and a great location - coupled with affordable rates, it's not a bad place to stay.
