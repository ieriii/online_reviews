For a hotel snob like me, I actually couldn't find much to complain about in this hotel. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Plenty of space, iron in each room (I hate when I have to call and ask for an iron). Bathroom was clean a little outdated, but not too bad. The staff is friendly, nice and accommodating. The fitness room is small - 2 treadmills a stairmaster, a couple of stationary bikes and one of those universal weight machines.
