This place is terrible. the front desk people are completely rude and need more experience when dealing with tousirts. The girls checking us in were slow, rude and did not seem to care that people are paying to stay there, which means, we are their business. The room was small and dingy. The workers were terrible and the only that seemed to empathize was a Supervisor. Never again!
