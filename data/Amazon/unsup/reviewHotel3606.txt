Ahh the Drake. I have grown up dreaming about the day I'd grace your presence. Alas...your just a really old hotel. Yes, the wood interior was gorgeous, and the hotel was beautiful...but: that's about it. I have gone to tea time, and that was fantastic! It's an experience you can't leave Chicago without. Staying there though...eh. Pass.
