I visited the Drake for afternoon tea, and what a fun experience. You might want to go with someone you feel comfortable talking with for a few hours because we were there for over 2 hours. The tea was very good - I had the chocolate mint truffle green tea and it was very mild. The food's okay but it fills you up. They consist of sandwich bites, scones, itty bitty mini pastries. For $35/person it was worth it for a one-time experience. Although I want to try afternoon tea at a more contemporary hotel next time. And then no more tea for me!
