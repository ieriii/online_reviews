This hotel was great. The location was awesome. It was the best deal I could find for downtown (everything else was 200-400 dollars a night and the Red Roof is 119.) I expected it to be more basic than it was. The bed was comfy, the room was clean, the service was decent. The decor was modern. We requested a room that faced Ontario street like our guidebook suggested, and we got a corner room facing ontario street (windows on two walls) which was great. It even came with a fridge and a microwave. The only two things that would have made it perfect would have been coffee makers in the rooms (there is a horrible complimentary coffee machine in the lobby, which was broken half the time) and a business center where we could check our email or bank accounts online. Although the coffee situation sucked, there is a Starbucks across the street which was pretty convenient. I would definately recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago who is on a budget.
