Do stay here if you're on the company dime or get a deal off of hotwire, etc. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth the price, typically between $250 and $300 per night. There are two different categories of rooms. The main hotel used to be the Forum hotel back in the 1980's. Back then, they advertised it as "business class'. The tower portion is much nicer but you'll pay a premium for one of these rooms. Yes, their ammenties are very nice and the rooms in the tower are unusual, not your standard cookie cutter shaped hotel rooms. The rooms in the main portion are nice just not as luxurious.   Catering staff does a bang up shop at a premium price. I love the meeting space, very unusual but it is an old hotel so there are not a whole lot of wide open spaces for networking. Love the health club and the indoor pool is totally cool,very 1930's Palm Beach vibe. Parking is expensive but what isn't off of Mich Ave? Trivia, you ask? This is the only hotel with a Michigan Avenue address that actually has an entrance right on Michigan Avenue. Cool, huh?
