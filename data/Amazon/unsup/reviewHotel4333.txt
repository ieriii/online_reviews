This is a wonderful old hotel. It is huge. I got lost multiple times trying to find my room or the elevators, although I suspect this might have been affected by my intake of alcohol. It is a great location, right next to the L plus across the street from the millineum park. Lots of restaurants within a short walk (try Exchecker!) My room was very nice and relatively spacious. I say "relatively" because i saw some of my coworkers rooms and they did not get the HHonors upgrade like I did. Everything worked well and the toiletries were not the standard Hilton stuff. The only negatives I experienced were the fact that they do not have wireless Internet in the rooms. Finally, the lobby is gorgeous, both in architecture and in the patrons who we filling every available seat happily drinking. We took occasion to eat at the Lockwood Grill based on my Yelp research and I was not disappointed. Plus I could charge it to my room and get even more HHonors points!
