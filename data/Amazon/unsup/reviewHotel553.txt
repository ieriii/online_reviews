Honestly, public has always been my favorite hotel in Chicago area, I stayed at this place couple times. But this time, I have to give them 1 star, and if I could, I would give them a 0. And I will never stay there again. Here is my story: Me and my boyfriend stayed at public on Tuesday and we checked out on Wednesday and went back to Indiana. When I was home, I found I left my jacket in the room. And we called the hotel, they said nothing was found in my room. But my boyfriend and I both clearly remember we left the jacket on the hanger in the closet! We are pretty sure about this. I was so sad because this is a rare find Chanel jacket which I just purchased in Miami two weeks again and hasn't worn once! And it still has price tag in it, which says 5000 dollars! I don't want to assume the housekeeping people stolen my jacket, but there's no other way I can think of it! And we drove four hours to Chicago that night just want to make sure if we can find back my coat, but the front desk people said they never found it. I guess I just lost it forever. I was so disappointed about that, and this is the worst hotel experience in my whole life. I don't think a decent hotel should expect this kind of things happen. So if you want to stay at this place. Make sure you take care of your belongings. Otherwise, it is gonna disappear forever!
