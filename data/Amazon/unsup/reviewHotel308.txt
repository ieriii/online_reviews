The location is great as it's just a skip downstairs to grab some grub at Ann Sathers & it's in the middle of a fun shopping area. Also close to the eL, which is sweet. The rooms, while clean, are rather small, though ... it was hard to manuever my parents, brother, & myself, so the kid stayed with me instead. Pricy for the room size, about right for the location.
