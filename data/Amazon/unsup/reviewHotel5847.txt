ost things about this hotel were nice. However, as a light sleeper, the alley was ridiculously loud, and many of the rooms face the alley. One of the air conditioners made such a loud erratic noise that I was unable to get a good night's sleep. IN addition, garbage bins are rolled down the alley late very early in the morning and added the the noise. I would suggest somewhere that actually has working, quiet air conditioners and does not have so many rooms facing the loud alley.
