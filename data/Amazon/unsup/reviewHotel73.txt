We stayed at the Motel part of the Clarleton. This is a separate area not in the hotel. It had allot of + the price was under 100 bucks, was on a single floor close to the parking. The room was small but the decoration was very nice kind of 60's inspired. The town was within walking distance. Oak Park has allot of shops. (we went on the 4th almost all were closed that day). The green line train was a block away if you want to go downtown. Take a visit to the Frank Lloyd Wright former home and walk or drive to the dozen or so homes he built very cool.
