Ditto the other Yelpers about great location, nice service & rooms needing a Ctrl+Alt+Del. The view from my 17th floor room was really beautiful, though, so ask if you can score a Michigan Ave. facing room. The fitness center was better equipped than I would have expected, judging from the otherwise older, outdated hotel. Medicine balls, swiss balls, yoga mats, walls of mirrors, lots of cardio machines, all pretty new. If you're looking for a Miracle Mile hotel and this Westin comes up pricing less than expected for other hotels in the same class, now you know why. So, if it's a luxe experience you seek, keep looking; but if you want a nice, standard Westin with a killer location, you'll be happy here.
