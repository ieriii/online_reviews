I was not impressed at all with the Hilton, It was in a good location but the front desk was not very friendly, My daughter and I were looking for an apartment from California and I thought I'd treat her to a nice hotel our first night, The room was cozy but very sterile, The view was not what I requested. Internet was $$$$ per day and the water pressure was a drip. But we made the best of it and went to days inn by lincoln park and received FREE internet all 3 days. Free breakfast all 3 days and very helpful front desk help. I can spend my money much wiser at other local hotels.
