I used to live in the city, now the burbs, but have to stay overnight in the city sometimes for business. I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel recently due to the recommendation of a friend, an unexpectedly good rate, and because the location happened to be perfect for what I was after. The hotel is located just south of the river at the corner of Michigan and Wacker. Millennium Park and the Art Institute are within easy walking distance as you head south, and some Magnificent Mile shopping (Nordstrom and such) is within easy walking distance to the north. (Note that if you're more into the Barneys / Oak Street area of shopping then the location would not be ideal - too far of a hike.)The hotel definitely seems to be geared toward a younger, drunker set. Not to be too harsh, but there were a lot of douchebaggish and wannabe douchebaggish types. I saw a few families here but can't imagine that the place is ideal for small kids, given the noise level, and the fact that the bathrooms (at least in the standard room I was in) only have showers and not bathtubs. By the way, the shower was awful. Very inconsistent water pressure and temperature, and one of those eco, or is it Euro, type of unmovable partitions instead of a shower curtain or door, so that you basically have to get in the shower completely to turn on the water. On the plus side, the bathroom and the room in general seemed clean, modern and fresh.Overall I felt the hotel was ok for a night or two but as a thirty-something I just felt too old for the place. Next time I need to be in that location in Chicago I will opt for the Hotel Monaco which is just a few doors down.
