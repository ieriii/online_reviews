I had a hard time trying to figure out if this was a good hotel, not good hotel, or a very good hotel. In this instance, I'm going with the middle of the road because the negative and the very good offset each other.  First, we booked this hotel through Priceline for $140/night for two nights. I thought that price was pretty good for early summer. It's located right near the blue line (easy to get to after you arrive at the airport) and it's between most other loop lines (easy to get around the rest of the city). The place touts itself for its history within the city and the performers it has hosted. This is to say, good first impression. Upon checking in, we were offered an upgraded room with a king sized bed for $49 more. We opted not to upgrade and they gave us an upgrade to a queen sized bed for free-- nice touch! Our room was spacious, though it had one chair, a desk, and a TV stand along with the bed in the sleeping area leaving it looking empty. The bathroom was on the smaller side, but it had some nice Peter Thomas Roth bath products. However, the bathtub was majorly clogged. Sad.  Outside of that, the room I had faced east, and the room filled with sunlight no matter how tightly I drew the blinds. It made it hard to sleep past 7am. As far as the rest of the hotel, the staff and front desk were friendly and helpful. Checkout was easy, and we were able to leave our bags with the hotel for a couple hours before catching our train to the next destination.  So, the Palmer House was nice. I wasn't blown away, but I was happy most of the time there.  In all my traveling experiences, I think it's worth staying if you can get it for under $150.
