This hotel is like St.Francis in San Francisco where history collides with modern world. Beautiful building with magnificent lobby. I got a suite which had two bathrooms and two closets. Bathrooms are all marble and relatively small in size. Hotel has tons of parking garage around it and is only a block from millennium park. I am not a Hilton fan and this hotel was definitely a breath of fresh air. Will definitely stay here again on next visit if i get the same deal again
