Given the great weekend price and the fantastic location of this hotel, I would say it's a very good place to stay.  It's been renovated and everything is clean and new. And the rooms of course are huge with televisions in the bedroom and living room. There's a Starbucks next door and each room has a mini refrigerator, coffee maker, etc. It's a little noisy on the weekend since parents seem to think it's cute to let their children run full speed around the interior hallway. And check in is slow as molasses! Don't go in at three o'clock!  The breakfasts are what you would expect for free food. Service was efficient and pleasant.
