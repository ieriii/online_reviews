I had a great one-night stay here. The room was modern, sexy, clean, and comfortable. The in-room mini bar was the best I've ever seen! VERY reasonable pricing, full bottles of wine, and a corkscrew in the room.  The staff was courteous, the gym was clean and well-maintained, and I can't wait to use this hotel for my next romantic Chicago getaway.
