We decided to take a weekend and pretend we were tourists, hotel, museums, whole bit. We found a reasonable deal at the Hilton Garden by checking prices and waiting until the day before to book the room. It has a great location (grand and state) right by the Red Line L. We were close to everything we could ask for. The room was really spacious and all their beds are Sleep Number beds now, so its fun to play around with that. There are a ton of families, usually coming to and from the pool, so we were never alone in the elevator. Which inhibited us from getting the token "mirrored ceiling in the elevator pic."  In your room you'll find a menu of places that deliver, and you MUST order from the breakfast delivery place. It's a RELIGION, and the true way to a woman's heart is good breakfast delivery. Well... this woman, anyway.
