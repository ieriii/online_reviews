Everything you expect from a high end hotel! The Ritz Carlton is set in a terrific location. Pros: -Awesome location. -Beautiful large room with plenty of storage (coat size closet, dresser, two drawer night stands). -Beautiful room with great views! -The service was impeccable! My husband was even impressed they everyone pronounced his polish last name correctly! -Room Service-prompt and served on a table/cart. -Comfortable bed, great dark shades, and the halls were very quiet. -The bar downstairs was reasonably priced for Chicago. The drinks downstairs with the views were worth it! Cons: My husband's only complaint was that you could not set the fan to continuously run as he prefers the white noise while sleeping.
