We had our September 24, 2011 wedding at the Marriott on Michigan Avenue and I cannot say enough great things about the staff we worked with. From the inital planning stages of our wedding to the day of the big event and even days later, I could not be happier with the service we received from everyone we crossed paths with. The bellmen were friendly and helpful. Maintenance and housekeeping accommodated all of our extra requests, the bartenders and wait staff were quick, courteous, and efficient. Special shout out to Amy Stage and Kristina Cappazoli from the Event Planning team. They are both so great at their jobs and they made the process of planning a wedding painless and ENJOYABLE. their knowledge, expertise, and willingness to go above and beyond made our wedding so spectacular. We still to this day get compliments from guests on how wonderful the food was at our cocktail hour and reception. People who say wedding food can't be elegant and delicious haven't eaten at a wedding here. We had four dinner options and all were fantastic and delicious - the horseradish crusted salmon was succulent, the filet of beef was perfectly cooked and paired with the most amazing red onion confit, the cranberry cornbread stuffed chicken breast was juicy, and the vegetarian paella was a hit with my vegetarian and vegan friends. SERIOUSLY, the entrees and sides were the best I've had at a wedding to date, and i'm not just saying that because it was my wedding. One last shout out to Cheryl B, the amazing and talented pastry chef. She made the most beautiful and delicious 5 tier wedding cake with three different cake flavors and fillings. The cakes were moist and tender while the fillings and buttercream were light, fluffy and delicious.
