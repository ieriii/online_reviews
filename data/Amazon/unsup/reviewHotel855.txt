The location is what makes this hotel. I came to the city for a long weekend and wanted a place that would be central to the Art Institute and to Mag Mile shopping. I am always baffled by the world of Chicago hotels, in which my options seem to narrow to either a $600/night room at the Fairmont, or a Travelodge experience where I'm taking my life in my hands (but oh, so cheap!). The Silversmith hotel fills this void in the travel landscape serviceably, if not memorably. I'm not convinced I'd stay here again.I almost feel that if I'd had more lead time, that I could have found a nicer room elsewhere at a recognized hotel chain. The Silversmith's rooms, although spacious, lack some of the more thoughtful appointments (to wit: the shower had only one slot for soap and the selection of toiletries could have been amplified as there was no showercap, shower gel, or hair conditioner). The decor was a bit of a hodgepodge--almost as though someone decided to clean out their storage closets/rec rooms in a bid to quickly furnish this hotel. The rooms did have a fridge and microwave, however, a boon for the budget-conscious or time-strapped traveler (especially with CVS at the ready). The hotel has a gym and business center and the bellmen are good about checking luggage and hailing cabs, which is always a plus.
