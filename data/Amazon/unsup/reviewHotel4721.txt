I really liked this hotel. The bed was VERY comfortable, the decor was functional, and the bathroom had nice storage. The only issues I had were all bathroom based; this includes walking around the toilet to get into the shower and a faucet that you couldn't get yours 2 hands under at the same time. That being said, I would definitely stay here again. The location might be the best part of this hotel!
