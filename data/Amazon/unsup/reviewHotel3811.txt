I stayed at Dana for Valentines Day and loved it. I'm definitely going to make excuses to go back. The hotel is very romantic and modern. Beautiful views, comfortable beds, even the blow dryer was the best. We stayed in a standard king. The shower was my favorite thing about the room - having the option to see in to the room (or for someone to see you in the shower) was sexy. Having an amazing restaurant in the hotel and lounge on the top floor was very convenient. We received breakfast with the room and it was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had with complimentary Bloody Marys. The only thing is, you may want to close your shades. I think the residents who live in the condos across the street could write a book on what they see. Floor to ceilings for them and for the hotel rooms probably makes for some funny stories. As I was in bed watching TV I looked over and saw the guy across the street doing the same thing plus a glare in his windows showing the guy in the hotel room under me walking around in his tighty whities. I wouldn't penalize the hotel for that though, if it makes you uncomfortable you have great dark shades - I thought it was still dark out when I woke up. Very nice.
