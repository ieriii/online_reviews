Any hotel with an "experience designer" must be worth at least 4 stars ;). My stay at the Amalfi was quite pleasant. They have a great customer service department here and I love the fact that they sat at desks instead of behind a HUGE counter like most hotels.  We had a room with 2 queen sized beds in it. Not big by any stretch of the imagination, but for $145 in downtown Chicago, it certainly seemed like a deal.  The location is great from what I could tell.  I did find the bathroom a bit puzzling. I'm not sure if it was a handicap room or something, but the bathroom shower all drained into the center of the room - there was no bath at all. There was also a bunch of poles to help you stand up if needs be.  Overall, I wouldn't hesitate coming back here again.
