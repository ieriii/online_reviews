Stayed in the south tower. Two double beds in a generous sized room which easily accommodated an extra cot. Would really have enjoyed Wifi in the room instead of only in the lobby. Exploring the hotel was a treat. Sneak into the Gold (?) Ballroom to experience the hotel's historic legacy. It's where the wildlife fundraiser scene was filmed in the David Duchovny/Minnie Driver classic "Return to Me." The room and hallways do feel a bit stuffy and old but remember, it's a hotel room, not an apartment.
