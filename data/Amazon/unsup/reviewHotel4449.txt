Since the recent major renovation project, Palmer House has looked even more phenomenal than before. Very classy and decadent in it's interior decor, it's a mix of the old with the new. Any personality can take light of the intimacy and nostalgia the lobby brings. A competent bar and restaurant awaits you on both sides of the main lobby, with reception very close by, and an excellent concierge service. Room service will take a toll on your wallet, but at a place like this - you shouldn't be at all surprised. The room rates and size vary according to how much you can pay, so expect to show some franklins if you wish to accommodate a large number of individuals to stay. This definitely isn't a motel six where you can cram a family of five for 80 bucks. My only gripe with the hotel is how the rooms are laid out. It can be a bit of a hassle to reach your final destination - your room. You'd think it was enough to fly, go through security checks, possibly experience the dreaded and inconsistent el from either O'Hare or Midway... but no. It doesn't end when you pick up your room keys. Let's just say I wouldn't want to have a serial killer after me. I'd totally get lost. Overall, an excellent hotel with great customer service, very convenient location (practically in the heart of downtown), and the historical landmark that it is to boot.
