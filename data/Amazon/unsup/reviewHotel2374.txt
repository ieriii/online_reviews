Gorgeous public spaces! The history of the building was fascinating. My room was on a recently renovated floor, and everything looked brand new - except the bathroom door which apparently hadn't been repainted since the '80s. It's a pet peeve of mine that when you're staying at a nice hotel and the TP in the bathroom is the cheapest, lowest possible quality. For almost $200/night, you'd think they can afford Charmin. Anxiously awaiting the day upscale hotels enter the 21st century and offer free wi-fi and simple printing options.
