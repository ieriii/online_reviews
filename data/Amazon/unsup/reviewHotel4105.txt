I've stayed here three times. Great location. Okay hotel. The lobby is impressive but really, that's about it -- and who cares -- want to eat in the cool center dining section surrounded by the reflecting pool and TV screens? I've never seen it open any hour of the day any of the three times I've been there -- they close it off and seat people off to the side. Other bonuses? This time our room came without toilet paper. Which is almost similar to how it doesn't come with free WiFi -- both are basic necessities. I planned for the lack of Internet access and left my laptop at home and just used my iPhone but its still annoying. The staff is friendly (as well they should be) but the rooms are in dire need of updating.
