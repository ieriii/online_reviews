Perfect location on Michigan Avenue - the Allerton has what big city travelers want. Who cares about big bedrooms and excessive bathrooms - the hotel has attentive staff - smart, caring, and willing to make it work. Yes rooms are small, bathrooms awkward at times - but the vibe of the hotel is positive and the people I met, amazing. All willing to make it work for you. If the room first selected is not to your liking, ask again, I did. Finding my 'suite' in a dark corridor, weird layout and not at all safe feeling. I asked to move, and front desk found a much better room, same rate that worked. Every person I dealt with was kind, empathetic, and willing to beyond to make my experience better. Bar served neighborhood crowd (church choir) as well as out of town guests. And all were welcomed by nice bar tenders. The maid service was great and also real in a face to face conversation. I loved that bathrooms while tiny and awkwardly designed, were stocked with "just enough" NOT TOO MUCH towels, etc. SO I felt no guilt actually using and not worrying that other towels had been left to linger. Thank you Allerton, nice staffing, awesome location, and great experience.
