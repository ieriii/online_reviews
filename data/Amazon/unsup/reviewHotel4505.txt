The Palmer House will definitely be my hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. Centrally located in the Loop, it is a beehive of activity. A little tidbit of trivia: it was originally built in 1871, but burned down 13 days later in the Great Chicago Fire. It was then rebuilt, apparently "fireproof," making it one of the oldest hotels in the country. The interior has absolutely gorgeous vintage opulence. There is a bar in the lobby area, as well as a newly renovated "Potter's Bar" (which used to be Trader Vic's, the oldest Tiki bar in Chicago). Our room on the 15th floor was beautifully decorated; a pleasant step through a time warp to the distant past. The only modern problems: wireless internet & cell phone got poor reception.
