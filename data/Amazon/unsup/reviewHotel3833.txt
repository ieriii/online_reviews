Starting from the doorman, the staff at the Dana is pretty damn friendly. The girls at the registration desk were honest, congenial and humorous, even though some white-collar accountant-looking-type was being handcuffed right behind me while checking in. Seriously. (Although I never found out what led to that.) The lobby, the lobby bar and the adjacent restaurant are all small and relatively quiet, but definitely have a ton of style. In fact, the entire hotel was far too cool for me, specifically, and probably too cool for most of humanity. The Tranquility Suite was simply awesome-- 2 rooms (a bedroom and a huge living room), 2 tiny balconies with amazing views (ask for a higher floor unless you have severe vertigo), and a nice bathroom with an unbelievable shower for two. Seriously, this room offered the best shower imaginable-- complete with 2 rain-style shower heads, 2 benches (for the ladies of course), a set of high-powered jets, and a handheld thingy that spits out mad amounts of water. This shower is definitely not "green", but it's the sort of place that makes you not want to leave. Finally, the bedding is tremendous-- it's hard to imagine feeling more comfortable in a hotel bed. All in all, the Dana appears to be designed to make you not want to leave your room (or the spa for that matter).
