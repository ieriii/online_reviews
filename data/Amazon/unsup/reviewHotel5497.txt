Here is a genuine find for a semi-tight-fisted tourist like me... I've never stayed in the Lakeview neighborhood area before, and I liked it. There are lots of fun places to eat and shop but still close enough to the Red Line for all the other Chicago attractions. This Best Western hotel was a terrific find for me since I was less than enthralled with their more generic and congested River North hotel closer to the Loop. That was full of college kids with hefty backpacks on weekend benders. This one attracts more of the middle-aged set who roll their suitcases from the cab. Oh wait, that would be me. It's a Georgian-style boutique hotel with a very friendly staff. I paid $150 per night for a nice-sized room with a king. It was very well maintained, and the "Do Not Disturb" sign actually seems to work in the morning. I never went in for their continental breakfast because hell, I was just across the street from Ann Sather. Besides, those early-rising Europeans beat me to it anyway. It takes about twenty minutes to walk to the Belmont station, which is on the main artery of the CTA since the Red Line goes up and down almost the full length of the visitable city. I'd definitely come back here in the summer months when the stroll is a bit more bearable.
