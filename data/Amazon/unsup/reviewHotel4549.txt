I booked this hotel via Priceline and I was very impressed with the hotel when I arrived. The lobby was beautiful and the gentleman at the front desk was very professional and friendly. Initially my 9th floor room was very spacious and well decorated. Unfortunately I had an uninvited guest in my room. There was a rather large cockaroach crawling on my bag that was on the floor. I called housekeeping and they killed it and asked if I wanted them to spray the room. I told them I wanted to be moved to a new room. I was moved to the 12th floor and the room was very small, the noise from the El was rather annoying and the bathroom toilet kept running after it was flushed. I was very disappointed at the level of service they showed after the incident I had. I suggest they keep up on there pest control.
