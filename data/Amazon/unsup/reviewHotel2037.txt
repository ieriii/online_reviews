We booked this room very last minute on July 3rd on Hotwire. I did a little research and had figured it was HI-Mart and for the price (100 with tax) and how late it was when checking in (2AM) I figured the room wasn't going to matter too much. The parking was very easy and compared to other city hotels was reasonably priced for staying the night with in and out. I believe it was right around $34. The check in was quick and easy, as it should be at 2AM. Although the guy checking us in wasn't very talkative or warm to us. The room was a very large with a king bed and a sitting area. The view was not of much however this hotel does offer some amazing views. I would actually say some of the best in the city because of it's position. A definite plus to this hotel. Some things that bother me about hotels that HI had on the list. 1. I hate when electronics aren't in working order when walking into room. The TV was unplugged, the batteries needed changed in the remote and the clock needed set as it was blinking. All simple things but also all simple things for the hotel staff to check on to make sure the room looks put together. 2. No info on Chicago in the room or info about the hotel. There was no book anywhere about restaurants in hotel, if room service was provided beyond breakfast, pool hours, etc. 3. Two VERY small pillows in the room isn't sufficient. Overall, I wouldn't stay again but it WAS a great hotel for a quick sleep in Chicago. I prefer a hotel with a more boutique feel and attention. Also, for me, the location wasn't ideal to being where I like to be in Chicago. For a family trip, reunion or even a guys weekend, I think this hotel would fit well. However, for couples looking to relax and have a nice weekend together I think you'd be better fit at a more boutique hotel.
