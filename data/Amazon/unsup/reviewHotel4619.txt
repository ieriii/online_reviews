The Hotel Felix rates comfortably between a Kimpton Hotel and the W. The single rooms are nicely appointed, but do not include a refrigerator, which I needed during Snowapocalypse 2011. Highlights: - The elevators are fast, which is atypical for a boutique hotel - The room service is quick and courteous - The rooms look like the inside of a West Elm store - The water pressure is very good - Each room has plenty of towels - There is a safe in the room - The fitness center has treadmills, elliptical machines and free weight dumbbells - The toiletries are a nice quality and plentiful - There is a bar and good restaurant, Elate, on the first floor My only complaint is that the single room is very small. The bedroom area is 12' x 12' and fits a bed and 1 - 2 moderately-sized humans. There is also a small desk that holds a laptop and not much else. That said, the spacious shower balances out the lack of square footage in the bedroom area. Net-net, I'd recommend and stay at the Hotel Felix anytime.
