I am currently staying at this place, and, as a teenager addicted to the internet, it sucks.All I ask is some free wifi for me iPod. Not too much, right?For these S.O.B.s, it is.To get wireless, or wired for that fact, it'll cost you $10 every 24 hrs. for internet access. Wired or wireless. Per device. And, seeing as I have three laptops, and two iPod touches, it really sucks. Balls.Take my advice, and if you stay here, which I don't reccomend, bring a wireless router, so it'll just cost $10 a day for all your devices.                     Matt out.
