I interviewed the general manager at the Palmer House. His friendliness and the friendliness of all staff that I encountered is why I'm writing this review. I haven't stayed at the Palmer House yet, but it is now on my shortlist for my wedding accommodation. Chicagoans...well, we love our city... and mention of the Palmer House gives us little sentimental heart tingles b/c of its deep Chicago historic ties. The newly renovated floors have stunning carpeting (deep brown with brightly colored, modern swirls of peacock aesthetic) with black/white photos of classic stars (Sinatra, Clark Gable, probably Ella Fitzgerald, etc.). Check out the 8th floor! And the furniture! Stunning vintage pieces! Bright greens, blues, etc. straight out of glamorous history! Beautifully photogenic! I'm usually the biggest fan of hotels like The W, The Wit, etc. and I so dig this hotel, b/c I think it fits right into that category without selling out its history.
