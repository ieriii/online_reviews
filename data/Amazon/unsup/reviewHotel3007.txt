I have stayed at the W - Lakeshore many times before and always enjoyed it. The overall vibe of the place is right up my alley. Modern, minimalist, and cool. From the moment the helpful and friendly front desk staff checks you in, you know this place is about details. The rooms are great! Well, I should say that the beds are the best ever. The 'Heavenly Bed' is just that, heavenly. When I upgrade my own bed at home, it will be to a Heavenly Bed. I can't say enough good things about how great I sleep on it. Maybe they are spiking the Bliss spa products that they stock the bathroom with. I'll steal these every chance I get! The bonus at my last stay was being able to see the Navy Pier Fireworks at NYE! Can't wait for my next stay!
