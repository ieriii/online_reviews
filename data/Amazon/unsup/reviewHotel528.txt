I stayed in Dec for 4 nights and the hotel was great. The standard room is fine with the view of fire dept. It's a few blocks to Miracle Mile, dining, and other attractions. Traders Joe and Jewel Osco is not that far from the hotel too. The staff are nice and friendly. I would come back to this hotel. The only improvement is that they need to improve on their free breakfast.
