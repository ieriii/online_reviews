Historic old hotel with a lovely lobby and bar area. My boyfriend and I stayed here over our anniversary for semi-cheap because we booked on Hotwire or Priceline or some damn thing. The rooms are only okay, though. We mysteriously had a room with two (comfortable) queen size beds and two bathrooms, so it was large, but it didn't have the elegance of the lobby. I'd happily come back, though!
