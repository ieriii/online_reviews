My husband and two young kids stayed in room 2A for 3 nights in November 2011. We were not impressed. The innkeeper was quite pleasant, however had awful body odor. My husband and I both remarked on this. When he showed us to our room, I asked if he would mind turning the heat up, as it was quite cold in the room. When we returned to our room later that night, we found a space heater outside our room. I could not believe that this place did not have heat while we stayed here. We had to rely on our space heater! The room was so noisy from the street that I thought the window must be open, but it was not. There are two shared bathrooms. Both of which were bare and in great need of updating. No soap or towels. I was reluctant to even place my towel anywhere in this room. Breakfast and coffee were not impressive. Not worth the money and definitely will not stay here again.
