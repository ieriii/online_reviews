Older, but classy and opulent decor transported me back in time to the 20's.  Laced with marble, and faux gold flourishes, the lobby and registration area is impressive, especially if you're wearing heels.  With a priceline booking, I was placed on the 22nd floor, which meant I had to take the Executive Floor elevator bank...making me feel far more important than I am.  Room had spa music playing when I entered and an LCD computer featuring their new Hilton Navigator...so long guest services 3-ring binder! Typical 4 star accommodations, but it has many antique/old world furnishings that differentiate it from most other Hilton's in the states. One bitchy desk clerk too many though. Want to give it 5, but it smells old.
