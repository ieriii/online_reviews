After having to stay in the chicago suburbs I finally got the chance to stay downtown and was excited to stay here - I usually love W's. This place sucked. The staff was snotty. The rooms were small. And the air conditioning was broken or something - it was so hot and muggy. The place was packed with snotty 20-somethings.  I will say its a great view. Next time I'll stay closer to MIchigan - likely the Peninsula.
