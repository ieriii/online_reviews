I had a terrible experience with the Knickerbocker hotel and would never go back: my computer was stolen from the room I was staying in. The hotel fought me for weeks on not having to reimburse me in full for a $2,000 computer, and tried to hide behind some Illinois' inn keeper law and tried to only reimburse me $500.  Knickerbocker: go read a book on the Four Season's up the street at Borders and take some tips on customer service.
