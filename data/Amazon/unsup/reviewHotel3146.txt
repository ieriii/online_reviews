I've been in one of the rooms here before. It honestly was pretty cool looking--wood paneled walls with a really big modern bathroom with some weird little window that opened up onto the room. But I'm still not convinced it was $300 a night good. For that much money there should be, like a bottle of champain waiting for you. And a whore in the bed.
