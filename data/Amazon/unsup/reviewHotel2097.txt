It has been around for over 30 years.....who knew?!?!  The recent renovation was well done. Modern look in good taste and the views from the event space on the 15th floor are spectacular. Cuisine is very good. Extra stars for the event staff. They are the most courteous and helpful we have experienced in 20 years working in the industry.  (They even cover parking for wedding/event vendors!!! No other place I know does this! Big kudos for that.). Forget the "Holiday Inn" brand you may be familiar with....as most have said this location is a delightful surprise. The 15th floor space is great for smaller weddings, but I think the space can be modified for different numbers of guests.
