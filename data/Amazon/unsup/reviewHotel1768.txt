I would definitely stay here again. The staff were all very friendly, and it's centrally located - near the el, but chances are you'll walk everywhere. It's next door to the Ford Cadillac Theatre, and a few other places are nearby - I recommend the Baton Club if you haven't been yet. Our room was a nice size for the price, the mattress and pillows were new and comfortable. No oversized tub to hang out in or big fluffy bathrobes - I missed those features. Good room service food, and be there for the complimentary wine reception in the evenings. Recently renovated.
