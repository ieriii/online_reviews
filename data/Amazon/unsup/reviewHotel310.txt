Nice quaint non chain hotel right across from my favorite club Berlin. It's always been my favorite place to stay at since all I have to do is cross the street and I'm snug in my non chain hotel exceptionally comfortable bed. It is on a busy road near the El if you are a light sleeper be aware. But the location is unbeatable.
