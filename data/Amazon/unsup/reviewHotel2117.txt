I've stayed at InterContinentals before (San Francisco, Boston), so I kind of knew what to expect from a luxe downtown hotel. This time I was in Chicago on business for one night. My co-worker and I saw the valet parking at the curb in front of the hotel but no one was there, so we opted to find the garage ourselves. That was tricky. It is located behind the building and underground. Take a right on E. Ohio Street, right on N. St, Clair, and then another right into the underground garage looking thing. The 505 Michigan Ave. parking will be on the left. Parking for one night was $57 (ouch!) but it was come and go as you please and was good until 5:00pm the following day. The employees at the front desk were friendly, as were the bellhops. We inquired about late check-out, and the latest they could offer us was 2:00pm if we signed up for their free rewards program. Eh, why not? I travel enough or work anyway. It's also good at Holiday Inn/Express, people. The room was nice (King bed). I really liked the soft music playing on the computer screen. It helped me sleep by drowning out some of the street noise. The pillows were nice and fluffy. I was really bummed that there was a fee to use the gym. I mean, I could understand the fee for wireless, parking, etc. But for the gym?? That made me sad. I love to work out and I wasn't about to pay almost $20 to use the gym for one day. Otherwise, the location can't be beat. Right near a lot of shopping and restaurants. You did A-OK, Intercontinental, Chicago.
