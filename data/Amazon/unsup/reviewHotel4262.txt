An absolute stunning hotel. The details are superb. The staff is curteous and helpfull. I love the restarant and bar in the lobby. It has such great energy. The bed and linens were so comfortable. Check-in was quick and efficent. Our bags arrived to our room with in 5 minutes. The location is perfect right in the heart of the theater disctric. You can walk to everything including millenium park. We will be back.
