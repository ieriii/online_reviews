My experience with the Amalfi was great! I stayed there last year when I came to the city to look for housing for when I moved. We got a great deal booking online and were extremely happen we decided to stay there. The location is perfect. It is around anything you need and restaurants galore. The free cocktail hour was a very pleasant suprise. They had an extremely nice spread of food and drinks for this cocktail hour (including their house made "Amalfitini"). They have fresh mozarella and proscuitto among many other things. When we went to the concierge to get a dinner recommendation, not only did she recommend something to us, but she knew someone at the restaurant and was able to get us 25% off our entire bill plus free dessert. That was a great perk! Other than that, the hotel is very nice and is a more modern looking style. I highly recommend this hotel.
