I stayed at the James a year and a half ago and LOVED it. Don't know if its just aged or if I had a better room last time, but this visit the place felt like it had aged ten years. Carpets in elevator, halls, and room feel dated and tired! Location is still superb and the overall vibe is good. Could not get spa to call me back to schedule a massage, which was also sad. Otherwise, location is good and it is a fine alternative to some of the other larger chain hotels.
