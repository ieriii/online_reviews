I was out with some friends the other night and suddenly I turned into Alice in Wonderland and fell through a rabbit hole. At the bottom of that rabbit hole was the Victor Hotel.  I don't understand this place, but I really don't understand clubs in general. Am I supposed to be impressed with the velvet ropes? The $20 cover charge? The 15 people that were there at 1am on a Friday night? The "reserved" tables that no one was sitting at? I wasn't.  I don't think I'll ever go back to Victor. Ever.
