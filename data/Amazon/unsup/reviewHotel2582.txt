So my friends and I have been going to Victor for years was nice at first but recently has taken a bit of a downturn. Tried to go there for a friends birthday party last Saturday and they turned one of our friends down because he had neck tattoos, supposedly saying it wasn't "that type of crowd" aka no people of color tonight. This place was already on a downward spiral but definitely won't be going back & wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.
