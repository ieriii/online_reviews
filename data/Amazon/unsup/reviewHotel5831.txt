My company held an event here and the staff overseeing it were FABULOUS!With the exception of the front desk staff, everyone here was polite and helpful! The rooms were nice and cozy, unique from other hotels I've stayed in. Who would have thought that this place used to be a cannery?!? Another minus was the lunch and dinner we provided for our guests. Dinner options were steak, fish, or veggie. The steak was cooked inconsistently, some very well done (and tough to eat), some medium, and some rare. When selecting the steak it was understood all steaks would be cooked medium, unless otherwise specified. To top it off the steaks were very fatty and the size of the steak was inconsistent as well. Some people received huge steaks while others got very small steaks. It was embarrassing to hear one of our attendees make a comment about it. The fish was god awful. WAY WAY over cooked. It was very dry and hard to swallow and this entree also had inconsistent portions of fish. I did not hear much feedback about the veggie dinner, but it did look pitiful.One huge plus is their clam chowder is DELICIOUS! I had 2 bowls!! Aside from the food, everything else was wonderful.
