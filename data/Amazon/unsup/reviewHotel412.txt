The location is great. I use the red line frequently so you can't beat the entrance that's about 6 steps away from the hotel. They also provide free internet in the rooms! No extra/hidden charges like Hyatt. The staff and service was fantastic, the people were more than willing to help you out however they could. The walls are thin and sound certainly travels through the bathroom vents, as some have mentioned, but it's a hotel.. It happens. Also the elevators do run slowly during peak times. There's only three for a 25+ story hotel, which is definitely one short of the optimal amount, but expect it going in and it won't ruin your stay. The bed.. It's got that strange comfort foam stuff, which is cool, but I found that it doesn't bounce back very quickly, so I'd have to alternate sleeping on different sides of the bed. Not a huge deal, but for people who have trouble sleeping they might want to do some more research into that.
