The fact that the hotel is on the 15th floor and up gives it a fancier feel than other places, but the rooms are your typical Holiday Inn rooms. My major complaint is the counter space in the bathroom. You get one little triangle sink for all your stuff. Try that out for three girls and one guy. The staff is so nice and accommodating. We would ask the maids in the hallway for tissues boxes and towels, and they were always courteous and friendly. I love the grand entrances from the street and the lobby. The front of the taxi area looks out to the river and skyline. Perfect for pictures. The bar they have on the 15th floor has a great view as well. You can get an expensive drink and watch the sunset. There is an indoor pool and a bad and pricey hotel restaurant. If you are lucky enough to get a room with a riverfront view, your windows will probably be open 24/7 because the view is gorgeous. The location is a little far from the touristy stuff. You will probably need to take a taxi.
