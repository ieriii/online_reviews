I stayed here about 3 weeks ago. I booked two rooms, but they gave me confirmations for four rooms instead. If I hadn't called to fix this, they would have charged me for cancelling two rooms. The stay at the hotel was alright. The rooms were clean and very basic. The dinner downstairs was alright. The buffet wasn't very consistent. One beef dish was very bland, but the next batch they brought out was overwhelmingly filled with pepper corns. Like I stated earlier, I booked the rooms with my card. However, a different card by a different person was used to pay with it. I received copies of the receipt by email and my card number isn't listed whatsoever as the form of payment. Now, can you explain to me why I got charged $200 by the hotel? Never again.
