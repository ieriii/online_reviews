I got a super deal at the James. $125/night. Yeah, you read that right...a total steal. After one day on my four day trip, I have to say that this is the best hotel at which I've stayed in Chicago. I'd heard about The James for a long time and as I'm a boutique hotel whore, I couldn't wait to check it out. And I wasn't disappointed. Well, let me modify that...I wasn't impressed with the decor, but what can you expect from an older (I can't believe 5 years is older in this category) boutique hotel. What I have really appreciated is the smaller touches. Keihl's (sp?) products, personalized, handwritten notes upon arrival, uber-friendly staff, great down pillow and crisp sheets, and loads of towels. I really can't find anything to complain about, except for that I'd love it if they offered a "sleep' function on the remote control (can't fall asleep when I'm traveling and need background noise.) -- and they actually may offer that but I've been too slow to figure it out. I wouldn't be surprised if I up this to 5 stars by the end of my stay...esp bc of the price.... Wait and see...
