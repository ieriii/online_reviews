Its a great location for a hotel- right off Michigan Ave. And it was incredibly cheap. I booked through Hotwire and it turned out to be about $70 a night including tax and fees.The rooms are small but nice. Wifi is free and worked great for me. I had no problems with the staff- everyone was friendly and polite. The one thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is that my room was freezing! I was on the top floor which probably contributed to the cold. I punched the thermostat up to 80 degrees but the room itself never got anywhere near that warm.
