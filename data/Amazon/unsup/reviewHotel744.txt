This Westin is great! We went during Taste of Chicago and it was the most inexpensive hotel I could find on/near the Magnificent Mile ... considering the location and amenities offered I think it's an excellent value. Yes, it's somewhat sterile in terms of decor because there's nothing trendy or flashy about it... they focus more on form than function with their comfy beds, dual shower head, etc. Service was very friendly (friendly than the Hard Rock!) and I highly recommend it.
