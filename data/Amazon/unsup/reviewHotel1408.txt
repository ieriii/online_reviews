This is a great hotel to stay in but beware, if you leave something behind you most likely won't see it again! I stayed here for a wok trip and had a blast. The hotel is very nice, concierge is extremely helpful, beds were comfy and the martini bar was delicious. However....and I know it's partly my fault but... I left a very expensive hair curler in the room to the left of the sink and 24 hours later when I called and realized I hadn't packed it, housekeeping said it was no where to be found! I swear to you I left it there, right in that spot, would bet my life on it and STILL, it's no where to be found by the staff. So I definitely recommend this place but don't leave anything behind!
