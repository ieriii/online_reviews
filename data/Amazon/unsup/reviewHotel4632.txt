Overall I was pleased with my stay at the Felix. The staff was very helpful, great bartender (very cute too), good location, and contemporary decor. The beds were very comfortable and dressed with quality linens. My complaints would be tiny and I do mean TINY rooms. In fact everything in the Felix was tiny. Tiny elevators, hallways, bar, and lobby. Complaint #2 there is no concierge. I'm a girl who makes the concierge my best friend so not having one was a big deal for me. However, the front desk people were helpful in making restaurant recommendations and the doorman gave decent directions. Overall, it fell short of what I would consider a boutique hotel, but for the price I would stay there again!
