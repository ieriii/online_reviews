The Dana Hotel and Spa is a bit unconventional -- very modern and chic design, pan-Asian cuisine, etc. -- but really enjoyable. I stayed at the Dana hotel for one night on my way back from a long and tiring trip and it was exactly what I needed at the time. I immediately took advantage of their spa-style shower (with one of those huge shower heads that feels like you're standing in a rainstorm), ordered room service, and luxuriated in the plush bed while watching some indulgent cable programming on the large, plasma-screen TV that you will find in each room. You could hardly ask for a better location as the hotel is only three blocks from the Magnificent Mile. My only complaint is that their room service is supposedly offered 24 hours a day, but when I arrived at 10pm the kitchen would only serve me sandwiches or salads. The menu is also entirely Asian-inspired, which is unique and interesting on their part, but not everyone is in the mood for sesame-soy glazes or wasabi dressing at all hours of the day. Still, the food was of better quality than most hotel room service options and I thought my "Chinese Chicken Salad" was tastier than I expected. Like Molly S. above, I also booked through a third-party company (http://hotels.com), but unlike her experience, everything went very smoothly for me and all of the staff were polite and helpful.
