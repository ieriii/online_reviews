had some work done at home so temporary stayed at doubletree for a few nights recently for the price, its not bad at all, convenient location, friendly staff, warm cookies, comfortable bed we were unlucky to have a bunch of teenagers next door, they were quite loud and the walls were thin aside from that, no complaints, its not peninsula but hey, i didn't have to pay peninsula prices either
