Great location in the middle of many restaurants and shops. The room had a great view of the river. Staff were friendly and helpful too. I deducted a few stars because wifi was $24.95!! The front desk said you could get free wifi in the lobby area but I I was unable to connect to it. For such a large hotel I was surprised that they didn't offer free wifi in the rooms.
