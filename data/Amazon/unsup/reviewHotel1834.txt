Didn't have a good experience here. Granted I booked late, and so I paid a very high rate (around $450) and they still put me in this tiny room that makes solitary confinement look comfortable. They called it a "Cozy Room" or something like that. The front desk attendant offered me some snacks to make up for it, and they never arrived. I called the front desk to ask and they promised they'd send them up. Never arrived. I can't tell you how awful the room was. I couldn't use the restroom as my knees were too long and hit the sink. I had to leave the bathroom to dry off. It was not possible to sit at the desk as the bed bumped into the table. Really awful experience. I'm only giving it a second star because I know the rest of the hotel is much nicer, but be careful what room you get.
