3.5 rating would be a better rating. We were on the water side at 34 floors up. Great view of the near north side. We also had a larger than normal room that included a chaise, which was great for reading. Our sink (along with the room next door) was backed up but the problem was soon fixed. So a great hotel if you are lucky enough to get a view, but it a remodeled hotel in a older building so don't be surprised if there are some hiccups to your stay.
