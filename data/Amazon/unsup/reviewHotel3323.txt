Gorgeous Carbide & Carbon building. Exceptionally decorated throughout. The service is wonderful and the rooms are stocked, even the beds are super cozy. Each floor (with the exception of the 13th) has cool rock memorablia. They also have a noon checkout which is a major plus!!! LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION and a one night stay was reasonably priced.
