The best thing about this place is its location. We stayed here recently for a museum-filled weekend, and, even though we had to battle the blusterous wind and oppressive heat, the walk through Grant Park to the museum campus was always pleasant. It's also an easy walk to Navy Pier, Willis Tower, and other attractions. If walking isn't your thing, though, catching a cab on Michigan Ave right outside the hotel is always a breeze. It's also just a block or two from Yolk, which is a must for early breakfasts. The pool was nice, and there's a fitness room that seemed fairly well-equipped, aside from the fact that there was only one treadmill. One thing we liked was that each floor has a Chicago theme (ours was The Art Institute), which was charming. The decor throughout the hotel is faded art deco, and I'm a sucker for that kind of thing. If you're staying for longer than a weekend, though, this place might not be adequate. Unless you get a suite (which we didn't do), the rooms have no microwaves and other things that come in handy for longer stays. Also, there's no pay-per-view, and the available channels on the television are limited. This is something I wouldn't typically complain about (who wants to watch TV on vacation?), but when you've got small kids, like I do, and their sleeping patterns are disrupted by travel, or if it rains, a movie is a good way to spend a little down time. We didn't visit the restaurant attached because it was very much not kid friendly. There were plenty of other dining options close by, though. Overall, it was great for a place to sleep and to hop in the pool to cool off, which is all I need for a few days. For a longer stay, I'd probably pick someplace else, especially with kids.
