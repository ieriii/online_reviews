This is a very classy W hotel. They comped me breakfast and it was delish! I didn't rent a car....I think I either took a cab around or their shuttle?? They had a giant pillow in the shape of a plum on the bed and I slept with that cushy plum every night and wouldn't let the maid service take it away... Great place to check out the nearby shopping and music/restaurant scene...the museums from....check it out...
