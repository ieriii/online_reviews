I've stayed at the Allegro several times while traveling for work and have never had anything but a pleasant experience. I typically like modern hotels but this boutique hotel is quite nice. The interesting decor, paired with the friendly staff and great wine happy hour make for a unique experience. I also liked the fact that it's located in the theater district which has its' own feel and is an easy cab ride anywhere you're looking to go.
