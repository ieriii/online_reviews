i know this is really lame, but refer to Shane H.'s review below. ditto to literally everything he said...esp the part about being unaccustomed to the midwest hospitality that is so absent in LA. unlike the 3-star ratings that complain about bad service here, we found the staff to be very attentive and helpful especially if we had questions about certain places in the city we wanted to check out. we stayed here for two nights during our four day stay and found that the location was perfect as everything--magnificent mile, the field museum, john hancock observatory, a lot of the highest rated restaurants in the city and even millenium park were all within walking distance. i actually noticed my clothes sagging a bit towards the end of our trip and later discovered that i had actually LOST a considerable amount of weight during our week in chicago despite eating copious amounts of bad food because we walked everywhere. it was actually so refreshing to be able to walk to our destination as opposed to always being stuck in a car (ugh, another thing about LA i detest).  another plus that i don't see mentioned was the gym. albeit small and limited in terms of equipment, they had these awesome state-of-the-art kinesis machines! i know it's lame to be so excited over workout equipment but they were so cool :) all in all, we really enjoyed our stay here and were kinda sad when we left to our second hotel. ps. MAKE SURE YOU TRY QUARTINO ONE BLOCK AWAY! we almost didn't but thank GOD we did!
