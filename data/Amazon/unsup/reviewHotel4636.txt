I booked this hotel through Priceline and got a very, very good price. When reading the reviews I was a little concerned about the size of the rooms. Much to my surprise, the room I received was very adequate. I have been in several other river north hotels and was familiar with small rooms. This room had a full bath. I was told it was only one of ten in the hotel (out of 120 rooms). My experience was great. The rooms were very clean. The location is great (only 3/4 blocks from Michigan Ave). The service was great as well. I parked across the street and saved about $30 over the two nights we were there. I would highly recommend this hotel.
