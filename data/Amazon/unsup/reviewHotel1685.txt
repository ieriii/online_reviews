My company booked a block of rooms for all of us because this was within walking distance to the office. When I first got there, the doormen was extremely nice, took my bags and had it sent to the room. I thought it was a little odd that instead of walking in and checking into my room, that I had to take the elevator to the lobby and then I was able to check in. The lobby itself is pretty big, with a grand piano, beautiful staircase, and lots of seats, its actually pretty cozy. The room itself wasn't bad, it was nothing spectacular. The room was big, but the way the room was set up was very odd. Usually the TV is in front of the bed, but mines was way off to the side. The bathroom was tiny! The sink was so small, that you could probably fit like 2 bottles of something and that is all the vanity space you have. Literally if I was on the toilet, I could reach over on the right and wash my hands in the sink or I could take 1 step over to the left and I'd be in the bathtub. Very small bathroom. With all the space in the room, they should really think about making the bathroom just a tad bigger. Bed was a little springy, but it wasn't bad. The comforter was really thin though. Whats with hotels having thin comforters for!? The hotel uses Aveda products so that's a plus. The fitness room was pretty great too - lots of new machines and clean towels. I didn't like that they didn't have a free business center. $6 bux for 15 mins of Internet usage! That's no good considering the other 2 hotels I stayed in Chicago had free 24 hr business center. But the hotel was clean and nice, staff was friendly, and the location was near work.
