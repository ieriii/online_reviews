I'd say by far, this is one of the hotels I actually consider staying in because of its free parking and super friendly and helpful staff. Like another person said... this isn't 5 star or anywhere close to it, BUT... it is a place that gives you the opportunity to rest your head and body after a long day of walking around downtown Chicago. Who really NEEDS all the glitzy 5 star stuff when you'll be out all day long and evening and/or night in downtown? Waste of money to have to have a hotel room with 1000 thread count sheets, mint on pillows, terry cloth bathrobes, et cetera... if you ask me. Save your money on things that are longer lasting... Anyhow... had a good stay here when I went to see Madonna perform at United Center :) Will definitely stay again :)
