My room was clean enough, but the hotel is old and dingy. The consistent smell of air freshener in the hallways made me wonder what they were trying to cover up.  The staff were friendly enough, but not terribly helpful. I must have been staying below a family of elephants as the noise from above was unbelievable. Oh, and the bed in my room was about as soft as a pallet of cement blocks.  Who cares if the parking is free -- I say stay somewhere else.
