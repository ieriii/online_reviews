The Hyatt is a nice hotel. The setup is a bit strange. We stayed in the west tower and we came to find most of the amenities in the east tower. So that was a minor inconvenience. Some of the amenities that were in the east tower that we used/ visited were the big bar, the bistro at 151, Stay Fit fitness center, J's Express, and the gift shop. Essentially all of the amenities we used. The room was nice. The only annoying thing about the room was the lighting. There was no centralized lighting. The staff was very nice and courteous. Would we stay again? Probably not, because there are so many other nice hotels in Downtown Chicago that we have yet to try. By no means is this a knock of the Hyatt.
