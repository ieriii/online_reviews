Aside from absolutely LOVING Chicago for what chicago was, this hotel made my experience so much more incredible. It's the little things that stick out and make staying someplace special - The James delivered!! We had an apt suite on the 15th floor. The room was spacious, so clean and modern looking. The bed was the comfiest bed. The linens were soft and didn't make that scratching noise you get most times at a hotel. The shower has two heads, for a rain like effect. Room came equipped with mini bar, fridge, they offered to bring us a microwave if we needed too! WiFi included!! We had a huge table with comfy bench seating, perfect for eating or working. The carpet was plush. Room service was on point, we waited no more than 5 minutes for any request. We ordered breakfast the first day, the food was fantastic. We both got egg white omelets with vegetables and coffee. I utilized the gym everyday I was there. It was WELL EQUIPPED and had high end machines. It was clean. They had pitchers of chilled lemon water and free headphones. They also provided oranges post workout. You can also request free workout DVDS for your room, muy importante for those looking not to gain travel weight!!! The staff was so sweet and kind, very helpful. The bellmen were also not bad to look at! Other things to note: Right across street from Trader Joes and a amazing pizzeria!! Also close proximity to N. Michigan, aka the Magnificent Mile. the location is just on point!!
