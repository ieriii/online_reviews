My husband had our wedding reception at the Embassy Suites. All I want to say to start is AMAZING!! Thelma, our event coordinator, was not only accommodating, gracious, and kind, she treated us like family. Everything was very personal and the entire staff at the Embassy Suites made our day so incredibly special. I wish I could remember every person's name that was so sweet and caring, not only to us, but to our family and friends. Thank you Embassy Suites, and especially Thelma, for everything. You have left us with a lasting impression that I will be honored and excited to share for the rest of my life! Xoxo!. L.O now L.M
