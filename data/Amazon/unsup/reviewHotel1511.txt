Great location- near Grant Park and Michigan Ave, plus on the river and a few blocks west of the lake. Great staff- very accommodating! One of the best fitness rooms in a hotel. And so appreciate the free wifi. Unfortunately, hotels are now charging an arm and a leg for that. Would have rated them a 5 if they had a pool/hot-tub and provided more updated bathrooms. However, I slept well. They have very comfortable beds. And I was on the 24th floor. I had a really good view. When I'm back in the windy city I will look to rebook her. First, I will ask if their bathrooms are updated.
