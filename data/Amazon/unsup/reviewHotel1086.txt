This is a really nice hotel.. I don't have too much experience with straight up $$$$ hotels as I usually prefer just a place where I can sleep, change, and clean myself up. This was a sweet holiday gift from my bf's parents as it also allowed us to sleep in Chicago for two nights before heading out to Wisconsin for Christmas. The location of the Fairmont is very nice - just a short 20 minute walk out and you can get around to Navy Pier and lots of other cool locations. Walk out further 20-30 minutes and you can get your way to a sweet bar selling sweet microbrews. Yum. The rooms are really nice especially for a double bed. I can't imagine a room with larger beds or one singular king-sized bed, but I would think that it would be pretty nice! They have lots of dresser space to put your clothes in, really nice pillows and blankets, the beds definitely let your legs dangle in a child-like fashion if you wanted to, the windows don't open up a lot but they do for some air, the heater/ac works accordingly, and the bathroom.. YAY. I love clean bathrooms. And awesome baths. Really nice standing up showers. A little hide-a-seek toilet room. I also frequented the spa downstairs in the basement as well - it's really nice and it was empty, so I could walk around completely naked as I had wished. And I did.
