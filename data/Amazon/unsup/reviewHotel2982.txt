My husband took me to stay the night for a fun date night one year and I'm finally getting around to writing a review of this place. Well, it's the W hotel, which obviously means it's stylish, cool, trendy, all in once place with an exceptional location in Chi-town overlooking Lake Michigan. We were there in the winter so I can't speak for spending time outside the hotel facilities so we definitely took full advantage of the inside. The people at the lobby were super nice, the decor was fab-u-lous throughout and the actual hotel room was spacious, clean and had a very chic feel to it. We left as happy guests. The best part of the hotel is that it houses Wave restaurant which is like Mediterranean tapas and it's absolutely delicious and definitely cost effective. This 4 star hotel is a great location to stay for both tourists, locals and even if you're on business trips, the concierge will be friendly and polite and the bar is definitely worth checking out and if time allows, make a reservation at Wave. And I have to mention that I got a really good night's sleep when we stayed our one night, bed was super comfy and those pillows, I was seriously contemplating taking them home with me.
