I was so worried about my stay at the hotel after reading some of the reviews online, but maybe the hotel felix is aware of their inconsistent reputation and is working to change it. I booked through a third party online site for a very low price for a friday night stay. I was traveling with my aunt, so it wouldn't have been a big deal if the room only had one bed, but I called two days before our arrival to put in a request for two beds. The representative I spoke with was very kind and accommodating, and told me she could not promise that the room would have two beds, but that she would note it on my reservation. When we checked in, the host had already set us up in a room with two beds, and away from the elevators. The room was a perfect size for one night (maybe not so for a family). The beds are not queen-sized, but they are so comfortable. The room had a pleasant smell, was quiet (although there is some noise from the hall), and the H2O spa amenities are fantastic. The sink in the bathroom was odd, but was not too difficult to use. I really liked that there were makeup removing towlettes, q-tips, and cotton balls available, as well as a small hair dryer. The shower was big and had a rainfall showerhead. The lobby is really beautiful, and in the morning they serve metropolis coffee! The doormen are so friendly, and had big smiles for us even at 7:30am in the very cold chicago morning. I would definitely stay here again!
