We used the Westin for our wedding room block and found it to be a perfect fit! Rates were a little high but it was marathon weekend so we expected it. We did have a few glitches throughout the planning process and check in but Abbie Armbruster, our contact, quickly and professionally addressed them. I would definitely recommend for groups or personal travel!
