Terrific business hotel if you are working downtown. The gym is small but serviceable, the rooms small but very clean and the restaurant that is attached serves wonderful meals. The best part of this hotel for some meeting clients is the European style lobby. It serves as a first rate office away from home with high speed internet, meeting areas and coffee in the morning . Staff are super polite and helpful. The area has loads of good place to eat. If you have the time the lake front is an easy stroll from the hotel.
