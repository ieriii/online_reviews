The hotel interior was beautiful and the staff was friendly. The walls are very thin since it is an old building and you can hear everything next door and in the hallway, which is a problem if your neighbors get in late and make noise, or if they watch a movie with the volume on. Beds were comfy and the front desk was friendly.
