Stayed here earlier this month for the 4th long weekend (I'm from Toronto, friends drove from Indiana). I should mention that I'm not one who cares for a super-fancy room. Besides, how much time are you going to spend in it for anything other than sleeping? But there were some big problems. I'll break it down this way:The Good:-free parking-free internet (we had no issues with the connection)-decent central location-the amazing bellhop (?) whose name I cannot remember. He was a sweetheart and super helpfulThe Bad:-old, old building with THE SLOWEST, tiniest elevators, ever-front desk stuff that were, well, not so bright (best example of this is when I had to get the manager to call my credit card company and reverse the room charge after I told them explicitly I wanted to pay cash. This could have very well ruined my entire weekend, not to mention my ability to shop/eat, if the charge hadn't been dropped)-stairwells smelled like piss-puny, old bathrooms with barely enough room to turn around in(sink is actually located outside the bathroom itself)-very noisy in the halls, and in the room above us (elephants?) and little will on the part of hotel staff to do anything about itMaybe some of my beefs are a little circumstantial, but I still don't think it was worth the price I paid. If I return to Chicago I'll be staying somewhere else.
