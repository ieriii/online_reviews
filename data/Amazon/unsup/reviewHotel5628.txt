Nice hotel. Pretty good service, but their food was below par for a Westin. We were there all week. The room service (I ordered stir fry) food was cold and salty - had to send it back. The banquet food was good except the meats - dry. We had to wait 40 minutes for sushi in the lobby, and so on. There are a pile of great restaurants around there - that would be my suggestion.
