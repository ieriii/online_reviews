Did a staycation here with my hubby, it was looovely. I may have even made a souvigner :)))). Rooms are really cool. we had the junior suite so it worked out beautifully( I Must have my own bathroom, must) we went to cibo matto for dinner (yum yum) and roof for drink which is always great especially on a warm summer chicago night!! I love the rug too when you walk in " never hate on the weather in chicago, 9 times out of 10 a conversation is started thanks to it) or something or other. heheheh love the wit, the wits the shit!!
