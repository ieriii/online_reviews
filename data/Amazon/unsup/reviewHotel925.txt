I stayed at the Hotel Burnham for three nights right after Christmas. The location is great for the Art Museum, Theatre District, restaurants and shopping. I was excited to experience a Kimpton hotel because the reviews I had read about their boutique hotels led me to believe that the Burnham would have a friendly and a cozier feel to it. I was disappointed. The room was lovely, but the bathroom was small and my showerhead had pressure problems. The water was also lukewarm so I could not take a hot, relaxing shower. The "free" hot chocolate that was offered in the lobby was somehow never available when I was in the lobby. I ordered room service for breakfast all three mornings there. Two of the three days, food or some item was not brought up on the first delivery forcing me to call room service and have the server bring up the missing food or item. Not good when you have already poured milk on your cereal and realize the sugar packets are missing. The down comforter was not in a duvet cover leaving me to wonder if I was sharing the uncovered comforter with the previous guest (s). The person at the front desk assured me that the comforters are cleaned for each new guest(s), however, I did not feel confident in what he told me. On the bright side, I loved the location of the hotel, and I loved the view from my room. I was on the corner of State and Washington Streets, and I could see the Bean at Millenium Park.  I cannot say that my stay at the Hotel Burnham was unpleasant because I loved the sheer excitement of being in downtown Chicago, and some of the staff were very kind and helpful; notably Ben at the front desk, and one of the housekeepers whose name escapes me. But on the whole, I would not stay at this hotel again, and possibly not at any of the Kimpton Hotels after this experience.
