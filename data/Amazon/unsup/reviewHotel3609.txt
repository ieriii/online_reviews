An incredible experience! I recently planned a business conference at the Drake, and could not have been more pleased with the service, staff, and facilities. In both planning and implementing the event, the staff was attentive to our needs, personable, and accomodating. The facilities were beautiful, the presentation elegant, and the experience impeccable. Our attendees were impressed and delighted, and I would wholeheartedly recommend the Drake for both professional or personal events. Many thanks to John, Eric and Lauren.
