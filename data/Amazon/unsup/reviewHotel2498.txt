Old world charm that nickels and dimes you the whole way through. There are so much better places to stay in Chicago, I must say I am not a huge fan of the Hilton Chicago. Was put in a room with a view of a brick wall without being told, and the room was so hot I had to keep the windows open in March. HORRIBLE!
