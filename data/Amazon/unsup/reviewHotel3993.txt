LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION Here during St Patricks Day weekend. Even Prez Obama was in town.. Great room rate via Priceline. Can't touch anything for less than twice the $$$. Too bad the Yellow WaterTaxi was shut down for the weekend. Crazy weather... no snow. People are running around with just shorts and t-shirts. Saw the Chicago River turn St Patty's green.
