Very nice and got a great deal. You can't beat $125 (including taxes) for a weekend night in Chicago. The staff was very friendly and accommodating (the outside street attendant let us leave our car parked there for 45 minutes so we could check in and run up to our room without having to pay for parking). The rooms were slightly small, but the hotel is located in a perfect place. We'd definitely stay again.
