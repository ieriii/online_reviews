Solid hotel with extra points for consistency of service and quality. My check in was quick and I got some extra amenities for being a Starwood member. Rooms are fairly spacious, clean, and I enjoy their beds and linens. I would suggest placing the "do not disturb" sign up if you're not an early riser. I forgot to do so two mornings in a row and I had housekeeping knocking at 7:30am (that's 5:30am PST for me so I was a grumpy face). Their meeting rooms are average but were ALWAYS freezing. However, they quickly came in to adjust the thermostat every time we called. I also don't know if it's because Chicago is such a high union-based city but the rates and charges for the meetings services were MUCH higher than other cities I've worked in. Note to self, budget wisely. This Sheraton has a great location and beautiful views. Their Chi-Bar had tasty cocktails and somewhat of a swanky decor. Overall, I look forward to coming back in March for our event. Let's hope the weather is on our side! :) 3.5 Stars
