I stayed here from June 7th - 11th fora a birthday weekend getaway, and I found myself pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Comfy beds, trendy decor, two on-site restaurants and a world class staff. I made a big mistake though, forgetting to tip my wonderful house keeper, so to whoever you are - I was in room 602 and I hope that this review makes up for my lack of appreciation. It's completely out-of-character of me and I sincerely apologize. Thank you so much to the Kimpton staff for being some of the most hospitable team members I've come across. You've definitely earned my loyalty in the Kimpton Hotel family and I'm looking forward to a repeat visit. I hope this review finds you and your future guests well. Great hotel, Great location, and one memorable experience to keep forever. Thanks for being rockstars.
