We chose the Amalfi because of it's great location, reasonable price and small size.  I read the reviews of other Yelpers and after spending the night there yesterday here is my take on this Boutique Hotel.  With the exception of the 2 front desk people , the staff is very friendly and helpful. The style of the lobby and common areas are modern Italian meets Ikea . The lobby is interesting, but I found the two desks where you check in an odd set up.  Our room, although small, was attractive, comfortable and clean.  I had read that some reviewers found the rooms run down. This was not my experience. The furnishings, wallpaper and linens looked very new. The bathroom was quite large compared to the room itself. It had a nice large vanity, make up stool, lighted make up mirror and a wonderful double headed shower.  The provided DVD's and CD's were lost on us, but the magazines and books were nice.   The hotel offers a free breakfast of pastries and fruit on each floor. This is a nice touch and very convenient especially after a late night on the town. They also offer a free evening cocktail hour in a " lounge" on the 6th. floor. We went upstairs to have our free drinks, but found a long line of people waiting to get inside. We took a pass on the drinks. Would I stay here again? Probably not. Here's why... 1. The room was small and narrow. It was ok for one night, but too small for more than that. 2. Noise. Our room faced the alley and we heard garbage trucks , homeless people, hotel workers and people from the building next door all night long. 3. Age. We are in our 40's and felt VERY old. The average age seemed to be late 20's to early 30's. 4.VIEW.... The only view we had was that of the building across the alley. I had read that the views were bad, but bad is too nice for what you get. I never thought I would care about views, but this was so awful that if we had planned on staying more than a day, I would have switched hotels.
