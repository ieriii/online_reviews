Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Room was clean and well decorated. Bathroom was more unique then most hotels and where there was not carpet there were hard wood floors! very unexpected. Very Quiet, Definitely Located in the business part of Chicago. Got a Shedd Aquarium VIP package with room and the overall price was fantastic I almost felt like I was robbing them. Hot Tub and Pool were small but no one was using them anyway so there were no complaints. Breakfast Buffet was I have to say the best I've ever had in a hotel before (and free). Wide variety and the wait staff took very good care of everyone. I had a good time.
