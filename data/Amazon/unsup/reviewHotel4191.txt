The Hyatt is a decent place but certainly not a place I would recommend to friends trying to get a true Chicago experience. It's in a good location only a block from Michigan Avenue and a couple blocks from Millenium Park but beyond that, what makes it a 4 star hotel or worthy of any other Hyatt I have stayed at? A run of the mill 2 double bed room is small. The hallways are very dimly lit. The staff there is good and I thought helpful. However, if you are looking for a really nice room and a nice hotel, look elsewhere. The Hyatt is a conventioneers hotel and nothing more. It's large to accomodate large conventions. If you can get it through Priceline.COM for 75 bucks a night or less, go for it. Otherwise, look at other 4 star hotels in the Loop or on Michigan Avenue.
