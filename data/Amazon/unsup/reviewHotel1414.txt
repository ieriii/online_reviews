Great hotel.  Really its all about location and this hotel has it.  You are right on the dreamy romantic part of Michigan Ave. and a just walk from everything. The rooms are smallish, but the old school elegance of this hotel is tangible and cannot be faked. You really feel its years envelop you and it welcomes you back from your jaunts like an old friend or drowsy lover. When I stay here I always park in a pay lot and walk or take a cab since you could stay a week at a chain motel for what you pay to keep your car in the garage over the night.  See you there.
