Thing about hotel business is... it's all about the service, the willingness to go over and above for their guests, and the attention you give to your guests.  Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers had it all.  Also what everyone should understand is that... it's the nature of the business to enjoy all those things above when you have a connection. So I guess you can say I have somewhat a biased opinion.  We stayed in a two-room suite complete with two LCD TVs, two double beds, two full bathrooms on the 19th floor.  We also had access to the Club Lounge on the 33rd floor which was great. Free breakfast every morning. Hor'dourves and snacks served in the afternoon.  When we had a difficult request for a particular service, the staff went over and beyond to get it done. And they were kind about it from the beginning to the very end, making sure it was to our satisfaction. They even made a couple of calls to our room to make sure everything was ok. Now THAT's what I call caring for their guests! Now it's not to say that they don't have ANY flaws. With the kind of price they charge their guests every night, high-speed wireless internet should be FREE.  But that's a minor concern. After all, don't we all want to be AWAY from all the craziness of emails and things-to-do's when we're on vacation??
