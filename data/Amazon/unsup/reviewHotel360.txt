Another awful hotel located just next door to the also-awful Congress Plaza. As sh!tty as the Congress usually is, I'd have to rate this Travelodge even lower. I wish I could give it zero stars. Or even negative-two-stars. It sucked THAT BAD. The lobby smelled like diarrhea. The elevators were broken the entire time I was there, which was extra fun since the entire hotel was full of Lollapalosers and it was hot as f-ck outside (and in, since their AC barely seems to work). There was some kind of sewer gas leaking into every crevice in the building that created the aforementioned stink. The bathrooms were disgusting. And again with the protein-stains on the bedding. Um, okay hotels...people F-CK in your rooms, okay? They're going to leak their nasty juices all over your sheets so STOP BUYING WHITE SHEETS FOR YOUR BEDS! If there's going to be dried spooge on my bed, I'd at least prefer not to see it. Writing this review is a waste of my time and yours. You only need two words from me: STAY AWAY.
