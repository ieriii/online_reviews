Perfect location for shoppers but not the greatest hotel in terms of quality of rooms. The lobby was amazing and so was the staff. The rooms on the other hand were just dull other than the views out over the city. We turned the couch around and had a bottle of wine looking out over the city at night 33 floors up and it was perfect! Overall best location for a hotel for shoppers but your paying for just the location not the quality of rooms.
