It seemed like a great Priceline deal, nice-sounding hotel in the Loop... until I check in and discover that parking is an astounding $62/night. The desk clerk says "well after all, it IS Chicago." I asked him to have my car stolen; after all, it IS Chicago. The walk to my room was reminiscent of the Big Wheel scene from The Shining. The room is Grandma-fancy, along with Grandma-pathetic electricals circa 1983. Is that really a double bed? I didn't know hotels had rooms with just one double bed, other than maybe the Y. The room is clean, but tired. Room service shuts down at midnight, again kind of Grandma. I'm sorry - I am a guest here but I have to pay extra to use the fitness room? Barf that. Would I book here on purpose? How many stars am I holding up?
