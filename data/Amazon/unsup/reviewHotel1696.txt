Here is my pro/con list: Pro - Very nice decor - Free wine hour every evening - Nice location in the Loop - LCD TV - Very nice service staff - Free paper if you like Con - Horrible Internet (come on people, Internet needs to be standard, and I'm taking better than what I can get at home) - Rooms are small - They don't use a proper bottom sheet, so the sheets move all over the place (one of my biggest pet peeves)
