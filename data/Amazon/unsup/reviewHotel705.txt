Location, location, location...that's the primary benefit of this hotel. CMs are pretty standard wherever you go...yes, some better maintained than others. This one was finishing a renovation but the rooms still looked pretty average.  If you like being near Michigan Ave. and don't want to pay extreme prices but want a decent bed at night and good business travel amenities, this is the place. 2 blocks from Nordstrom, a few blocks from Ginos and right next to the brand new Garretts Popcorn shop with the heavenly caramel aroma. A very small Starbucks off the lobby. The bed is okay, not great, not enough blankets. Free wireless is great. Not enough channels on TV (no A&E, no TRUTV); Great bellmen who are very helpful. You can schedule the cleaning of your room in case you want to go out for the day and don't want to leave your laptop, etc. in the room while it's being serviced.  Do not...I repeat...DO NOT order room service from the restaurant off the lobby called Vivande. I had the misfortune of ordering dinner from there on SuperBowl Sunday because I wanted to eat in my room and watch the game. The salad was old and the soup had these mushy croutons (blegch!). Eggs over medium were eggs over raw.  The serving staff was apologetic of course but it was a poor compensation for bad cuisine. I would stay there again yes, especially if I knew i wasn't going to spend much time in my room (to go shopping instead!)
