Silversmith was a perfectly acceptable hotel in the middle of Chicago's downtown and a short walk from Millenium and Grant Parks. You cannot beat the location. However, for a "boutique hotel", I was expecting more. The lobby was kind of strange... all wood with their "business center" (2 computers) and their gym which was pretty sorry looking. Our room was very dark since we were directly facing another building. That being said, the room was immaculate, the staff was friendly and the beds were comfortable. This was completely serviceable, however it didn't seem very "boutique hotel"-ish to me. I'm not sure if they should try to sell themselves as that. Either way, it was affordable and worth it for the location alone.
