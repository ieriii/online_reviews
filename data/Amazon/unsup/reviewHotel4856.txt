Worst Hotel I've ever stayed in. Nothing like the website at all. The room was completely dilapidated and musty. Furniture was scratched and looked old and dirty. Carpet was dingy and smelly. baseboards and wall paint were deplorable. Bugs in the bed. I was completely astounded at the misrepresentation of the room compared to the photos on the website. In addition, after moving to another hotel, the Congress Plaza management charged my credit card for four nights I did not stay there. They refused to give me the credit and so I was responsible for paying 4 nights which I did not stay in their hotel.  I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.
