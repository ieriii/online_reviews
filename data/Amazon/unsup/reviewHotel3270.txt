I have to say, I had little if any expectations when I was booking our rooms here. Boy, was I surprised. All 18 of us had only positive feedback - not one negative or even sub-par comment (and that says a lot with this diva minded crowd). GREAT, great, great staff. The building itself is gorgeous and easy to spot from the exterior. They're planning a renovation soon (very much unnecessary in my opinion- no sign of the typical wear-and-tear). There is a Starbucks located in the same building- bonus - and they are centrally located to everything. I'll be staying here the next time I'm in Chicago - no question about that one.
