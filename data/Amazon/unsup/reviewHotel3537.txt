For the price, this hotel is up to par. It is in a great location in Downtown, Chicago. You can either walk or take mass transportation to any of the spots in the city. The beds are the most comfortable I have slept on in a hotel room, hands down. The hotel has a rooftop pool on the 40th floor with spectacular views of the city. The pool was not all that impressive but the view made up for it. There is even a bar in the hotel that had Trivia Night on Tuesdays. We didn't make it to Trivia but the idea is always fun! If you are looking for a hotel in the mid-100s price range, I recommend this one.
