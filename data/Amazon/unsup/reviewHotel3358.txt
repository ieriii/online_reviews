Just because it's cheap doesn't mean it has to be crap, which it is. The rooms are teeny tiny, so if you want to be comfortable you will need two rooms if you have more than two people, which will make it just as expensive as anywhere else. The parking is valet only and crazy expensive ($40/day). The daytime staff were jerks, including the valet guys and front desk guys. We kept getting dirty towels when we asked for clean ones. One appeared to have blood on it.  There were some pros. All the rooms have LCD HD TVs, which is nice. There is a pool. It does have a great location in the South Loop area. And yes, it is very affordable. Also, the late night front desk clerk was awesome. He was extremely friendly and helpful and had been at this place since the late '80s. He probably hasn't been rewarded enough if he is still working that shift.  Also, the adjacent restaurant/bar isn't terrible. It's no classy joint, but the bartenders were talkative, the food was as good as expected and it appeared to have a decent amount of regulars.
