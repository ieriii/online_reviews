I had my wedding here on 5/14/11, and I was very pleased with the entire event. From start to finish, Barbara Martin, the catering manager, was very easy to work with and very accommodating. The view from the Wolf Point Ballroom is great. It looks out over the river and makes this more than just another hotel ballroom.  Another nice surprise was that the food was amazing. I don't tend to expect much of wedding food, but I must say that ours was delicious. We chose chicken napoleon with roasted vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.  I had people telling me all night that they loved it. The cake (from Alliance Bakery) was included in our package and that was great, too. And I didn't have to do any coordinating. The bakery dealt directly with Barbara.  The rooms that they blocked out for us were also very nice. The rooms for both sets of parents were free, as was our bridal suite which was spectacular. It was huge, had a nice view of the city, and there was free champagne and cookies waiting for us. We, and our parents, also got free breakfast the next morning.  I definitely recommend having an event there. We really wanted a downtown wedding and at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza we were able to get it without spending a crazy amount of money.
