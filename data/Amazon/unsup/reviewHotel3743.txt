Baffled by the 5 star reviews and comments about good decor...I would never stay here again, although the location was good for me. The most annoying thing about the hotel is the elevators. We stayed with a baby and were using a stroller and you must take an elevator up 1 floor to get on another elevator to get to your room. There are 2 or 3 other elevators that go from street level throughout the hotel that are empty, that they reserve from the rooftop bar only and staff only. These elevators remain empty, while the others are overcrowded and make many stops. Once on that elevator you must insert your card into the slot to press your button and hope the elevator has not already started moving. Most other people in the elevators were confused and annoyed by this. In addition they put us in a room next to the elevator that was noisy and you could hear the club music coming up from in from inside the room. In addition one night there were (what sounded like 20) drunk people hanging out in our hallway, talking really loud for at least a half an hour, which isn't really the hotels fault, except the rooms were not sound proofed. Whoever designed this hotel is an idiot. ALL of the design elements are completely disjointed, and do not go together. The style over thought, all over the place and is in poor taste. These is nothing inspiring or calming about it. Less is more people!
