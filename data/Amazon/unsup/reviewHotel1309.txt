Overnight (a Tuesday) in the city for the Billy Joel/Elton John show. All hotels, I mean all, were booked so we decided to splurge. On the positive: + Friendly and prompt doorman, he greeted us by name hours later when we left for the evening. + I really appreciate genuine courtesy, with no pretense. We received that upon check-in. + The concierge knew we were in for the concert and had directions to Wrigley pre-printed upon our arrival. + Very clean, and well decorated room...spotless room/bathroom; drawer liners; white, I mean white, bedding. + Tasty and speedy room service - available at all hours (we ate at 1:00 am) + Lovely in-room breakfast...things that were supposed to be hot were hot and chilled things were chilled. + Early check-in request granted (11 am) + Late check-out request granted (Noon) + Great location + Beautiful lobby + Friendly and professional staff +++++ A lake view without requesting it...this never happens to us without an upgrade request. Stellar service example... - Although laundered, one of our robes had a nasty stain on the butt- ewhhh...we called their attention to it and we were rushed a new robe and our room-service bill was comped without even requesting that. They just took care of it, and apologized three times for it. Room for Improvement - Housekeeping seems to have the glitches - stationary set had not been checked in a while...kinda ratty and marked up - stained robe in the room previously mentioned - morning paper/breakfast order had been placed via hang card, but did not get turned in - therefore our breakfast was not delivered at the requested time, and had to be reordered...when called to their attention they had it to us in record time with many apologies...the breakfast was part of our package so we were not charged for it. We would/will return. Really appreciated being appreciated for staying. :)
