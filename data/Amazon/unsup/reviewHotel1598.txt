we used this hotel as our suite to get ready in before wedding, our honeymoon suite, and family rooms. the website is misleading and the staff were unfriendly. the rooms that we thought our guests and ourselves were getting (depicted on website) was not the room they put us in. awful animal print and DIRTY. VERY DIRTY My hotel suite did not come with refrigerator and the toilet leaked. the staff was not helpful and not friendly. I would not recommend that anyone stay at this hotel.
