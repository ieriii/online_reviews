We had the Perfect Wedding!!! From start to finish my husband and I had a phenomenal experience planning our wedding with the Omni Chicago. The food - staff - facilities - and overall standard of service was phenomenal. Logistically it was so easy to get married at Holy Name Cathedral, have a fantastic view of Michigan Avenue at the 676 restaurant for our cocktail hour, and have our reception and guest rooms in one building. The food that was served at our reception was served hot and tasted phenomenal.The front desk and maintenance staff were very helpful and even put up an extra hook in my closet so we could hang up my wedding dress. The entire event went off without a hitch and far surpassed our expectations - and those were bridal expectations :) Sarah Johnson was our event manager and she made us feel at ease and excited about our wedding from the start. She was extremely professional, flexible, very responsive, easy to work with, and an overall pleasure to be around. I am a very detailed oriented bride and we never worried about a thing. Thank you for such an incredible event!!!
