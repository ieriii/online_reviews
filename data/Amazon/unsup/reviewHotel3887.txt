My experience at this hotel was significantly better than the 2 stars it currently has. We were able to check in several hours before the listed time without any issue. The clerk that checked us in was very friendly and polite. We stayed in a room accessible via the north elevator (even numbered rooms) on the 10th floor. Our view was not great, but the room was very clean. The air conditioner seemed to work fine, although it was not extremely warm while we were there. The hotel had a very aged feel to it, but my expectations for an 1890's era building were far surpassed. The housekeeping staff was very nice. They quietly knocked at the door around 8 am every morning, but we had to turn them away as we were preparing to venture out into the city. Each of the 3 days we stayed, we returned to find things tidied up and cleaned very well. Nothing was out of place in anyway. We dealt with two separate concierges and another desk clerk who were all friendly and helpful. There were only two things that distressed me about my stay. The Mountain Dew LiveWire button on the soda machines returned Orange Crush and my expectations of being creeped out by a haunted hotel were not met. This place is definitely a deal in the heart of downtown. Great access to subway and buses. I would stay here again if I return to Chicago.
