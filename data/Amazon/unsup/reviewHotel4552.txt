Dates: February 14-16 Price: $76 a night via priceline (Actually 3.5 stars) This place exceeded my expectations, albet those were low based on the price I paid (chicago in february apparently not all that popular). The star of this place is the lobby, which is really what all hotel lobbys should be. Beautiful high ceiling was old school without being stuffy. Very cool white marble bar set right in the lobby, not pushed off to a secluded corner. Many leather booths with table service for afternoon tea or late night drinks. Location is not great, particularly on the weekends, athough it is 2 blocks from millenium park, and a block from a bunch of train lines. The low light of the trip was the rooms, small, not particularly modern or lush at all. Service wasn't really great, although that rarely bothers me very much. Corner bakery outside is so-so.
