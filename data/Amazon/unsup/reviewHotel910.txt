I have never stayed at this hotel, nor have I ever set foot in one if its rooms. Nevertheless, I am forever grateful for the Hotel Burnham... June 28, 2008... Leaving Grant Park after the most amazing FREE Stevie Wonder show. The music was still in me as I danced down the street with good friends and a bladder full of magic lemonade. The conversation included talk of hopping on the Brown Line and heading to Lakeview, but I knew I would never make it that far. The lyric in my head quickly had gone from Stevie's " All I do is think about you" to that Detrol commercial's "Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go right now". I assured my friends that I would catch up with them later and mumbled something about going to Marshall Fields...I rushed down Washington St. on a mission. But I would have needed a time machine to visit the Marshall Fields bathroom, or even the Macy's bathroom (the store was already closed for the night). Feeling defeated as I stared through the locked Macy's door, I turned around and took a huge sigh of relief. It was the Hotel Burnham & Atwood Cafe. I remembered eating there, and having to cut through the hotel lobby and go downstairs to visit the ladies room. I ran across the street, but slowed down as I entered the hotel lobby and smiled at the front desk staff as I made a bee-line toward the stairs. There, at the bottom of the stairs was the bathroom, just as I had remembered. Afterwards, I walked out of the Hotel Burnham with head held high, and the ability to handle the train ride without the threat of a most embarrassing moment. Thank you Hotel Burnham for being there when I needed you most.
