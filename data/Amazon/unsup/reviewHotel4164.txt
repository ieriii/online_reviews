There was trash in the room when we came in...a bunch of paper and bags stuffed behind the chair in the corner. When we first called down to tell the front desk, we were put on hold for several minutes and had to call back. Finally did get a hold of someone. We went for a walk and when we returned, some of the trash had been cleaned up, but there was still paper stuffed behind the chair (even though we had told the front desk that that was where the trash was).  On top of this, the room we were given was the ADA-compliant room, which we were told was our only option if we wanted a king bed. It was very clear that this hotel 'phoned-in' conversion of this room for ADA-compliance; many of the fixtures were poorly converted or useless, regardless of one's ability status.  For example, the bathroom sink was incredibly small and shallow. More the size of a sink in an RV than a full bathroom.  Instead of installing ADA-compliant towel racks, there were simply no towels in the bathroom. It really was unpleasant to step out of the shower and realize that you have to walk out into the bedroom and into the closet to get a bath towel.  Annoyingly, the room's security latch was installed at the same height as the main light switch. When the latch was unlocked, it covered the light switch. The was very frustrating when coming into a dark room for the evening and having to fumble behind the latch to get to the switch. The overall ambiance of the hotel lobby felt more like a mall food court than a relaxing hotel. Parking was shockingly expensive, and increased the cost of our stay by 50%. Only pro: Good location.
