The only thing this hotel can offer are elegant interior decors. Lots of room for improvement. 1. Took me 25 minutes and 3 phone calls to have a bellman help me take my luggage from my room. I'm surprised by this inefficiency. 2. As early as by 830am, I have a maid knocking on the door yelling "house-keeping". Seriously? People are still sleeping! 3. Now this one really kills me. We upgraded the room to be on one of the highest floors. Guess what view we have for paying the extra? Another building's firewall. Seriously? There's no reason for the extra charge if you get the same crappy view, just on a higher floor. 4. Walls are thin, you can definitely hear the hallways and neighbors. Not an entirely horrible stay if you're into interior decor. Otherwise, not much to expect.
