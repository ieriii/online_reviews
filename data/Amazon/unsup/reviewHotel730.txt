Stayed at Westin Michigan Avenue on my recent visit to Chicago. This hotel is decent, but certainly not great. It is conveniently located on Michigan and Delaware. Right in the Magnificent Mile area and across the street from the John Hancock Center. In terms of location the hotel is great. However, I felt that the hotel was a little dated. It is not as nice as other Westin locations I have visited. Our room did not even have the dual shower heads which Westin is known for. I was also a little disappointed in the service. We had arrived late Friday night and they only had one person working the front desk. Being a SPG Gold Preferred Guest I stood in the line designated for such members. However, the employee working the front desk decided to help other guests prior to me. I'm not even complaining about not getting preferential treatment. They walked in after me. We he finally decided to help me, he wasn't every enthusiastic about his job. Once checked in the employee did not even properly direct me to my room. I had to go back and ask where the elevators were. That's not the way to treat a customer, especially a loyal one! My stay wasn't all that bad. I'd say my initial interaction at checkin is the basis for my rating.
