This is the old Cass Hotel...Which is originally why I started staying there on my weekend trips to Chicago. Call me vain :) The staff are always friendly and the rooms are clean. They do a great job with their loungey area and the decor is very mod. It's totally centrally located right off of Michigan and in the heart of all the shopping (If that's important to you). The rooms are teensy-weensy so do not be surprised. The walls are a little thin too as it's a very old building. It always ends up being one of the cheapest stays which has kept me coming back...Even though they ditched my namesake.
