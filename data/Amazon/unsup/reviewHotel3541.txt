We got a great deal through expedia for the Avenue hotel on Huron St. The lobby was sort of cheap looking with rental car office type kiosks to check in. Our check-in process also took a little longer than it should have. However that's where the negativity ends. The lady at the check-in counter was pleasant and gave us a corner one bedroom suite on the 27th floor (which I'm pretty sure wasn't what we had reserved for just $95). The room was great. Leather couch, flat screen TV, i-home and a comfy 'zebra' chair - and that's just the living room area. The bedroom was like any other hotel room except with better decor, a nice view of Michigan ave and the best bed ever. The goose down pillows were heavenly and I think we had the best sleep in years on that bed. It was insanely comfortable and cozy. The bathroom was small but efficient with a nice wide shower head and soft towels. We did not have to call or request anything. Everything was provided. We did not try the sky lounge or their room service so can't comment on that. (I am not one to pay $15 + tax + $3 room service charge + 18% gratuity just so I can eat 2 eggs and toast!) The check out was fast and easy and the concierge kept our bags after we checked out so we could roam the city without dragging a suitcase. A great hotel stay for a great price! Wish I was there in that bed right now...damn!
