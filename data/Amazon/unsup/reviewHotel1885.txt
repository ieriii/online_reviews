I stayed at the city center in December. First the good, big room nice foyer and a bar that's in close proximity to a very cool casual hangout type entrance. The bad, maybe I expect more from my doorman but seriously does anybody here know how to hail a fucking cab ? I mean it's not rocket science and the jw marriott accross the street had a GANG of employees that knew how. The ugly, what the fuck is that smell in the front lobby ? Seriously, every night when we stumbled back to the place it was something wretched this way comes.... Other than that, maybe I expect too much. Regardless, if you are getting a discounted room how can you not give it 3 stars ?
