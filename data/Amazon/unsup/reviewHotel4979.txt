Just completed a big family reunion at this property. We had a luncheon buffet and a dinner buffet, and all of the food was excellent. The pastries are to die for. The new restaurant, which opened about two months ago has a more extensive menu than the prior. The hotel staff was attentive to every need. Rooms are small, and the bathrooms are the smallest I have seen, but when you consider you are right next to a 5 star hotel and you are paying hundreds of dollars less, the Chicago Essex Inn will be my first choice whenever I return to Chicago. All rooms are nicely appointed, and if you can afford the upgrade to the King Suite, you will not be disappointed by the space and the view. We experienced very hot temperatures (100 degrees) on one of the days, and the A/C in the banquet hall facing the east, just could not keep up. Fans were required, which were offered. The lobby is clean and neatly appointed, and I understand it will undergo renovation after the current tourist summer season. A best kept secret is the 4th floor open air garden patio with excellent view up and down Michigan Avenue and the lakefront. The pool and weight room will satisfy almost anybody. Cabs are easy to get, and many tourist buses stop right in front of the hotel.
