We had a great night's stay at this Hyatt! AMAZING bed (actually thinking of calling the hotel to find out what kind it was), very relaxing decor, lovely toiletries (yes, I took the lotion home), Starbucks in the hotel lobby!! They also had a selection of Chicago made ice cream in a freezer there, yum! We were able to walk to the heart of downtown in only about 15 mins, not bad at all! Had a great stay and would definitely stay again for leisure travel!
