worst hotel ever. got bed bugs and when they offered to dry clean my clothes and ship them to my house, they called me and said that i had to give them a credit card number and pay for my own shipping. i've never been more disgusted with "hospitality" in my life. i would never recommend this hotel to anyone and i have made a point tell everyone i know in chicago who has friends coming to visit to never book a room here.
