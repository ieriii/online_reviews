I stayed here for just one night at the end of September. While the Hotel Felix is eco-friendly and somewhat chic, I can't give the spot more than a three-star rating. Here's why: While the service was great and the staff was more than accommodating, the accommodations themselves were less than stellar. I, like Colleen, was assigned an "01" room near the elevator shaft. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Chatter. Chatter. Chatter. With the room itself being a bit larger than a walk-in closet, I made do because, well, there are worse things. But those two 4am bars' across the way? Their patrons screaming all night? No thank you. Maybe it was such that I was perfectly situated on the seventh floor, to get the brunt of the noise, the screams funneled directly into my room via wind and high-rise condos. People yelling and screaming and carousing late into the night = no sleep for this gal. Coffee? There was nada left when I came downstairs, but whatever... you can get coffee at myriad places in Chicago. I just can't, in good faith, give the Felix a better than three-star rating, despite its super nice staff and eco-friendliness.
