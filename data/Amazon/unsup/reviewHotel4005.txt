We bid on a room in priceline so we got a great deal plus this hotel was close to everything we wanted to go to at night so that was perfect. I didn't really expect much because I was happy just to be in Chicago. When we drove into the hotel, it look pretty nice and very big. First thing you notice when you walk inside is the hugh space that have and the restaurant right in middle of everything. We got our room and walked upstaire and it was pretty good w/a nice view of the lakes. Our friends got another room 10 rooms from us so we were pretty close to each other. I am glad we got to stay here. ***the only drawback is the $60 overnight parking but lucky we got the front office to waive that for us. Also our friend didn't have a good nite sleep because of people partying in the room next door but lucky they move room because the noise level was too much for them.
