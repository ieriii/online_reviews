I love this hotel! It is really close to Michigan Avenue, but on a quiet street. The location is excellent, and the staff are welcoming and friendly. The room prices are very reasonable, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. We booked a block of rooms for our wedding, and were so happy with how everything turned out. Our guests loved the location, the rooms, and were very satisfied with the room prices. While it is not new or very modern, the rooms are very nice and I would recommend this hotel.
