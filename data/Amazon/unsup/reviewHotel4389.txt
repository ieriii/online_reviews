Like many http://tripadvisor.com reviewers said, the walls at the Palmer House are paper-thin. I was awakened by my neighbors' coital activity. Not my idea of a morning call. And I stayed in the renovated room. Aren't things suppose to improve with renovations? I'm with Jenelle. While the lobby is gorgeous, I'm not resting my head there. I love gawking at hotels, but ultimately, what rates the hotel is its comfort and location. The Palmer House merits its 3 stars with its comfortable bed, tightly-drawn curtains and location. A short walk to Michigan Avenue, Millenium Park, Art Institute and the Theater District. What more could one ask for, except a little more quiet, unless that wink-wink-nudge-nudge sound system is your kind of thing.
