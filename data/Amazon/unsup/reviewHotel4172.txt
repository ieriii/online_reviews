I had a very good stay at the Hyatt. The room was modern, clean and very comfortable. I had a couple of questions for the staffa and they were all answered pleasantly. The entire hotel is huge featureing restaurants, bars, conference rooms, coffee and gift shops there are staff members everywhere to assist you. This is a very busy hotel as it is very centrally located to the Loop, Navy Pier, Michigan avenue and everything Chicago has to offer. There were only a few problems though. They made an error with our reservation and it took them a very long time to resolve it. They did clear things up. It also took a very long time to get our car from valet when we checked out. Amidst all the small problems the Hyatt more than made up for the minor problems that I encountered.
