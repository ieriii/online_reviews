Supposedly special weekend that I had written to the hotel about before arriving. This hotel failed in so many ways I hope that others will think before booking here. Service - non-existent. 4 of us at the lounge for over 2 hours - nobody ever came to see if we needed anything until we were getting ready to leave. Concierge? Non-existent at the hotel - had to go 4 times before somebody was there for us to ask for a breakfast recommendation (instead - I Yelped and was EXTREMELY pleased). One person at the desk so wait time to check in was long and tedious. All in all - I would not go back here especially since there are nicer and better hotels in the Chicago area. This hotel seems very worn down and in need of an update too. Finally, I don't need to have self-help sayings plastered all over the place!
