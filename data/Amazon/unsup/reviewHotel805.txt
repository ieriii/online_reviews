The worst Westin and hotel experience ever. Staying here ruined our suppose to be wonderful engagement weekend. My fiance had just proposed and had flown me out to Chicago as his job was relocating him. We were suppose to celebrate and check out the area. When we got there, our nonsmoking King room with a view was no longer available. My fiance had called in and put in a special request and they said they would honor it. We ended up in a smoking room, and then we ended up with two full beds. Oh how romantic. Not only that, for the four days we were there, the rooms were rarely made before three pm. We have since stayed at the Westin across from the House of Blues. Those rooms were must bigger, the people were nicer, and the service excellent. The service at this Westin sucked and all the management offered us was a free meal from the room service menu. Yeah!
