Had afternoon tea party at the Palm Court. I thought this place was elegant, however old fashioned. The finger sandwiches and scones were good, but nothing to rave about. I had better afternoon tea sandwiches at a less luxurious place. Tea selection and variety could expand as well. The harpist in the background was a nice touch. Service and ambiance were wonderful. Loved the powder room :)
