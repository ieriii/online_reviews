The aesthetics at PUBLIC are great, but I don't think enough (or anything at all) was done to upgrade the infrastructure of the aging building. The under-window air conditioner/heater was noisy: the fan rattled and the compressor made a distinct rumble that carried through the floor to my head on the pillow. It wasn't bad enough that I think it was broken; I think it was just poorly made. The bed and linens were fantastic, and I slept soundly after I turned off the heater. (Luckily the room remained a comfortable temperature anyway.) I was awoken in the morning, though, by a loud sound that I first thought was static from the TV or iPod dock. It turned out to be just the water rushing through the pipes as my neighbor took a shower. My own shower was just above lukewarm, even with the faucet open to full hot. The walls and floors must be pretty thin, as I heard plenty of coughing and footsteps from above and next door. I would normally cover these sounds with the steady white noise of the fan, but the rattly fan was worse in this case. I loved the design of the place, but the fact that they didn't do more to mitigate the age of the building and the resulting flaws would probably keep me from coming back.
