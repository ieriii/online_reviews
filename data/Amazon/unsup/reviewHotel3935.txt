I, too, was scared to stay in this hotel after reading multiple terrible reviews. My boyfriend and I planned a trip to Chicago because we have such a love for this city. I was worried I was going to have a terrible, scary experience, which may ruin my trip here.  We had read ahead of time about the Congress being a haunted hotel. We did not, however, have a haunting experience. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left everyone in the hotel was super helpful and pleasant. The parking situation was a little crazy, as the parking lot was also a lot for Taste of Chicago. The parking attendant, once finding out I was a hotel guest, put me as a priority in front of all others trying to park.  The room definitely had character. Yes, there's old wallpaper. Yes, the carpet is old, dark red and dingy. Yes, the shower curtain looks old. But, the fact that the wallpaper and shower curtain has the Congress Hotel logo was neat. I felt like I was staying in a piece of history, which is hard to find anymore. The bathroom was clean, the room was clean, I checked for bed bugs and there weren't any. Housekeeping was really fast. We'd leave for breakfast and by the time we came back, our room was clean and ready for us. On top of everything else, the location is excellent! There are tons of places to eat within walking distance, it's close to the L and Grant Park is right across the street.  I hope this review is helpful for anyone reading the horrible reviews. I think it's a hotel everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime. The elevators are old and GORGEOUS! Also, go check out where room 666 is supposed to be. We read the room is sealed. It's not just sealed...it was covered by a wall! If you look on floor 5 and 7, you'll see the difference. Maybe it's just me, but I felt like I was sightseeing right in the place where I was staying...at no extra charge :-)
