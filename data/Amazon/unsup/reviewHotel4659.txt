We stayed at Hotel Felix just three weeks after it opened and we loved it. We ended up paying $110 a nite (stayed for two nites) which was the cheapest we could find in Chicago. The staff was exceptionally friendly. We already knew the area, so not much assistance was needed finding stuff to do. The rooms and entire hotel have a very modern feel (which we like). The beds were AMAZING. The TV was great and everything was spotless. The only real downside was that some of our TV stations weren't coming in very well, but that's not really a big deal. Free breakfast in the morning and contains exactly what you'd think: thawed pastries, coffee, juice, cereal, bagels, etc. We found street parking very easily. We opted to park in the nearby garage overnight, which was about as expensive as the valet would've been. The downsides were (as stated below) that the bar and restaurant weren't yet open, but no big deal. It's a new hotel and is experiencing growing pains as you'd expect. All-in-all, we'd love to stay there again.
