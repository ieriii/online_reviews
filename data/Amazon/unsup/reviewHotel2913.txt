If you enjoy and/or need a firm mattress, this hotel is NOT for you!  The Sheraton has taken the "pillow-top mattress" concept to a whole new level, one which I (fortunately) had never experienced. One which takes effort to crawl out of. One which is nearly impossible to roll over in.  One which I would dare call a "pillow mattress", with no back support whatsoever. Our room had two double beds, which we ended up using because we kept sinking into each other. The linens and duvet were lovely, our room had a great view of the river, service was good, it's an easy walk to Michigan Ave... I would have given it 4 or even 5 stars with a firmer bed.  PS: We Pricelined it day-of for $89. PPS: Overnight valet parking was $48. PPPS: It's offically called the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper(sm) Bed, a "custom designed plush top mattress set", introducing, "a whole new level of comfort". I'm sure there are folks out there who consider it cushy indulgence; I'll let you be the judge.
