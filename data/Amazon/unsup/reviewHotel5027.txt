I stayed in the W Chicago last August and, overall speaking, it was a good experience.I'd recommend to anyone who have enough $ to spend or that can found a good deal.Here are the things I liked and disliked about this hotel. Most of the things in the hotel are great!Liked:- Great swimming pool and very complete and spacious gym- Rooms are very comfy and the bathrooms come with all the things you want to bring home (shampoos, mosturizers etc.)- Staff is very attentive and corteous- Great free DVD selection- Great location - close to Navy Pier and other attractionsDisliked:- Food. I ordered food to eat in the hotel and I was absolutely disenchanted. Food was not only tasteless but it was hard to swollow. Good thing is that hotel reimbursed me for that- Lobby bar. This lobby bar in the top floor is just not like the W hotel lobby bars that you would expect. This one is tasteless and reminds of bars that are almost out of business. I don't expect anyone to like to go there to celebrate anything or even for a drinkBut, all in all, is a worthwhile experience if you plan to come to Chicago for a good time!
