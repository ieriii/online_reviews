I was excited when we booked this Kimpton hotel through Hotwire, especially after having a fun experience earlier this year at Hotel Monaco in Denver. I was expecting more free wine and cheese and hotel full of quirky character. I got all that AND a mirror in front of our bed. "Why is there a mirror on the wall in front of our bed?" He looked at me when I asked that question. He's not complaining; he loved it that there was a mirror in front of our bed. Cheers to Hotel Allegro for keeping it kinky. P.S. Just valet it if you're staying overnight. $44 for self-park vs. $49 for valet. Yup, that's what we get for staying at a hotel in the Loop.
