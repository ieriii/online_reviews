I attended a conference here this summer, and while the conference facilities were fine, having to cross the picket line each day was not. This strike has been going on for YEARS. That is NOT OKAY. Based on what I knew of the strike, I decided to stay at the Hilton down the street. From what I heard, it was the better choice as other people at the conference staying at the Congress reported that their electricity kept going out, and their bathrooms were having issues. Also, some of the girls thought the rooms were haunted and after a night there, decided to stay elsewhere. Yeah, even at the conference rate of $99/night, no thanks!
