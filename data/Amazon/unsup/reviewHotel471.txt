This hotel is lovely. I love the elevator and how you can view it from the outside. Its pretty kewl. The rooms are nice and spacias and the windows are really cute. The complimentary breakfast was tasty and there was a lot of options. We order room service, mainly finger foods, and everything was just right! I didnt hear any sex noises in the middle of the night, which is good! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone planning to stay in downtown Chicago for a few days.
