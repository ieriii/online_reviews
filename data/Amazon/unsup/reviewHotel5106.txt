IF YOU VALUE CUSTOMER SERVICE, DO NOT STAY HERE!! PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING EXPERIENCE WE HAD DURING OUR STAY AT THIS LOCATION.My experience a Marriott hotel was terrible. Our room rate was changed overnight, and the hotel was trying to force us to pay the new rate. In addition, the staff was very disrespectful. The customer service was extremely poor, and the management is terrible. In fact, we were hung up on by a manager when calmly inquiring about the new room rate. This was a terrible trip for us, and I do NOT recommend spending your money at a Marriott Hotel!!! They do not follow their core mission and values.
