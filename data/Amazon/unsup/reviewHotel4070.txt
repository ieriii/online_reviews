I like this hotel. Ive stayed there twice even though i live in the city. But you really have to bargain at the front desk for a good room. The first time i stayed there the room was huge, one wall was all floor to ceiling windows, facing north, with the most breathtaking view. The second time i stayed there, for the nye party the other week, we got stuck in a small room, facing east, with a small window and an "ok" view. They also didnt honor our request for a smoking room, and had a note on the desk saying there would be a $250 cleaning charge for smoking. But, they are decorated very nice, and the staff at the desk is really nice and patient too. wouldnt go back for the nye party though- it was so huge i spent the whole time walking around trying to find people.
