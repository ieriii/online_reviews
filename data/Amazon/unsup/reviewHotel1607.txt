my friend got a great room for a great deal: the view of the chicago river, trump tower is great! the yummy smelling shampoo they give out, the fact that the one bed room is clean and large, the friendly concierge who kindly gave us a menu for late night food delivery and chatted it up with us, and the decor is great! what's not so great: the fact that the fridge appears to be missing, the lack of a flat screen tv, the door to the elevators are full length mirrors that both me and my friend got so confused about that we both ran into them as the elevator door opened for us. my friend got confused cos he thought the elevator was full of mirrors (he was sober). i walked into it cos i was well a bit tipsy shall we say. unnecessary safety hazard! we'll upload a photo later for this. it's great that they offer dry cleaning (obviously for those who pack mainly office attire) but not all of the clientele are travelling on business. put in a laundry machine for the rest of us thanks! they charge $2.50 per pair of socks. ridiculous.
