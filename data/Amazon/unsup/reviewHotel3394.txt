So bf got this hotel on a deal, so price was not an issue, as with nothing is...really. This hotel is located on the mile, which put us in the middle of the action, shopping, and walking distance to just about everything we needed. Heck, with all the hundreds of Starbucks they had, I was within walking distance to two Panera Breads, which was awesome! LOL. We stayed here just this past weekend for my birthday. We stayed from Thursday - Sunday. The hotel is cutesy/boutiquish to me, which isn't bad. It is a very old building with lots of character and charm. The only thing(s) I wouldn't say I did not like, but did not appeal to me, were the room sizes, cost for overnight parking ($50 per overnight stay), paying for the internet, and the cramp elevators and hallways. Now keep in mind that our room was on the 13th floor, so at any time I was waiting on the big-wheel and child to ride down saying "redrum", Ha, ha ha. But those are just things that were not appealing to me. The hotel was clean, housekeeping cleaned and made the bed daily, and the staff was so nice and courteous. I do prefer rooms with microwaves and fridges, which this room did not have.  If you are looking to get the most bang for your buck, I think you should keep looking because for most of the amenities, you have to pay for them here. BF had his Sprint wireless jack, so he did not have to purchase the internet package. It reminded me so much of a cruise, being that everything costs!!! Yes it's downtown Chi-town, but it isn't Vegas, LOL. So I guess that is why the high costs. Would I be back? Naw..I'm sure I can find something else with a bit more. Nevertheless, this was an awesome location and we even walked to the Navy Pier and Lakefront Dr from here.
