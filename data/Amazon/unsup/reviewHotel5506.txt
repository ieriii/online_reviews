Being first-timers in Chicago, we had no idea where to stay. A friend of ours recommended this Best Western. At first, we were like, really? Now we know why... It's located right in Boystown and is walking distance to Wrigley Field, Lincoln Park, the red "L" line and some express buses on Lakeshore Drive. Nice restaurants, bars and shops are in walking distance and its easy to get to other neighborhoods. We got a regular room with a queen-sized bed. It was very comfortable. Lots of nice amenities: flat screen TV, free wi-fi, coffee maker and mini-fridge where you can store your own food. There's a free continental breakfast every morning until 10am. There's a gym on site (although I never used it -- we spent most of our time exploring the city.) On top of it all, the prices were very reasonable. I would stay here again in the future.
