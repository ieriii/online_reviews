I want to steal their pillows. I'm used to staying at more budget-friendly hotels, but when planning my short stay in Chicago, this Hilton was actually cheaper than some of the other hotels downtown, so I jumped on it. I really enjoyed my stay here. I was allowed to check in early when I arrived, which was very much appreciated, as I was a hot ass mess from walking and dragging my suitcase the few blocks from the blue line. I asked about a room with a view, but it was another $25/night, so I passed. My room did not have the infamous (?) two bathroom setup, but my one bathroom was just fine. My water pressure was great, even up on the 19th floor, and my fixtures weren't tarnished and looked really nice, unlike what some of the other reviewers experienced. The bed was super comfortable, and I loved how white and crisp the sheets and duvet were. And their pillows - oh my God, I wanted to steal them all, they felt like clouds under my head. The location of the hotel was nice, just a few blocks away from the Harrision red line stop, so it is super convenient to get to/from places pretty quickly. What I really liked was the check out process. Maybe other hotels have this, but I've never experienced it. Not only did I not have to wait in line to check out, like the mass of people that were doing so when I left on Sunday morning, but I was able to print out my boarding pass for free! All I had to do was check out through my TV, then send my boarding pass to their print station in the lobby. Genius, and pain free. When the mood hits me to get back up to Chicago, I will definitely be checking out the Hilton again.
