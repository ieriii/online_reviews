I have always loved the W hotels, but this one was.. decent but not the most amazing W hotel I have stayed at. The reason I say this is because the rooms are really way to small - at least the Cozy rooms were. The room itself was also slightly old. You can tell from the walls and doors even though the decor in the rooms was modern. The bathroom was also way too small. There really was no space to move at all and this was the same with the spacing between the desk and the bed. It was very difficult to even slide the desk chair out. Another thing that bothered me during the stay was the fact the walls are paper thin. The room next to mine was definitely throwing a party and unfortunately, I could hear the television and the screaming pretty clearly. While the rooms themselves were cramped and older, the overall hotel decor was magnificent. The lobby was beautiful along with the second floor of the hotel - it'd be a great place to throw a party or event. I just wished that the spaciousness of the public areas applied to the guest rooms. The hotel service was pretty good though. I ordered late night room service and even though the kitchen messed up the order, they immediately sent up a different late night entree (on the house) and said that I can order whatever I like for breakfast the next day free of charge. My boyfriend and I definitely took advantage of that one and W Hotel did not say a word about it. Internet was also complimentary during our stay so that was definitely a plus. On another positive note, the location of the hotel couldn't be better so it was definitely very convenient to get around.
