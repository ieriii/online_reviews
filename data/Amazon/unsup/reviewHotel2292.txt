Oh Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... I love your 300 thread count Signature linens that gave me a restful and comfy sleep. And your towels that didn't smell funky. I love your adoption of Mayor Daley's green initiative by housing 200,000 honey bees on your rooftop to produce honey for the hotel and sell to hotel guests. I love your registration clerk Melissa who gave us a fabulous room on the 39th floor that provided an amazing view of the lake. I love your house made potato chips cooked fresh daily. I REALLY love your homemade pickles that have a banana pepper zip to them. I love your close proximity to everything Chicago! No rental of a car needed. We walked everywhere. Front entrance is on Rush. Back entrance is smack dab on Michigan Avenue. Close to the river. Within walking distance to Navy Pier and Millennium Park. I love your lobby bar and the loungey, comfy furniture where we would partake of a nightcap after a day of sightseeing before we hit the hay. Yea, internet is extra and the rooms lack fridges, but you know what? This is a big city. They want you out and about enjoying the sights and sounds; not holed up in your room being a hermit. That's why I love the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile!
