We found Avenue hotel on a bargain hotel website for a spur-of-the moment trip to Chicago. We found it to be within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile and a very good rate, so we decided to go for it. Normally we can't afford a decent hotel within the city, but I guess we got lucky. When we arrived at the Avenue hotel we loved the sophisticated but not stuffy decor and we were warmly greeted with a smile and a warm welcome from the doorman, who quickly assisted us with our luggage. Our room was very clean and well-kept. My husband thought it was a bit small, but in the city, that's to be expected. I found it to be comfortable and pleasant. I was excited to try the bed since it seemed that is what every other review mentioned and we were not disappointed at all! The best darn night of sleep ever. When staying at the Avenue Hotel you are in walking distance of some really great restaurants and shopping, no need to have a car while staying here. The hotel overall was very impressive, especially for the bargain we got it for. All in all, I would definitely stay at the Avenue Hotel when visiting Chicago, bargain or no bargain
