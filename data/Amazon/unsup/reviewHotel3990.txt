Writing this review after a sleepless night so I'm a bit cranky. Bed was one of the more comfy ones, but the ac was excessively loud and the room dry, city traffic and neighbors noisier than what I've experienced in Manhattan even though we are on the 27th floor (thin windows and walls), and the toilet makes a loud squeaking noise each time it's flushed. As for the rest of my stay, pros were the views, the location, and the service. Other cons were - the hotel common areas were freezing in the middle of summer and the hotel pub stopped serving food and drinks before midnight. May come back if there is a great deal, but need to be armed with ear plugs, sweaters, and sleeping pills.
