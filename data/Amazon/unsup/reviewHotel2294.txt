Well if you looking for clean motel with a nice lobby bar then this is your place, but you might have got that for a lot cheaper at a Motel 6. Look here is the story if you are any type of a business person don't expect to have WiFi in your room only in the lobby. Come on folks it is 2011, which resulted in me trying to use my Verizon Cell phone hot spot which was also horrible. Let see if that fails maybe I can watch a little TV, woops again no HD TV signel, no menu on the remote this can't be it is 2011. So if you want and expensive place to stay with no electronic abilities then this is your place.
