This is a 5 star hotel and lounge, They can have the other 3 stars back when they get rid of the rapper crowd with dead looser T-shirts on, Have been coming here for 5+ years, Always have a great time, However, The last 2 times have forced us to go somewhere via cab so we don't get shot or stabbed by overzeleous rappers looking for fat white chics with low self esteem, Excalibur is on Dearborn holmes. Dear Westin folks, We feel your pain but please fix this problem.\ *UPDATE* stayed here back in April 2008, A complete turn around, the W is great again. thanks, Westin
