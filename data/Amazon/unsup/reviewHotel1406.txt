Pros: Great location (50 feet from Michigan Avenue) Reasonable price (after using several web sites) Nice modern comfortable room Reasonably quiet Front desk and attendants were helpful and for the most part polite Good concierge advice (Giordano's and Gino's deep dish pizza are both within walking distance) If you love shopping: great shopping is blocks away. Cons: Internet was $10 per day One day we needed to use the internet from the "office". That was $20 per hour. If you have a car, parking is over $50 per day. There is much cheaper parking a few blocks away. This deserved 3 1/2 stars. What made me go with three stars was the memory of the day I had to use the internet downstairs and I ended up paying $20+ for the hour I used it. My next hotel had free internet in the lobby.
