If you want a nice time warp feeling and to feel as if you were a high roller in the 50s, then head to the Palmer House. This sprawling huge monstrosity of a hotel has housed many many important people...and unfortunately many many cigarettes.  The rooms do have a reminiscent smell of "old" which can either be charming or disgusting, depending on your frame of mind. Bathrooms are small and relatively basic, but the ambiance of the Palmer House is really what you stay there for, not the modern amenities.
