This place was great! I was drawn to it because of the historic building, and I loved all the design touches. The rooms are lovely and the hallways still look like old office buildings. Our window had a great view. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and unpretentious. The location was very convenient, we were able to walk around the Loop and we very close to parks. The bed was comfortable and the room was nice and quiet. I recommend it and plan to stay there again.
