Usually I am an easy going dude, but I have to vent about this hotel because I still have gripes about it days after checking out. 1. The rooms have decor for OLD people. I always joke about this hotel chain and say its great for old people. 2. The beds were the most uncomfortable beds I have ever slept on, period. LIke sleeping on the floor seemed like a better option at one point when I tossed and turned. 3. The internet was not good. I need a stable connection to do my work, and the wireless only option kind of sucked.
