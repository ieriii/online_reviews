While the lobby was gorgeous our room was a TOTAL disappointment. We were excited based on the photos on the website, but our room had clearly not been remodeled. The bedding was old, the carpet was old, the wall paper was peeling off the walls & our bathroom reeked of mildew. Not sure how we got stuck in the gross room, but we did. We could have had a better quality room at a holiday inn.
