Beautiful hotel with fantastic rooms. However, the TV didn't work the entire three days we were there. Air conditioning was also very flakey (coming in and out for no reason) on the hottest weekend of the year. The morning of check-out, two separate people came to the room before 10 am to ask what time we would be checking out (not to mention the maid coming twice to see if we were out of the room). After telling the two different people that we would be out of the room by 1pm, the manager then called *again to make sure we would be checking out. After paying full price for two nights at the hotel, plus drinks at the bar, plus dinner at the restaurant, we thought we'd earned the right to enjoy our last few hours in the room. Instead, we felt hurried out. When I expressed this to Emilia, the director of the front office, she responded that she was sorry, and had expressed our frustration with her colleagues. No offer for a discount on future stays with them, or even to take the $15 minibar charge off our bill. In a city with a lot of other hotel options, you'd think they'd take every opportunity to build customer loyalty. They definitely fell short, here.
