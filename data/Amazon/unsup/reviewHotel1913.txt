I thought I was going to the W on Lakeshore, I was wrong but was pleasantly surprised. Spent my birthday nite there with some girlfriends. All I can say is top-notch customer service. Walked in and was given the mini-tour of the living room and bar area, nice. The hotel was very sleek. I told the front desk it was my birthday and they sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and the best chocolate torte I have ever had. Yummmmm I chose the special rate which includes parking (normally $51 per night) and two free drinks at the bar. It was well worth it.  They also have a complimentary Acura car service which I took full advantage of.  What better way to spend my birthday day than free champagne and pulling up to the restaurant to meet my friends looking and feeling like a million bucks! Thanks W !
