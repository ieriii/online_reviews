Wife and I were taking a "bucket list" train tour of the US and had just arrived from the West Coast on the Empire Builder. It was late, we were tired and didn't know what to expect for our $79 Priceline room. A King was not available, so we were upgraded to a suite that I am sure was nearly 1000 square ft. if not larger. The notice on the door said the room rented for $1000 (or that could be charged for it). It was on the upper floors and had a spectacular view of the Chicago River and the Wrigley Building across the river. I had a minor problem at the front desk inquiring about my "Gold Passport" and the manager upgraded me to Platinum status allowing us access to free breakfast and evening cocktails. I couldn't have been more pleased with the nice lady who checked us in and the hotel manager who more than resolved a minor problem with four days of free cocktails! We spend four wonderful days there before continuing our "bucket list" train trip. I am not easily impressed, but our treatment here was nothing short of spectacular. Everyone from the Bell captain, front desk to my infrequent visits to the bars, was exceptional. I had no idea the hotel was "upgraded" or "remodeled." It looked, to this traveler, like a brand new facility. A side note: Our room had two full couches a conference table with 6 chairs and a full business desk. I asked the front desk what the room was called for my review. She said the room wasn't "officially" listed, but could be requested. It had several floor to ceiling picture windows and could function as an office as well as a hotel room.
