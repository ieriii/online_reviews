I walked in to the Westin expecting the Westins I saw as a kid that were not hip one iota. Starwood moved some of the W style over this a way. Slick lobby with a nice straight modern Eames-esque woodgrain look. The beds are clearly a big draw as well as a double showerhead that has so much pressure your body may well have some red spots for a few hours if you stay in one place for a minute. Of course, the location is great for a visitor with all the Mich Ave stuff. Let's just say H&M saved my ass when I forgot my tie for a job interview.
