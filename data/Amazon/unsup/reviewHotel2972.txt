They try to be top of the line, but fail miserably. Pros: - They now have Wifi. It's fast enough, but only because I didn't have to pay for it. - Good complimentary breakfast/evening snacks, but only for certain members. I got lucky because my boss booked the hotel, and he travels a lot, so I got these perks as well. - Clean gym, with sauna, and a pool. No hot tub though. - Nice lobby, with those screens you can play games - Free water bottle in your room every day - Comfortable pillows -Coffee maker in the room Cons: - Internet is $12.95 every 24 hours. -The room does not feel clean. From the smell, to the look and feel of the carpet, to the stains on the ironing board. - The TV is pretty small, with unimpressive quality. - They charge for the gym. $12/day, or $20 for the stay. Not worth it. Oh, the best part? They don't really tell you that you have to pay for it, until you're there. A guy will walk up to you and ask you to sign in and then either pay cash or charge it to your room. Good, albeit dirty business ploy because when you're already at the gym, chances stay and finish your workout. - The shampoo sucks; it makes your hair feel like you just washed it with rubber cement. - The showers can't handle any amount of hair. I get it, I have a lot of hair, and it falls out when I wash it, but give me the option to clean out the hair instead of just forcing me to stand ankle deep in shower water. I would not stay here again if I had the choice.
