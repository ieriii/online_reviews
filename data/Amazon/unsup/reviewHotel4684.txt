Named our price on priceline not knowing what we were going to get and we ended up with a nice hotel. The only reason i am giving 3 stars is because the rooms are so small. The hotel was clean and smelled great but the room was tiny not even a dresser. I had stayed the earlier part of the week at the Swissotel and with the size of the rooms and the views there it is hard to compare the two. The staff was very friendly and the bed was very comfortable. I did like the free wifi and free parking for hybrids which is a big plus in a town where parking is close to $50 a night.
