I was so surprised to see all the negative reviews of this place because I loved my recent weekend stay here. Yes - W hotels are awfully pretentious sometimes and honestly, it's not the type of hotel that I normally stay at. But I had some starpoints and it was a weekend mini-vacation in Chicago so I decided to try something out of the norm. I got upgraded to a suite on the 30th floor and the view was AMAZING. I personally loved our room...everything from the half bath by the entrance to the decor and even the window in the bathroom (but yes agreed with other reviewers - if I wasn't traveling alone or with family, it might be slightly weird). The service was decent - not bad, but also nothing extraordinarily amazing. I never got a chance to take advantage of their Acura service where they drive you anywhere within a 5 mile radius, but it seems like a great way to get around, especially since this hotel is not particularly close to anything. Quick walk to Navy Pier, but you're going to have to walk a few blocks before you get to anything of substance (Magnificent Mile, public transportation, etc) - that was my only complaint. Overall though, awesome weekend here. I would definitely recommend this W location over the City Center location.
