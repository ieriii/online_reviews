It's 2:00 a.m. and instead of sleeping I am writing this review because it is so loud in our room. We are staying on the 25th floor which had great views but they neglected to tell us that there is a club on the 26th floor that plays house music until 2:30. I called the front desk and all they did was apologize for the noise and then they hung up. For the amount of money we spent for our room I would expect more. We definitely won't be back
