Stayed here for a weekend . Very convenient location.  I had minimal interaction with the staff, but the check in was quick and easy. Really nice boutique hotel. The rooms are great. Very clean, modern decor. Several convenient parking options in the area. The hotel offers free parking if you drive a hybrid car- which is a huge bonus if you qualify because parking anywhere in the city will cost you an arm and a leg.
