It's nothing fancy. But it's a place to hang your hat while you're in Chicago. It has free parking, which is huge for out-of-town guests ... especially in this neighborhood (VERY touristy). The rooms are pretty small, but I've found that for my unassuming family, they don't need The Drake or The Peninsula to make them feel good about themselves. They'd rather spend the money they save & spend it on their darling daughter (hi ... that's me). Also, yeah, Pizzeria Ora is a heavenly alternative to the big ticket Chicago-style pizza places nearby & it's IN THE BUILDING. No wait, equally as good 'za, & have I mentioned it's IN THE BUILDING? Which, if anyone who has every survived a Chicago blizzard knows is HUGE. Plus, I believe that when you stay there, you get free drink tickets to the bar. Score!
