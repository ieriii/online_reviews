Great location. SUPER comfy beds. It's the Heavenly Bed! Might even be better than my own... and I say this b/c I actually MISSED being in bed at the Westin Chicago River North last night, which was the first night sleeping in my own... unless I can score me my own Heavenly Bed... *searching Google.com*
