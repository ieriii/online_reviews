I like the big wide open spaces of the hotel lobby that fill with natural light from the transparent glass ceiling. It really is good for socializing. There is plenty of convention space underneath and in the other tower as well and it is easy to get around. The staff is courteous and efficient. The gym is small but OK for a hotel gym. They have a lot of tread mills and some dumb bells and machines. The location is pretty great too. I think this is just where you want to be in downtown. Right next to but not on Michigan with a great view of the river (if you book the river/lake view tower) make this prime real estate for a hotel stay in downtown. You can walk or take short cab ride to anywhere from here in the Loop/downtown area. If you want to grab the L or a bus to take you uptown the stop for the bus is about two blocks away and the stop for the L is about five or six blocks. This is a great place for a convention.
