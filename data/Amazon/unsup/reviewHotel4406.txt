Ah the Palmer House. Old world craftsmanship my friend. They dont make them like this anymore. Amazing lobby. Great rooms on the 13th floor. Some are ridiculously huge. Bars and the restaurant are servicable but I still love this place. I find myself in rotation between here the James and the Conrad when I hit the big city. Always happy to go back to the House...
