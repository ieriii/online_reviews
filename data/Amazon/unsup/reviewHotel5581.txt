I love SPGs. This hotel has a great location - within minutes walk to the subway. The lobby is grand and has a clean modern feel. I asked for a complimentary upgrade at check-in and got placed on the executive floor which means access to the lounge! SWEET!  The room was comfortable, clean, and more spacious as I had imagined. There was an iPad for which I could request items from housekeeping rather than calling the front desk. Complimentary items that I could request included the norm - toothpaste/toothbrush, but also deoderant, contact lens solution and feminine products?! COOL. Only feature missing (or maybe I didn't find it) was the option to check out on the iPad. Downside, no free in-room WiFi but they do have it in the lobby. Best part? I PriceLine'd this hotel for $100/night.
