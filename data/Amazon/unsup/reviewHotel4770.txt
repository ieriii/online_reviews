I'm not experienced with hotels in Chicago so maybe its normal to spend $244 a night for a hotel and have to stay in a room big enough for a king bed and thats all. There was a dresser with a tv but the bed was so close to the dresser that I could not open the drawers. Internet you have to pay for (about $8 an hour). No fridge, or any other furniture in the room. There was no coffee maker (because they want you to buy the crappy expensive coffee at the starbucks downstairs). I can deal with a small room but I like to have my coffee first thing and I hate starbucks. I've stayed at Comfort Inns that were better than this. I guess what you pay for is the fancy bar and restaurant and lobby. I would never stay here again. Also the security deposit is about $51 a night and parking is $38 (self park) or $61 (valet) a night.
