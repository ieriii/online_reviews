Mark P. hit it on the head, you should be able to give different stars to different parts of this place. Quick backround: went there for a bachelor party with 4 other guys, reserved the extreme suite at $800.00/night. When we got there we were all dressed nice as we were about to go out and reak havoc on the town. The guy checking us in asked if there was a special occasion and we told him our friend was getting married. He doesn't even let us finish before he starts lecturing us about how they have a strict no party policy and they wont hesitate to call the police if we get too loud or out of line (mind you we are all 27-30 years old, dressed nice and just booked an $800 a night suite at the Fucking Hard Rock Hotel.) So we went up to the room and it was very nice size, but the couch had all sort of love stains on it and half the stuff they said came with the suite (fridge, guitar with amp) wasn't there. We still had fun and checked out the next day, letting the same dude that checked us in know that we didnt party as he gave us this shitty kind of grin. They have a bar downstairs that was pretty good, but the restaurant they have there, China Grill, was overpriced and not that great...It was also my first time to Chicago and I was eating bomb ass deep dish pizza so that might have had something to do with it. All and all three stars in fair, might check out the W the next time I go to compare.
