Spent the night last night as an end of spring break getaway with my husband. Overall, we really enjoyed it. Pros Great rooms- comfy beds and the bathrooms are very nicely appointed Location on LSD is very convenient Cons Neighbors were crazy noisy, not good sound insulation Pool was way overcrowded I'd go back if the price was right.
