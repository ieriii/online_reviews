This review is on their New Years Eve party, put on by Scene Chicago. Had a great time with the group we went with. Plenty of food at the buffet tables, along with people coming around with trays. The drinks were excellent and strong, with not so bad lines. Maybe about a 5 min wait. Tops. They had 4 rooms with a range of music from hip hop to 80s. 2 of the rooms being large, 2 being not much more than a lounge type of area. My biggest complaint was the bathrooms. The lines were horrendous! About 20-25 min wait, only to find out there was no toilet paper. Really? I send almost two hundred a ticket (not including the dinner) and you can't supply me with some soft TP for my bum? What made me mad, was that I was standing in line from 1230am to 1255am and when I went up to the bar, they had already stopped serving booze. (Even though it was supposed to go until 1am). The crowd was a twenty something and was a great time. Until around 1am. Two girls puking in the bathroom (hold your liquor ladies!) and one guy laying on the floor with a black eye (as the cops were trying to pull him up and take him out). Oh! And they also came around about 1145pm with TONS of NYE flair. Hats, noise makers, streamers, etc. Even though people were going nuts with it all, there was plenty to go around. I must say that they have great staff there. All in all: Fun, but not worth the $$.
