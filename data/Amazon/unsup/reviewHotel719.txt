I've stayed here two times. First time I would give them a 5 star rating. Second time I would give them a 1 star rating. So I guess that averages out to 3???  I won't go into too many details about either trip. Just know that the first time we went we were treated very well and made to feel welcomed. The second time our needs were ignored and we didn't feel that warm feeling we did the first trip.  I've stayed at many Westins and I can say this place is inconsistant at best. Good luck.
