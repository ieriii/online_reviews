I bought this deal on Hotwire for $68 plus taxes. A great deal for what I got. But as you can see I didn't pay a lot and didn't get a lot. So with that said, I was pleased for a quick business trip. Located reasonably to where I needed to be and comfortable rooms. I was a bit taken aback bit how SMALL the rooms were. I'm glad that is was only ME in the room. I did like the free WiFi and TV was very close to face...did I mention that the rooms were small? All-n-all, I'd actually stay here again...
