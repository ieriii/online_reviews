This W was very nice. Right on LSD, a couple blocks from the Mag Mile, and we got a 14th floor view of the lake and Navy Pier. The rooms seemed pretty clean and I liked the cute little shutters you can open between the bathroom and the rest of the room. Also loved the full length mirror they provided and the robes. Staff was super helpful and I used the concierge multiple times. Definitely talk to them and get coupons and passes to things before you go anywhere. Breakfast was pretty good, but pricey if you don't have a breakfast coupon.
