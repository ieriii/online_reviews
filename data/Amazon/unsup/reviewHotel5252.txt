Coming from Springfield on a last minute business trip, I was forced to stay at a hotel for the night. Oh did I make a mistake by picking this place. I took the cheap route and they had free parking (hence the ONE star) so it seemed like a good deal. Coming in in the early morning on February the 29th, the front desk girls were super rude and seemed like they knew nothing. Two girls, a tall one and a short one. Boy they didn't help.The water was FREEZING in the morning. I called the front desk and the same rude girl answered. NO HELP. The water took forever to get even lukewarm! Outrageous. The room was super dingy and small (I guess for the price).And what really made this worse is that the hotel staff didn't even make me feel welcomed. My partners and I will never stay here again.
