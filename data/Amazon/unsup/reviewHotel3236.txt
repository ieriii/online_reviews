Thanks for the yuks, Hard Rock Hotel. My stay here was perfectly amenable, and, come to think of it, pretty much what I expected. I've been juggling my hotel choices a little upon my trips to your town, and thought I'd give the Hard Rock a whirl. The verdict? About par for the course for a mainstream downtown Chicago stopover: clean, comfy room, plenty of space, free wi-fi (which I gushed over..seriously, hotel people, sometimes it's really easy to make geeks happy), and a doorway to the Michigan Avenue whatnot that keeps those of us still learning our way around from seeming completely lost. Things I wasn't as crazy about included the fact that the shower door doesn't close (it looks cool but inevitably you end up with a floor half full of water), and actually, that's not quite true. There's no shower door at all, just a pane of glass and an opening. I tried the downstairs bar, which was fine and appeared to be full of good company, but a little on the small side.  Bottom line, the Hard Rock Hotel tows the line you think they would: staffers occasionally referencing you as "my man," bellmen with the emo mustache, and space with all of the requisite memorabilia you might expect. And my stay there was pleasant, definitely. But I wouldn't shine a spot light on it and call it fifteen minutes of fame, either.
