I had a freebie night to use up at a Hyatt location that expired at the end of February. So I booked the Hyatt Chicago and also requested some upgrades. I got the upgrades, which were the Regency Club and an Executive Suite. The suite was very nice (2 plasma TV's and a nice sofa and chairs). The roll-away bed was delivered promptly. The suite was very clean and nicely decorated. Checkin was very smooth. The Regency Club was a really great deal. For $20, we got a continental breakfast, appetizers during the afternoon, all the espresso I could drink and pop that the boys could drink. It was well worth it. I'll be coming back.
