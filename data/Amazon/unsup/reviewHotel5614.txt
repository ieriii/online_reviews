The RESTAURANT & LOUNGE at the Westin The lounge area of the Westin has a refreshing combination of sophistication yet informalness. You can sit in the lounge and order cocktails from the bar or food from either the main restaurant or the sushi bar. This is perfect if you are in a group that can't decide what they want to eat. The Pamatini martini is excellent. Their banana "cheesecake" dessert is not a cheesecake at all and is excellent. I have enjoyed all their food. I definitely recommend their lounge for an after-work hangout or weekend dinner.
