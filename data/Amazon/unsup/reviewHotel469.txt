I came here with a group of girls for a bachelorette party. We met up at the Embassy Suites and hung out here for a while until everyone was ready to head out to the club. The suite was nice and spacious. I really liked how there is a covered area for cabs to drop you off and pick you up. My only complaint about the hotel was that the bathroom in the bar area was closed for renovation which was a pretty big inconvenience. Also, the smokers in the group were not very happy that they had to go down two sets of elevators to get outside for a cigarette.
