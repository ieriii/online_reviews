Location, location, location! My cousin and I recently stayed here for 3 nights on a weekend getaway trip. Because of the popular location we didn't need to rent a car. It was adjacent to The Shops at North Bridge, public transportation (bus/subway), taxi stands, restaurants, and pretty much anything you could possibly need. The lobby was always full of people since there is a bar and a Starbucks. After the first two nights we switched from a fairly small, yet comfortable and clean room to a bigger hospitality suite. It was basically a standard room with an adjacent living room (bonus Murphy bed we didn't use), a small kitchenette and two flat screens. Both of our rooms had spectacular views of the lake from the 44th floor. Being the needy gals we are, Concierge, the Elite desk and the front desk staff always took fantastic care of us, providing disposable razors, extra rooms keys, shuttle to O'Hare, etc. And the turn down service was a nice perk. Thanks for the chocolates.
