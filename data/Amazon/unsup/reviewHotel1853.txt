This place is really refined & has some great finishing touches. Expect a sleek modern design in the bedrooms but you can forget about open space. The room is like a typical nyc bedroom & I got a view of a parking garage!! Took a 2 hour trip plus 30 minute train ride to feel right at home......But the amenities were better than expected nice flat screen TV, nice layout for the bathroom. What was useful though was the refrigerator, we took out all the expensive water, beer, & chocolates they would have overcharged us for & made it our own getaway fridge. On weekends they have a bar/lounge which provided some entertainment & interesting characters. Location is great though the red, blue, & all those other trains line were right around the corner. Oh & if your famished a McDonald's next door son!!!!
