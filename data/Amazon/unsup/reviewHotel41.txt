For the love of God, whatever you do, DO NOT take room 307. Suffice it to say that I would rather set my hair on fire than spend two minutes in that room. Shudder! After asking for another room, was pleased with what I got. The decor is a bit "Quacker Factory-ish" ala dried floral wreath, plaid pillow shams, etc. but overall, the room was clean, the bed comfy and the housekeeper..the nicest person I have ever met in a hotel!! The hotel is a bit older but you cannot beat the location. Enjoy the room for what it is, a place to sleep whilst in Chicago. Enjoy!
