Note: I did not stay here so I really can't a experiential review. However, I can only review the architecture, ambiance, design of the space.  I went in and looked around and took a few photos and was just overwhelmed with the exceptional overall all ambiance of the place. From the looks alone, it is a 5** palace:  a pretty palace and very upscale for sure. . From what I saw, of the open tea room dining area (just looking at the place settings for tea service was an art form in itself), wow, lots of gold leaf style culinary accessories, fabulous bathrooms, I could have stayed in the woman's bathroom at least 1/2 the day relaxing, and fabulously adorned lobby . . .wow, if I had 5 star money, this would be a great place to treat one's self.
