Chicago trip tip!!! Book your hotel on priceline negotiator! We once got the Palmer House Hilton for 70 bucks a night!  If you are lucky, you'll land there or at the Chicago Hilton. Great place to stay for a short trip to Chicago. It is positioned right next to the park and art museum. Within reasonable walking distance of most of the major downtown attractions. I recommend taking a cab or the bus up to the top of the mile and walking it down, then grab a quick cab back and its worth the expense. Especially if you go when Chicago is cold.... which is practically always!  The rooms are what you need them to be. They are comfy, modern, and clean. Spoil yourself and go downstairs for the breakfast buffet. Just have them charge it to the room so you don't feel so guilty about it.  Flat screen tv in the room, ours was prob a 40 inch, maybe 45. PC screen has free applications to cater to tourist needs and give you ideas if you run out of things to do.  BE ADVISED! If you are taking a trip to Chicago... You will pay out the nose for parking so plan it into your budget(again, use priceline to save money so you can spend it on parking!)! Expect 45 bucks or so a day to park at any hotel in downtown. If you can afford it no problem. If you can't... maybe look into parking at a commuter lot and taking the train into the city.
