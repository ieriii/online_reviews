What can I say... I LOVE this place!! I booked a vacation through Orbitz and this was the hotel that came with the package I chose. The location is perfect (close to everything you need... restaurants, shopping, theaters) and soooo cute!! Beautiful lobby with free "wine hour" every night from 5-6pm (you can't beat that!!) Our room was a little on the small side, but for two people (and the price) it was a DEAL!! The staff was so friendly and helpful too!! The concierge became my best friend that weekend!! I loved this city (and this hotel) so much I will definately be back SOON!!!
