I would very highly recommend weddings at Hotel 71. Rebecca will handle everything. We had an unbelievable amount of people tell us it was the best wedding food they'd ever had. The views are amazing. The room is smaller so it has a less capacity than most places but if you're having a wedding of 100 people or so, it is the best venue in the city. I could not be happier with how our wedding turned out and the service was wonderful.
