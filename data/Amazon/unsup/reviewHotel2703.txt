I stayed at The James Hotel on business in April. I'm not a fan of the modern IKEA look but was pleasantly surprised but the hotel and it's staff. Everyone there goes above and beyond to accommodate you. They are super friendly which to me is important. There is a restaurant and lounge on the first floor with excellent food. I was there about a week and ate there twice and both times we had wonderful service and food. One night we hung out in the lounge and also received great service. The rooms are very clean and the mini bar is by far the best mini bar I've ever seen in a hotel if you are a drinker. These weren't your sample bottles of booze. They also have Kheils soaps which I love and they give you new ones everyday. Turn down service was wonderful it was nice to come back to your room to music playing and soft lighting to help you start to relax. The beds were super comfy.  I would definitely pick The James as my first choice for hotels in Chicago. It is worth every penny!
