Walked into the lobby and the first thing I thought was, "Wow, this is LUXURIOUS." This place was way more elegant than I expected. Nevertheless, it was a great place to stay. Our room was huge with plenty of floor space and had two bathrooms...sweet!  Location was GREAT! The hotel was within walking distance from Millennium Park, which was exactly what we were looking for. The hotel staff was very friendly, accommodating, and helpful.  Downside: Overnight parking was a b*. The hotel charged some ridiculous amount for valet, so instead we circled the area to find a nearby lot.
