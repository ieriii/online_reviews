First off, I didn't book this place -- work booked it for me. Such a bad experience I don't even want to waste the energy to write about it. Workers have been on strike here for ages. Not sure if that's the reason, but the rooms were not in great condition. (They were reasonably clean, though.) The iron in my room leaked badly. When I called the front desk to ask for a new one, the woman wasn't very friendly. I politely explained that I had to leave for a meeting in a few minutes, but still no iron after 30 minutes. Good thing I didn't really have a meeting, just an educational session I was okay with missing. The lines in the lobby were always bad. We tried to save time on checkout by using the machine, but it didn't work (not even a little).
