This really feels like an old-time big city hotel. Its grand in many ways, and the location can't be beat. Right on Michigan Ave, its a short cab ride or a long-ish walk to the shops in one one direction and Soldier Field in the other. If you're visiting in the summer, the park is literally across the street, and the view of the lake is perfect.  The lobby is very impressive, as you would expect from these grand old hotels, and if you get a chance, peek into the ballrooms and look up. Really impressive - there are a lot of elements you will find throughout the property that has the charm you won't find at the more modern Hyatt convention/hotel places. Of course the tradeoff is that rooms may be a bit smaller and the fixings are a bit dated. I had a corner room which provided great views through multiple windows, but I sense that it could be a little drafty on cold, windy winter days. Overall though, very cozy and comfortable. I'd recommend this hotel for out of town visitors, especially those with kids because there's room to run around in the lobby floors, and great access to the park and lake.
