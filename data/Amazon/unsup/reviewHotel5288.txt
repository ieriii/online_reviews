My friend and I came to Chicago for a day to go to a concert and needed someplace reasonably priced to stay. We had read mixed reviews and decided to take a chance on this hotel, because the more recent reviews were actually pretty decent. We should have found someplace a little bit pricier to stay. It. Was. Terrible. I have to admit the location is spectacular and the staff seemed friendly when we first got there. They explained that because of the above average temperatures the air conditioner wasn't working, and it was going to be a little warm in our room. So we think, okay, maybe it'll be like 70-ish in the room as opposed to you know, comfortable temperatures. WRONG. WRONG. WRONG. They threw us on the very top floor, and it was 90 DEGREES OR HIGHER THE ENTIRE TIME. It was ridiculous. They explained to us that if it was too hot in the room, we could go downstairs and get a room change. So we went downstairs to ask. You know what happened? NOTHING. We were stuck in that about 90 degrees room. It was like if we were in a humid desert in there. They wouldn't even give us a FAN or something to at least cool the room off a little bit. Not even the least bit accommodating. It was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I have asthma, so the sweltering and humid heat didn't do me any good at all. What would have happened if I had an asthma attack and asked for a refund? Probably nothing, because they didn't seem all that accommodating after they explained to us that the air wasn't working properly. It was like they were saying "Yeah, we warned you, too bad, you are stuck here!". I mean it was so hot that if I got a total of like an hour and a half of sleep probably. Same goes for my friend. Overall I wouldn't go back there at all. Other than the location and a reasonable place to lay down your head, I wouldn't go back there.
