Rooms are super small and the service is eh... I've stayed at quite a few hotels and this one got me irked enough to jump on Yelp for a review. (1) I called before my flight to put my wife on the reservation since I was coming in 4 hours after her. They assured me this was done even after I asked them how they would do it since they didn't ask for her name. They take the name but I am skeptical. I land in Chicago and sure enough, my wife has been wandering around in 30* weather like a hobo in California clothing. They apologize but that's about it. (2) The guy at the desk was a smart ass. He asks for my ID, I give it to him. He then asks if I go by an alias, I tell him I use my nickname (DJ R***) often (my name is D*** R*** Jr). He finally says, OK, why are you using a different name? I'm a nice guy and will accept it, but most hotels will not. Really? I've been traveling frequently for the better part of 10 years and have never had a problem. (3) I get to the room and damn near hit the bed with the door... THE ROOM IS THAT SMALL. Heel to toe (size 13 show) 4 steps to the door from the bed and 1.5 steps from the wall to the bed on the other side. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Yeh, they put a desk but it's so close to the foot of the bed that it's more intrusive than useful. There is a dresser and TV but it's tucked in a corner rendering the TV unwatchable. (3) The bathroom is tiny and using the toilet necessarily puts you into the wall. When I got here, I immediately started looking at other hotels (like the Wit where I stayed a couple months ago) but was talked down by my exhausted wife. I wanted to complain and probably will... never again Palmer House, never again.
