Awesome hotel!!! Great location and great rooms! The views were amazing! I went there for a meeting in the hotel and we stayed there as well. All of my 9 colleageus from across the nation had a wonderful time as well and kept on complimenting the hotel in our meetings. The meeting rooms have great views as well if that is relevant. On top of all this I requested for a firm pillow because of a bad neck and it was the best pillow I have ever slept on. I called the executive houskeeper so that I could get the info on the manufacturer and he said "I'm glad you liked and just keep it!!!" He gave me the pillow for free....now who does that!.Only downside to the hotel is the elevators are a little slow.Overall just a wonderful experience!
