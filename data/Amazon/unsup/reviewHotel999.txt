I travel to Chicago about once a month for work, and I always try to stay at the Amalfi if possible. It is a boutique hotel (so no reward points), and the check-in area is a bit unconventional, but the service and amenities here are always great. The rooms are on the small side, but they're adorably decorated and stocked with Aveda products. I take *really* hot showers, and I've never had problems with the heat or water pressure here. The workout room is very easy to find and set up nicely, with multiple treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, and cable tv. During my first stay, I was surprised by the fact that there are no vending machines in the building. The rooms are stocked with ungodly expensive designer bottled water, but luckily, there's a 7-11 right around the corner where you can grab your necessaries. Room service comes from Harry Caray's across the street; it's not great, but there are plenty of better dinner options in the River North area within walking distance (I recommend eating at the bar at Frontera Grill). I do appreciate their complimentary continental breakfast, which is available on every floor. The selection isn't mind-blowing or anything, but you can get baked goods and fresh fruit, which is all I really ask for. The best part is that I've never had to spend over $179/night on a stay here! The Amalfi's not the cheapest place in town, but if you do your research and get on their mailing list, you do tend to hear about their deals and specials.
