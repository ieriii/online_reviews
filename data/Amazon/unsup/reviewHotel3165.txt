Pretty good as far as hotels go. I have to say that the rooms are a little tired and the staff are really helpful and friendly. The guys at the valet were rock stars. A change from many of the NYC W's. The views of the lake are awesome, summer or winter. It's a little bit of a walk to Michigan Ave when it's super cold and icy, but overall, well positioned. I'd give it a 4 star if there were some decent suites and larger rooms. Like all W's it's on the high side $ wise so I think there should be more room for your money. Not everyone is blinded by the bar and tunes.
