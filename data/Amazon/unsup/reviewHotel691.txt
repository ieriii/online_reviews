Ah, it was fine. We were in a scramble and it was a room. We way overpayed for it, though, but the entire city was booked, so I guess that's what happens when you procrastinate. The employees were great, the bed was adequate and at least didn't have that horrible foam comforter thing that you occasionally encounter. Not really much else to say.
