Here is everything wrong with the hotel, since I don't really want to take up that much time. The rooms are small, we had one of the bigger rooms and it was still very small. The workers were very very rude. No matter how friendly they were trying to be, you could easily read their disdain in their reactions. We were locked out of our room at one point because the hostess didn't charge us the entire safety deposit for our stay and required us to come back down. She was very rude and didn't seem to understand us when we did. The pillows smelled like mold, the elevator felt like it would break down at any minute, and the shower door wouldn't stay closed totally. After we checked out, I realized I lost my house keys, so I called back and asked if they had them. They called back quickly and told me they had found them and I could get them at the front desk at anytime. We were at Shedd Aquarium at the time, so we came a few hours later. When I asked they said they didn't have them and had to check the room again. I sat for close to 15 minutes before they finally said they had them at the desk. The doormen were very nice but I would never stay here again.
