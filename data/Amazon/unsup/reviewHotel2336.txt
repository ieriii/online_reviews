I arrived a bit early for a dinner meeting one Sunday, so I stopped at the Chicago Marriott Downtown Hotel to review my notes and sip on some Cosmopolitans. I'll tell ya.... the bartender really knew how to mix a Cosmo!! I had 2 cocktails and they served glasses of nuts with the drinks. I was alone but I had a nice time. Really could have stayed there all evening.... but my time was limited. Hey, I highly recommend the bar area in the lobby of the Marriott.
