Our entire experience was perfect. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. The concierge was able to get us a dinner reservation at 7:00 that we would not otherwise got ourselves. The workout facility is very nice, and I especially liked the peppermint infused towels. The room is very clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and had one of the best pillows I have ever slept on. Beautiful hotel and I would stay again the next time I am in Chicago.
