wow i'm kinda glad i didn't read the reviews before i stayed here- i would've cancelled. my daughter and i only stayed here overnight. i wanted a good location, that didn't cost an arm and a leg. yes, the hotel is old-i'm not interested in a hotel that looks like every other. our room was in the south tower, and while we did have that same "shining" feeling as the previous reviewer mentioned, the room was beautiful. there was no odor, or burn marks, and the bed/ing was clean and comfortable (and king size). i was disappointed in the lack of refrigerator in the room tho. yes, there was a line to check in, but the staff was friendly and efficient. i did ask for a room with a view that wasn't a wall-no problem. we had a view of the SEARS tower. as for the picketers, they were there, but weren't disruptive don't know the specifics of their situation. i would stay here again, but appreciate the perspective given by other reviewers.
