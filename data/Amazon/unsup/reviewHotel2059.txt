I booked this hotel after alot of research for a weekend away with my 13 yr old daughter and a friend of hers. The hotel is very easy to find and has great views. Its clean and updated. Not alot of frills or bells and whistles which is fine. I didnt pay for that. I got free parking which was the deciding factor to booking with easy in and out anytime I wanted. The pool is very nice even if a little cold. Work out room was up to date and clean. Lobby restaurant and bar were just fine as well. Great views from the bar if you are over 21.  No in room fridge or mini bar, but like I said I didnt pay for that and didnt need it. Free wi fi. We had a great stay and would go back. Id recommend it to anyone.
