I loved this hotel- it was worthy of dancin on the bed once I plugged my ipod into the docking station/alarm clock. I gotta get me one of those! Upon arrival, my first impressions were of the good location, only a few blocks from the river and Millennium Park. Next, the lobby was decorated very chic and modern. The complimentary wine happy hour in the early evening was perfect. We took a few glasses up to our room after checking in with no problems and were pleasantly surprised with the hip decor of the rooms. The bed looked super cozy and proved later to be just that. The room and bathroom were a little on the smallish side but normal for Chicago standards. The concierge later recommended a great pizzeria for dinner and printed out a map for us to give the cab driver. He also suggested a few tourist things for us to do and reserved tickets for us on the Architectural Boat Tour. Very helpful! Be forewarned, the movies are expensive to rent and watch on the big screen LCD TVs in the room. That's my only complaint!
