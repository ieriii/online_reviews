Back from friday & saturday nite stays in King Deluxe room 3002....oct 21 & 22...Bed was Posture Pedic Grand and hardly a pillow top!!!!pillow tops give a floating on cloud feeling and this bed was lumpy and hard as rock!!!! We observed on the floor and around the base ofthe walls filthy dust and dirt!!! Absolutely the worst discovery Sundaymorning were finger & toe nails scattered about the floor, not noticedbefore but now in the bright daylight very disgusting!!!!Four star hotels certainly offer much better comfortable beds, and immaculate cleanliness!!!! Future Chicago stays will be at true four stars hotel, like the Marriott!!!! The Johnson's Adrian, Michigan
