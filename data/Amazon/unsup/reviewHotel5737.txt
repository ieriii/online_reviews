We had our wedding at this hotel. Overrall, a good experience, but just a few things that were a bit of a turn off. Our wedding coordinator quit 2 months before our wedding; the new one who started (Nicole) was good, but took forever to respond to phone calls & emails. The portion sizes during the tastings were misleading, and were not as large on the actual day...definitely about half the vegetables & potatoes we had initially seen. But overrall, the hotel was beautiful, and our bridal suite was amazing. Would recommend for a wedding, just stay on top of the coordinator!
