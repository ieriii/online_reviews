The Good Stuff-- Close to Navy Pier & Michigan Avenue. Friendly staff, great concierge services. Decent restaurants & good drinks (EXCEPT the pomegranate martini which tasted like cough syrup). The Not So Good Stuff-- Really, really, really uncomfortable beds--unless you like being stuck in a marshmallow.  Elevators are slow - you have to build 'commute time' into your schedule.
