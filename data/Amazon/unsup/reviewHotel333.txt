Look. A Travelodge is a Travelodge is a Travelodge is a Travelodge. If you booked a reservation at a Travelodge and when you got there were disappointed because you realized you were at a Travelodge then in the future you should not book a reservation at a Travelodge. Did my bath tub get clogged? Maybe. Did girls run up and down the hall drunk at 5am? Maybe. Did it meet my expectations? Absolutely. Worth the money for the location. Enough said. Boom.
