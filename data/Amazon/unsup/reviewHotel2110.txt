The rooms are lousy and outdated. The walls are thin and the rooms are small with very limited room for your luggage/clothes. The service is horrible. The staff is rude and on the arrogant side. The only positive is the location. But at the same time there are many other choices in the area. Enjoy Chicago! Its an absolutely gorgeous City.
