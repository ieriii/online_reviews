Though I haven't had an opportunity to stay at this hotel, I must comment on the customer service I received when calling for some information! I had several question regarding my travel plans...parking and nearby lots, the best restaurants in the area and fun nightlife I was interested in. I spoke with Edwardo on the phone (front desk person) and he was very helpful and courteous in answering all of my questions. I felt like i was on the phone with GOOGLE! Very informative and patient, he really helped me with my trip details! I can't wait to book my stay, I know that if all else fails the customer service will be there to accommodate me.
