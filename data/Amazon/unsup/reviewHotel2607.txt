Another Jerry Kleiner establishment in the Fulton Market District. I wasn't around for the days of Shelter, but I am told that Kleiner knew how to throw a party, and I must say that I can see what everyone is talking about. My first escapade to Victor occurred about a week after its opening. Of course, being the new club on the block, every model, B-list celeb, and athlete in town was sure to be checking out the spot, leaving the proletariat outside to wait in line for an hour (I must say once I got in I was impressed). I recently went back to Victor for the first time since then, and I like what I see. The interior remains the same, 1950's and 1960's mod furniture (Miesian Barcelona charis, some Le Corbusier, and the bubbly chair whose designer I don't recall), tasteful nude photography, and an overall very colorful atmosphere. What I really like about this place though is the focus on house music, which draws an intense following, particularly on Thursday nights. As with any place that has been open for a while, regular Friday or Saturday nights can be touch and go, so I would stick to special events. But overall, I would deem Victor Hotel to be a place that more Chicago nightclubs should aspire to--tasteful, sophisticated, experimental, and distinctive.
