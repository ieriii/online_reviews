I absolutely love the W City Center. W hotels are known for being uberhip, and this one is no exception: you pretty much feel like you are in a seductive music video as soon as you walk in, thanks to the modern lobby all tricked out in dark tones and low-lit to give the place a perpetual dusky feel. Yes, the rooms are fairly small, but there's a lot of sexy in those little packages. The beds are top-class, with the most perfect bed linens I've yet to experience in a hotel--featherbeds, pillow-top mattresses, down comforters, feather pillows...heaven. The amenities are lovely, as well: in the bathroom, you get a travel kit of Bliss products instead of chain-branded things. Did I mention the floor-to-ceiling mirrors? I'd choose the W to have an affair. Not that I've had one, of course. I'm just saying. The staff during my visit was all helpful and friendly, from check-in to cocktails at the Whiskey bar, and I never felt a thing was lacking. Oh, and free Granny Smith apples are tucked in bowls everywhere, which I love, because those are my favorite.  The whole place is fucking delicious.
