I stayed in this hotel the first time I came to Chicago for a college visit. It is precisely why I am moving to Chicago in a few days. When we first arrived there, the doorman greeted us and took our bags (surprisingly, thats not done much in DC) and guided us to the front desk. All of the staff we spoke to were very polite and helpful. They gave us great recommendations on where to go to for food, and advised us on how to travel when we return to the city. The hotel was quite beautiful, and very comfortable. Our rooms were a few doors down from the free happy hour and breakfast sites so my parents were pretty satisfied. The only reason I give it four stars is because the view kind of blows, but that is no reason to totally down this hotel.
