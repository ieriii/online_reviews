Stayed here in May when I was checking out one of DePaul University's graduate programs. Clean, but tiny. Elevator pretty much only fits two people plus luggage. We got a room that didn't face the El line, but my mom said that she could still hear it at night when she was trying to sleep (I didn't hear a thing, but I slept through Hurricane Wilma in FL four years ago, so that should tell you how heavy of a sleeper I am).Water pressure in the shower was fantastic, even if the bathroom itself was on the smallish side. Beds were EXTREMELY comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was ample, free cookies in the afternoon and right across from a Jamba Juice. You really can't lose.
