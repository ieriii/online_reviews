Excellent hotel because of the prompt service and location! We found deals on Travelzoo and were so happy with the location. Less than a mile away from all of the shopping, restaurants, the beach, and clubs/bars. My only complaint is that the walls were paper thin and we all got pretty loud and some point but no one ever came to complain. I would definitely stay here again!!
