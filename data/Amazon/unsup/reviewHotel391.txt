I thought it was a great hotel for the rate we got. Plus, it was a last minute decision to get a hotel out there for the weekend and it was pretty cheap for a 2-bed room. I was thinking because it was downtown, not far from Michigan Ave that it would cost us a lot, but the room was 69.50 + tax it ended up being 86.50ish, and we split that in half with my friend and her boyfriend, so it was pretty affordable.  I was surprised that the room had a mini-kitchen that included a microwave and mini-fridge. I didn't expect to see that, but very convenient if you had some leftovers you wanted to reheat for a late-night munchie. When we checked in, the front desk was very nice and told us all the amenities that were available to us. And when we checked out, they were bright-eyed and welcomed us down with a 'good morning'.  The room was good, the beds were a bit soft, but doable. They had a nice flat screen to watch some late-night television and plenty of storage space. The room served it's purpose and for the most part, pretty quiet, I will say the walls are pretty thin...I could hear the other room's TV going on. But the price was nice and that's what we like! The room was clean and we enjoyed our stay. I can't really say how much parking was because didn't park our car there. Luckily my sister lives out there and we parked our car at her place and had her drop us off at the hotel. So, all in all, great place to bunk.
