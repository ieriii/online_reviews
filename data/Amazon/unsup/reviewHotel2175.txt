Ah, the venerable Intercontinental. You definitely get the charm of an old fashioned grand hotel here. Lobby is spacious yet comfortable and navigable.  The pool is special, if you like to hang out at indoor pools when you travel - probably great for the winter. My hotel preferences lean towards the modern Hyatt -style places for business trips, but vacations feel more like vacations when you stay at a place like this. Pros: * surprisingly quiet * elegant without being pretentious * comfortable rooms with nice amenities * old building that doesn't feel like one * if you or your significant traveling buddy live to shop, then you can't beat this location and hotel - I can't think of a better place in Chicago to drop after you've shopped. Cons: * my room was really small - not much room to move around * limited views of anything but Michigan Ave (which is not really that bad actually)
