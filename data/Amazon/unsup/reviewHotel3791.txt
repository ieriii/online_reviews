Rather fun things about Dana: Floor to ceiling glass windows Fluffy gowns and matching white slippers, I know, it's the simple things... Friendly service, and bonus chocolate coated fortune cookies on the bed. Fun but unsustainable shower heads in the shower stall. Sorry Lake Michigan. A stool in the shower.... for...? Use your imagination. Also handy for shaving one's legs. The breakfast had all kinds of berries. Berries maketh the day happy. Soft beds with lots of cushions. Frigging "WEIRD-AS" things about Dana: A glass wall in the shower stall, with a curtain that can be opened from the outside, for maximum perving potential for gazing at your loved one while they shower, or take a dump. Exposed concrete ceilings in small low-ceiling bedrooms? I know it's trendy and retro to use exposed concrete like in the 60s.... but in a small room the only things that come to mind are ... uh... bunker? prison cell? Not so good things about Dana: No bathtub. Small rooms. Weak wireless signal. The spa services were all booked up, so we couldn't make use of the spa.
