Their Reservations Dept. needs to ask everyone their age BEFORE booking a room for them! Discrimination? Evidently you must be 21 to book a room at this hotel, so imagine the surprise we got when arriving from out of town & being turned away because we are 20. We were told that a Chicago City Ordinance required that all hotels in Chicago have a 21 yr. old requirement. Holiday Inn did make arrangements for us to stay at the Marriott 1 mile down the street & did pay the difference in the room rate & paid for an extra night.  I think the Holiday Inn was overbooked because of Lallapalooza. The Marriott said they were unaware of any such ordinance requiring an age of 21. Just disappointed in Holiday Inn for being so unorganized. We waited in the lobby for 2 hours for our room, being told our room was still occupied & after 2 hrs. telling us that we didn't meet the age requirement. Then putting the luggage back in the car & driving to the Marriott. What a way to spend half the day.
