Two weeks ago I attended a conference here and had a pair of pants and jacket destroyed by their janitorial staff who dropped a container of bleach cleaning solution which splashed onto me. I didn't realize immediately that any had even gotten on me so I continued on to dinner with some co-workers, but later realized that I was sporting many new spots. Total loss ~$100 and I was just there attending a conference.
