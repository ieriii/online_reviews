I was very surprised that a hotel in such a good location offered free parking and free internet. By free, I mean there's no hidden charges! I stayed there in mid March and was very surprised at how well decorated the rooms were. My boyfriend and I decided to get the queen sized room (it was very spacey). The bathrooms were very clean and well stocked with towels and toiletries. The location was wonderful because it was right by the Magnificent Mile and State St. We walked to everything without a problem, even late at night. There's a McDonalds right across the street, next to the Rainforest Cafe. I highly recommend booking the rooms online. Checking in took me literally less than a minute. I just had to show him my ID and picked up my room keys. Checking out was also a breeze because I had prepaid for the room online. All I had to do was return the room keys. We will definitely stay there again!
