Welcome all to another edition of "Johnny Asks..." So Johnny asked "what hotels are good but cheap for a secret getaway?" (eyebrow notched) Why do you ask JT?! Have some secrets do you?! Are you asking me on secret getaway!?! Listen, I like you and all Johnny but I'm already in a relationship, you understand, right? Anyways, you could go to the MKH. Not the best hotel in the city but the price is fair, the rooms are not huge but enough (awesome pillows and super comfy bed which is the most important, right?!), service is average, great location in the city, they host a murder mystery dinner on the top floor, and they have a descent bar in the lobby of which you can order some bar food too. Their bartenders are hilarious and make a fierce drink. They do have complimentary bar snacks but honestly why would you eat them?! Do you know how many hands have been in there?! So I only stayed one night after watching the murder mystery dinner. I don't recommend the mystery dinner (I'll explain later). I hope this helps, sounds like you're up to know good again JT!!
