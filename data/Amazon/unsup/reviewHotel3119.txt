i love this W Hotel mostly because of location, location, location! i usually visit over long holiday weekends ... twice per year, or so. i lived downtown in Streeterville for many yrs so staying at this W is like a homecoming party to me ... but perhaps, too much party? my big knock on W is inconvenient access ... never ever check-in on a friday or saturday night. last time i arrived 10pm on a friday night, it was a zoo. i roll up in a cab with bags and found a line out the door. W has gotta decide whether to be a club or a hotel, i think. after getting thru the party line (excuse me, pardon me, sorry) i finally reach the front desk for a quick check-in, no problem. but it is still really odd to have partygoers checking you out while you're simply trying to check-in ... a bit disconcerting. had i known, i might have dressed for the check-in?!? (lol) parking fees are expensive because spaces are precious. some streeterville parking spaces can sell for +$50,000!!! so taxi to/from W at all times. it's cheaper and convenient. you can walk the magnificient mile or pier on nice days too. the food is good. i love the breakfast menu and the openness of the restaurant - lounge area, garden, lake view - refreshing. the rooms are comfortable, artfully designed, and spacious. i prefer the relaxing lake view but the city view is also good. i do not use the pool or spa but most say they are nice too. i love to run the path that stretches for miles along lake mi. and of course if you wanna party, friday/saturday is rockin! ;)
