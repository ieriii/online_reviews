The staff at this hotel are very well trained professionals. The Hotel itself is very discreet, private and unassuming. I stayed for a few nights in the earlier part of the year when it was a necessity. Their bar and food happy hour is something to look forward to each night. Anti pasto to rival any Italian B and B. good selection of beer and wine too. The beds are so accommodating and the view and location are excellent. I have stayed in many hotels around the world; this one is as impressive as any! On a side note you cannot compare this hotel to the Peninsula or Ritz Carlton. Do you compare a Toyota Matrix to a Mercedes Benz?
