Want to stay at a hotel that nickel and dimes you for everything? Stay at the Hilton Towers in the South Loop. Free WiFi? No...that is $2.50/hour or $15-20 a day (yes, they do throttle depending on how much you want to spend) Tea or coffee for all in a room for 4? No, they only leave 2 tea bags and 2 single serving coffees (capresso) in each room. Want to take a relaxing bath? Not easily done in a 6-inch deep tub. How about chill at the pool? Not if you don't want to be overrun with kids. Want an easy walk to Chicago nightlife? You are at the far south end of the Loop, and really need to be further north to make this convenient in the winter. As a romantic getaway from our place (we live in the city) this was not it. Room service leaves a lot to be desired if you don't want to spend $100.  Don't get me wrong, this place had its hey-day back in the early 90s when renovated.  They could really use to update the place again. You can tell the Hilton Towers is now designed to efficiently suck every dollar out of the tourists and business people stay here for conventions. 2-stars because the place was clean and they allow you to bring your dog.
