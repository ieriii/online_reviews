We had a teeny little dinner (18 people) here the night before the boy's Bar Mitzvah, and some of our guests stayed here. A lovely hotel with gracious service. You won't get a pool and fitness center, but the location and charm more than make up for it. Dana and Annelise gave our small-scale event the same attention and service that they'd give to a 200-person wedding. The food was was tasty, though not very inventive. The thing is, that you won't get away cheap. There are room charges on top of the food charges, which is why we had the main event at Maggiano's.
