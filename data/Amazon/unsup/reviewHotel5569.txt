I recently set up a wedding block with Hotel Lincoln and have been very pleased with their customer service. While I haven't actually stayed at the hotel, everyone from sales to the bellboy were courteous and attentive. I'm sure my guests will be happy with their stay this summer, and I can't wait to see what the roof deck is like this summer. The views from each room of the park and the lake are amazing, I can only imagine what it will be like from the rooftop! I stopped in the coffee shop attached to the lobby and had a delicious cuppa. The publicist for the hotel happened to overhear me ask the barista what exactly the hotel was going for with their design choices. From the outside, I was expecting the hotel to be somewhat deco. Upon walking in, I realized it's anything but. I think she described it as collegial eclectic, which they really achieved by getting most of their common room decor from various places throughout Lincoln Park.
