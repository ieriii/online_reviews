I recently stayed at The Almalfi and it was just so-so. I am not quite in-line with the other reviews here. It was a hotel, but nothing special, particularly for the price it was charging. It's fairly nicely located for tourist (such as myself) but you still have to walk a few blocks to really find anything. The room was decent, nothing special. Lobby is really small. Service was so-so. Gym was not that great. There's no fan and it's fairly stuffy and hot. Would I stay there again? Perhaps, but I would definitely look else where for.
