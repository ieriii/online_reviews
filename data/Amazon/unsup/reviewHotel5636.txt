I have stayed at this hotel many times, as my corporate office is just a couple of blocks away. This westin is in a great location! The staff is always friendly and helpful. The room is always clean. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the restaurant in the hotel. The food is okay, but not great. The sushi bar is a nice option, but it leaves a little to be desired. They didn't have any wasabi the last time I was there!
