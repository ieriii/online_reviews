Dump. This is the most feared type of downtown lodging on earth: the convention hotel. It's actually just fine if you're looking to encounter wild packs of dry humping, married business men in town for the Dunder Mifflin paper expo. But if you're not, you may want to steer clear of this place. I accidentally stayed (well, entered the room and left) here after booking on Hotwire and our room looked and smelled like Amy Winehouse just checked out of it. I should note, however, that the valet and bellmen were friendly and professional. The irony is that it's just as expensive as the nearby Conrad (Hilton family) or Intercontinental which are great places to stay. Another incredible pain in the ass was check in. Two front desk people were chatting, another was behind the counter and yet they insisted I use the kiosk to check in. It was a pain to say the least. Then when we came back downstairs to checkout they seemed really offended by it and were pretty rude about it all.
