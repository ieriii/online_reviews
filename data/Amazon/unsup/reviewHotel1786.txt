Is it possible to describe a hotel as delicious? I booked this hotel, well knowing I'd be in recovery mood after Lollapalooza. THANK GOODNESS. This place is amazing. I stayed in the King Suite. I feel like a King. Ridiculously spacious. Chic and modern, but not comfortable, tasteful, and cozy. Love the blue color theme and music prints and photographs. Two TVs? Why not. Full bathroom including a tub with jets? Yes, please. The service - from the valet to the front desk - is fantastic. And the small details: the swanky zebra print bathrobes, the fast and free internet, the extensive in-room dining menu. Within 5 minutes of entertaining the room, the decision was made: not gonna bother leaving the room. It's that nice and comfortable. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'd look here in a heartbeat. (I'm so stoked about not leaving room, I forgot to the mention the fantastic location: near anything you need - restaurants, theater, museums, and parks.) *****, no hesitation.
