Really modern and kinda swanky when you walk in. I like the overall setup. The gift shop is awesome and has some really interesting one of a kind jewelry items and it has some cute purses and shirts too, but they are a little on the pricey side. Both times I stopped in it was the same girl working and she is super cool and personable. I have never stayed in a room so I can't review that part of the hotel. I also attended a Style Chicago event here on one floor. It was nice enough, can't say the views were too great from whatever floor we were on.
