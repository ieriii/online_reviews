Though I've never stayed in this hotel, I've been here for a dinner event and really enjoyed myself. The food was good, the service was good, and the venue is quite elegant. Definitely take cues from other jilted guests -- carry your junk with you or lock it down. Though it may look it from the inside, you're not in Oz and your crap will get jacked if you leave it out in the open. Take a tad bit of personal responsibility and you won't find yourself trying to get the hotel to reimburse for your lapse in common sense. Seriously, I read that review and wonder if it's the same woman whose kid hit my car with a shopping cart and then gave *me* the stink eye when I asked her what gives. Also, the acoustics were good.
