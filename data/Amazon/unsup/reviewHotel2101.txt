I never thought I'd give Intercontinental a 3 star but here we are... I love the Intercontinental brand, you know what you're getting every time you come here and most importantly the beds are damn comfortable.  If I had to compare this to other Intercontinental's (not other hotels) I'd say the single ice machine on the 7th floor sucks! Paying to use the gym sucks! The room is much smaller than other Intercontinental's I've stayed at and the walls are pretty thin. The pluses include a Starbucks downstairs and jumping on their wifi is simple, the staff are helpful, the concierge makes solid recommendations especially when you want non tourist things, the hotel is beautiful and did I mention the beds are damn comfortable? I think my favourite thing about this hotel is the location. I'm glad we chose this one but the next time I'm in Chicago I might check out The James. To the couple having sex in the next room...guy, that was a poor showing...really poor!
