Its ok. I like the City Center property much better. My gay husband was in Chicago for a week, and we caused some trouble here. His room was pretty typical for a W Hotel... it acually reminds me of the W Times Square. Trying a little to hard to be South Beach. The upstairs lounge... is awful. We came back late after dinner for a few drinks. There was a man about my father's age who invited me to do the electric slide with him on the dance floor... I wish I was joking. I'd stick to City Center.
