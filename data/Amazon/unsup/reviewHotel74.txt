Remember in Home Alone, that concierge at the hotel who was a total crab and wanted to bust Macaulay Culkin's ass? I think his dopplegangler works the front desk at Carleton. We had a group # for our wedding guests, but somehow a handful of their reservations disappeared. Maybe it was user error or maybe it wasn't, but when working in a hotel, you need to just drop the 'tude and satisfy your paying customers. You don't act like you're doing us a favor by letting us stay at your crusty hotel. Anyhow, besides all that drama, the hotel was fine. The cleaning ladies I ran into were super sweet. The rooms were clean and spacious. Their choice of fabric patterns for the curtains were unfortunate. The entrance was really weird. What hotel doesn't have automatic doors? Getting your stuff into the hotel is like an obstacle course. First you push through two sets of doors (no button for handicapped people to access), then you have some steps to make it through. To get to the right wing, you have to go up some more steps before making it to an elevator. Someone didn't think this through very well.
