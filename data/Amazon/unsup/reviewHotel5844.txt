My friend and I, along with our mothers, stayed at LaQuinta on November 3rd, and are very satisfied with our stay. We needed wheelchair assistance, and the staff could have not been better in assisting us with this. They actually went out of their way to make our stay very enjoyable. And the breakfast was great. It helped make our visit to Chicago, and viewing of the Oprah show an excellent time. Any and all questions were answered in a very professional manner. We will definitely recommend this hotel to all of our friends
