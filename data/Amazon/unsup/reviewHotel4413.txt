The Palmer House was my go-to hotel in Chicago for several years. I'm not so hot about it anymore. Here are the goods and bads: THE GOOD: Great location in the loop. 1-2 blocks from all El lines. Walk to clients, restaurants, theaters, museums, etc. Old school decor and charm with a beautiful lobby. Many rooms are reasonably large (though if you scrounge for the cheapest rate it's on one of the tiny ones). Good prices at times. Stayed 3 nights around New Year's Eve for about 300 all-in. THE BAD: "Old school decor" also means poor room lighting and tiny bathrooms. Deteriorating service for Hilton HHonors members. Staff takes an attitude of, "We've provided the minimum guaranteed benefits, and that's all you're going to get." It's a shame because they used to go the extra mile. Prices are often high (200+/night) at which point there are usually better values elsewhere downtown.
