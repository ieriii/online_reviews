This was the first rooftop bar in Chicago that I've been to. I don't know much about the hotel and spa itself. Actually, I don't know anything about it. but this is probably the last time I'll go to this rooftop bar. I enjoy rooftop bars/lounges (especially in the summer\spring time). The Dana Hotel was really nice. It was half open to the outside and half indoors. It was nice. They had heaters for the winter, I supposed. The music was pumping, nice size crowd, there is some dancing and grinding involved (not trashy at all). Some of my girlfriends and I went to meet up some of our other friends here. I've been to settings like this before (stylish yuppies, douchebag "bros", rich pretentious old men looking for younger girls, ladies who are waiting by the bar looking hot slash slutty so they could find some pretentious old man to pay for their overpriced, skinny tall glass with a ton of ice and straight up alcohol drink, etc.) You just have to go there with a mentality that everyone's there to get wasted (as did I) and then judge everybody else. It's easier for ladies to get in than guys, unless you're popular and/or rich. Don't get me wrong, I had a great time there with my friends, but the place was too poshy, too stuck up, and wasn't my cup of tea. I'd go back if people asked me to, but I would never suggest going there to have fun. It's a good place to take your visitors, if they like to go to places like that.
