NOTE: I have never actually stayed in the hotel -- this is for their bar/restaurant. Ok, I must admit, I used to be the kind of girl who loved hotel bars. But that was a lifetime ago and I stopped that sort of thing. But, awhile back, I started getting my hair done across the street at Studio 110 and having cocktails before and after at the Whitehall across the street (seriously, try going to your next hair appointment loaded - it's super fun.) Anyway, it's not your typical hotel bar. And the food is delicious. Specifically, the pot stickers (those are the ones that are steamed right?) Well, these motherf*ckers changed my life. That and their pizzas. delicious. use the hot chili oil. do it! Me and two others split a pizza and had a dozen dumplings (they had a few -- i had many) and a a delicious Cab. I was in heaven. Pure heaven. Do it. The next time you are downtown or at Studio 110, go here for food and drinks. Plus, when you walk to the back bar area (not the restaurant) you can sit on big plush couches and chairs and hang out and drink and eat. It's so not typical Michigan Ave. I bet staying at the hotel is nice too...get loaded and roll on up to bed.
