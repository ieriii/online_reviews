We ended up in one of their modern themed rooms - and boy was it eclectic, and TOTALLY up my alley. It was on one of the higher floors, so the floor-to-ceiling view was an unexpected bonus - especially since we booked our summer Saturday night here on chance, not reading any reviews beforehand. I'm not sure if all the rooms were like the one we got, or if we just lucked out completely, but WOW. Modern yet comfortable furnishings. Large and spacious bathroom with colorful polka dots EVERYWHERE. And even though the room itself left little space to run around and do cartwheels, we were pleasantly happy with our stay. We got a good deal (price divided by 2), and it was a pedestrian friendly commute to and from the bar/club scene. Highly recommend this place as an alternative to the chain hotels/motels for an authentic and one-of-a-kind experience in the heart of Chi-town. Request one of the 'modern rooms' to be amazed at how a fun duvet cover can change your hotel experience!
