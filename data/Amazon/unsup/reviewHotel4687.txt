Great boutique hotel - nothing bad to say at all. It's the Four Seasons of it's price range. I stay at nice hotels and this is amazing for the price. The housekeepers are assigned to a floor so they are almost like butlers - they get to know you and are there to help you in any way. Also this hotel is close to all the good restaurants like XOCO, Maggianos, Bandera, etc. Best of all, a Whole Foods in just a short block away. Amazing. Staff could have been a little nicer/better (less snooty feeling) but they were ok enough. Their restaurant's food is REALLY good too - especially brealfast. Highly recommend.
