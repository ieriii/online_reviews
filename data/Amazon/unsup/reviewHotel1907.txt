Love it. Loved the lounge area, and that night they had happy hour or cheap drinks, can't remember but it was nice. The rooms and bathrooms were very nice too, a bit small, but decorated very nicely. Bad view from my room, but I didn't mind since I wasn't staying there very long. Location was perfect, so close to Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, Union Station, and great restaurants. Every time I visit Chicago I want to stay here, but can't always find a good deal. This is definitely one of my favorite hotels to stay at.
