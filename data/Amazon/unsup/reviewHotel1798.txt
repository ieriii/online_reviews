My husband and I had our wedding here and we are so happy and thrilled we did.  First of all, the entire staff was so nice and accommodating. We had several room change requests and they always did what they could and gave us the biggest rooms possible. The hotel itself is very stylish, clean, and hip!  My wedding went so smoothly. We had the world's best catering sales manager (Alison) who was so patient with me, and I truly consider her a friend now. Our food was amazing. We heard so many compliments on the food. But most importantly, the space is so romantic and breathtaking. It really is impressive. Please feel free to message me if you are considering having a wedding here. I would be happy to answer any questions.
