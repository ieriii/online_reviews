I stayed here a couple of times in 2011, as this was the hotel-of-choice for my sister's wedding last summer. It definitely had a lot of charm, but it was quite outdated and a bit run down (peeling wallpaper, for example). The elevator was INCREDIBLY SLOOOOOW - and just one passenger elevator for 16 floors meant lots of waiting around. (There was a service elevator that some used instead, but it was equally as slow.) For the location and the price, though, it's a pretty good place to stay.
