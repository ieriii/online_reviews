This hotel was disappointing. When we arrived in our room, we were bummed to find out that there was no coffee maker in the room. We ended up getting room service for coffee in the morning for that reason. Upon checking out, the concierge informed us that there was coffee on the second floor! If we had known that, we wouldn't have gotten room service, which totaled about $75 for our 5-day stay. Nothing in our room indicated that there was free coffee in the hotel, which I felt should have been very clear. One evening, we also asked the hotel if there was a microwave we could use to warm up some leftover food from the night before to save money, and they acted like that was an absurd request. There are plenty of other hotels in the area, and if I returned to the area, I would stay elsewhere.
