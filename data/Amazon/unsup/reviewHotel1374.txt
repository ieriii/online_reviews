Came here for an evening of downtown Chicago festivities and this was a great stay.  It certainly has that European feel, which to some, can just mean plain small. We got a basic room but you can upgrade for more space for a small fee of about $15-20. Learn your square footage for bookings these days so you know what questions to ask! Anyway, I don't mind small, especially since it way only overnight. There were drawers for your stuff and a decent closet so you can get a lot of stuff out of the way if you want. If I was staying for a week or something, I'd get the bigger room. Doors are pocket doors so they don't get in the way. With that said, there's an awkward gap on the bathroom door that if the person in the room is sitting at just the right angle, they can see a bit of your reflection in the bathroom mirror, even though the door is closed. Hard to explain, but just be aware that if you do "private" things in the bathroom you wouldn't want others to see, keep this caveat in mind. Super quiet sleeping, very nice linens, huge TV, stocked mini-fridge. I felt their customer service was fantastic. Front desk was professional and very quick, and the doorman was kind enough the brush the snow of my dirty filthy car while we retrieved our bags.  One problem: for late night snacks, there's not much around. The only place open within a block was Cheesecake Factory, and I wasn't going there. Ended up going to Tempo, where there was a nice mix of people out late at night for a variety of reasons that I always find myself wondering....
