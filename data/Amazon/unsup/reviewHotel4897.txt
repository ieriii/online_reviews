You get what you pay for at this hotel as far as rooms, service and atmosphere go. My girlfriend got married June 25, not at the Dana but we all stayed there. We needed to check in early that day to have somewhere to get ready (traveling from Detroit) to make it to the church by 3:30 pm. The hotel checked us in early over the phone while we sat traffic (at no extra charge), and when we arrived at the hotel with only minutes to spare (thanks to sitting in traffic for an extra unexpected hour) the front dest attendant not only sensed and acknowledged our urgency but took care of everything for us lickity split (literally, we were in the elevator, on our way up to the room within 45 seconds of walking in the front doors of the hotel... as all of our friends were walking out and getting onto the shuttle to go to the church). And we ended up making it to the church on time. Later that night, when we ordered a (extremely overpriced but well worth it) bottle of Veuve, the guy on the room service end of the phone was super cool and the delivery was very fast, as requested. Same with ordering breakfast the next morning - polite, fun and fast. Not to mention, the rooms are gorgeous and clean - we didn't want to leave but couldn't afford to stay. We really enjoyed our short little stay at the Dana.
