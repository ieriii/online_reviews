I want to give Hotel 71 more stars, but I just can't. The location is great, the view from our room was nice, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. After that it goes downhill. We were given a king bed when two doubles were requested, though a discount was given, it was still an inconvenience. The room was oddly shaped leading to a lot of unusable space. No mirror except in the bathroom.  And the bathroom is a whole other issue. I think the rest of the hotel was recently renovated, unfortunately our bathroom had been overlooked since 1970. The dingy & stained bathtub was chipped, grout was filthy, lighting was terrible and there was no exhaust, so putting on makeup was next-to-impossible.  Hence the 3 stars.
