LOVE this hotel. The boyfriend and I had a late Valentine's Day celebration here by renting a room (staycation i guess? too bad I detest that word). The hotel definitely has unique design, very suave, fun, and modern. Our room was a "Spectacular" room with a view of the lakefront. Too bad it was a usual gloom and doom foggy Chicago night. Got drinks at Whiskey Sky on the 33rd floor. Very small, great drinks - would have liked a better view of the city (the view isn't bad, it just can be hard to see it without kneeling on the couch - at least if you're 5'2). Only complaints/notes 1) Parking - $48 for overnight valet parking. Good lord. We just parked on the street a few blocks away and paid like $10 in meter parking. 2) Let it be known that if you are a very private person when it comes to using the bathroom, this might be rough for you. There's a sliding door, but there are also cafe windows into the bathroom that don't *fully* close. Otherwise, absolutely love and recommend this place. Great view, great food, great staff... great!
