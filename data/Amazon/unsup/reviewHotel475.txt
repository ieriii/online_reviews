I couldn't believe the price when I booked a suite here for me and five others. The rooms are not the most spacious, but for the price, it's great. And the location was perfect. They were located a few blocks from everywhere we wanted to go. To your left is the Art Institute of Chicago, Aquarium, Grant Park, Buckingham Fountain, and more. To your right was the Magnificent Mile shopping area, tons of restaurants, Chicago Water Tower, and John Hancock Observatory. Although we weren't directly located next to anything, it worked out perfect to me in close to everything rather than closer to some places than other. Another perk was that we located right across from Dominic's Pharmacy. We walked there regularly for snacks. Saving the best for last, the absolute BEST thing about this hotel is: - Complimentary breakfast buffet every morning. (Time varies by the day) - Made to order omelets of your choice. - Complimentary happy hour w/ chips & salsa and other snacks. - The nicest bellperson(s). Greeted everyday entering and leaving. And were very helpful with any questions we had. Other perks that I didn't take advantage of: - Indoor pool. - Gym. - Lounging area in lobby. I highly recommend this hotel! My friends and I were very pleased with our experience.
