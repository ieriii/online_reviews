This place is interesting. Lobby and decor are modern, as other reviews will tell you. I hate the cologne in the elevators... Rooms are OK, but nothing to write home about. It's an old building refurb, and there is only so much you can do... Service is phenomenal, which, along with central location, is what moves this from a 3 to 4 star review.
