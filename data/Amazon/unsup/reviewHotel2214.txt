If it wasn't for the location this would be a one star review. Hotel staff is just not what you expect from a Michigan Avenue experience. Hotel is crowded with foreigners primarily Europeans. The hotel is nice but not consistent with the price. Our room temperature control was broken and had to have engineering fix it. We spent one very cold night. They charge $18/day for Internet access and wait until you hear this... $12 to use the treadmill at the fitness center. This rule must go since it is just ridiculous. Again location makes this a good choice but the Marriott across the street is a much better choice.
