I stayed here for a graduate school interview and was pleasantly surprised. The place doesn't look so hot from far away (see pic), and the lobby on the first floor is tiny and dark. But once you go up the elevator to the real lobby, things are much better. It's really annoying that you have to change elevators to go up and down, but the location of this hotel is excellent.
