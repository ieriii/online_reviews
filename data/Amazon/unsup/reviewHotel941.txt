WELL.. where do I start. How about the good.. * Great location - right by Michigan avenue and all the shops * Across the street from Garrett's Popcorn! * Easy to find and get to... walking distance to so many places * Right next to the bus stop * Pretty friendly staff at the front desk * super cheap the bad: *dirty - rooms have not been kept up *small rooms - there was NO walking space *no desk *beds were very small and very low *bathroom is smaller than any other bathroom I have been too.. there is pretty much no room on the sink counter *lobby does not have a bathroom? isn't that weird? *room was not cleaned regularly *found a bug on the floor - do not walk around barefoot here *towels and amenities left something to be desired - the towels were so small they barely cover your body! *elevators are small, cramped, and chose to work when they wanted to In a nutshell... stay here if you do not plan to stay for long or are looking for a bargain room next to everything. Do not expect much.
