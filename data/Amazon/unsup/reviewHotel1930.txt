Pretentious, much? Stayed here with a discounted rate; I would have never paid full price for this snobbery. The W has a reputation for luxury, but I wouldn't consider this hotel luxurious. One of my friends said it best when he commented that staying at this hotel seems to come with the prerequisites of an eating disorder and a cocaine problem. The hotel just tries too darn hard. The lobby is dimly lit and full of mirrors like a 70s nightclub. The rooms are large, very clean, and somewhat well appointed, but definitely not worth the cash. The elevators literally made me want to puke with blacklights and holograms--seriously?! And for all of the ridiculous "Welcome to the W, what's your wish" nonsense, the people at the front desk were quite preoccupied by their personal cell phones. Parking's $51. Save yourself some cash and park at that Self Park down the street over night for $34.
