My best friend and I stayed here for a girl's night out.....the service was ok. The hotel is in an ideal location for going out on the town. I loved the architectural design of the building--uber trendy--the beds were VERY comfy. Now, the shower I was not impressed with since there are no shower doors! Water kept getting all over the bathroom so you have to be careful. Also at one point during the evening an employee let himself into our room with his room key at approx. 8 pm asking us if we wanted a "turn down service"! The staff was not the friendly and some of them were out and out rude. The price was reasonable however...and the spa was "just okay". Probably wouldn't go back again.
