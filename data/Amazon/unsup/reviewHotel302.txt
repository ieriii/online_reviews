Either everyones standards are really high or mine are just dirt low but this place was great. I dont think I could have stayed about a better hotel. Sure we looked at the really sweet 5 stars downtown and couldnt afford them due to non ballin'. But hey... This place is close to everything. Right at purple belmont. Close to food, shops, bars, PIZZA. Staff left us alone the whole time which is a big plus. Russ hooked it up several times. Small rooms but that is all you need. It was clean warm and the bathroom had a window facing Belmont. It was great and we will be back.....
