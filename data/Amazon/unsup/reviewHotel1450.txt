Was here for work and LOVED it. Comfortable suites with great service and an amazing view of the city. You really can't go wrong staying at any Omni, just this was especially nice due to the service and location.  Located on Michigan Avenue, your close to shopping and tons of restaurants. The rooms have a full-sized living room with flat screen, desk and wet bar area. The french doors lead to the bedroom with another TV, and the bathroom is very modern stocked with premium bath products. For work or pleasure, it's a great stay.
