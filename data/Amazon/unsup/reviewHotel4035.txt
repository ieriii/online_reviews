The hotel is nicely located downtown, the cost is also very high so expectations are then high I have som complaints The hotel itself is somewhat dated You feel like you are walking into an airport or train station when you walk into the lobby They will charge you $52/night just for parking They charge $14.95/night for Internet, this is the cheapest and slowest package they have. The breakfast scrambled eggs were oh my god horrible "almost powdery". Their fitness center is shameful and there is no swimming pool. Given the cost and their approach of nickel and dime you, I would not recommend it.
