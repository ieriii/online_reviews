We took advantage of an opening month special. Staff was welcoming, friendly and helpful. Warm chocolate chip cookies at check in. Bartenders were great. They definitely treat hotel guests well. Food was great. Spa was a bit disappointing. Great treatment. Not so great spa ambiance. We'll go back. Especially to Roof!!
