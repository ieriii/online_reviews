In general, this hotel was a disappointment. I was expecting much more from a W. The front desk is in an odd location - it requires directions to find. The decor in the hotel is modern. I checked in around midnight and had booked a room that was supposed to a "Wonderful Room" with 253 sq ft. Instead, they sent me to a room about half that size. The bathroom was so small that there was no room for the waste basket - which they positioned practically in front of the toilet. The vanity was so small that there was definitely no place to put the regular toiletries people bring when they travel. I assume they think you will be running these back and forth between your luggage and the bathroom. The person checking me in informed me that this was a newly renovated room and it did smell that way. However, they missed small details such as the air conditioner against the wall was not caulked and the old wall was showing behind it. When I called to let them know I was not satisfied with this accommodation, they offered to upgrade me for another $70/night. Eventually, I went down to the front desk and the next person on duty was excellent. He was anxious to make things right and immediately moved me to another room that was twice the size - probably the room I reserved at 253 sq ft. (no additional charge) The lounge was nice. The service was good and the waitresses were friendly and helpful. The security personnel were also nice as were the people at the bell desk. The exercise room was reasonable (called the Sweat Room) - but the thermostat was set too high and it was pretty warm in there. I guess that's why they call it the sweat room:-)  There was a relatively small collection of equipment but it was in good condition and well maintained. Other than the bad first impression, this hotel is okay. It is nothing exceptional though and for the price, there are better places.
