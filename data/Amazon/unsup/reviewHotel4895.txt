My wife and I chose to have our wedding reception here, and we could not have been more pleased. The staff was great, the event was well coordinated and the accomodations and ammenities were to die for. The reception hosted about 140 people and they were all very pleased with the space, yet coziness of the 5th floor lounge.The majority of our families stayed overnight and we found the price of the rooms, food, drinks and entire event to be very reasonable considering the elegant yet very cool surroundings. From the all glass facade, to the hardwood floors, and everything in between, this seems to be a very "it" place to be.Overall, we were obviously very pleased and would absolutely stay there again, if not host another event!
