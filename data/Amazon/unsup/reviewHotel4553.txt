3.5-The Palmer House will not disappoint you in the realm of aesthetics. The Palmer House has a beautifully painted ceiling that was restored by one of the same artists that restored the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The light fixtures and the ambiance is incredible. You will see bellhops and a few stores in the hotel (including Starbucks).  The negatives go with the rooms mainly. The room that I stayed in was a little small, and it had a smoke smell even though it was supposed to be non-smoking. In addition, the bathroom and decor did not look very well kept.  For the price that you pay to stay at this hotel, more amenities should be included in the price. You will have to pay for wi-fi and the business center. The location of the hotel is convenient. You can walk to shops and to the Millenium Park to see the Cloud Gate (o.k. no one calls it that...aka the 'silver bean'). I gave it a 3.5 due to these factors.
