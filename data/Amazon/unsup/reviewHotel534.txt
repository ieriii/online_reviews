It was long pending from my side to review Hampton but somehow it slipped out of my mind. So here it goes.. I stayed here almost an year back for 20 days. -Location: Hampton is located in the heart of downtown. It's just a block away from red line station. It's very near to all the good restaurants and Chicago River Walk.Clubs like Excalibur, Andy's live jazz and restuarants like Shaw Crab house,Braazars,Benny's Steak House are very close. -Room: My room was quite big with all the facilities like a small fridge, microwave,coffee machine,ironing board, iron and flat screen.Bed was very big and comfortable.It had a couch and small table.The room had a very good Wi-Fi connection.Closet with security safe. The bathroom had all the basic amenities and was very clean. -Staff: Staff is very helpful right from the doorman, receptionist and manager. They go all the way to help you out whether it's getting a cab or getting tickets for the local cubs game. -Hotel: It had a business centre which has Internet,printer and fax facility. The pool and jacuzzi area is clean enough to be used.Gym is very basic,they should add some more equimenmts. -Food: The complimentary breakfast was very good.It consisted of waffles,coffee,cakes,eggs,juice machine,fresh fruit, buttermilk biscuits,sausage and different variety of cereals. The bad part is if you are staying too long in the Hotel like I did, one does get bored with the same breakfast daily. I did request them to change their menu.Will have to stay again at Hampton to check if they changed it or not. -Drawbacks: It's very near to fire station so there is a constant disturbance due to fire alarm voice. Even when the windows are closed the sound is quite prominent inside the room.
