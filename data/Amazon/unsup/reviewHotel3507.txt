Before arriving here I checked Yelp for reviews......lots of unhappy comments, but we loved this hotel. Trendy, friendly, helpful, modern and a fabulous location! We always choose boutique hotels, and our room rate was excellent, 23rd floor with view of Michigan Ave. The room certainly was a satisfactory size, since most of time we were away from it. Wifi in the room would have been ideal, but going down to the lounge area wasn't a problem and rather a cool place to be, whether with coffee or a drink. The location made every where so accessible, we walked all the time! No car needed, just bought a 3 day pass and could use the El or buses anytime! A great hotel in a great city!
