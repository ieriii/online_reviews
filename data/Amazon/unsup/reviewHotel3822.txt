The dana has a very good location to all the must see places. That was why I picked this place. checking in was a breeze. staffs were efficient and friendly. room was neat and modern. housekeeping does a good job. the only downner would be the noise coming from the streets and hall. even i was located on a high floor every cop car, ambulance or fire truck that drives by would be echoing thru out the room which is not good if you need to sleep. would pick another hotel in the same area next time I visit.
