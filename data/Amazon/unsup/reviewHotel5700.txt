The location was excellent and close to major tourist sites. We had a room facing the buildings to the back of the hotel, which we didn't mind because it seemed to "buffer" the noise level. It was a great historical building, which usually indicates small rooms. This was expected..but was surprised by the minimal housekeeping. We stayed a week and some days the room would not be cleaned up until 3 pm. I don't think they ever vaccumed the carpet while we were there. It took them 5 hours to get us a roll-away for our daughter to sleep in the first night. The staff was somewhat helpful when we asked them a few questions about how to get to the orange line to get to the Mid-way airport. The restaurant downstairs had good food, but a bit pricey I felt for the portion size. Checking in and out was really fast and they stored our luggage for several hours on the last day. The bathroom flooring did have a "urine" smell to it. I believe someone in an another review also had mentioned that as well. The filtered water/water bottles was a perfect addition. We had a few days where there was not enough warm water when showering in the morning. I was shocked to find out that this hotel throws out all the plastic/paper and does not recycle anything. I took our empty plastic bottles down to the street side recylce bin myself. In all it was a good location for the money.
