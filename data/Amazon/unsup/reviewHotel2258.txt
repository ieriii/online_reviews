We had a pre-wedding dinner party at the Marriott on Michigan Ave, and we were absolutely floored by the extraordinary level of commitment shown by every member of the Marriott staff. Kristina Cappazoli helped us plan out our event, and was amazing right from the get go. Each time we interacted with her, we felt more confident that the dinner would go well -- and it did! We continue to get compliments from our guests on how wonderful everything was -- the food, the ambiance, the service. It all added up to an unforgettable night, and we owe thanks to Kristina for helping us make it happen. Special shout out to Cheryl B, the amazingly talented pastry chef who designed our wedding cake. She came up with some excellent designs, and was willing to adapt to our tastes and preferences. More than one guest came up and told us it was the best wedding cake they had ever tasted. If you have to plan an event in the Chicago downtown area -- I'd wholeheartedly recommend the Marriott, especially if you get to work with Kristina and Cheryl!
