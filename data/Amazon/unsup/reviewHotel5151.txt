Stayed here last Sat nite.Can't say enough about how nice the room, staff and facilities are. Great location near Millennium station,excellent price/value.One block south of the river two blocks from Michigan Ave. Has a European feel with Midwestern warmth. Had Sunday breakfast in Fillinis, food and service was great.
