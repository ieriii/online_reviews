The biggest downfall for this hotel is that it is nearly in the middle of no where. It's a sketchy part of town, with Chinatown about 4-5 blocks away and the nearest L station about 6-7 blocks away... and I can honestly say these are LONG blocks. If you plan on staying out late in the city after dark, you're probably safe taking a cab. It can be pricey though, so taking a more expensive hotel farther up north... especially north of the loop is better. Room service is non-existent... although the hotel does advertise a pizza place and chinese place that you and order delivery from. The hotel's little sports bar is its only saving grace. The crowd is upbeat and the drinks are great. If you're new to the city and aren't street smart, this isn't the best place to stay. If you've been here before and are used to far south of the loop, it's definitely worth it!
