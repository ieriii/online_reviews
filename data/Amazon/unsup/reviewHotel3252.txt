Yeah yeah yeah its in the Carbon and Carbide Building. I love Chicago architecture but there are many architecturally significant buildings in the city and its not like the hotel and its decor reflected any of the buildings stylings.... so it really has nothing to do with the hotel. BUT I liked the decor. Of both the room, lobby and bar area. Very sleek and modern. Loved the gray-purple walls in our room. The minimalist decor. The meant-to-look-expensive Warhol-esque rock-star images were cheesy but acceptable. Color-scheme - thumbs up. Aveda bathroom products - good job. Great bed and lots of extra pillows in the closet - rock n roll. The curtains definitely kept the morning light out - but, the rooms were not quite soundproof (from the bed, which was some distance from the door, I could hear the elevator and neighboring rooms' doors opening and closing - strange, not too mention light Saturday AM traffic). I laughed at the outrageous prices found while purusing the room-delivery menu and the mini-fridge items. Not like I was surprised. I just feel bad for the people (i.e. the out-of-towners up late night) who are stuck having to pay for all these things. (Whereas other guests may know there way around the loop or not be intimidated searching for a local convenience store). $3 for a can of pop. $7 for a bottle of designer water. etc etc. Good god, how horrible. My friend, living in the suburbs, got the room to serve as the base for her birthday celebration and I enjoyed the comfort and swankiness of the hotel but wasn't *super* impressed. The other guests we encountered during Saturday checkout were anything but urban sophisticates - which was cool. But contrary to what others have posted.... definitely touristy. Basically I place like this is a bit too gratuitous for my tastes but I have nothing against it. It was pretty cool but still nothing to write home about.
