Nice place, decent prices. I snabbed a deal with hotetonight for $114 (I had $25 in credits), we got a corner king with a balcony, whiich was nice. I loved the showers and everything is clean and modern and good to look at and the bed is super comfy. It is a nice, quiet hotel and vertigo is right upstairs, which is awesome and has very nice views! Great location too.
