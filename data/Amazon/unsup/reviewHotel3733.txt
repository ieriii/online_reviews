I was recently at the Dana for my sister's bachelorette weekend. First, we went to the Dana spa and that was AMAZING. I had the aromatherapy massage and fell asleep it was so relaxing. My sister, who usually feels uncomfortable at spas, got a facial and LOVED it. We stayed in a corner suite at the hotel which was SO luxurious! IT had 2 balconies, a plush king bed, sofa bed, a wine fridge, hardwood floor living room and a shower for 2! The staff was very accomodating, bring our luggage up and down from our room and also bring extra things as we needed. They would call when our friends came to visit the room and let them into the elevator for us and even brought up our friends shopping bags for them! The Dana is also right in river north so we could walk to all the fun restaurants and bars. Check out the Dana Hotel for sure. It has a modern, clean/new look, is right where you want to be in Chicago and is DEFINITELY above all the usual chain hotels.
