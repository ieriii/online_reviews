We were fairly disappointed. While the lobby area is quite immaculate and historic, the rooms are not. They are quite small. On our second night there we experienced problems with some loud partiers next door. We called management and they tried to contact them a few times. Finally, we called again and they asked if they could bring some earplugs to us. We explained that we already had some. Unfortunately, we did not sleep well that night. We would choose a different place to stay the next time we are in Chicago.
