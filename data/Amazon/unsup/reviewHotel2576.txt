It was alright. My friends and I went on Lady Gaga night. If you're gay, love gay people, and love Britney Spears-Kesha-Lady Gaga music, 18 and over, then it's your place. The crowd was dancing, music was playing, there was a drag show. A lot of freakiness going on. But when they started the juke music...I thought...I did not pay $10 for juke music, if I wanted juke music then I would've gone to a ghetto high school homecoming. Somehow I think that the crowd is way young for my age (I'm 24). But I think they're some cute looking gay guys there and I made out with him (I'm straight). Hehe. Can't say much about the drinks because I pre-gamed.
