I went to a wedding reception here. I will admit I did not expect much because this place seems to have been under construction for forever and I just didn't have high hopes. It was a lovely reception, however. The room was very modern, with a nice cool reception area outside to step away from the dance floor and cool off. The biggest problem was that you had to ride up a very slow, cramped elevator to get there.   The soup here was...remarkable. The best tomato-basil soup I've ever had. Second-best wedding soup I've ever had (that would be the cream of artichoke at the Hotel Intercontinental about 12 years back). I don't know what the magic ingredient is, but it must be pixie dust or leprechan gold shavings or unicorn kisses. It is served with a marvelous bread top that defies description. I just cannot say enough about it. I would do unspeakable things to have that soup again. I think I'm going to start calling the hotel to see what I can barter for more of this soup. Also, the wedding was beautiful and lovely. I assume the first dance, cutting the cake, etc. was nice but couldn't look up from my soup. I'll have to watch the video.
