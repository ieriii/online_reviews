The room we had was VERY clean and the beds were super comfy. The staff was also very accommodating. We thought our room would have a mini fridge, well it didn't so the front desk was nice enough to bring one up at no additional charges. (Sweet) We had a nice city view. Walking distance to all the stores. Just a quick cab ride away from everything else. My friend dished out the $28 for self park. Though Priceline we paid $87 (After taxes) for a room with 2 double beds.
