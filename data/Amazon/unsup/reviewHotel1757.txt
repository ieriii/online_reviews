I think a 9 year old girl with a fetish for princess stuff designed this and then an early 90s contemporary interior designer finished up. Way too 'girly' and annoying contemporary style. I'll give em points for the logo though. The striped hallways make my head spin sober or not, more so when not. However, very clean and gives off a swanky feel. Some sort of theatre group meeting was going on while I was there. Bonus though of free glasses of wine and socializing around 5pm. My view was a brick wall and there were odd noises throughout the night so that was a bit of a downer. The staff is very helpful and actually has a sense of humor. The best part of the stay... the music they play in the lobby and the elevator. Granted it's possibly a little too hip and that well may make you sick but good tunes nonetheless. The Smiths while riding to the lobby, hell yeah.
