This ais a great place to stay if doing business in the River North area. Clean and comfortable rooms, freindly and helpful staff, a great restaurant just through the lobby for those cold nights you don't want to venture outside in and a nice continental breakfast on each floor. You can sneak out in your pjs and bring coffee and fresh fruit & pastries back to your room. Great value for the price. Will definitely return!
