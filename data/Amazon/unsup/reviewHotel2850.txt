Four stars for accommodations and location, 1.5-2 stars for some bad-apple service encounters, giving this place overall three stars. Hotel accommodations were well apportioned, and at a perfect location in downtown Chi-town. My room was clean, very comfortable and very well cared for throughout my stay. I would have enjoyed my riverside view room more if I weren't so busy during my business trip. Great views of the waterfront, lakeside and riverside. Walkable to the Magnificent Mile and other touristy areas of interest like the Art Institute and Millennium Park.  Great amenities, but they sure nickel and dime you to use them unless you pay a flat rate for your stay or you're a platinum-level Starwood Preferred Guest member. It's an obnoxious ploy these higher-end hotels play, and of course we sucker into them and succumb to them. I will rejoice the day they stop playing games and stop with these peddling charges.  Service was attentive, but not consistent. If you get unlucky you'll get a receptionist that's very strict, not accommodating, and otherwise arrogant. One reception who I got at check-in was friendly and listed the amenities included during my stay. I got an obnoxious young lady at check out that charged for internet. I told her it was supposed to be included and she said otherwise and that I should have checked when I checked in. Since my stay was taken care of by my work I didn't bother to argue, but that didn't make me less annoyed with the service. I'd definitely keep this hotel in mind for my next stay for amenities and convenience of location, but the nickel and dime-ing of USING the amenities and the sour reception/customer service will by no means make me run to the place.
