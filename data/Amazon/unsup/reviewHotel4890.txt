We stayed here last weekend for 5 nights and were thouroughly impressed with the service and the amenities.You MUST suck it up and get the corner suite room with floor to ceiling windows! INCREDIBLY comfortable beds and great views! Showers are porn-tastic as well with see through wall into the bedroom!Aja steakhouse is great for drinks too...centrally located, walk to everything!
