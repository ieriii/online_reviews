We enjoyed the Dana. Very nice staff and comfortable rooms. The beds are pretty plush with 300-count fabrics, but not quite the quality of the Westin. A little squishy for sleeping. Great shower and room features. We had a view of Holy Name Cathedral. A few negatives: the air conditioner was loud and would wake us up at night. Also, the continental breakfast was subpar. I think with some tweaking, I could give Dana a 5. Also, great location!
