Good price in a great location (set back from Michigan Ave with easy access to it) with cookies when you check in. Not a whole lot else a gal could ask for! Room was spacious and tidy, and the bed was comfortable. The shower was also great and service was helpful when needed. Hotel has also recently been remodeled which is nice. The lobby has ample seating and a cozy feel. Breakfast is not included(no surprises here) but there is an Einstein's in the lobby if you need to grab a quick bagel or a coffee (though there is a coffee maker in the room as well).
