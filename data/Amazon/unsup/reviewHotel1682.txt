This hotel was extremely nice for it being downtown. The prices are great and the staff is very friendly. Though this is a pet friendly facility, no pets ever got in our way or were too loud. There's a restaurant called "321" hooked up in the hotel. The food is pretty good and the waiters are almost too ridiculously funny and nice. Then there's the Encore bar..which I'm pretty sure only tourists hang out there, so if you're into annoying tourists..I say this is where it's at. OH AND TOURISTS ARE SO RUDE. UNGRATEFUL, AND ANNOYING. I couldn't believe Chicago was filled with such snotty middle class white people in the summer. ANYWAYS...The lobby is really cool! They serve coffee in the mornings, water and ice tea in the afternoon, and wine at night, for free! It's also a cool place to hang out since the rooms are so small. However small the rooms may be, it was a nice room. Most hotel rooms you'll find in ANY city will be that small. Especially at such a good price. I would come here again.
