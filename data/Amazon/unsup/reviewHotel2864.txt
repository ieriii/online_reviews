I was here for a conference.  This Sheraton is centrally located which makes walking to the various restuarants and places to see easy. It's also a block away froma Dominic's, so you can stock your room with snacks for a fraction of the cost you'd pay for the room snack bar.  The staff was friendly and accomodating. I especially like that the business center doesn't nickel and dime you for one or two copies or to log in for a few minutes.  One minus is the wi-fi is wireless in the common areas, but wired for the rooms. If you have two people with laptops, this means disconnecting one peson so the other can log in. They need to rethink this concept IMHO.
