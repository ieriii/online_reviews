This is a gem of a hotel just off the Magnificent Mile. The rooms are nothing to get excited about, but the location and the staff make it great. If you're looking for the typical big chain hotel room, this isn't it. If you want a quaint hotel, with comfy beds, hot water, and clean sheets, this is perfect. Great rates available just check the hotel sites for deals. Ditka's place is right next door for eats, and Starbucks is across the street...perfect!
