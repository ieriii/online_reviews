I totally love the funky, chic feel of this hotel! Stayed here with a group for a wedding and could not have been more pleased. Agree with the below review about the total awesomeness of the funky theme throughout the hotel's furnishings. When I opened the door, the combo of the black sparkly floor with the metallic closet doors created a disco-ey feel, kind of like the room was welcoming you into a party. This, combined with the funky blue blue plush carpet was enough to set me back a few years. The best part of the room? Definitely the bed. I have never slept so well.  I found the hotel to be super quiet, and also surprisingly, with an excellent desk for me to get some work done during the day. I loved the ease of having a nice restaurant downstairs that wasn't too pricey, yet still nice enough to enjoy a good drink and some apps while relaxing from the day's events.  The proximity to Millennium Park is also unbeatable! Location is always key (particularly in a city that has such scary driving), and the Blu did not let down in this respect.  I also found all the employees to be extremely accommodating. Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I would definitely be back!
