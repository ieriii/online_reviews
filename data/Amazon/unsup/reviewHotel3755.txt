I was just here for a yelp elite event and the service was wonderful! I had and leg and foot exfoliating treatment and a aromatherapy massage. Both left me feeling simply relaxed and ready to enjoy the day. The service was professional and the facilities are impeccable. Will have to come back and pamper myself on another rainy day!
