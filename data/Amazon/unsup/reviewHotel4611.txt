Pros: Nice location, convenient to many restaurants and touristy locations. Friendly staff Awesome "business center" aka computers that you can use to surf the net for free! And free printing too! Con: Rooms ARE very tiiiinnnyyy!! Not insufficient, but very cramped. I wouldn't say this is up to par for a 4-star hotel as it's listed on priceline. But definitely a really good 3-star hotel.
