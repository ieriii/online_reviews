I've only stayed here once so far, but I'm not sure I would do it again. First I'll go with the positives. - As has been mentioned, it's got a nice view. I'm usually in my room for sleeping, so the view doesn't matter all that much to me. - Pretty good location. I got in late (O'Hare lost my luggage, who would've thought), and I was pleased to find a restaurant (PJ Clarke's) and grocery store (Dominick's) within close walking distance. Dominick's is open until 1am which helped out a lot. - Concierge is helpful. She pointed me in the direction of the places found above. Now on to the negatives... - Room feels old. The linens reminded me of my grandparents linens from the 70s. The bathroom was antiquated with old fixtures, decent shower. - Dirt in my bath tub. Not sure why and it washed out fine, but seriously. - Ethernet cable didn't work. I called to put in a request to fix it, went to get take-out and to the grocery store. Got back about an hour later and no one had come by to fix it. Called again and they sent someone up shortly, but you shouldn't have to call again. - O'Hare lost my luggage, I notified the bell man that they would be delivering my luggage over night. He assured me they would leave me a message if it came letting me know it was in. Wake up the next morning with no message, assume it has not been delivered. Check on the airlines website and it says it was delivered overnight. Sure enough, went downstairs and it was there. Overall just wasn't the greatest experience. Cheaper than the Westin, but I prefer the Westin River North to the Sheraton.
