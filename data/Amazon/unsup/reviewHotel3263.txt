Hard Rock Hotel is a modern, hip place to stay in. As soon as you walk through the door you feel its refreshing style. There are cool paintings on the walls and the service is pretty good. The room is excellent and comfortable on the eye. The bed is comfortable and they have awesome pillows ;) We ordered food and it was not good at all. The ceasar salad felt like it was done three days ago. Watch our for the mini bar. Touch anything and it is on your bill. I would definetely stay there again.
