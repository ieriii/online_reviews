First and probably only chance to stay at the Ritz Carlton and it lived up to it's name. I had a great time! By the 2nd day our family's mantra was "I lov e the Ritz." Thoroughly enjoyed their great services and amenities. I also recommend treating yourself to a massage at the spa. The only down side was we sometimes felt like people were looking at us like we belonged at the Red Roof Inn, but hey, we're rookies!
