Recently stayed here for two nights. Took the advice of several reviewers and upgraded to the Executive Suites. Well worth the small upcharge. The room was very comfortable. The A/C was awesome. With temps in the mid to upper 90s, I was concerned that it might never get cool enough. Boy did it ever. It was great! The appetizers at night and the continental breakfast in the morning are great. And the cucumber water right outside the elevators was so refreshing coming in from the heat. The staff was very friendly. Everyone we passed in the hall said hi or wished us a great day. There's an el stop right out the door. A McDonalds and CVS are in super close walking distance. The Art Institute is barely a block away. Never had to wait for a cab, the doorman were on top of it the moment we came outside. We did have a slight billing issue with something ordered before our arrival but it was fixed up immediately. I will most definitely stay at this hotel again if I'm ever in Chicago again.
