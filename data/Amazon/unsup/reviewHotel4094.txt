This hotel should be used only for business/conference type events cause I don't think it will satisfy any of the needs of a casual traveler. I stayed here 1 night, and my experience kinda blew. I was supposedly being "upgraded" to a better room because I have status with Hyatt, but if the room I got was my upgrade, i'd HATE to see what my original room looked like. Small, uncomfortable, sterile, uninviting setting throughout the hotel. The main lobby is actually very appeasing to the eyes, with waterfalls and high ceilings. The service was decent, and I have no complaints here. If you're looking for a hotel to relax at, this isn't the spot. Its loud and busy typically, with business people and conventioners.
