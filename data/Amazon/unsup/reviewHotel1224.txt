We were extended a complementary stay due to our dissatisfaction with our last visit over Valentines Day. Elizabeth Finifrock in Guest Services went out of her way to make up for our previous disappointment. We were given the LakeShore Suite on the 31st floor, with amazing views of the lake, the loop and Soldier Field. The suite was HUGE and luxurious, eminently comfortable and homey. I think I'm spoiled for all future hotel stays ;). Upon returning from a trip to Shedd, we arrived back in our room to find refreshments waiting for us. Elizabeth had recommended a restaurant that proved to be a great choice! The night was made complete with a complimentary "sweet tooth" tray of truffles and cheesecake "pops"! The whole night - our anniversary btw - was amazing and more than made up for our disastrous visit previously. While I hate to think it takes a negative for a hotel or other service to change its tune, I AM happy to know that the folks @ Hyatt take our feedback seriously. We had a great time.
