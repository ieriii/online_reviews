I have been in two rooms at this location. I wasn't impressed by either of them. I found them to be bland, small and gaudy. I usually like gaudy! The hallways are filled with boring "art" or shadowboxes. The lobby is nice, but I think for a W it could/should. be done better. For the price, You should stay at the sofitel.
