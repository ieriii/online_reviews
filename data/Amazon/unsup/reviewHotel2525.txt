Stayed on the 16th floor last week ... pros: - short walk to Grant Park, museums, Millenium Park, restaurants (Lou Malnati's, Yolk, Bennigans) - friendly, helpful front desk ... much more like a concierge service! - Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries - beautiful, grand, historical building cons: - got warm and humid at night ... A/C works on motion sensor - inconsistent quality of housekeeping - small selection and high prices at Pavilion (casual family dining) - rough towels, no soap dish and glasses/cups in bathroom
