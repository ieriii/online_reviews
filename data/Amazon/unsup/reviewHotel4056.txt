I somewhat feel that 2 stars is harsh for my experience here, but "meh. I've experienced better" most definitely sums up my feelings. However, since that'd be quite a short review, allow me to elaborate: i found this hotel on Hotwire for the low low price of $70 a night. I have a feeling it would have been a lot more had I not booked it before there was a playoffs game scheduled the same weekend. It was worth this price, I guess, but I still wasn't pumped about my stay. First off, the hotel is really not all that convenient for public transport. We had to hoof it to Clark and Lake to catch most all of the trains. In the Spring/Summer/Fall that would be OK, but in Winter it just meant we took a lot of cabs. Suddenly the $70 room got a lot more expensive. Second, our room was TINY! The walls were paper thin, so we could hear every frickin conversation in the room next door. And they were boring conversations. The bathroom is right off the bed, and is only separated by a sliding glass door. Sometimes when two people are sharing a room they don't want the other person to hear your bathroom noises. This was impossible in our room. I tried to turn on the sink to disguise them, but the water pressure is so low that wasn't much of a help. Still, the room was clean and had a fantastic view. I have no MAJOR complaints about this hotel, but still, it's probably been my least enjoyable hotel stay in Chicago.
