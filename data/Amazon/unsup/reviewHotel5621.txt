It's a Westin. The basics extremely nicely done, with no unnecessary frills. Great service. The room service burger and salad had a ridiculous amount of onion on it though, as if onions were going to go extinct tomorrow. I love onions usually, but there was probably a whole onion between the salad and the burger. Bizarre.
