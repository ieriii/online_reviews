This is a good place for single men or a brief stay. We were there for 1 week... Too long for this room.  The bed dominates the room. There is nowhere else to sit to watch tv(which malfunctioned) or even sit and relax. There is minimal closet space and the only drawers are in 1 bedside table.  The bathroom is functional, but small. In order to appear larger, the shower is totally glass... Open to the bed area, they do provide a curtain, but the entire bathroom is visible to the bedroom if you forget to close it. (every day, as the maids must be instructed to open it daily). There are limited bathtubs in the hotel. Don't count on getting one.The hotel has a modern euro feel to it, but the staff is either unconcerned or clueless. The exception was the doormen, they were helpful and pleasant.  We were there for the weekend nights and the hotel turns into a party... Great if you don't want to sleep. We could hear the music from the bar as well as people yelling and running in the halls. We don't plan on going back.
