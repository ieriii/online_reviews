This may very well be the McDonald's of hotels, but staying here is like getting your happy meal from Ronald McDonald himself and finding an extra McNugget! I pricelined a room for 90 bucks for relatives coming to town. Like a reviewer below, we checked in using the handy self check-in machine and little did I know I would end up in a 3rd floor room looking straight at an air-vent covered roof. I think it was a janitor's closet or an excess furniture storage facility. The room had no light, no wallpaper, high, water-spotted ceilings, and the furniture was crammed any way it would fit. No good, I said. I made a quick call to get a room change and ended movin' on up to the east side- literally. I was given a new room on the 29th floor with a dazzling view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. The front desk clerk who gave me my new keys, Moji, couldn't have been more pleasant. Plus, the Hyatt is perfect for out of town guests as it equidistant between Millennium Park and the Mag Mile. Hurray for the Hyatt!
