Typical Marriott in a fairly good location near the UIC campus and the medical district. Driven towards the business traveler. Has a decent restaurant and bar area, although hardly warm or comfortable - more get-in and get-out. Starbucks service at the bar. Most of the rooms seemed to have nice street views - above average for a hotel. Getting there is a bit of a problem if not by car. Local nearby bus stop is the best choice - the metro is good half mile from the hotel. Walking from the hotel to the waterfront is a trek and is possible during the day - I wouldn't recommend at night.
