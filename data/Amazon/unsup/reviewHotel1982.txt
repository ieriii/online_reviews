This place is snazzy and jazzy. One of my favorite hotels I've stayed at. The Radisson Blu Aqua is this pillar of awesomeness that is truly splendid both outside and in. They kept the wave theme throughout. The halls/room were decorated in an offbeat sort of way that I liked, with this blaring aqua colored carpet and then half the place had these little sparkly mica bits embedded in the floor, so it was like a disco ball in the entryway. The not so good: it was very quiet until Saturday night, when there was a huge party and the people next door were ordering room service at 2am. The doors on the rooms slam inadvertently. And when they were out on the balcony I could hear them speaking even though they were not speaking loudly. In the morning, a tourist ferryboat comes by on the river with a megaphone and it sounded like he was right in my ear. And I was on the 10th floor. But if you don't sleep in this wouldn't be an issue. The noise things did not dim my appreciation of the experience much. p.s. if you are staying here while going to a conference at the Sheraton (less than 10min walk), be aware that the most direct route across the river involves 3 flights of stairs down to a lower road level. There is another bridge that doesn't involve stairs but it would add 5-10 mins to the walk.
