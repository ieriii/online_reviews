let us begin with the seven min wait for the one elevator. we get to the room and the key card will not work. the new one works after 4 or5 swipes. the a/c works great after eight hrs. if one person wishes to take a shower and the other a bath you are in luck because the tub does not drain. also if you are not sure if you should be green and use only one towel, the tremont makes this easy! They only give you one towel per person. I must say it really is in a great location and the people that work there are really nice, This place just needs lots of work.
