You know, say what you want, but this place is precious. I call it "the regular man's Four Seasons" because it's right across from The Four Seasons Chicago which means you can go to the Conservatory at TFS and put on airs if you see fit, then go back to your quaint room at The Whitehall, nobody the wiser.  But honestly, dollar for dollar, I like this hotel better because of the charm. TFS has great service, sure, but the Whitehall is the little train that could, comparatively. They try harder with less and do better. It's a different hotel. Nostalgic, quirky, comfortable, neat. The bar staff in particular rocks my world --- if Poppy is still there then management is damned lucky indeed.  Funny story about the series of shenanigans I encountered at this fine establishment but we won't go into it now, here. What I'm saying though is maybe I'm sentimental and maybe you wouldn't feel the same if what you're looking for is The Four Seasons or The Pen.  But I've been to both those and many others and quite prefer The Whitehall in the final tally. When I'm back in Chi, you'll be finding me there.
