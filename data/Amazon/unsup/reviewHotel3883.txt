Where do I start? My favorite part of this fecal hole was the pubic hair bubbling up from the slow shower drain. I also liked the mold smell wafting through the entire building. This place is seriously bad. It is in need of a wrecking ball like no building that I have seen before. Bullet point list of things that suck about this place: Red AstroTurf carpet in room with stains Mold smell 100 decibel a/c system that could not be turned off Carpeting on the wall of the elevator Plaster falling off the walls in the shower Fluorescent lighting in the bathroom Screaming drunk 12 year olds running around at 4 am This place sucks. The wife and I stayed here over labor day weekend. The one star is for the location, that is the only thing going for this place. Spend the extra 30 a night and stay somewhere else.
