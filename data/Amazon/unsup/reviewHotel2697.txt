Stayed here with friends over the weekend and was very pleased with the location and attentive staff. The rooms were a pretty good size, but despite being on the 9th floor, there was a lot of exterior noise. The only complaint about the room is that is really isn't designed to be shared (especially by 2 women): the bathroom is long and narrow with limited counter space and no lighting or outlets by the full-length mirror and no mirror at all in the bedroom, which makes concurrent getting ready very difficult. They have a nightly turn-down service and give you a little treat from the restaurant downstairs (e.g. a small cookie), which is a nice touch. Valet parking is very expensive ($48/day), but it does give you in & out privileges. The concierge was very helpful when we asked for bar/club recommendations and gave us front-of-the-line/no cover passes for our entire group to some near-by trendy places (think the cover at one of those places was actually like $20, so definitely worth asking for!).
