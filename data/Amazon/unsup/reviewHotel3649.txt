High Tea at The Drake - what a great way to spend a chilly Chicago afternoon. I haven't been to tea at The Drake in 10 years and not much has changed--the service is still warm and attentive, the tea sandwiches are still yum-yummy and the pastries are still delish. Now that I'm all growed up, though, I think I would actually rather have another round of sandwiches than any pastries at all--they stole the show for me, especially the little guy with asparagus. I must remember to include asparagus in more of my sandwich creations!  I think I would take off half a star for the whipped cream with the scones--from a can, Drake? Really? I expect more from you. Even I make my own homemade whipped cream and it doesn't take much. But alas, the little asparagus sandwich silences any complaints and the soothing harp lilting in the background makes any conversation or group of rapscallions seem more civilized. Even though I'm pretty sure I was the only rapscallion there. ;) Wear your pearls or wear neat jeans (or both), practice pinkies up and enjoy a pampered afternoon of quiet service and tasty treats. I will be back--hopefully before another 10 years roll around.
