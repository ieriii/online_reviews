I've never stayed here. However, I interviewed the General Manager as part of a research project I was working on. I was so incredibly impressed by the staff's professionalism and staff, but even more impressed by the general manager himself. One of his quotes basically said that he's not only in the business of retaining the old memories, but also continuing to make memories (the actual quote is much better stated, but I don't have it on me at the moment). His view of cutting-edge technology (he's in favor of it) was surprising to me. But his friendliness and willingness to give me his time was even more impressive. The hotel definitely has a historic, English grandmother's-attic aesthetic. According to the interview, he's in favor of maintaining the historic feel and look of the Drake, but also wants to stay modern and relevant.
