I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent at this hotel. Three nights here and no qualms whatsoever. Awesome location. Within walking distance of Navy Pier, The John Hancock Center, and fabulous Michigan Avenue shopping. If you need to go anywhere else, ask the doorman (who's UNBELIEVABLY attractive) to hail you a taxi. Cool looking lobby with a bar. Adjacent Einstein's Bagels. Excellent staff who make sure you're feeling welcome. Cookies at check in - delicious ones at that. The front desk people here are great. Really friendly and took care of my stupidity of placing my roomkey next to my credit cards and BlackBerry. Very clean, with cute rooms that are decorated nicely. Super comfy beds! And the thing that I judge any hotel by...the water pressure for the shower was unparalleled. This hotel is a winner.
