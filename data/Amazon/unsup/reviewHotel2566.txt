Victor is always having different events and different crowds. I wouldn't recommend showing up at random. They do get some really great events and promotions though and the space is beautiful. When you do go, just make sure you get your drinks from the guy bartenders. Much like other venues and clubs, Victor like to put cute girls behind the bar that look good but give really slow service. Last time I was there there were two guys and a pretty blonde. The blonde wasn't "bad" so to speak, but the guy bartenders were clearly faster. At least the owners are smart enough to have just one cute slow chick instead of an entire staff of them. Usually parking on the street isn't to hard to find, however they do offer valet service on the busy nights that I have been there.
