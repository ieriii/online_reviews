I stayed here literally every other week for practically a year before i moved to Chicago permanently in April of 07. Its new renovations reveal the true beauty of this architectural masterpiece. The building has great history and excellent service. kind of a pricey place to stay, but hey when its on the companies charge card, go for it !
