Service. It is truly what sets apart the Ritz chain of hotels from other hotels. You see it in the smallest ways. The front desk clerk coming from behind the counter to personally hand you your key. The doorman who runs back to your valet parked car to grab a bag you forgot and then brings it to the meeting room you are in. The staff cleaning the public restrooms who greets you when you enter and says good bye when you leave. All small gestures . . . .but gestures that don't go unnoticed. The rooms are not as opulent as they might have once seemed as other chains have picked up their game but they are nice. Oh sure, the rooms are over sized, and have a bed with the best pillows, linens and duvets but they don't feel "over the top" as I used to think Ritz hotels were. The bathrooms are adorned with marble and feature L'Occitane products which are always appreciated. And the deep tub is always welcome in a world of hotel rooms that is quickly becoming a "shower nation". Internet is free and there is a small mini bar in the room. What was missing for me, though, was coffee in the room. I know I could call and have a pot delivered to me, but i just wanted to slurp down a cup without all the hassle of getting dressed, etc. Many of the meeting rooms have terrific views of the lake and of the city. Even the staff that work the private banquet functions are super friendly and nice, helping to do whatever you need even before you know that you need it. So I'll end as I began. At the Ritz, it's all about the service. And while that model has been copied by many of the high end resorts that I have the privilege to visit, it is still evident in everything that they do here. And that is much appreciated by this "road weary" traveler!
