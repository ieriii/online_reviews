I think place was overpriced for what I got in return. I felt that the registration counter people were not helpful and not very polite. They failed to mention that the gym cost $18 a day when I called to confirm that they had one. The Starbucks inside the hotel was over priced. It took over 24 hours for them to bring us a cork screw that was requested. They failed to mention that in room Internet was free because of the conference that we were in town for. Be warn the lowest Internet package was $15. The beds were on the small side for full/queen and small sized rooms if you have more than two people staying in the room. I liked the location of the hotel and their maid staff was very friendly but bases that I think I look into another hotel next time I visit.
