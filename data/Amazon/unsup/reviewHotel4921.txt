I had a wonderful time here. This is exactly how traditional afternoon tea should be. The attention to detail was superb, the tea, the fine china, the lovely sweets and clotted cream...everything was top notch. The harpist was elegant with a soothing repertoire. She was an amazing musician. In a city full of slick lounges, the old world charm at the Drake is a special treat.If you are a local, and not staying at the hotel, I would highly recommend having the valet park your car. It is reasonably priced. Besides, who wants to deal with parking blocks away when all you want to do is relax and enjoy your afternoon tea?My only critique is that the air seemed a bit stuffy, perhaps air circulation is not the greatest in the hotel? Old HVAC?Overall, I highly recommend it.
