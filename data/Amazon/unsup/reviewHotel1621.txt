A dump. Stayed here for way too much over the marathon weekend. Paint peeling in the bathroom, unfinished elevators/lots of waiting time, dark and unimpressive lobby. Really cheesy furnishings too in the rooms: leopard chaises?? If you can get a good deal and need a good location fine, but don't go for quality.
