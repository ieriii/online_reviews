Don't be fooled by the photos on Expedia or http://Hotels.com. They are experts at Photoshop.  Debbie Downers: 1)The room was extremely small 2)They had an odd odor ( as if it wasn't cleaned properly). 3) The bed was uncomfortable and linens needed to be replaced 4) Nice sink but why didn't they replace the shower head 5) Bad water pressure. Yay: 1) Lady who checked me in was very nice. 2) Opening wine welcoming is a nice touch. 3) Historical building converted into hotel.
