I loved this location... It was prime. I always love being in Chicago, but the smaller hotels are usually easier accessible to the busy spots. The decor was beachy, very non-urban, but I liked it as it gave me ideas for my Miami condo which I'm redecorating! (go figure, get the idea from chicago) The poorest possible thing was the front desk.... One guy, sweet but not quick at all was manning a manic line of check ins... There was a sign for IHG Elite members but nobody was there to work it... I liked my place there, especially the awesome upgrade to a suite, made a huge difference... Loved the chic Indigo vibe... Pricing was average.
