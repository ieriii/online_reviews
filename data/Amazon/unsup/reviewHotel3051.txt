As far as W's go this hotel is nice. Most W's are old hotels that they "renovated" with purple lights, techno music, and a giant W. The hotel feels like a real W. Try to get a room with a view of the lake. The room service is also very good and if you have status you'll get a nice box of white chocolate whoppers. WARNING - For business travelers there's a very long line to get a cab. It can take as long as 45 minutes so make sure to plan accordingly.
