We had our wedding here. I loved it. The venue was fantastic and our coordinator was great. All of our guests were impressed with everything. The food was fantastic, the timing was great for everything, and the dancefloor was unforgetable. All of the guests at the hotel seemed happy with their rooms. I would recommend this venue to others.
