Pretty Please...More..more..more!!! I decided to take my cousin and a friend from out of state for a little R&R as a bridal gift...A massage was my mission. The prices are unbelievable! A 50 minute massage for $90.00 in a "Spa" like atmosphere. This wasn't a place with a room and you're in and out. We felt like queens for a few hours. We had comfy slippers, fluffy robes, a great steam before and after the massage. The most relaxing "Relaxation Room" with calming music and water. Even shampoo and blow-dyers to get all pretty afterwards. The best part: we bought online gift certificates for $100.00 and got $25.00 Free! So actually 3 massages was only $78.00 each. Even Better!!! You can get the certificates on their web site. Now, details of the most amazing massage. First off, the Bed was heated. Nothing better than that in my opinion. My therapist was amazing. She hit all the right spots, massaged my hand and head too. After each body part was massaged, she would lay hot towels on my skin!! I was in HEAVEN. I've been to the the four seasons and top end spas, but had a hefty price tag and paid $150.00 per massage..Now, I have the secret. Great Deal, Great Spa and Relaxed all for $90 plus tip!
