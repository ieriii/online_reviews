Stayed with a friend here this winter. I loved the HUGE Christmas tree in the lobby! So beautiful! The bedroom was a little small, but the bed was super comfy, and the bathroom was spacious. Great closet space, and you can't complain about the view of the lake! :-) (Granted it was like -20 outside!) I wouldn't mind coming back to stay here :-)
