The Allegro is always a nice stay. Love that they are pet friendly, love the Tootsie Rolls at check in and the wine reception is a nice bonus if you are game for a complimentary drink. We've stayed here for many years and have never had any problem. We usually get one of the smaller rooms, but since we are out and about so much it's perfect. This last time we had cocktails and then appetizers and drinks later on in the lounge, and the bar service was professional and spot on. The room prices are reasonable and it's only a few blocks to great shopping or Daley Plaza. If you are in the Kimpton rewards program, wi-fi is free.
