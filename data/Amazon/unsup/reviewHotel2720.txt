I would move in if they'd let me (and only charge me as much as I currently pay in rent, because I'm cheap). Seriously -- very comfortable and luxe. And quiet, amazing considering its location in a busy part of town. I didn't order room service (for budget travelers who book into this place on a discount, there's a Trader Joe's across the street to get cheap snacks), but the menu looked mighty impressive.
