It's a great location and the staff is VERY helpful. Easy to get a cab and an excellent restaurant next door ...... also with helpful and freindly staff. About a $5 cab ride to McCormick Place Convention Center. My only complaint about the hotel is the Internet connectivity......it sucks. Best Western needs to work on that issue. Can't say enough good things about Chicago. I'll be back!
