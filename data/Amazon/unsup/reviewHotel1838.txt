Quick Thoughts: - lobby is one of the best W lobby's anywhere if you're into that sort of thing...hotel bar as expected is solid - bed fell short of W standards and sucked compared to the average Westin bed - typical W gym - small, but does the trick (towels in the fridge is a great call) - internet speed in the room was great (based on wireless - they have both wireless and wired) is 1Mb/s down and .26 Mb/s up - billing was annoying given the ridiculous deposit - 40 SPG stays in the past 2 years and this was the 1st time I've had a hassle - staff is great - from room service to check in The W is 4 stars compared to most other hotels, but 3 stars compared to the better hotels I've stayed in the Chitown (Conrad, Blackstone, etc...).
