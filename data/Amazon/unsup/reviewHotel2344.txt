Wonderfully located to all of the Magnificent Mile shopping and dining, as well as the Rush ST entertainment district. Easy access to Lake Shore DR or I-94 and the Loop as well. The valet and bellhops work hard to get you in and out of your car which can be tricky since they only have one lane in their pull-in area. Yeah, the $48 valet parking is pretty steep, and there are lots of garages nearby, but come on, this is downtown Chicago parking is a bigger bear than those guys playing down at Soldier Field, you may end up spending less with the valet if you want in and out privileges. The lobby is gorgeous. Contemporary without feeling cold. Elevators (at least the high rise ones) are fast and efficient. Every staff person I came in contact with was courteous and professional. The rooms aren't huge, but large enough. Comfy beds. Shower had great water pressure (pet peeve of mine).  Here's a tip...if you want a great view high up request a feather free bedding room. We were on the 39th floor on the Michigan AVE side which gave us gorgeous views of the Mag Mile skyline.
