What a cute, stylish eco-hotel! It's conveniently located in the heart of Chicago. My friends Sage J. and Andy just moved here and Andy booked us a hotel at hotel Felix.  The rooms are small which is typical for big cities. It's slightly smaller than the Club Quarters in San Francisco. However the place is clean, the employees are friendly and it's located in a prime location. I love that it's within walking distance to my favorite grocery store "Whole Foods". This is a really special hotel that caters to the business traveler and the young & hip. (but not the douchey trendy hipster kind) Lots of bars and shopping nearby. Internet is free, but it's very slow. There is no coffee maker and no luggage rack in the room, but overall a good experience.
