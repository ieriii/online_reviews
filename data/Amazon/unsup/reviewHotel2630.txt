We managed to finally get a few days off, and after some browsing and checking other user reviews, we decided for the James. One of the main attraction is the location. It's perfectly central, 100m from Michigan av, and a few mn away from some excellent places to have dinner, or even breakfast/brunch/lunch. Central location means also easy access to most attractions in Chicago. So going back to food, we took advice most times from the concierge, who each time gave us an excellent address depending on what we wanted to eat. The bedroom itself is very good. It took us a bit of time to get use to the switches for the lights which were not always located at the right spot. Also wifi was very very slow. But for the rest it was as needed. Comfortable bed, small bathroom with all amenities (and good quality soaps etc.), and when coming back in the evening late, there was always a little cookie on the bed to welcome us :-)
