This is the best hotel in Chicago. I've stayed at the Park Hyatt, the Peninsula, the Drake, the Westin - and this by far my favorite. Part of the "Small Luxury Hotels of the World" group, the Talbott fits the luxury bill without draining the wallet. Centrally located in the Gold Cost (close to my office, Equinox, Exhale, restaurants and shopping) and across the street from some of the best cupcakes in Chicago at More, the Talbott has beautifully appointed rooms, and a staff that makes you feel at home while traveling (Robert and Stacy are wonderful). There are no words to describe how comfortable the beds are at this hotel, and I'm a huge fan of the Molton Brown toiletries they provide. It's also great that they offer a free guest pass for workouts at the Equinox at 900 N. Michigan Ave right around the corner. The Talbott is not only my favorite hotel in Chicago, but one of the best hotels in the US that I have experienced. You definitely will not be sorry if you make this your home in Chicago.
