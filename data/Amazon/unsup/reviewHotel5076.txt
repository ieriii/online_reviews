Do not ever host an event there!  Rude management, no professionalism, not very customer service friendly at all.  Attended a fundraising event there and the little "worker" or whomever he was literally told everyone to stop what they were doing and get out., no tact whatsoever. I guess they wanted to be ready for their regular rowdy crowd in. They're not accustomed to servicing a higher class of people but I'm sure they don't care, as long as they get these poor unsuspecting fools money. Thumbs down.
