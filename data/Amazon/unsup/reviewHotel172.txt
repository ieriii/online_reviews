It all goes downhill once you get past the friendly doormen.  If I knew then what I know now, I'd take my business elsewhere both for the room and the drinks. The location is good and the rooms are clean, but that's all the praise I can muster. Chicago is a huge city with tons of great bars and hotels. These days you don't have to sacrifice service for a buck.
