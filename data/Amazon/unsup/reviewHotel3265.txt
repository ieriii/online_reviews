3.5 stars Like many others have mentioned, I too secured my stay at the Hard Rock Hotel after stumbling across a knockout rate. For the location, I found very few other options in the same price range. I arrived at the hotel several hours before check in time, but the concierge happily stored my bags went out for a few hours. I utilized the service again after check out. Overall the service from both the front desk and the concierge station were dripping with eagerness, but the competency level was a bit lacking. The lines at the front desk were frustratingly slow whether one employee or three were behind the counter. The room is what made the hotel for me. It was huge, and by my standards, could have been two save for the single bathroom. I took showers while relishing a view of Millennium Park. I chased indulgent nights away with coffee from the Keurig maker. I fell asleep in the comfy bed while watching the oversized TV. Some small complaints I had included the previously mentioned, slow as molasses front desk. Also, the bed was stacked with all down pillows. I hate that so much. Seriously, a girl needs a little support sometimes. And well, I might be reaching here, but this one puzzled me: The room was stocked with more varieties of decaf coffee than caffeinated. It was a good thing my roommate didn't drink coffee, or there might have been an epic morning battle over the second cup. All in all, a good place to rest my weary mind and wobbly body after long days spent eating, drinking, exploring, and indulging my inner tourist.
