-1 star for no mini bar or mini fridge in the room. The BEST part about staying in a hotel room (other than having your bed made for you) is raping the mini bar!! -1 star for no wireless internet in the room. I will not be subjected to sitting stationary at a desk when there is a perfectly good bed from which to surf the net from. A lot of business people stay here and it is 2010...get with it Hilton! -1 star for no airport shuttle! Total bummer, and less expensive establishments general provide this service! Other than those major complaints, this hotel is GORGEOUS! The reception/bar area is decorated classically. The rooms were large, clean, and didn't make you feel like you were sleeping in a hotel straight out of the 80s and the hotel is in a great location very close to Millennium Park! For some reason it was hard to get a hold of the concierge and I was put on hold more than once for longer than I deem appropriate at such a hotel. Twice I even hung up and called back and got an answering machine rather than a real person! Me thinks they need to hire more staff! I also requested that a wireless internet bridge be delivered to my room when one became available; a request that was ignored and never followed up on to explain whether there was availability or not. Boo for customer service. On the plus side there is a full service Starbucks on the ground floor which saved my life - twice! However, next time I'm in town, I'll most likely be staying elsewhere...
