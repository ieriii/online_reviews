I'm giving this W three stars for their stellar service only! Otherwise...bleh... I will echo the sentiments of other yelpers. Walking into the lobby, you're faced with the familiar look and feel of the W chain but upon closer inspection, the hotel appeared run down and not up to par for the brand. Rushed renovation or bad maintenance? As I mentioned before, the customer service here is excellent!. As was the food in the restaurant. I think it's called Wave. Anyhow, the staff at Bliss were also very nice and extremely accommodating. I would stay here again just for that. On the flip-side, who would want to stay in a nice hotel with bad service? A plus is the location and view of Lake Michigan. I just hope they spruce up a bit if I ever return.
