This is my review for the SPA at Dana i came here recently for a massage with Katrina (i'm pretty sure that was her name) and a facial with .. can't remember.  The massage was AMAZING. I had an 80 min swedish massage- but she used all techniques and really customized it towards my needs. She was very friendly and talkative when I met her, but knew when to stop talking when the massage began (thank God! nothing worse than a masseuse talking too much) i have a really bad back and she really used deep pressure on those areas and wasnt afraid to get in there and work it lol. the facial was reallly good too.. i got a customized 50 min facial with microdermabrasion.. it was my first time so the lady really educated me on everything.. she was talking a whole lot at first but i guess she kinda had to so i knew what was going on.. but then she let me relax so that was nice. she gave a small massage on my neck and head-- it was really bad and pointless-- something she should work on-- no pressure at all... the Amenities SUCKED. a tiny little steam room in the locker room- seats 2 people.. and 2 showers... the relaxation lounge was a tiny room for 4-5 people to sit... no snacks... but the kiwi-strawberry water was good. all in all, if u really are in need of a good massage and dont care for amenities, then u should come see Katrina... but if u want amenities and basically stuff that you're paying for... go to a diff med spa..
