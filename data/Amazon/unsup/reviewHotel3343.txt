I truly enjoyed this hotel and will be returning when I am back in Chicago. I came here during the NATO conference/protest and it was all smooth sailing. Great location, great staff, cool rooms and an incredible pool. CONS: you can't really control the room temperature and there's a smalllll bathroom. PROS: everything else. the pool was a great highlight -- a deep end, a greenhouse like atmosphere, friendly guards, etc... big beds, great location, affordable, great east around, etc... I'll be back.
