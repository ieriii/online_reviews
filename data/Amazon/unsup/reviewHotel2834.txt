I loved my stay in this hotel. Check-in took too long, but was worth it. That's because the friendly staff member worked hard to find me a great room, and found a way to get me free wireless during my stay. Good start! On the other hand, the first (well-earned) cocktail i had was a $14 disaster. A martini in a (not-cold) wine glass! Come on. Despite really enjoying my time in this hotel, i'll get the negative out of the way first - mediocre overpriced restaurant. LOUSY lattes in the coffee shop. The room was small, but clean. Nice furniture. Nice view. Good location. Just enough removed from the Magnificent Mile that it wasn't loud at night. A perfect spot for watching the lights of the skyscrapers and reflections on the river. Easy walk to the L. Easy walks or cabs to about any restaurant in town. I took an warm afternoon stroll through Navy Pier. On the river boat Chicago architecture tour, i learned that the Sheraton i was staying in was designed to look like a cruise ship. Finally... it all made sense. In fact, i was proudly staying at one of the structures featured by the narrator during the super-informative, beautiful look at the city. (Maybe i should be reviewing that.) I stayed here over St. Patrick's Day weekend. I couldn't believe that i was able to select what type of view i got (especially since i booked my room Shattner-style - bidding on Priceline... woo hoo - did i get a bargain!). I got lucky with the river-view, that just happened to include a front-row view of when they turned the river bright green. That, and the 80 degree weather, made for a particularly upbeat end to a quick business trip. Great Irish pub next door on the riverfront. Great riverwalk/river-jog location!  I noticed there is a liquor store one block away, so there is a solution to the lousy drink. And a Starbucks graces the entry of a grocery store that is only about two blocks away. As you can see, i recommend staying here.
