from 4 to 3. My second stay featured incredibly loud air conditioning going on and off all night. Also, the room was a little warm. I woke up in the middle of the night and stumbled in a half drunken, half hungover state to turn the temp down and it was locked at it's lowest point - 65 - and I was still sweating. Not an awful experience, but not as good as the first.
