Ken B. said it best: "I give it 5 stars not based on luxury hotel standards, but based on the money I spent per night and damn right, it gets five shiny stars." We stayed at the Allerton on a holiday weekend and got an amazing deal on Hotwire. (I paid more per night to stay in a dingy motel in Santa Monica, but that is an entirely different review.) I read the Yelp reviews before I came and was bracing for the worst-mainly that I would be sleeping in a closet, but I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed in the Standard room, which I think is their smallest room. It has a full sized bed, and a tiny bathroom (so two people can't get ready at once) but was otherwise spacious and clean. The fitness center was also well equipped with new treadmills, ellipticals, weights and a TVs on all the equipment. The location is also in the middle of everything. A stay at the Four Seasons it is not, but for the price, it really can't be beat. All in all, I think this is a great boutique hotel that has been renovated quite nicely and I would definitely stay here again. I am taking away one star because of two things: 1) the elevators are the SLOWEST most awful elevators ever. I know this is beyond management's control since it is an old building and they probably had to work with the existing framework, but OH MY GOD. Don't stay here if you anticipate being in a hurry at any point during your stay. Or stay on a floor you can walk up to; 2) the tv channel selection is really limited.
