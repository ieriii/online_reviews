The location of this hotel is great if you want to be in the heart of downtown Chicago! It's close to pretty much everything! We also got a great deal, a single king-sized bed room for $89/night. The hotel itself, was gorgeous-the lobby ceiling was breath-taking! The one con with the hotel was that the room was TINY. It's the smallest hotel room I've ever been in! But I guess being in the City, you're not going to spending much time in the room anyways.
