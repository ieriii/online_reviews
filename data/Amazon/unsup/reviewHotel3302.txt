I stayed in the tower suite for the weekend of my birthday (Fri. 1/20-Sun. 1/22). The suite is fabulous and affordable. It's a one bedroom with the living area in the front and bedroom in the rear. There are plenty of windows which give you a view of Millennium Park from the living room. One of the best things about the Hard Rock is that most of the staff are music fans so they are laid back and lots of fun. In particular, Demetrius (DT), who served as a bell hop, bouncer and all around friendly face/host really made us feel welcomed by remembering our names and checking to ensure that we had what we needed. While there, I received a great bottle of wine the first night, turn down service, a comp drink at the bar and free pool games and music in the lobby. I highly recommend that Hard Rock Hotel if you are looking for a comfortable, friendly place to stay where music and enjoying life are the vibe and lifestyle.
