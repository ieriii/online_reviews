I've stayed here about 10 times over the last few months, and will continue to stay here. The hotel is a bit outside of the loop, and it can be difficult to catch a cab occasionally in the morning. Great on-site fitness center, with multiple nice machines, 2 treadmills, a bike, a stair stepper and a small selection of free weights. The staff is friendly, although I've had very little interaction with them other than check-in/check-out. Rooms are clean to an 8/10 - some mildew spots on the ceiling of my shower last night and there are little details here and there that should be tended to, but good overall. Would like coffee in the lobby, but that would take away from their little coffee shop at the back of the hotel. There's a Jewel-Osco grocery store around the block if you like to buy groceries (no fridge or microwave in the room though), and the CTA Red line is around the corner also if you prefer to catch the train to downtown rather than cab.
