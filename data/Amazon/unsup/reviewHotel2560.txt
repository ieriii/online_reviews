I love this spot! Only reason I don't frequent it very often, is bc I'm unsure of who is throwing the party and what kind of crowd it'll be in there. Regardless, I adore the b&w photography throughout Victor. I always see something new. My favorite part are the side rooms....it's nice to get away from the riff raff sometimes. Who am I kidding? ALWAYS! I've actually eaten at VH, I totally forgot. We got a proscuitto panini. Unfortunately, it did not come w/ fresh fruit as described....so they discounted our bill. I think they saw my reaction to the lack of fresh fruit and mumbled amongst themselves, "I think I recognize her from yelp...we'd better do something to compensate." ;-)  Another thing to note, VH serves sushi! hmmm....questionable. I also like the location...totally off the beaten path. Victor Hotel will see this face again.
