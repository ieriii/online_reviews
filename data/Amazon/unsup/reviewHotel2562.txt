The people-watching here is fantastic. The reason that there are black and white photos of boobs on the walls is because the type of men who patronize this place still get a kick out of nudity. Oh, and since they're black and white, they're artsy too. These are also the type of men who have seen "Fight Club" way too many times, put too much gel in their hair and at the conclusion of the night, after staring at the same pair of girls for hours, can only muster, "Do you guys make out?" The drinks are wonderful, and admittedly, I wonder the same thing about the girls.
