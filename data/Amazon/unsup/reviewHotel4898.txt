PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!After reading the reviews for this hotel I was soooo excited to go, so I booked this as a surprise for my husband's birthday weekend, it was horrible I think my worst decision yet....First the room looked like a box and this was the Corner King with two walls of floor to ceiling windows. The bed was a queen size I was told it was a king. The supposedly city view was us looking into other peoples apartments and them looking into ours.The plus side tho was that the spa was good but not great.However after we spent our weekend and was given our bill that we signed off on the hotel came back and charged us an additional 200 bucks in error which we are still waiting to get. A bunch of thieves if you ask me.Never again.
