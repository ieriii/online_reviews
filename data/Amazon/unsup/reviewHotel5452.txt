Great stay! Big rooms, nice bathroom, and good service. I did find it a little weird that the 'fitness suite' is nothing more than a converted room with some machines--but they have an elliptical, 2 treadmills and a few weights so it's not bad, just weird. Would definitely recommend, and would definitely stay there next time we're in Chicago.
