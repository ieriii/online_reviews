We stayed at The Whitehall this past weekend. While it could use some freshening up in the lobby etc. we found it to be a perfectly nice hotel. The staff was pleasant and efficient and the rooms were well appointed and clean.The best parts of the hotel are the lounge, which is nicely rehabbed and very charming, the beds (super comfy) and the bathrooms which have been most recently renovated. We had breakfast in the adjacent restaurant the next morning and found good service and fresh food cooked well.I give the Whitehall 4 stars primarily because of the VALUE of the place. We paid $99 on a Groupon promotion and that INCLUDED valet parking and continental breakfast. What a deal! Even without the promotion, the available rates are great for a charming old hotel on the Gold Coast. We would definitely stay there again.
