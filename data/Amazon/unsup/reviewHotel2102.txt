Lovely historical hotel. I enjoyed its location the most - right on Michigan Ave. in the heart of the bustling traffic! Oh yes, this is the city for sure. But I loved every bit of it. I also thought that the rooms were pretty comfortable, as I stayed with two of my family members. The hotel employees pretty much helped out but mostly minded their own business which is a nice gesture, as some of us want to relax after a long day out sightseeing/or shopping. Our huge fam frequented the "Michael Jordan" lounge too, as it was conveniently located right next to the lobby. In addition to that, during the mornings, we would also load up on coffee at the Starbucks that is attached to the hotel. Enjoyed my stay and would love to come back again; maybe I'll take my significant other next time! There is a possibility that we may come back sooner than later. :)
