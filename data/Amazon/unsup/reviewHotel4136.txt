What is WRONG with these people! I LOVE this hotel!... Don't try to say I don't know my hotels.... I have traveled a lot more than your average bear, in over 40 US states and at least a dozen countries. This may not be the most posh, or the most service oriented, but they give you a very good quality stay for a decent price with a TON of perks. The location is terrific. I like to take the train in from the airport, but that's just because it puts me in a city frame of mind. They have a very nice airport pickup/drop off for people who are a little more practical and less city-romantic than me. The hotel faces the Chicago river... so you can watch the drawbridges go up and down, and all the sailboats stream in and out to the lake, and yes... many rooms have a view of the lake. If you can't see the lake, then you CAN see the beautiful city lit up at night in all her glory. In the winter, a desert dweller like myself can enjoy the underground corridors. You can go to the sub levels and travel around the city for blocks.... get your nails done, go to a lounge or restaurant, or do a little shopping. If the weather isn't horrible, Michigan Ave is across the street. I could wander the area for days. The atrium lobby is spectacular... a great place to sit with your coffee and FREE WIFI
