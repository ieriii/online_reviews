Overall, we had a great stay. We enjoyed the 24 hour room service, the large and beautiful room, and the nice views of Chi-town. Our experience with the staff was incredible!! they were on top of everything, especially ensuring we were having a great weekend!! The conceirge, Tim was amazing, hands-down. He was what made our weekend incredible, by suggesting great places to visit, dine at, and truly went above and beyond to ensure our stay was top notch. The only thing that was disappointing was the noise of the doors of other hotel rooms. We were woken up both Sat and Sunday morning as early as 7am by other hotel room doors slamming closed. This was not fun, esp since we were hoping to sleep in late both mornings. Honestly, we heard every hotel door near our hotel bedroom slam closed. The insulation is horrible. And the noise level of the slamming doors was awful. We did note this to the concierge, who stated he received similar complaints from other hotel guests. So, if you're looking for a great hotel, amazing service, but the noise of slamming doors (due to poor insulation and bad architecture), this is the place.
