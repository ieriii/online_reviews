My husband and I were in town from London, UK for a wedding and stayed at the hotel through part of a very reasonably priced wedding rate. When I made the reservation online a few months prior, I noted that it was also our anniversary weekend and I would happily pay for champagne and strawberries to be delivered to our room upon arrival. At check in, the woman at the front desk wished me and my hubby a happy anniversary. It had been a few months since I had made the reservation and during that time I had gotten some rather unexpected news that I was pregnant (Btw Yelp friends, this is why I haven't Yelp'ed any restaurants lately--morning/all day sickness doesn't allow me to be very adventurous!) I thanked the woman, confided our baby news and told her that we no longer needed champagne (no point in me getting bitter with the hubs as he chugged down "our" bottle). An hour after we got to the room, there was a knock at the door and a staff member dropped off sparkling water and a bucket of (what I thought was) champagne. I sighed and briefly considered just giving the bottle back...until I looked a bit more closely. Hotel Allegro has popped a bottle of sparkling apple cider into a champagne bucket and included a hand written note congratulating me and the hubby on our anniversary and our new bambino. BEST HOTEL CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.  Although I didn't get to indulge in anything but water during the 5-6 PM wine hour, my hubby loved it. Close to all the downtown hot spots, the location of this hotel is spectacular. The only cons...small rooms and not the thickest walls in between rooms. Without a doubt, I would happily stay there again though! Absolutely amazing hotel experience with great customer service.
