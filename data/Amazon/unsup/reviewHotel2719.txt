First, the service at this hotel is superb. Friendly, helpful, and always accountable. I loved it. The hotel itself I think is a renovated office building and they did a great job attending to all of the details that come along with a renovation. The gym does not feel like its in a basement. I love the mini bar with great selections at decent sizes and prices too. Don't forget the travel sex toys! The alarm clock has an ipod dock that pops out that most people don't notice. All in all, great location, service and clean! Free wifi which is becoming standard nowadays. I was on the 15th floor and did not have much of a view but no complaints. Extremely spacious room and comfortable furniture.
