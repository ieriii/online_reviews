I indeed had sweet dreams last nite at the Doubletree Magnificent Mile. We were there for one night. It took about a minute to check in, we grabbed our delicious chocolate chip cookies and headed to our room, that was clean, spacious and lovely (lots of pillows and a great bed). We used the concierge services to book a tour and they were knowledgeable and friendly. Love the location, right in the middle of all the action and the price we got on Hotwire was very reasonable. Like others have said the parking is $41 but that is actually cheaper than many other hotels in the area. We saw signs advertising close to $60. It's downtown, to be expected. Only disappointing factor was the wifi situation. We wanted to look up some addresses but did not want to pay over $20 for decent internet speed. I was even going to go for the standard grade at $10 for 24 hours but it wouldn't let me charge it to my credit card, only the room (there was an option for it but it wouldn't activate). We stayed at another Doubletree this past week in another city and their internet was free. But that was only a minor disappointment in another wise lovely stay.
