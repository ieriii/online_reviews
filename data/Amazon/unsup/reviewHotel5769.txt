Hidden gem! We just left this hotel, and let me tell you something... we had a blast! Quiet location, convenient to Little Italy, Greek Town, United Center, Union Park, blue line and pink line are just 2 blocks away, and hotel provides a free shuttle within 1 mile radius. Front Desk, Valet, Restaurant and Housekeeping staff were awesome. For every question we had, they had an answer. Rooms were nice, fresh and most important clean. We order 625 Salad and Club Sandwich at their restaurant twice, because it was soo delicious. Parking is $30, valet only, but hey, I this is the cheapest hotel parking in Chicago. Overall, we had a great time, and we will be back for Lollapalooza. See you soon!!!
