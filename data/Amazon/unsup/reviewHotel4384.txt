Really pretty hotel! Walking in and seeing the reception/ bar area it's rather breath taking. Painted ceilings and just really pretty architecture inside. The halls to the rooms are a bit confusing as we got lost on our first go round, but all the maids in the hallways working were super friendly and directed us correctly. The room was really cute and very spacious. We had a double bed room and it also came with desk, a large comfy chair and ottoman. TV was old school CRT but no big deal. I peeked into other rooms as we would walk around the halls and some were not nearly as large and others appeared to have rooms within rooms. Bathroom was pretty standard and the tub made me feel claustrophobic without a curved shower rod. The bed was comfortable and I really liked all the decor of the hotel inside rooms and inside the halls. We had an issue with the shower and the maintenance guy came right away and we also got extra towels very quickly after requested. Concierge was super helpful and friendly and booked us our tour bus tickets online to save us 10%. Also, great people watching in the bar area. Careful though, I got caught checking someone out. http://Embarassed.com I enjoyed my brief stay here and found the location to be very convenient.
