Even though I live in Chicago, I stayed at the W Lakeshore just to get away from it all. The decor is modern, sleek and inviting. When I arrived for check-in, there was a mob in the lobby. I had made my reservations weeks in advance and was given a check in time of 3pm, yet my room was not ready until nearly 5:30! It seemed that a lot of people had the same dilemma as we all crammed together sipping complimentary tea and champagne that the staffers provided to keep us calm. In the meantime, I had a massage at the Bliss Spa on the upper floor, which was very nice. When I finally got to the room, it was nice and warm and had new-age chill-out music playing. Did I mention that this new-age chill-out music plays everywhere , 24/7 at the W? It can become more grating than calming. The room had a great view, the beds were comfy and the bathroom was cool and well stocked with Bliss spa products. Had I been staying with multiple people the shuttered window to the bathroom might not have given enough privacy. I didn't have room service because it was pretty pricey, but I guess that's the point! Overall, W is a nice, hip place to stay. One star off for the check-in flub.
