I love this place....when you first walk in I feel like I just took a vacation and went to Miami. The Interior Design of this place was well thought out and inspiring to the creative eye. I went to have drinks with some friends but ended up eating there because the small plates they offer looked so good and taste even better. The wine list they have is a little different from what one might be use to but can be considered a refreshing change.
