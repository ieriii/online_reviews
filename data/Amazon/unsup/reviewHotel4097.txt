This hotel has its pluses and minuses. For the minus; small to no counter space in the bathroom. The toilette is situated in such a manner that to flush it one must reach in an awkward manner. When the toilette seat is up, it rests agains the tissue paper. Odd. I turned the air down when I arrived and then went out for a few hours. When I got back it was still warm. Called down (difficult to do, see below) and Juan arrived, saying he wished the hotel would give us a disclaimer. Their air system is not the type that blows air into the room, and it's silent. So no white noise. But he said they'd bring me a fan right away. To call the operator, one dials zero as expected, but then one gets a stupid robot giving options; speak the name of the employee or department you wish to reach, or press zero for the operator. I already pressed zero! Odd. After an hour I had not received my fan. I pressed the one touch button on the phone for exceptional stay. I was put on hold for over five minutes and then was disconnected. I dialed again and was spoken to after a minute. She had not heard that I requested a fan. It's been almost another 30 minutes. I want to go to bed, but I want a fan. The ice machine is about 3 rooms down from mine, yet I can hear everyone getting ice. Annoying. The pluses; great location, whether one wants to go to Navy Pier, Grant Park and the museums or the Magnivicent Mile, you are right there. The rooms are nice enough and the view is great. I've been here before and will most likely have to stay here again. But if given the choice, I would prefer other places over this hotel. But then again, I'm just happy to be in Chicago and staying downtown for a change, as opposed to by the airport.
