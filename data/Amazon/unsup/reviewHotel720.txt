Westin bed = darn fine Wait Staff = darn fine Nice location, room view was what one should expect: Of another building across the way. No problems with noise in the room like other reviewers. Else = Left something to be desired. The wifi wasn't too bad, but what REALLY got my goat? No wired internet. Says there is but no. There's a cable *on the desk* in the room, which I followed back (as an ex-IT guy I like to tinker) where it goes to a box and then nothing, nada, no other cable. Lovely ruse, Starwood, thanks. Ha-ha! What a lark. I called the desk and the fellow a little too nonchalantly said "Well have you tried the Wifi instead?" Does something smell funny or is that the Chicago River? Stayed there for a medical conference of the g-friend's, she said her boss's boss professed they were very unhappy with the measly catering provided for what they thought was an exorbitant price. Room service charges were INSANE. $5 + 11% tax (ok, that's fine) plus 24% *service charge*!? We had our meals paid for top to bottom, ate at some nicer places while down there, but even in a pinch we refused to pay such inflated rates. The prices at the bar downstairs were just plain over the top, too. It cost me $19 for a beer and a shot, just a Goose Island 312 and a Ri rye. Never again. Not ever, ever, ever, ever. I would stay there again on someone else's tab or in a pinch, since it was comfy enough and we had a nice time, but the amenities and prices just didn't add up for us.
