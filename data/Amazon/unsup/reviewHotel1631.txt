Besides the location and the view, this is by far the most overrated hotel in Chicago, Our room was severely outdated and literally dirty. The window had duct tape around the edges (presumably for "insulation"). The sink & shower faucets leaked water everywhere (mold is definitely growing behind the scenes). The linens felt like sandpaper and there were no extra blankets or pillows. The closets didn't even have hangers in them. The television (they advertised flat screens) was a Zenith from the early 90's. Room service was fast, but the food was mediocre and outrageously expensive. The only thing slower than the elevators is the valet. You can expect your car 20 to 30 minutes after calling for it, despite the fact that the garage is attached to the hotel. If you're on a budget, don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a lot for very little with this hotel. There are plenty of budget hotels in the city that are much, much nicer than Hotel 71.
