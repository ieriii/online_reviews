Even though my stay at the Hotel Felix wasn't perfect, I'm still giving it five stars because I know they just had a few brand-new-hotel-kinks to work out. All in all, this place is fantastic - perfect location, close to everything, super-cool ambiance (modern and cozy), really comfortable beds, huge showers, friendly staff and good service and a big eco-friendly emphasis. Three bummers - the restaurant/bar wasn't open yet, the TV movie and check out system didn't work, and the front desk wasn't staffed on a Monday morning to call for check out. But...I'm confident these will all be remedied shortly and when they are, this will be my new favorite hotel in Chicago. Oh...and it was CHEAP! I think my grand total for one night was about $120 INCLUDING $42 valet. Totally worth it.
