Very nice facility and the location is prime. My only issue is the tiny bathroom, but for two days I can deal with it.  My first impression was the outstanding level of customer service given by the staff. I have never been thanked so much in my life. The bed is comfortable with a soft fluffy comforter and lots of pillows. My 31st floor view was fantastic. I happened to have been there for a business meeting which took place on the premises. I have to say the food that was served was outstanding. I would definitely stay there again.
