I'll keep this one short- decent hotel with a great location. The prices are reasonable for a hotel right off the magnificent mile, and our room had been recently renovated, but was a bit on the small side. The elevator was older and slow, but did the job. The staff was friendly. Its definitely worth considering again for a trip.
