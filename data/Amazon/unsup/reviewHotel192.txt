This place gets 5 stars for one reason, and one reason alone. It was at this hotel that I saw my first topless woman. When I was a young kid, my family stayed at this hotel for a weekend. It was known as the Guest Suites back then. I vividly remember being at the pool on the top floor and looking out the window across the way to the condos across the street. Sure enough there she was, a topless 30 something (or at least that's what my 9 year old mind though), walking around in a thong. Oh man. I'm sad to report that they no longer have the black and white tvs in the bathroom that I used to think were so pimp, and that the parking is ridiculous ($50 a night, park at the self park at the Hancock across the street and save $20), but the rooms are huge, and the views are stunning. All in all a solid hotel, in a great location if you don't care about access to the el. Sadly no topless women this time.
