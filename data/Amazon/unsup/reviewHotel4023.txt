We stayed here for 2011 Thanksgiving and really enjoyed our stay. When reading some of the reviews you have to be sure to check the date. The hotel has been remodeled and are still planning to remodel other parts of the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to check in. We asked if we could have a city view and were granted it with no extra charge. Our room felt modern and updated. The bathroom was really cool and I loved the lighting. I'm a nurse so I know all the nasty germs lurking around hotels. I am really creeped out when I see other people's hair in the shower or around the toilet. I never once saw someone else's hair! The cleaning staff is great. They cleaned our room, made the bed, replaced our towels and straighted up each day! Nothing ever went missing from our room either. Plus, at alot of hotels the cleaning staff is loud and will barge in even if you have a privacy sign on the door. Nope, not here at the Hyatt. We never heard them cleaning other rooms and they never disturbed us when we had the sign on the door. Kudos! As for location...it was perfect for us! We took the train alot to other parts of the city like out to White Sox Stadium, China town and other parts of the city. Just a few blocks away, you can catch the Red line for $2.25 a ride. Thats much cheaper than a cab! Michigan ave is right up the block too. If you are needing snacks/drinks for your stay there is a grocery store 1 block away. Go out of the side door by the computers and the bistro. Go out those doors, take a left after you walk down the stairs and the store is right down the way. We stocked up on water and crackers to avoid the high prices at the hotel. We would certainly recommend staying at the Hyatt in Chicago!
