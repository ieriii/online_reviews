overall a nice hotel. lots of pros, lots of cons, and for the price, not what i expected our first time in Chitown.Cons- y on earth did they not tell us about happy hour? i mean i told them i was new, tell me what u have to offer. i called downstairs 3x and no one answered my call, i had to go downstairs and the lady told me "we must have been busy" really? upon checkin, i showed up at about 10pm, and was first told that because i was late i got moved out of my delux king and into a twin queen bed room? i told him sternly me and my fiance are not staying in a queen double bed, next thing u know there was a "cancellation" and i could get the room, cmon now im in sales i know that line. the TV is small, not alot of channels, the delay absolutely sux, and i have to raise my arm like an antenna to change the channel. there were cookies on the desk, cant have em unless u get charged 5 or 6 bucks, i mean cmon? water bottle? 7$! and this is not even mentioning the fridge. one of the highest priced hotels, and a small deluxe room, just expected more i guess. Y dont they take our bags to our rooms i mean they will probably get tipped....ANd the worst thing of all, i waS trying heating up food, but no MICROWAVE!! r u kidding??PROS- double shower head is great. finally a comfy bed. i mean extremely soft and comfortable with great pillows. cont. breakfast on each floor is a nice touch. the door guys are extremely nice. Pius, Rafi, Hi :) . liked the robes as well. really nice location as well. semi nice view, if ur higher than the 10th floor. will try another hotel next time.
