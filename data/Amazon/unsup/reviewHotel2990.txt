Amazing views and location. The room was nice, though the shutters in the bathroom over doors were a little strange for sharing the room with someone. The valet was $55, so factor that into your price. The concierge and front desk staff, like other W hotels, seem to be hired for coolness and not necessarily knowledge and friendliness, but they at least tried to help somewhat.  You can't be the location or the views though, and it's a clean and updated hotel with excellent amenities. Also, the Whiskey Bar has a fantastic view.
