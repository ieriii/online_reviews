This hotel is in a pretty good downtown location, giving you central access to Michigan Avenue or more shops on State street. Lobby was nice and inviting, though a bit of confusion set in as it looked like they share an entrance with Club Quarters. The room I was in, while pretty nice (modern touch), was really narrow. A "river view" can be a bit misleading - the one I had was more of a partial river view, with an in-your-face view of Trump tower. The windows are operable which was surprising. The bathroom is a bit tiny and only has a stand-alone shower.
