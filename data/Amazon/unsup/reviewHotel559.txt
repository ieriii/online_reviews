There was this big event during the weekend of my stay so the place was packed. The staff was friendly and nice. The restaurant downstairs had great food and divine desserts, and very good coffee. There was a bar that was quite full the whole period of my stay and a decent selection of wine. I love the room decor and I had a nice view out my window as well. The bathroom was teeny tiny but it was adequate for one person. The room itself was spacious enough and uncluttered, just the way I like it. I think the location is wonderful, the general area was pretty safe. I'd say that the main negative for me was the noise level from outside the room during the day (while cleaning? not sure) but it was fairly quiet at night.
