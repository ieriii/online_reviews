I agree with Tobey. First few weeks of going when it first opened the staff was friendlier. The last two times the door guy was very cocky! Yes, you have the power mighty door guy! Its not that serious of a lounge for the door guy to act like the secret service. aside from this however, i still prefer this lounge over a club so if you want to hang out with a friend after dinner and not pay to get in, this is a nice place. The sushi is pretty good and the bar tender that use to work at fulton lounge is swift on her feet. never leaves you dry! So overall, go there early, plenty of parking, no cover charge, the music is pretty good and you can have a decent conversation without going deaf...the price for a glass of wine is acceptable for the glass size and they do have very good wine selections....their mango rolls are very very good! Also, I like that they take pictures of their guests for their website and they actually post them. unlike other places they edit their pictures. I must add, short people be warned, this place attracts tall model like people, if you dont like to feel clusterphobic then dont stay too long, or you'll have drunk giant women stumbeling on you as they dance to lounge music.  (hee hee) it is entertaining though... oh yeah, hurray for this place, no more frat boys! well, we'll wait a couple more months, you'll be seeing them come in with their flip flops.
