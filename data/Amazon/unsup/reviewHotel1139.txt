I've stayed in quite a few downtown Chicago hotels in the loop and River North -- and this is by far the nicest experience we've ever had. The service was impeccable, the rooms were beautiful and the bathrooms were gorgeous. Everything was spotless and extremely well maintained. We'll definitely be back. Well done, Fairmont.
