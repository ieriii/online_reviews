From my countless stays here- relaxing in my all time favorite Tranquil Suites, to being transformed into pure bliss at the spa, to the best times here posted up at Aja's bar to rant with Justin and team to always being blown away with the over the top events & spectacular city views up at Vertigo Sky Lounge - Dana Hotel Resort & Spa is even better defined by their team of unforgettable and legendary people..From the street to my favorite faces checking in & concierge rock stars, to bar staff to the masterminds in sales (Maureen) and events (Sandi), to their always evolving food & bar menus (Aerial & Matt) to HR (Kristen) responsible for keeping this team together. Thank you! All of you out there are missing a time of your life here in Chicago if you do not stay, spa, unwind, attend or plan an event at Dana Hotel Resort & Spa!!!!
