All new hotel. Our room had an amazing floor that reflected the light like tiny stars. Our room had extra wide doors ( for wheelchairs) and the bathwas probably also equiped for handicapt people. The consequence was that the shower was difficult to use standing in such a large wide bathtub.I'm sorry to say that the bar next to the lobby looked more like a cold/clean/white cantine or mess than like  bar.The staff was very friendly and the concierge(s) were very profesionnal and well informed about their city.Ask the frontdoor guys where to go for breakfast. They know their stuff.
