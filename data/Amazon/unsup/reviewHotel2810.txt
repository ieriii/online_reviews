For a guys' weekend this is a great choice. You have plenty of room, you have a sleeping area that can be closed out from the sitting area that has your minbar area and flat screen tv, you have your complimentary buffet breakfast with made-to-order eggs/omelette station, you have your complimentary manager's reception of drinks and snacks, and you have complimentary internet use in a shared area to check out that there is local Whole Foods Festival with Cracker being the main act. What more can you want? It's also only one block away from the Grand rail station and within walking distance to many tourist destinations (i.e. Navy Pier, Millenium Park, Chicago River, etc.).
