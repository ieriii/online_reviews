This place deserves a five star rating for being the best place in the city for you average working man with a family. First off, it has FREE parking right outside the door in their own lot!!, and this is a $50 savings per night. Super friendly and helpful staff. Great pizza right here in the hotel. Try the Marina if you love seafood. Great location. This is now my second stay here and I will not even think about staying anywhere else. Best Western River North is a Great Family Hotel. Sure, you will find fancier places, but it is good, clean, and downright a good place!! McDonalds is across the street. Starbucks-2 blocks down as well as a Jewel Osco Store for food, snacks, pop, etc.
