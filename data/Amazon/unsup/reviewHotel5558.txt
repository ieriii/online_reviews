I recently stayed here on a Monday (of all days). The La Quinta opened earlier this year in a former office building. Unlike the roadside properties of this chain, this La Quinta is in the western edge of the Loop (Franklin + Madison) so it is convenient for business folk and for leisure travelers visiting the nearby Sears/Willis Tower. My room was pleasant enough, with carpeting in one half of the room and wood flooring in the other. There was a microwave, empty mini-fridge, and coffeemaker. My view overlooked Madison, and it was fun to watch the workers in the building across the street and those rushing to the nearby CTA and Metra stations. True, the closet is a bit small and the toiletries are limited, but they have very nice rates for a downtown property. The breakfast buffet is included, and I made my own waffle to go along with my filling meal (sausage, bacon, muffins, fruit, cereal, yogurt, juice etc.). The staff seemed busy, but most of the time they did take an extra second to greet me like a real guest. They have an indoor pool with a tiny Jacuzzi, which I enjoyed immensely after a long day of errands.
