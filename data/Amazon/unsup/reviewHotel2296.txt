My brother used to stay at this location on business and he recommended it to me and although you pay a little extra for the area, its still an okay price. The bar is very well stocked, the service was friendly and quick to serve and the seats were very comfortable. But since its in a big open space and near the side entrance it can get chilly sat there if the heat isn't cranked up at night. I wish the Starbucks was open a little later, but with so many others surrounding the hotel, its a minor complaint. I was a fan of the restaurant- both breakfast and dinner was delicious but its was rather overpriced. The gym was perfect both in stock, cleanliness and smell. The wi-fi 'deals' apparently improved vastly since the refurb so that no longer effects my rating. And of course the room itself, was...well standard Marriott. Big comfy bed with plenty of extra pillows and blankets and the bathroom had a pretty decent shower. It was among the cleanest hotels I've ever stayed in and the friendliest. Will definitely recommend this location to my mother (and shes even pickier than me!) if she visits me late next year.
