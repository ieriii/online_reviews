Was here last night for some drinks. This was a terrible experience. It was cold and drafty because you're basically in a hotel lobby. The drinks are overpriced. The decor was scary! The clientele was interesting to watch but was full of tourist, douche bags and odd balls. I would not stay here if I was visiting the city or go here to have an overpriced vodka rocks again!
