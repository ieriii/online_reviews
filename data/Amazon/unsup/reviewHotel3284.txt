Great people, great staff, awesome location, excellent "hip" rooms, great lounge, great rates! Our music groups love to stay here and their is a good reason!! They take good care of us!! I was just on tour with The Avett Brothers and we were suppose to stay one night, but we extended it to 3 nights!! I know why and I hope you find out too!  Easy in, easy out, just a great all around location, Concierge and Front desk staff are superb!! I want to live here!
