Finally a decent hotel on the southside. I have not stayed there, but I had a friend stay there, and his room was just fine. Definately not the best, but when you go to visit an awesome city like Chicago, all you really need is a clean place to lay your head. Now to be straight up, this place is not downtown, and there is not much in walking distance, so be prepared for that, but if you are driving then this is probably a great spot (no $40 per night parking charge). And also, the Sports Bar in the hotel, seems to be a nice gathering spot for cool African American urbanites. I met some friends at the bar the other night to watch the Chicago/Greenbay game, and the place was packed. Everyone had their Bears shirts on and were having a great time. The bar staff seemed to be a bit overwhelmed, and the appitizers that they had sitting out NEVER had the heaters turned on, so they might want to pay a little more attention to that, but over all I think that this place has the potential to be the place to be. No more running to the north side. And I also noticed that they have a nice new restaurant, that I will be trying out in the next few weeks. The atmosphere is awesome.  The hostess was very nice and gave some good basic information. I sure hope that it lives up to its potential.
