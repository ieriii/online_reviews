The pros: Very good location to get nearly anywhere via CTA or walking. Free WiFi throughout the hotel... nice touch. Staff, down to a single person, were all fantastic. Every single one. The bed was very comfortable, the linens were nice. The cons: Quite possibly the smallest hotel room I have every stayed in. The bed was practically shoehorned into the room. No place to store luggage if it's bigger than a carry-on.
