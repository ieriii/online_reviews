Yes, the rooms are small, but not intolerably so. Staff was friendly and its in a good location. Just far enough off Michigan Avenue to cut the crowds down. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The gym needs work. All in all, a good hotel, depending what you pay. If you are paying much over $100 p/night, you will probably be disappointed. I pricelined it but fees were higher because it was spring break, so it was a bit over priced.
