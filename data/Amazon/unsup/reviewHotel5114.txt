Should be number 1 in our opinion for service, location and pool!!!We stayed here in August to celebrate many events and we were upgraded to wonderful suite. Margaret at check in merely overheard that it was our daughter's birthday and organized a beautiful chocolate cake..this created an amazing memory that will last forever. Exceptional service. This hotel oozes character in the historical wing.The Pool was beautiful, the service unmatched and the location incredible!!Nothing is too much trouble.THANK YOU
