Cons: I got a great deal to Palmer House, which is why I stayed there. Before my trip I added a day to my reservation... That caused an issue. When I got to the hotel they couldn't find my extra day, which was cool because they eventually found it. I was told it would be corrected in the system and put as one reservations rather than two.. Great... that is until I tried to get into my room at like 1am and my key wasn't working! Apparently the woman forgot to fix the error in the system & I was checked out. That was fixed and they checked me back in after about 30 minutes. Next they didn't clean my room the day of the "check-out situation"... I don't know if it is because no one was supposed to be in the room, but I think that it's disgusting. I was annoyed to enter my room and see my bed still unmade and no new clean towels and wash cloths. Lastly, I was supposed to receive a non-smoking room and received a smoking room. By the time I checked into the hotel I was so exhausted from work & my flight that I didn't even care and bought a candle to try to help the smell of the room. Pros: Nice Lobby, Decent rooms, Lounge/Bar in the lobby, Comfortable bed, Crabtree & Evelyn products in the bathroom.
