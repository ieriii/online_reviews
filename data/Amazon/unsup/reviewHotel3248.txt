What a great hotel!  I'm pretty loyal to Starwood Hotels. But when Groupon put up the $99 special for the Hard Rock Hotel - I decided to check it out. Check-In Very efficient and friendly. I was checked into my room very quickly. The front desk crew was very warm and inviting.  Great start to the weekend. The Room Very urban hip - I had the Deluxe King.  Very nice and roomy --- The Hotel Bar 1. Great Service - Lara was on top of her game - very attentive and   friendly 2.  The Bar Menu was great!  I ordered the Mango and Asian BBQ    tempura chicken. Delicious... I have to say there isn't one thing I could find wrong with the Hard Rock Hotel - I would definitely visit again (sorry Starwood) and would feel very comfortable putting my family up here when they visit Chicago.
