This is like a traditional W hotel's attractive, quieter, hard-to-get-to-know sister. The W City Center is still a bit of an enigma to me and I have stayed there several times. The first time I booked this hotel, I was surprised by its location, but drawn in by the name, I made the reservation and hoped for the best. Honestly, it is not as bad as some of the SPG hotels that I have stayed in, but it doesn't have the redeeming qualities of the other Ws.  The thing about a typical W hotel is that beyond all of the pretentiousness is excellent service and cleanliness. This W has the cleanliness, but none of the excellent service. Most of the service I got boarded on you-are-interrupting-me-checking-into-foursquare-under-the-table looks and uninformed service on the phones. They usually have better pricing than the other Ws, but you won't get the benefits that come with the extra dollars. By "extras", I mean basic customer service.
