I travel for work all the time, so needless to say, I have stayed at a lot of hotels. I tend to like the historic properties (Palmer House), but this one is the exception. I really enjoyed this hotel, restaurant and meeting room facilities. If my company makes some money next year, I will be back as often as possible. Every person we dealt with was friendly, helpful and professional. What a delight for Chicago. The sushi........oh.........yum!!!!!!!!!
