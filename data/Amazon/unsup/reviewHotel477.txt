Embassy suites has some nice rooms with decent beds. With the suites you get the seperate room which isnt much use in Chicago since you shouldnt be spending much time in the room anyway. There is free breakfast here and a managers drink hour which isnt worth much either. The breakfast is below average and you have to wait in a line across the lobby to get a free drink.  The location of this hotel is great with plenty of great restaurants near by and very close to Michigan ave, and the Navy Pier.  Dont plan on parking your car here since it is about $50/night try to find parking near by.  If you stay here skip the free breakfast and head over to Yokes which is awesome, also go to Joes steak seafood and crab for a great dinner
