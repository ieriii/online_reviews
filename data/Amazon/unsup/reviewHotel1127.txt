This is an okay Fairmont, however not my favorite. The location is pretty good, close to Michigan Ave. and walking distance to a lot of good bars/restaurants. The concierge was very good and I used him daily (Tim, btw). The rooms weren't that big and the bathroom didn't have a separate shower stall from bathtub. The closet space was very minimal and the clothes drawers were almost non-existent. The espresso machine was a nice touch, however I spent 5 days there and couldn't figure out how to use it (probably says more about me than the machine). The cleaning staff was good except for today when they knocked on the door at 8 am. I probably wouldn't stay here again. There are better options for a lower cost blocks away.
