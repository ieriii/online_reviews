Famous stars such as John Travolta, Katharine Hepburn, and a few select others (which they pride themselves on serving once or twice; the full list can be found outside the building and inside near the check-in station) have chosen this hotel to stay at, and I get it. It's quaint, it's timely--it looks right out of what 1970's luxury class hotel should look like. We stayed on the 16th floor and had a nice view of a construction site, the Hancock building, and the American Girl doll shop. But for some reason, I can't get too into this place. I'm not sure if it's the fact that it lacked a decent screen on the 16th floor windows, paying $10/day for internet access (when I've had it free at plenty of others), the creepily trembling elevators, or that the staff were rude, but I just can't give this place five stars. However, despite those short comings, it was incredibly clean, the hotel is in a safe part of town, the beds are comfortable, and the drinks at the downstairs bar were fantastic. There are certainly good things to this place, and the $150/night (when it could probably and easily be much more in this town) wasn't bad either. The one thing I would like to know is, why were there three phones in our room? And one in the bathroom, nonetheless?
