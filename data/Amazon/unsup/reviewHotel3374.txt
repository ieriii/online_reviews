At $120 bucks a night thats a little too steep especially since we just literally slept there. The staff was wonderful and friendly. To get front view of the lake, u have to pay extra so they just moved us to the closest room to the front as possible so we still got a good view of the pier. The wall size window was awesome. It kind of gave a romantic atmosphere. The bed was really soft and everything was clean. Right next to the park and the lake and convenient. It is one block away from this funky bar called Buddy Legend's i think. My boyfriend and I clearly didn't fit with that crowd! But I really do like this hotel :)
