I took my mom to the Drake for an afternoon tea on her birthday and I was very impressed. The room the afternoon tea is held in is gorgeous, with a harpist if you get there after 2pm. The harp music was beautiful; she played everything from "Happy Birthday" to "Beauty and the Beast" - both classics. The tea was great, but some of the food could have been bigger and better. Because I mentioned I was coming there for a birthday, my mom received an extra piece of birthday cake, which was the breakout performer of the meal. It's also worth mentioning that if you come there for an afternoon tea, they will validate your valet parking pass for $13. It was an overall very expensive afternoon, but my mom and I had a great time drinking tea and then exploring the hotel and accidentally interrupting meetings.
