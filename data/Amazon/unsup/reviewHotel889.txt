The marble walls and ceiling and the ornamental metal elevator grills of the Hotel Burnham will be impressive to the architect in your life, should you choose to take him along on your stay here. He'll appreciate this adaptive reuse of a historic landmark. It's even on the National Trust's Historic Hotels of America register! And spacious rooms ensure that you won't trip over one another. I even managed to get several hours of work done at the desk during my stay, which is not usually the case at cramped in-room desks. The location is excellent. In the short time I had between my arrival and when I had to be at work I managed to visit Millennium Park, take a picture with the bean and find a dress and shoes for a wedding I had to go to that weekend. Any frequent Kimpton Hotel guest will come to know their nightly wine hour. But the Hotel Burnham doesn't just offer red and white wine, they also offer Cracker Jack! Staff here goes the extra mile - spending nearly half an hour trying to hail cabs for customers stranded in the rain, always greeting guests with genuine smiles. The Hotel Burnham would be my top choice for a stay, be it work or pleasure, in Chicago.
