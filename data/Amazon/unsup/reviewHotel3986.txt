Beautiful and luxurious hotel. Central Location, within walking distance to Navy Pier, Millenium, and Manificent Mile. Huge luxury hotel. Expensive parking (but its Chicago). Wi Fi charge for the room but free in lobby on the 2nd floor. Love the connection to Houlihans at Michigan Avenue...open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Small Grocery store one block away. Sensor locks on the hotel doors. Booked with third party retailer and never felt like it. Ipod alarm clock, coffee w/maker, flat screen, and the most comfortable bed that I have slept in. In room-safe. Instead of the amazing riverview, I had the view of the Fire Departmnt and the amazing looking Radisson Blu hotel. Greeted by name when I made a phone call. Offered a free USA Today because I passport member....many conferences going on but did not feel crowded. Bar is a little pricey, but hey, it's Downtown Chicago. I was more of a Houligans gal with the drink specials and plate specials. I have stayed at this property in the past and could never afford to at the non-third party retail rate, so I appreciate that they offer a gal like me, "caviar and champagne lifestyle" on a "sardines and Tang" budget. They will continue to offer this, I will cross my fingers EVERY TIME for the Hyatt.
