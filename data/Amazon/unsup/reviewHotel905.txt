Very pleased with our Saturday stay. I had booked a king suite to celebrate Valentines Day and couldn't have been more pleased with the room or service. We had a corner room with views East down Washington of the Pritzker Pavillion and North down State Street with views of the old Marshall Fields (I refuse to call it Macy's) and the Chicago theater. The room had a seating area separate from the bedroom. Both were very comfortable. Typical Chicago street noise but certainly tolerable on the 7th floor. The hotel, the former Reliance Building, is beautiful. The historical details are everywhere you look. Everything was spotless. The only nits were someone had taken the cashews from the mini bar so we made sure to mention this when checking out. Anyone that knows mini bar protocol is aware that surprise charges can appear later for items you never touched. The front desk made note of the missing item. And an errant room service charge had to be removed. The concierge handled my bouquet and candy request (I know, cliche, but sometimes you gotta stick with tried-and-true basics) and both were waiting in the room when we checked in. Charges for both were very reasonable. Be sure to join the Kimpton loyalty program to take advantage of the free wifi and $10 mini bar voucher. Location is close to Millenium Park and the theatre district. I know we'll be back.
