If you are offered an upgrade to the executive floor for $19, take it.  The regular rooms are TINY. The rooms are ok as far as style goes, just a little outdated. Old, CRT TV's, no wifi in the rooms, and the bathrooms need major overhauls. The showerheads are out of a dollar store with lousy pressure and the sealant around the tub and toilet was peeling up or missing. The staff was great, 'nuff about that. Wifi is sold by the hour in the lobby, $7. Wired internet is available in the rooms for $15-20 a day. The hotel overall is very nice, there is a CVS and parking across the street. We may come back, but not to the regular rooms.
