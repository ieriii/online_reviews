I just finished working on a conference at the Sheraton. I hadn't been there in many years. Checkin was a breeze and we had a room just off the elevators on the 12th floor. The rooms are fine and clean, but nothing too special (unless you have a room with a view). The ballrooms have been kept up to date and are very serviceable. The banquet food was not very good in this case. The burgers were a lower grade of meat than my wife got from room service the night before. So, all in all, a decent hotel, but stay away from the banquet food.
