4-stars for view and location and some staff, 3 for amenities, service, and overall vibe. Stayed here since it's essentially a conference center hotel, and I was attending one. It's just a standard Sheraton. Nothing that sets it apart from others. It's located on what's essentially a dead end, which is nice that you don't have to deal with traffic directly in front of your room. I didn't receive any recognition for being an SPG Gold member, but was "upgraded" to a "corner" king room. By that I mean I was lucky to have a view of the western part of the river and the Trump tower. I asked for a high elevation floor (22 isn't too bad) on a corner since we aren't entitled to a suite, and did get one, altho a co-worker with no status got 26th floor and a better corner room. oh well.  NO WIFI at this hotel. Really??? It's a Sheraton, so you get the comfy bed. That's a plus. Bathroom was not designed very well. It seems like you're a mile away from the tv when in bed. Doors around your area close VERY loudly. There are better options in the area if you're going to be spending the usual rate of roughly $200. My advice, if here on vacation and your own dime, is to priceline a hotel around the mag mile or loop. The two VERY nice things I have to compliment them on is the desk clerks being very helpful with my questions, and the ability to go to the locker room outside of the gym to change clothes before my room was ready. It's a nice locker room with soap, shaving cream, q-tips, lockers, and showers. It does take a fortnight to get to from the lobby, however.
