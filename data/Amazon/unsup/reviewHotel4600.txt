My parents stayed here for one night and had to move because the air conditioner was just too damn loud. Be forewarned, especially staying in Chicago during the summer, you can't go without A/C. The lobby was nice, if somewhat over-perfumed, and the room was nice except for it's tiny size. Also right now, there is building construction going on right next door and that was the view they had from their room... It seems like a good hotel for your money, but if you're willing to spend $20 more, it'll make all the difference.
