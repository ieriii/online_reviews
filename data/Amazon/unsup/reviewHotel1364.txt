One of the best hotel beds I've ever slept in.... amazing sheets, and perfectly padded for your comfort. The showers are also pretty neato too. Not only do you have a rainfall shower on top, but you also have the handheld shower that is propped up on the side, and that my friends, is nothing short of awesome. OH, and if you have room service in the morning, get the french toast with bananas. And, get a side of bacon. This is best if you eat it in bed. It's sexy trust me :)
