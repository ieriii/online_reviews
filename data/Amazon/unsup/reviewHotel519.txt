I am not *quite* sure how to write this review yet. My friend had booked us a block of rooms for a GTG we all were having. There were about 8 rooms used, and I guess they were all supposed to be suites, there were supposed to be refrigerators in the rooms, and there were supposed to be microwaves. I personally, just got a double room, and I guess nobody else had a suite, either.  And my friend got the paperwork in on time while going through the worst time in her life. So Hampton Inn and Suites, PLEASE get your act together. All of that being said, there were a lot of great things about the hotel. The complementary breakfast was comprehensive and wasn't lacking anything. The rooms were comfortable (slightly small). It was in a good location. And when I called down and asked for a fridge for my leftover pizza, they waived the $10 charge for it. I wish I could give a better review because the service was outstanding, but they just didn't earn it on their end for the lack of customer service in the room-booking department. They needed to hold up their end of the deal.
