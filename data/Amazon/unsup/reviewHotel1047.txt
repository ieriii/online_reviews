This place is located in a great area. It was easy to hang out at some of the new places like Trump Tower & Hilton Rooftop among other places. I stayed here based on a group rate for a wedding. The things I enjoyed were the free happy hour from 5:30-7 daily. The staff is extremely friendly. The rooms were very clean except for a couple noticeable stains on the chair which were gross and moving the trash again back near my clothes when I kept moving it away. The things I did not like were thin walls, slamming and kicking of doors early in the morning for the complimentary breakfast rush. It felt like it was never ending. The only relaxing time was after everyone went on with their day. Definitely not a place to go when you are jet lagged and can't handle the time difference. Beside the problems with the doors, I had a problem with my shower knob. It would slide from cool to extremely burning hot. I told the front desk but the problem was never solved and I stayed for 5 nights. I don't know if I would go back. I even asked specifically for a quiet room. When asking for a late check out, they do charge an additional fee.
