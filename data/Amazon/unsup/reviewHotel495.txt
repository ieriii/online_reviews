The beds were comfortable enough and the location is nice for downtown happenings... We had someone trying to sleep in the "first" room, on a Friday night, and that was a mistake, as the lobby stayed pretty loud, and a group of drunken revelers tried to get into our room at 3 in the morning... they finally did manage to get into the room next door, and the walls are pretty thin. $15/day for internet is completely unacceptable. Breakfast was ok, especially for the price (free) but the cooked-to-order stuff is the way to go. The buffet offerings don't stay warm or get refilled often enough... you have to get lucky.
