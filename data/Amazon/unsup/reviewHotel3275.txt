So... put John Lenon and Yoko on the wall in the bathroom and charge $300/night? I've stayed there probably 4 times now, and the rooms are not all born equals. This time my room was freezing and couldn't turn the heater above 70... I got so cold that I was felt sickish the whole day. Don't expect extra cozy rooms, there are "stylish", read super cold design. No extra either... WiFi is $15/day, no bathrobe, nothing extra... just sparse and "stylish". If my meetings weren't tight across the street I would choose another place to stay.
