I really can't say enough good things about this hotel. The entire place is recently rehabbed back to it's 1920's splendor and it shows. The lobby, elevators, hallways are "old hotel small" but that I think adds to it's charm. The rooms decor is top notch - Granted we were in one of their suites. Our room was loaded with antiques in great condition. The bathrooms are very nice - hand-laid tiles, plenty of room.  The staff was very attentive, very responsive to inquiries and really were what you'd expect from a old school hotel like this. The location is perfect - a short block from Hancock and Water Tower Place, TONS of shops within easy walking distance (if that's your bag) and many top-notch restaurants also within 3 blocks in every direction. (not to mention a pretty good Itallian spot right in the hotel). This is definitely a hotel from an era long gone - but still at the top of it's game. *The price I listed as "Moderate" but keep in mind that that is in comparison to the other hotel options in the area.* For the Gold Coast, it is a great price.
