we were upgraded to a suite so I can't comment on how small the rooms were. ours was definitely comfortable. Pros: - LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. seriously walk to wrigley, southport, tons of food, bars, theaters and the El. - comfy bed. relatively quiet room - decent linens - friendly service Cons: - squeaky floors can be loud (but actually comical) - room decor is "quaint" and might be considered dated - tv is also quaint Would stay here again in a hearbeat. So much to walk around to and so much energy in the neighborhood.
