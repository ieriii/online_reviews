I stayed here last week for a work conference and unfortunately I returned home to find BED BUG bites on my feet, arm and few other parts of body. Very irritating and not what one would suspect from a Hyatt. Called to relate this to a manager. I guess I was given the the manager of housekeeping that told me this would be looked into. 3 days later he called back to tell me the room was cleaned and inspected and had no BED BUGS. Right. I guess I imagined this horrendous rash/bites that I had right after staying at this hotel. Poor location. Drab and old-very plain. Only useful for a conference at this site. What kind of a customer service person at a hotel denies that you had a problem or bad experience and offers nothing but a weak apology and denial that it was their fault. Go to any other hotel. I have never had this problem nor this kind of follow up from any hotel I have ever stayed.
