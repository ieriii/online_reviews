Looks like they renovated / updated their rooms. Overall it was definitely an update for the better. I stayed here before in a much larger room, but our experience this time was a lot better considering many of the items in our room back then including the furniture, the TV (a tube tv) were outdated. Rooms now features a fairly good sized flat screen tv, computer that has your name on the title screen, which was a nice touch.  I like a more modern approach of using that computer (sort of like a kiosk) to look for nearby attractions, see room service options, look for restaurants and numerous other things. It gives you more info about what's around and what to do around the area. The downside is that in order to use the web browser, they charge a ridiculous amount. In this day and age, when we are hooked on technology, I sort of see this as nickle and diming. Really annoying. Anyway, I got the parking and room package at a decent price so it was nice to go in and out of parking without hassle.  Overall, I'm satisfied with our stay. Got some good rest and I actually booked to get away from the burbs and spend some time in the city with my wife on our anniversary. This place served it's purpose and everything was solid.
