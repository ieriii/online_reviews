Five stars all the way. Where to start????  The service is awesome from the valet to the reservations. From Check in to check out . One word CLEAN! Continental breakfast on every floor! Free drinks and small appetizers from 5:30 to 7. Location location location... this small boutique hotel is right around the corner form the hustling Hubbard street clubs. One block from the House of Blues, Bin 36, Flatwater, Keefers, 10 Pin etc.... across from Harry Carry's next to Red Fish. Ten minutes from everything!!!  The bed was so comfortable I didn't want to get out of it. They have every amenity and when we needed something and had to call for it, it took like two minutes for it to arrive!  There was even a men's bathroom on the floor we were on. so when the women were in the suite's bathroom, we could go right down the hall and use the facilities. awesome! The decor was really hip too!
