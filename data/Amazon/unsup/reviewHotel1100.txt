So here are the bad things that I encountered at the Fairmont Hotel since that is pretty much what everyone looks for first. -Must pay for the little things like internet and jacuzzi. -There is no swimming pool. This really sucked cause my view from the hotel looks into the Aqua Condominium's pool area, which looked refreshing. -Only has one trash can in the room.  -No dressers to put clothes away. -Small closet. On a side note...the cab drivers are the worst (except for one). I wonder if they live in their cab. The front seat of every single cab we took had junk in the front seat, like Dunkin Donut coffee cups or leftover wrappers from yesterday's dinner or lunch. Just take a peek in their front seat.  That's it!!! Everything else was delightful. There is a reason why you stay at the Fairmont and that's customer service (and the most comfy beds for vacation). From the valet to the concierge, everyone was very helpful and eager to please. This Fairmont Hotel seems a lot more hip that the other Fairmonts. Two blocks from Wacker, and four block from Magnificent Mile.
