I came here with a few friends for a wine tasting. We didn't stay, so this review is strictly for the decor and loby service. This place is clean, has plenty of bars and lounges on various floors, and valet. One thing about the valet service, they have a very confusing system. I was sent around the front entrance and down into the parking garage, after I had specifically asked for self park. When I pulled up to the attendant down under, he wanted to valet my car and when I asked him for self-park, AGAIN, he waived me off and down the lane without direction or courtesy. Needless to say, I ended up leaving the endless underground garage and parking at another facility across the street. Yes, the other facility charged me the similar $26, but I was happy to give them my money instead of you know who. The experience was festive and the lobbies are artfully fun. In the future I may venture to stay here, but I'll surely remember to take the train.
