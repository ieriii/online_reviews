We stayed at Fairmont for 10 days due to a conference that was being held within the hotel. We checked in around 8pm the first night after a long delay of flight, but instead of checking in the room that we booked 6 months ago, we had to wait in the lobby for 30 mins for the room to be cleaned. The room was small and out-dated. We also had a small coffee table that's totally broken. The bathroom did not have the usual toiletries that you see at other 4-5 star hotels, q-tips/cotton balls etc, and the shower area had a strong moldy smell. The only good thing about it was that they had Miller Harris toiletries (which was not that great either.) No in-room coffee and no starbucks in the hotel. I had to walk to N Michigan Ave. for a cup of latte every morning. The location is great ONLY if you have a meeting right in the hotel, otherwise the area is very 9-5 and deserted after business hours. It's a long walk to any other tourist attractions or decent restaurants. I'd have chosen InterContinental if I've known the area better.
