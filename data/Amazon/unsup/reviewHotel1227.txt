Very nice hotel but I have major reservations in giving it anything higher than three stars. The hotel itself is four or five stars. Great accommodations, clean, sharply designed. We enjoyed our time there. As a hotel for tourists, though, it's lousy. I was placed there via a great Priceline deal, but the hotel is in a sketchy area, which you discover if you walk to the nearest CTA stop, or to the Metra station, or just straight into town. During the daytime, you'll notice said sketchiness but I was never fearful of anything happening. The evening is a totally different story, and we began taking a cab home. If you're going for a convention at McCormick Place, or just passing through town, this is a fantastic hotel. If you're a tourist, I wouldn't choose to stay here. If you're a tourist going through a deal site and are blindly placed here, just be prepared to drive or spend a little of that saved money on cabs. Finally, some people here do make great points about how this place is often understaffed -- the employees are very helpful and friendly, but during the daytime can be hard to find or get a hold of.
