Margarita had a rotten lime to compliment the rotten waitress. And whoever thought that blue cheese and spicy buffalo sauce was a good combo for a chicken sandwich should watch some food network--that's were I got my formal training ;). Too pricey for the quality. Never will return even if I got paid for it. Ew.
