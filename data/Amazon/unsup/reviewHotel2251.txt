Worst hotel I have ever been to... I would have rather stayed in a dinky motel than this place ever again. The service was terrible, parking is mad expensive, I felt like I paid for a Tiffany's and got a Walmart. The woman on guest services was always in a rush to get off the phone. The pool closes way too early and that is the only good thing about the hotel. Our room was uncomfortable, they crammed a sofa in there which was a complete waste of space considering we didn't have any leg room between our bed and the sofa. The bathroom was pathetic for a four star hotel and worst of all the toilet seat had brown "stuff" on it still ... grossed me out so much. Our tv didn't work so they had to send someone to fix it.... The guy was the only nice person we talked to at the hotel. We got this hotel for my fianc bday and it really put a damper on our minivacation.
