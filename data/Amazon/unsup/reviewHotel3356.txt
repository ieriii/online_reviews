The Essex inn has a pretty fantastic history here in Chicago. It was one of the first (if not THE first) hotels to allow "mixed race" company, or people who were other than WHITE in rooms and meeting rooms. For this reason, one of the professional groups I work with hosts meetings here. The Essex has gone through renovations in the past few years. The hotel rooms have been redone and it shows, they are much nicer. Are they Omni level? NO- but- they are great for what you pay for! They are small, but not NYC small. The meeting rooms are currently gutted and a focus of work. The location makes it pretty prime for visitors. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful.
