I don't see what the big deal is. I've stayed at this hotel twice, and the rooms are super small and nothing special. I think the ballrooms are nice, as I have been to a wedding here, and a company event here as well. But other than that I don't feel like its worth the money. I haven't had a bad experience with the staff, but I didn't feel like they were over the top extraordinary.I wouldn't stay here again unless it was free. I think there are lots of cooler hotels in Chicago.
