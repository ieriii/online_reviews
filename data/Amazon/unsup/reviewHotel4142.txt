Booked via PL for a rate of approximately $85 after taxes. For this area, I was pleased. I am a Gold Passport member, although this was my first ever stay at a Hyatt due to the lack of them in areas I often stay in when spending a night somewhere, and was treated like I was an elite member. You won't get this kind of attitude at the vast majority of any other hotel you stay at. Was checked in at one of the Gold Passport desks only because it was empty and I was motioned over there by a clerk. When she inquired about me being a Passport member I told her I was and she was INCREDIBLY polite and friendly despite me booking via PL. Asked about a more quiet room away from elevators and she put me in a room in the West tower on the end. No view, but it was definitely quiet. Loved the room. Odd location for tv and armoire, but bed was great, and bathroom was very nice as well. Check-in area was a zoo. Not enough room for the size of a hotel it is. Not sure what's going on with the street entrance to the West Tower, but it just seemed odd. The one real complaint I had was with one of the guys hailing taxis and helping with bags outside. I tipped a buck after he slung my bags in the back and he didn't even close the trunk. I had to get out and slam it shut once we realized he was more concerned with getting the next tip. I was only here for a night and just wanting something towards the center of the city since I had one day of sightseeing on my own to do. 3-4 blocks from the Red Line, but overall a good location. The staff impressed me the most. Good job, Hyatt.
