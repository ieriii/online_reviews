so i stayed here on friday night i really liked the decor of the place the service was the best i have ever gotten okay i make this short and sweet though what i really hated about this hotel sos my girlfirend was taking a shower and al of a sudden the whole bathroom flooded with water like 2 inches thick so she ended up using all the towels to soak up the water so thats what i did nt like about this place plus the funitute is just okay alll in all it was just ok in my book
