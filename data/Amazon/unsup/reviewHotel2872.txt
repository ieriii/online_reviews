Going downtown is a hassle for me as it is, finding a place to stay is even more of a nightmare. Price vs quality is all i'm contemplating, and this place was on par with what you would expect. The air conditioning didn't work in my room, the room service was late and extremely over priced, the parking wasn't complimentary for staying at the hotel (freaking double dippers) and I could hear everything going on in the room next door - and it wasn't as exciting as you would think.  My next stay in chicago will not be here, that's all I can say.
