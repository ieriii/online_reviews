We stayed at the Palmer House when we were in town for a wedding. The hotel itself was fine and in a good location, HOWEVER, our door did not latch properly and our room was broken into and valuables were stolen. We immediately called security, they arrived and took a statement and sent someone to fix the door. At that point it was "out of their hands" and reported to their insurance. We never heard from a hotel manager or customer service to check on us or see if there was anything we needed. After our trip I called customer service to let them know what happened and the representative said "the hotel is not responsible for lost or stolen items" and that if I "believe" I had been robbed I should have called the police. Basically we will not get compensated or even apologized to even though it IS the hotels responsibility to provide a room with a working door. The icing on the cake is that 6 months ago when we were moving and stayed a different Hilton our Uhaul was broken into and all of our belongings were ransacked, stolen or ruined we were treated even worse. Not only did the hotel manager not so much as offer us a free breakfast, we were scolded for not having properly registered the Uhaul in the parking lot. (even though when we arrived with the uhaul it was after midnight and we had previously registered our vehicle.) So next time you stay at a hotel make sure that all of your belongings fit in the safe or just carry them around with you.
