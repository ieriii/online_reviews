We stayed at that hotel for 4 nights and on the 3rd day two our laptops disappeared from the hotel room. We left the hotel in the morning and when we came back at night we found everything except our computers in the room. The staff was not helpful at all and was obviously marking time. The receptionist told us to wait till the morning to check if the housekeeping confused something. At the same time they said that since the room had not been cleaned that day, nobody had been there (did we steal the computers ourselves?!). Later they said they could do nothing about it. There are no cameras in the corridors either. They did not even apologize to us. Do not go there!
