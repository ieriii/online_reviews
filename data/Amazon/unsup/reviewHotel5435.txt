I guess if you're as poor as me it'll do... but honestly you might be just as safe sleeping outside. It really looked like something out of a horror film. The door didn't lock, the windows were held together with duct tape, there were stains on everything, the water runs yellow for about 30 seconds after you turn it on, and the hallway and elevators smell like urine. But the toilet was very clean and the staff were friendly. It's quite an experience and it's something to tell your friends about later.
