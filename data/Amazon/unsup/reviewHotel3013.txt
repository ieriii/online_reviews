I booked the "Marvelous Suite" (corner of hotel; lake view) for the Air & Water show, and I've never paid happily paid so much for a hotel room in my life :)  I couldn't stop looking out the window at the absolutely gorgeous view. Notes: - If you want a coffeemaker or mini-fridge, you'll need to request one.  - Use the roll-down shades behind the bamboo ones to block AM light - Expect full elevators during busy periods - Large sink countertops are great for spreading out toiletries/etc - Bliss shampoo/conditioner/etc = delightful - Location is super convenient - Walls are a bit thin - Staff is very friendly, professional and accommodating As for the people complaining that the lobby is essentially a bar, you are clearly the folks who need a drink the most.
