I got the opportunity to stay here for a night and was quite impressed. Everything from the touchscreen computer in the room to the lobby to the comfy bed to the staff made my stay memorable. When we first got into the room we ordered some room service (grilled chicken sandwich) which came very quickly and turned out to be delicious. The bathroom was a little bit outdated and dusty, but the shower was great and the shampoo/ conditioner products they had were amazing! The view from the hotel room was beautiful. We were in a corner room on one of the top floors looking onto the lake and down S Michigan Ave. If you can choose your room I definitely recommend this side of the building. i would stay in the Hilton again if I ever need to!
