Spent my one-year anniversary here with my boyfriend - beautiful view, upgraded executive suite room... it was more than I could've ever asked for!! We were treated very well while we stayed there, it was QUIET, enjoyable and very welcoming. Also, they had AMAZING food when we ordered room service. It was so good!! We would LOVE to go back again really soon!!
