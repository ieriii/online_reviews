My Husband and a friend stayed stayed 1 night (2/16/2012) here after driving cross country (from Spokane, WA) to purchas a classic car and needed some rest. We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisors reviews. Room and staff were great but on 2/16 about 9pm my husband was harrassed by a drug dealer to buy cocaine, this happen right by the valet area. The next morning at 7:30am his friend was also harrassed by a different man to buy crack. My husband discussed this with the valet staff and was told it is not the first time someone reported this. My husband spoke with Andrew the Mgr. who stated there was nothing he could do since this happened on the street ....street? this happen in front of the valet area. I am sure if a hotel employee stated my husband harrassed them by the valet area security tapes would be pulled or he would be told to leave. As a HGI member I was very surprised Andrew did not offer to look at tapes, refund some or all of his points. As I stated the staff were amazing (especially the valet that let him put his car in their loading zone for the evening beacuase of the size and we did pay the valet fee would never expect not to) and the room very nice, we would have loved to return for another visit but we feel security is lacking and Andrew really wasn't very interested in getting to the bottom of this. I will not stay anywhere I cannot feel safe regardless of how nice and welcoming the staff and the good condition of the room. Also please note the score for service is based on Andrew, handeling of the situation and as far as value i used points, although I do not feel this proprty in anyway represents a cat 6 hotel I have stayed in many Hilton proprties with lower cat. ratings that were beautiful.
