Meh.... Lobby is small. Hotel is kinda classy from the outside. Staff was very friendly. View was beautiful. The room was ok, just not as super spectacular as I was expecting for the location price etc. The rooms kinda look like it was an office building that had been remodeled so the closet was in the bathroom, a little weird but whatever. Decent stay but did not blow my mind
