I am not a frequent yelper but was so impressed by this hotel that I felt like I needed to share my experience. I stayed at the James on Monday of this week and after a long day at the office, I really appreciated the friendly and helpful staff at the front desk. Check-in was a breeze and they even gave me an upgrade to a suite. My suite was exactly what I was looking for, large king size bed with flatscreen in the bedroom, moderately sized living room with a coffee table, couuch and large TV. It was great for finishing up some work at night in a more relaxing environment. Wifi was free, they offer a nice high-tech "Dream Machine" alarm clock with audio like rain and beach sounds to put you to sleep + an ipod deck in the mini kitchen. I checked out their GYM and was really impressed to see the sheer size and number of machines and equiptment, also opened 24 hours. Their bath products were all natural and high-quality (can't recall the name) and the shower was very clean, which I have noticed is NOT standard at many pretty high-end hotels. I woke up refereshed and headed out for the day. The last experience that sealed the deal on this hotel moving to my top 5 was the helpful bell-boy that gave me directions to the Starbucks down the street, offered to hold my bags while I went and had my bags in a cab waiting for me when I got back. It's the extra committment to service that makes the James Hotel special in my mind. I've got 50/50 luck on finding great hotels that actually make you feel at home when traveling for business so this hotel ranks well above some of the more popular hotels in this part of Chicago. Kudos to the James, you seem to "get it" when it comes to service and you've got really fantastic people on your team!
