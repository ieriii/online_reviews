This is probably one of the best hotels in Chicago. The Intercontinental has a fabulous location on Michigan Avenue, and it has excellent service and is very nice. The hotel lobby is extremely nice and has a very important, upscale feel to it, while the rooms are nicely decorated and are very clean and comfortable. I haven't seen the pool but I heard it is gorgeous, and it is directly connected to Zest Restaurant which I've heard is fab.
