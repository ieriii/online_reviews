I stayed at the Wheeler last September with my wife. I contacted their office to reserve a particular room that we had stayed in on a previous visit. Stephanie returned my email and confirmed my reservation. However, when I arrived, I was told the room I reserved was unavailable, and that they would substitute another room. The reason the room was unavailable was because the entire hotel (except for the room they gave us) was being renovated. Now, I'm no fool. You don't just forget that you are renovating your entire hotel. They had to know the room was unavailable when I booked it, but they did not tell me until after I arrived and they had my non-refundable deposit. This is the worst possible service, deliberately lying to your customers. Although the room I was given was very nice (and larger than the room I asked for), my attempt to recreate a previous special getaway was ruined. I really wish I could give them a higher rating, because the mansion is very beautiful inside, and the rooms are extremely comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was also great. Everything about the place is relaxing and luxurious. This could be such a wonderful place to visit, but I don't feel I can recommend it to anyone because of their current management. Edit: I have been informed that the Wheeler is now under new management. The building and amenities were always four stars in my book, and so I now feel comfortable recommending it for special occasions. I have adjusted the rating from two stars to four.
