Shady...I get the whole elitism, there are no seats, and drinks are expensive as hell thing, but the Victor should be more wary of who they do business with. We went here on March 13 to see J*Davey. The doors opened at 9. We were forced to listen to some crappy, unannounced opening act that took the stage sometime after 11. By 1:15 AM, I'm asking the bar staff when they headliner is going to make an appearance. They tell me the band already played. So I had to let the staff know that J*Davey was the main attraction. They said they didn't know a thing about it and had nothing to do with it.At 1:20 a fight breaks out. There's only so much time you can keep people drinking and standing and waiting before things get unruly. Once that fire is put out, only THEN does J*Davey take the stage. Only to play for about 20 minutes, until the house lights come on and it's time to go. I think they got to perform about six songs. The night was a complete rip off. Someone must have gotten a pretty decent cut of the bar revenue that night given how long the crowd was were kept waiting. I understand Privileged Media was the promoter for this event and I blame them for things getting out of hand. It's not entirely the Victor's fault, but they should be more proactive when hosting an event.
