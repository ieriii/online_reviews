Nice hotel with small rooms. Also, despite having booked a luxury room, they had none available at checkin. I was moved to a slightly larger room when they could not fit a pack-n-play in the room I'd been assigned. My biggest concern, however, is the security (or lack thereof). Between the lobby and my room, someone managed to steal my cell phone and wallet, taking all of my money.  The thief discarded my wallet with credit cards in tact (they had rifled through the cards, but didn't take any), by leaving it in a cushion on an elevator. While the staff was generally empathetic, I would have liked to have dealt with some onsite security personnel who could have investigated the incident and perhaps reviewed cam footage to identify the thief roaming their hotel.
