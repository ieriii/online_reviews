I still love this hotel and am excited to see what it will be like after the renovations. My guy likes to stay at the Drake when in town. The executive suites are fantastic - they are spacious and have TWO closets. Ask for one of the rooms with over-sized marble bathrooms. The words over-sized and marble, when put together, make me incredibly happy. The chandeliers in the lobby and extravagant floral arrangements also make me incredibly happy. Also, who can complain when you have Chanel in the same building?
