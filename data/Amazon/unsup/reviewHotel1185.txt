It was convenient for an overnight stay to attend a concert at Soldier Field. It was kind of busy and hectic in the lobby. We asked for food options and were given possibly the worst hand-drawn, then copied map ever. It was only slightly correct. When asked about walking back to the hotel from Soldier Field, we were told to follow the lake, which was about as abstract as you can get and ended up with us going way out of our way and needing quite a bit of help from others to find our way back. But the room was clean and the bed didn't suck. It's pricey because they assume everyone staying there is on a corporate expense account.
