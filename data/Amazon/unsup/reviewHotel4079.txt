We stayed there on Sunday night, after gthe July 31 Paul McCartney concert at Wrigley Field.  Two Queen beds, two people, $119.00. The room was great. Clean, very comfortable beds, the ac worked perfectly, tv was no problem, bathroom was nice, clean, looked newly remodeled. 3:00 pm Check-in took all of three minutes. We parked one block away, in inside underground parking, for $30 for 24 hours (the hotel wanted $50). The location is perfoect for exploring the Loop. L's ar three blocks away. We did NOT eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel...they are a little pricy....$25 each for buffet breakfast. But there are plenty of Starbucks and little nook-and-cranny places to get something to eat within 4 blocks of the hotel. did not spring for internet, it would have been $12.95 per night.
