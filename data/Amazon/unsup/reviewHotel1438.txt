I came here for a stay over the weekend. I have to say that the service was superb and the staff was all really nice. They made our bed once in the morning and once at night. The beds at Omni was also very comfortable, more comfortable than the bed that I slept at home. The curtain was also thick and really good so it sheds out all the light. They also had all the little stuff that made life a little bit better, such as liquid soap, shampoo, cotton balls, q-tips, sea salt for the bath tub, shampoo and conditioner, and lotion. The place smelled good. TV also had cable, and I had wifi connection as well. I had a good time at Omni and will be staying there again if I ever go back to Chicago. Location for this hotel is also good because you are within walking distance in downtown Chicago so everything is a few blocks away.
