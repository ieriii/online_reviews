It's a big, huge, gigantic hotel. It's nice and it's a lil' fancy. Hilton's vary so much in decor and services, you never know what you're going to get. This one is a winner.  We stayed here for two nights when we moved to Chicago before the movers arrived with our stuff. I got a screaming rate the week of July 4th for $129 a night. I was upgraded to the Executive level, which was nice. The bed was really comfy. We were on the top floor with a view of the Sears Tower, so it was a great way to spend my first night in Chicago. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was on the small side, but with good counterspace. It's been a while since it's been updated, the bathroom has marble everywhere and gold fixtures. It's very "over the top".  Not really my scene, but it was good for what it is. I'd stay here for business, but probably not for pleasure again.
