Hotel Felix is a quaint little hotel with very friendly staff. My girlfriends and I had booked a one night stay for our annual girls christmas extravaganza.There was 4 of us and we came with enough crap for about 10 people.When we pulled up the lovely valet man informed us that we could park across the street for a cheaper rate than valet! I thought that was really nice of him. After that 2 bell boys unloaded all our stuff and sent it up to our room where he insisted on unloading everything himself. A long story short we had many a request that night and all were taken care of promptly. The only issue we had the whole time was the lack of a lamp in the room so it was a little dark, other then that it was a great stay!
