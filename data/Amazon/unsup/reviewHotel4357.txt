My husband loves this place, hence our stay. I've been three times and the lobby is a wonderful place to people watch and hang out. Most of the rooms have been updated, which is also nice. It's about a mile from the more popular stores on the strip, so if you're a walker you'll like that, if you're not that won't be so fun. It's a nice stay, nice staff and a Starbucks on the street level. I'll stay again.
