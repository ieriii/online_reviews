Public is a stunning hotel in the best neighborhood in Chicago. The decor is to die for. The hotel was previously The Ambassador hotel and it's face lift to Public was well worth the effort. I stayed over the weekend and received excellent customer service. There are many spaces in the hotel to sit and relax with food, cocktails or coffee, each space more fabulous than the last. On the weekends the place was packed with people going to the restaurant and bars, definitely a see and be seen kind of place. I can't wait to come back and stay again.
