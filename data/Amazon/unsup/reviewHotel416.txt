This was the perfect hotel for someone who wants to be fairly close the action but cannot spend a fortune. I thought the rooms were nice and the employees were very friendly and helpful. The layout of my room was weird (the closet door opened right against the bathroom door) and the elevators were down a lot but overall it was a good experience.You are in Chicago so you won't much time here anyyway. Be sure to ask the concierge about good places to eat they have coupons for many places. Also you have to eat breakfast at Eggsperience. It was eggcelent!
