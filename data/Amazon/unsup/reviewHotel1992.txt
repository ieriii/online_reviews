We recently stayed at this hotel for the grand opening. The room and views are magnificent. We loved the hardwood floors in the room and also had a balcony. I would highly recommend this hotel on your next stay to Chicago. Tip: If you want a balcony room when you book your rate look at the detail of the rate and you can see if it has a balcony or not listed.
