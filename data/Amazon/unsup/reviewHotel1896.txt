The comfiest beds that I can recall. We were so in love with the bed that we were looking at their in-room catalog for the purchase price. On an extended July 4th holiday, we would find ourselves in bed until two because we'd just loose track of time. However, since the W is so centrally located, we found ourself doing all of the following, four days: 1 Wrigley game, 1 US Cellular game, several trips to the Taste, a numerous other touristy stuff, and 1 Nine Inch Nails concert at Tweeter. The rooms had a very modern appeal and the towels were very lush. The square footage was small, but they made good use of their space to seem bigger. Quick room service. Love the apples and little nooks in the lobby. Two bars, one in the lobby and a larger one with a street entrance. Parking on the street is not difficult, especially at night. But, you could also have them valet it for $39 per evening.
