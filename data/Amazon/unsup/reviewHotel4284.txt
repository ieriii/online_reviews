We loved our stay at the Palmer House Hilton. The location is superb, quick access to all sorts of public transport (El, subway, bus). The hotel has a great historic feel. Rooms were comfortable and well kept. Staff was very nice. Lobby is a gorgeous place to sit. Being historic, the walls are a tad thin, but we slept fine, neighbors didn't keep us up. Everything in our room worked well and the products are nice (Peter Thomas Roth) Overall, great experience and I'd definitely go back. We booked with http://Hotels.com and the rate was fantastic, billing was quick and easy.
