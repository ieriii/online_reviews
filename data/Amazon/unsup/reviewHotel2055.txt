We've used this hotel for the Chicago(ish) Tweetup 3 times now and they have bent over backwards to help make our stays more than pleasant! There always seems to be more than enough parking. There's convenient access to the brown line, taxis and the shops at the Mart. The rooms are clean and the views are spectacular. Even with conventions and weddings going on, my room has always been a quiet place where it was easy to fall asleep.
