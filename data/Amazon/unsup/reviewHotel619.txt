Pro's - Einstein bagels in the lobby - Warm cookies when you check-in - Great restaurants/bars nearby (Timothy O'toole's, West Egg Cafe & Gyu Kaku) - Close to Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier and all the stores - Free wi-fi in Lobby - Decent price. We got it on Priceline for about $120/night Con's -Doesn't include continental breakfast -The smoking floors are AWFUL!! Cannot believe people can smoke in hotels there - 3 out of the 4 nights we stayed there our "do not disturb" sign disappeared in the morning and the maid woke us up....not a happy camper!! - Walls are thin so we heard the man next door to us coughing/throwing up two mornings in a row
