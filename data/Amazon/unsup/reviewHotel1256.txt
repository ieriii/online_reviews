There were HUGE SPIDERS all over this hotel. The were on the pool chairs, in the lounge, in the outdoor seating areas, and even in our room! I got a few bad bites while I was staying there (and still have the scars over a week later!). The Hyatt is also in the middle of nowhere, in a deserted, fringy neighborhood. I'm a city person, so people drinking on the corner and shouting at me doesn't really upset me, but my 26 year-old suburbanite sister was really freaked out. In (safe) walking distance of NOTHING, not even a bullet-proof deli.
