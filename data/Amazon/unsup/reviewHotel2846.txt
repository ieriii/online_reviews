I'm with most of my fellow reviewers... I have very mixed feelings about this hotel. The bed was super-comfortable. I really wanted to take the pillows home with me. The view from my room on the 20th floor was incredible! That's about the only positive thing I can say. The bell service was supposed to deliver some important items to co-workers who were staying at the hotel... they didn't get them on time, but I was still charged the $2.50 to-room delivery charge. *sigh* Internet - both wired and wireless - is $12.95 a day! What a rip-off!! I would expect wired service to be free of charge. My room key cards would not stay activated. They demagnetized the minute I put the card in the purse. So, every time I came back from leaving my room, I had to call security to let me back in. That was getting old really quick! They suggested not putting the card in my purse, so I put it in my pant pocket... same issue. I guess I'm supposed to carry the card around like an Olympic torch? Breakfast was ridiculously expensive!! To eat IN the restaurant was even more expensive than the same items for room service. I had coffee, 2 eggs and toast, my bill was $24 (there goes my per diem... guess I'm skipping lunch). I have to say the valet guys out front were great! And the hotel is very clean and very pretty, but for a hotel of this size and status, I was expecting the little things to run just a little bit smoother...
