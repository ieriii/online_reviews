I hop around all of the IHG properties in Chicago while I'm staying here for work, and the Holiday Inn on Harrison came due. The location isn't dreadful, but it certainly isn't close to anything. There's a Panera, Whole Foods, etc about a 6 block walk, but in January winter and 5" of snow, count me out. If you have a car, then life is good, otherwise plan on taking a cab to everything. Great fitness center on the top floor, all health club quality Precor equipment, a great multi-machine, and dumbbells up to 50lbs. Kudos to the General Manager for making the investment here. Rooms are good, very much Holiday Inn but clean and what I need. I was upgraded to a suite #437, and it's more space than I live in on a daily basis, and has a microwave, fridge, and a flat-panel TV although I don't watch it. Front desk staff is friendly, although check-in took a little longer than I would like due to several people all at once. Room is surprisingly quiet since it's so close to the freeway. Great looking business center on the top floor, looks more like an internet cafe than the typical hotel business center - very nice. I see other reviews talking about the tiny lobby. I use the lobby for checkin and checkout and don't hang out there, so it's small size doesn't bother me. I did not experience the families, although I'm also not here during the high season. I did not try the pizza joint attached to the hotel, it has looked pretty empty every time I've passed by the window. If the GM or anyone from the hotel reads the reviews on TA - The WiFi is pretty slow, and could use a bandwidth upgrade. Find out whatever the Crowne Plaza on Huron has, and make the investment into the same pipe. It would also be nice to have coffee in the lobby.
