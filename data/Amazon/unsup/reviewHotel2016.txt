THIS HOTEL IS HORRIBLE! I've stayed at this Holiday Inn before and use it for work bookings often since my company is located in the Merchandise Mart but I will never stay there again and advocating all of our out of town guests do the same. I had a reservation for last weekend and received a confirmation number the week before I was supposed to check in. I had guests that were unable to make it so I got online and cancelled (there is no cancellation fee). I received my confirmation, everything was good. But when I logged onto my bank this weekend, they billed me for 2 of the 3 rooms I had reserved. When I called to say I cancelled online and gave them my confirmation number, they told me that all rooms were booked under that confirmation number but they had separate booking IDs and I needed to cancel each one of them. When I previously went online to cancel the reservation, there were NO OPTIONS for that and it did not tell you that you were only cancelling one room, not the entire reservation. I will never stay at the Holiday Inn again and suggest you go ANY other hotel downtown and receive better customer service
