A new fan! Family friendly and truly a gem in downtown Chicago! Our stay was brief but unforgettable. The best was the phenomenal complimentary breakfast and great parking. You can actually check out and leave your vehicle till 3:00 pm allowing you to continue to enjoy all of the wonderful shopping, eating and sightseeing nearby without the worry of "Omg where do I park?" Loved it, love it! Pool could be bigger but hey, who needs a pool when you got a whole city to explore??!!.
