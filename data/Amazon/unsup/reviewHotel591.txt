I can't say enough great things about my experience at the Public Hotel. Not only will I stay here on my future trips to Chicago, the hotel alone makes me want to come back as soon as possible! Here are just a few of the reasons why I love this place: 1. Every single staff person throughout the hotel was friendly, warm, and welcoming. (They must hire them all from a modeling agency because they are unbelievably good-looking too!) 2. The public spaces are not only interesting looking and luxurious but also comfortable! If I have to spend 3 hours working at my hotel, why not do so sitting in a cozy sheep skin-covered chair, next to a fireplace with a delicious coffee drink! 3. Speaking of drinks, the cocktail menu is interesting and delicious as is the food menu. I haven't eaten so well since... I can't remember when! And yet the prices are affordable! 4. The social scene here is very cool. People of all races, ages, and styles make for great people watching but the mid-western charm of the clientele made me forget I was rubbing elbows with the chic and glamorous. 5. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel is just an acknowledgment that we are living in a technology world and should do so without limitations. Charging for internet is like charging for air. 6. Free access to the nicest gym I have ever been to: totally unique design, more pretty people, AMAZING classes, (I'm still sore!), and top-quality gym equipment. 7. Perfect location - walking distance to restaurants, shops along the miracle mile, and just steps away from the shore, (you can't beat that view!) I could go on but I shouldn't need to. Book your room now! You won't regret it.
