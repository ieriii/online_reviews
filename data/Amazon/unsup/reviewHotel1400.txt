I work kitty corner from this hotel, so I recommend that coworkers stay here when coming in from out of town. I haven't been in the rooms, but they say they are nice and clean and fine. I have found the loby bar a nice place to stop and get a drink with colleagues after work. Service was very friendly and responsive. Haven'd dined in the restaurant, but appetizers in the bar were delicious.
