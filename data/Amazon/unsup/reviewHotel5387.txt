While the Seneca Hotel could not be better located in downtown Chicago it was a truly great experience. Unlike others who have written reviews, I found the staff to all be very friendly, professional and eager to help in any way possible. None of the negative concerns expressed by other reviews did I find to be our experience. Flat panel TVs, WiFi, spa tub, all upgrades from the big chains costing at least twice as much. Our room was clean, neat, well appointed, quiet and very spacious. The bed was as comfortable as any hotel I've visited outside of Hong Kong. Having access and/or the use of a refrig/micro/sink made our stay seem much more relaxing then a standard non-appointed room where running to the ice machine is the norm. Based on our last stay, this is our new hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. My only hesistation in not writing this review earlier is that I wanted to keep this new found "best value for the money" find a secret. Give it a try, and if you find something you want changed, just ask, and I'm sure that the accomodating staff will do their best to resolve your concern.
