This is a review of the restaurant, not the hotel. The restaurant is Brasserie by LM and is located on the first floor. I came here in the evening of April 28th, a Saturday night.  Looks can be deceiving - the place looks nice, inviting. However, the food and the service were some of the worst that I've experienced. The waitress had no concept of courteous manners, no concept of how to help diners enjoy their experience and kept pushing us to order a main entree, while not asking what we thought of the appetizer (french onion - a big miss).  The bread that came with the soup was so stale that it must have been at least three days old.  My friend and I were so disgusted by the arrogant waitress (the other service people may have been better but we have no way of knowing).  My friend and I decided it wasn't worth another bite, so we asked for the check, and asked for change to break a 20. We saw the waitress go to the bar and make a face to the bartender, indicating as if how dare we ask for change for a 20 in a restaurant... that was the final straw.   I predict this restaurant fails, as the other restaurants in this location have.  I had hoped it would be better because I like to support South Loop restaurants. This one gets a big X crossed off my list and I will be telling everyone not to go here.
