I booked the room through priceline which was an excellent deal for what I received. This is definitely a boutique hotel with chic nautical charm... not what you would expect to find in chicago's Gold Coast. They have a restaurant and in room dining after 5pm... pricey but the salmon was great. My room had a stand up shower with no tub so if you need a bath tub, I recommend asking for one. They offer both smoking and non smoking rooms. The non smoking room I was in dId not smell like smoke at all. They have free wifi and cute rooms but have out dated television sets. They carry Aveda bath products, keurig coffe in the room and the beds are pretty comfy. Don't drink the bottled water in the room, that will run you $4 a pop (what!?) But chicago boasts some of this nation's cleanest water straight from the tap. They also have a fitness and buisness center. The staff is wonderful which is why all the stars. I feel the staff really makes a place feel more like home away from home. If you need a cab to come get you use American united taxi... (773) 248-7600
