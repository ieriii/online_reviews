Stayed there for three nights starting July 16, 2009. Got a very low rate on Hotwire and then was upgraded because my brother knew somebody that knew somebody. Overall it was awesome. Beds were comfy, it was quiet. Location is great - but you have to figure out how to get to the red line station ( cross the street, go down unmarked stairwell, walk 2 blocks...). Pool was refreshing, but very old-school and not set up for hanging out. Starbucks in the lobby was great. Location was perfect.
