Hotwire listed this hotel as 4 1/2 stars, frankly it hardly qualifies as 3 stars. While the location is fantastic, the hotel itself leaves a little to be desired. I got a great rate through hotwire, but if I would have paid the regular rate I would have been furious. The decor was tacky with peeling wallpaper and stained carpet and there was no mini bar or fridge in the room. Our friends in the room next to us had a mini bar, but we did not. The maids did a horrible job at cleaning the room and did no more than pull the covers up over the bed. Also, there was no umbrella in the room....if you are staying in a rainy city like Chicago you should have an umbrella in the closet! The room was very small and standard. There is nothing elegant about this hotel at all, Hotwire needs to update their rating.
