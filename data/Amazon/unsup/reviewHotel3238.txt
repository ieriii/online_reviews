I stayed at the Hard Rock in one of their suites as a birthday gift. The hotel is nice and has a fabulous location if you're visiting Chicago but what really made this night was the Hard Rock staff.  When I walked into the suite there was a bottle of champagne, balloons, and cupcakes from Molly's waiting for me with a hand-written note by the girl that had a hand in arranging our entire evening. We cracked open the champagne as we toured the suite and checked out the fantastic view from every window of our 36th floor David Bowie suite... sweet!  We had only been in the room for about 20 minutes when there's a knock at the door.  Someone from the front desk had come to check on our accommodations and deliver a complimentary bottle of wine! Obviously the Hard Rock staff are on a mission to satisfy me in every way. *snicker* I meant the wine and chocolate you dirty-minded people!  After relaxing a bit we headed down to the fitness center for massages. I was greeted by name and wished a happy birthday by the two gentlemen that were our masseurs (myself and my boyfriend).  I had never had a professional massage before so I had no idea what to expect. All it took was a brief explanation and a quick strip and I was under the sheet for a full hour of total and blissful relaxation before going out to dinner. We ordered breakfast in our room the next morning. I tried not to yawn in the face of the very perky and friendly young woman who delivered our breakfast and set everything up at our table for us, chattering away the entire time. I just wanted some coffee and to watch the news, poor girl probably thought I was a bum, but she was a good sport and really great. All in all I had a fantastic experience here and would definitely recommend it.
