You could do worse.  Through a very strange hotel mix-up, i.e., budget cuts, I got booked here instead of my regular hotel. At first, I was a big old cranky bitch about that - I travel regularly, so I have certain expectations, and I have to be here for 5 nights. Ordinarily, I don't want to be staying in an Embassy Suites for 5 nights in ANY city. It's nothing personal - they're just great for a night or two, then that's it. Any more than that, you need a little TLC. And, when I first walked in, it reeked so badly of chlorine that I thought I was going to pass out. Not a good first impression. But, the bed is comfortable, they are keeping it clean, I have a lot of room to spread out, I have a great view of the city, and there is a really nice Dominick's market across the street that is keeping me well stocked in the snacky-time essentials (Pellegrino, almonds, and fruit! OK, OK...and Twizzlers. Lots of Twizzlers.)  So, I think it's a matter of keeping your expectations in line - and for that, it's fine. Walking distance to Michigan, close to everything - not top of the line, but certainly not bad for the price, especially when you're travelling on business.  However, if you aren't paying the tab, and the economy's not in the crapper - it ain't The Peninsula! Just sayin.
