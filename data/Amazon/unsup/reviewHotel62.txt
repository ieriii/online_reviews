I stayed here on my last visit to Chicago... all hotels were booked that weekend, so that was the last resort and my expectations were low. I paid much more than I should have for a place like this one (almost $200 a night), but I think their regular rates are quite a bit cheaper if you book your room in advance. This said, the hotel was actually not bad. It's nothing fancy: very similar to your average Days Inn or Best Western, but the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and the room was clean. We even got a free upgrade (larger room). They have free breakfast (kind of crappy, but it's free...), and there is discounted parking at the hotel: $12, which is very cheap by Chicago standards. So... I'd have no problem staying there again, provided I can get a cheaper rate. 3-1/2 stars.
