Lobby: nice Elevator: meh Room: ick! The beds are great and that's about all. The room is old and run down and it feels like you are staying at someone's house that has lived there for 30 years. Also, the room has a terrible stale stench to it. Other cons: have to pay for wifi and gym use and there isn't an iPod dock in the rooms. Staff is fine, but certainly not great. I'll stay somewhere else next time.
