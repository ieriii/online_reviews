We arrived at 6am and they had a room ready for us which was great. Its a boutique style hotel with cool decor. Rooms are cute, but a bit small. Its almost like they are trying to hard to make it a really nice hotel. The location is great, right in the theater district and walking distance to Millenium Park. Overall good hotel for the price.
