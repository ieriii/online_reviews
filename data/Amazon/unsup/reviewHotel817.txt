We visited Chicago for a long weekend and found this hotel online. We liked the idea of staying in a non-chain hotel, but location and price were also important considerations for us. When we arrived, we were greeted at the front desk by Patty who set the tone for the entire weekend. She was friendly, professional, and helpful. We talked with her a couple of other times during our stay to ask for directions or restaurant recommendations and her hospitality was incredible and very much appreciated. We didn't expect that in a big hotel in such a large city. The rest of the staff -- from the housekeepers to the doormen -- were great, too. Our room was on the 9th floor and was surprisingly spacious for an older hotel. We're also a little snobby when it comes to beds, bedding, and bathrooms and we had no complaints at all. We could barely hear the el trains from our room and, when we did hear them, it sounded more like white noise and didn't interfere with our sleep or relaxation.  We definitely enjoyed our stay at the Silversmith and are hoping to stay there again during our next visit!
