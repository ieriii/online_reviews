oh you're so good, so good, so good. Your room service and design rocks. even down to giving out doggie treats outside your door. Your salmon and filet is delish, and excellent turn down service. Gym is state of the art great that other hotels. Thanks to Equinox fitness guru. you rock, and i am your fan.
