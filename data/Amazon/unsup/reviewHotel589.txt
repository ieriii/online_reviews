Hotel management came to a resolution on my earlier complaint, so this is a deserved update. I don't love everything about this hotel -- the modern face-lift on old infrastructure shows through sometimes -- but it is a great hotel at not-unreasonable rates. They also have free wifi, which every hotel in the world should offer, but for some reason many still charge $10+/day (crazy).
