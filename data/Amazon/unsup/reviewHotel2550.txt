You know how you always wanted to wear your hair in an excessive poofadore, or find a reason to try that super intense peacock liquid eye shadow that leaves you looking like a sad mess when you end up crying about your gay best friend who you couldn't turn straight? Well, this is the place for that noise. I went head first into this posh warehouse district club and when I took the dance floor to impersonate the tackiest new wave house moves I could imagine, no one was laughing....BECAUSE THEY TOOK ME SERIOUSLY! In fact, everyone here seems to take themselves seriously...from the $10 valet parking in a completely deserted street parking area, to the bouncer complete with list and velvet ropes, to the $100 Jack Daniel bottles with a price markup simply because you're enjoying it VIP styley. Best bet: show up for one of the million open bar parties they have, get there real early because this place gets crazy packed, and bring dirty friends to deter the smooth walkin' illiterate man action that is bound to come your way.
