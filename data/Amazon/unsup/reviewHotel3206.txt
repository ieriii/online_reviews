This hotel was a lot of fun. I came here for a staycation with my girlfriend. We reserved the room online from their website, and by doing so we got free wifi - holler. but all in all it was a good stay. We checked in around 7pm and the Tower King room i reserved were all taken so I got upgraded for free to a Tower King Suite, which was SWEET. It was very spacious and had great views. Windows on 3 different walls, the only direction we did not have a view of was to the west, and being that I live in West Loop, I wasn't missing much.  The windows were huge, the bathroom was huge as well, but the only qualm we had with the room was the shower was a little weird. The floor of the shower was continuous with that of the rest of the bathroom. It wasn't a problem, just kind of surprising.  We had 2 TVs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. A good variety of channels. The bed was a legit King and was very comfortable. One other thing, there wasn't as much "hard rock" stuff as I would have anticipated. We had a picture of Marilyn Manson in our room which was a little creepy but not bad haha. But If there were more little music/rock things around the room it would have felt 'cooler.' But all in all it was a fantastic stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would love to stay here again.
