Sorry but I feel I have to update this review.... I've now been staying here nearly two weeks and I have had precisely one shower that was hot. No more, no fewer. I don't know how the heat distribution works here but I would've thought that they could channel some of that energy expended on making the corridors into saunas (seriously I have to wait until I'm in the lobby to put my coat on or I'd boil in the lift) into heating some frickin' water. Secondly, my TV does not work. I only discovered this tonight as I had previously been too embarrassed to ask how to turn it on (it wasn't plugged in, but there were two wires and I followed the wrong one and... it's embarrassing, I confess). I was right to not ask because the front desk man was rude and unhelpful and told me there was a switch and there wasn't. The TV sounds like it's got some doppler effect going on, but I'm sitting still. Sometimes there is no sound. SOMETIMES THERE'S LOADS. I don't even particularly want to watch some strange show about tim roth reading the body language of psychotic criminals (can someone tell me what that is??) but at least if I turn it on I'd like to hear all of it or none of it, not half of it. If you open the fridge just once, it hums all night. I think it's to keep the dripping tap company. Again, rant over. I'm still giving it three stars because I understand it's bloody good value and having just got out of the cold shower, talked to a rude man and turned on the broken tv, i'm not in a very objective mood. but really. no.
