If you are coming to Chicago its Hard to beat this location- its near everything- Art Institute, Navy Pier, state Street, Michigan Avenue...etc. The rooms are small but sexy as is the menu and the stuff in the minibar. The Carbide and Carbon Building is an architectural gem and its worth checking out even if you don't stay here. We had a great view from our room- straight down Michigan Avenue. It did not find that, however, distracting. :)
