I really liked this place. Got a great rate here, and was slightly skeptical as most "boutique" hotels I've stayed in tend to favor style over substance. The hotel is in a great location, the staff was friendly and helpful and the interior was stylish without being gaudy. Used the workout room which was modest, but adequate and had a great city view. The room I stayed in was very large (another rarity with boutique hotels), the TV and cable options were slightly below average, room had a great city view. Bathroom was also spacious and nice. Had one incident with the hot water being too hot in the shower and a staff member was sent up almost immediately and fixed the problem within 5 minutes, and was very friendly. Overall a pleasant experience and I would definitely recommend it, especially in the $100-200 per night price range.
