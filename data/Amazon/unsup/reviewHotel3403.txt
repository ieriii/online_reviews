I'm not sure why so many people had a bad time here. I actually enjoyed my stay here. I stayed at this hotel a couple of weeks ago for a romantic weekend in the city. I checked in Friday night, and checked out Sunday morning. My fiance got a Groupon, so we got a suite, free wifi, and two vouchers for two glasses of wine (4 glasses total). The hotel is very nice. It's location is on the Mag Mile, so it's a perfect stop for shoppers. The room was very clean and spacious. I get really paranoid when something doesn't feel clean, but this place put me at ease. I didn't worry about feeling dirty. The suite included a separate living room connected to the bathroom and bedroom. It makes the room more intimate. The room is very modern considering it's a very old building. The Allerton has been around since Al Capone was roaming the mean streets of Chicago. I did read about their renovation, so I could see and feel the newness of the hotel. The lobby and bar is on the second floor. The only complaint I have with their bar area is that it's so hot. The open fireplace makes the area so warm and stuffy. The bar is tiny, only a couple of couches and chairs. The second floor exudes modern luxury. I wished they kept more remnants of the old building. I love historical places, and I felt like it lost that touch in here. The second floor of this hotel knocked off a star. I personally did not have any issues with the staff at the hotel. Everyone seems to be hospitable. No complaints there! Overall, this was a fun place to stay. Considering I really love B&Bs, I wouldn't mind staying here again. If you want to stay at a historic building where gangsters used to hangout, a boutique hotel, or a place that makes you feel glamorous and modern, stay at this hotel. You'll like the location, and you'll like the modern feel of this historic hotel.
