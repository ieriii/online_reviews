Very cool hotel, good location in the Loop! We bagged a Tower Suite at a great price, and man was it amazing! It was like 800 Sq. Ft and was very cool. The view was amazing! Kinda small in the lobby & stuff, but the service was pretty good. We did not have time to try the lounges or restaurants, so that will have to wait till next time. I would def stay here again, especially in the Tower Suite. It was pretty "rock star"!
