I enjoyed my stay here in the perfect location by the Hancock Tower and just off the Magnificent Mile. Rooms were very clean and comfortable and there is a grand old-fashioned lobby to enjoy a cocktail or post-shop cup of coffee. It's an easy walk to the beach and all the great sights of this historical city. I found the rate very competitive too. But the very best thing about this hotel? The grilled cheese and tomato soup! The best I have had anywhere and available on the room service menu.
