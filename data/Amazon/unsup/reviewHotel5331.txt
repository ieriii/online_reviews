didn't hate it, didn't love it. the hotel was a bit smaller than i envisioned. i liked that there was a little bar in the lobby, just wish the lobby was bigger. it was so small could feel the air when people entered and exited. the room was nice and updated, but smaller than i thought. all in all it was okay, not great, not horrible. i might stay again. the cookie was nice. i even wanted the cookie ice cream sandwich, but couldn't see myself payin $6 plus 18$ gratuity and $3 delivery for them to come upstairs.
