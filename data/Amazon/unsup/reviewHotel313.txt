My fiance and I were going to a concert that started at 10, and didn't want to bothered driving back to the suburbs, so we hopped on priceline and got a great price for a room here! The staff was super friendly and the room was lovely. Before we went out, we relaxed in bed, watched some TV, and hopped on our laptop using the free WiFi. Previous reviewers have mentioned the sound of the El, which we noticed, but I guess are used to from living in a noisy downtown area. This hotel was right around all of our favorite spots to shop and eat. Awesome! The bathroom (and entire room, for that matter) was clean and well taken care of. Our room was small, but the bed was comfortable. We both had a great night's sleep after coming home around 2 AM.
