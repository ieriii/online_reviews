We stayed at this hotel in April 2010. It's an excellent location with L train service a few steps from the entrance of the hotel. Staff here is very friendly and accommodating. The suite we had was on the small side and because it's an older building a little noisier but still very charming. Walgreens is a block away and plenty of places to grab a bite to eat. My favourite is the Pot Belly Sandwich shop across the street. Good soup and Sandwiches.
