I am not sure that the people who wrote the four and five star reviews of City Suites actually stayed here. I will say that the staff is exceedingly friendly and helpful and that the 24 hour coffee in the lobby/living room is nice... But you go to a hotel to sleep. And at this hotel sleep is hard to come by. The main problem is noise. The walls are thin enough you can hear your next door neighbors TV. The ceiling creaks from the upstairs occupant just walking around. And I had the misfortune of staying in the room opposite the elevator so every time the doors creaked open you felt as if people were coming into the room.  I give one star for service... one star for cleanliness... but the stars for comfortable and a good nights sleep I have to withhold.
