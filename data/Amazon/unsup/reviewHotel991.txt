Really nice hotel with a very nice, accommodating staff. They were extremely helpful with early check-in and late check-out in order to meet the needs of my schedule. Staff was friendly, room was clean, free breakfast (always a plus!), prime location in the heart of downtown and new appliances (TV, iPod speaker system, etc.). Would definitely recommend Amalfi and will likely be staying there again in the near future.
