Silversmith has that old traditional feel, which is not my style so there was no wow factor as far as interior decor goes here. The metal scrolls on each hotel room door was a nice touch though. Everything else had that old wood "creaky" feeling to me.  Really enjoyed the staff. They're all so nice. I happened to leave something at the desk during check in (where others were checking in too) and as I entered my room, my phone was ringing and it was the front desk letting me know I had forgotten it there. Neat :) This hotel wins for - Location (though I'm sure any downtown hotel would get a point for this!) - Price - not bad for the location. About $200 a night. - Staff - unbelievably nice. The bellman even went on a stroll along the streets with me to show me some restaurants and favorite spots since it was my first time visiting Chicago. Parking fees are NOT cheap though. I believe it was over $40 and I wasn't there for more than 24 hours. Yikes.
