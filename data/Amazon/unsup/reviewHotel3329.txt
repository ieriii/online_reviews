I stayed in the hotel from 9/5-9/7/09.  We enjoyed it. We had a two double bed room, with three people. It is an average size, clean, and has nice decor. I was surprised there was a high def wide screen TV, but I'm sure a lot of upscale, big city hotels are probably moving towards having them standard. The climate control was fine, and the room was quieter than we expected for a city. The valet, bell boy and front desk personnel were polite, helpful and professional. The elevators are quick. Something to consider is to go to each floor to see special items from bands. I wouldn't do it, but several other people were doing it. A shirt and a guitar from Prince was on our floor by the elevator. We had the buffet breakfast 2 mornings in a row at the China Grill restaurant, which is attached. The staff is abundant, professional and polite. This hotel has a nice location. Grant Park is one block away. Cabs and public transportation are available. There is a free trolley nearby that goes to Navy Pier.  This is within walking distance of Bank of America Theater, if you don't mind walking about 8 blocks. We did it in maybe 15 minutes.
