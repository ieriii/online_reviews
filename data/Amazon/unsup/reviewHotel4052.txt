This is one of my favorite places to stay while in Chicago. The service is always superb- friendly, warm and most importantly, helpful throughout the whole stay. They especially treat their platinum members with additional care and make certain that all needs and requests are met. The rooms are better than average. I do feel they could update their bathrooms to make them a bit larger, but the two bed suite or kind bed suites are always spacious and great. The staff is lovely and other than some of the housekeepers being a bit rude, I find this hotel to be luxurious and wonderful for a short stay!
