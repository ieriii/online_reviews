Centrally located on the Magnificent Mile, this historic building is a nice convenient option. Rooms can vary, however. Initially we were put up in the historic tower in a room that was fine but nothing spectactular. (What was spectacular, was how the hotel allowed us to check in super early 7am upon an early flight arrival). Later in the day, we moved to our originally assigned room, which was considerably larger (especially the bathroom, which was quite nice with separate bath and tub). One of my friends had Ambassador status, which apparently ... doesn't hold much weight here (or at least is quite confusing in terms of what one can expect). After repeated requests for water, they brought up one small bottle for four of us. Pretty disappointing service in general.  Also, we couldn't check out the historic pool as it was being renovated while we were there. The gym was small and unimpressive. We were here because of a wedding held at the hotel but not sure if this is a place we would be dying to return to in future visits. Internet is $17/day (unless you have Ambassador status).
