Great location, but the entrance is on Huron East of Michigan, not on Michigan itself. Check-in is on the second floor. I think I got a nicer room if not simply non-standard, it was a corner room, with a tight, but multiple room set-up. Living room and bedroom. Room service food was excellent. Brioche French Toast and Goat Cheese Fritatta were quality. They did forget to give us the sugar and toast though, which were brought back up immediately. Get the pitcher of juice, although it is 18 bucks, it guarantees way more than 3 glasses at 5 bucks a pop.
