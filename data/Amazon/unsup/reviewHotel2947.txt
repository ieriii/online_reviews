PERFECT location, very close to Navy Pier & the Mag Mile. I'm a frequent traveler - I usually stay in a hotel every week. I can say that the interactive tables in the lobby are neat, the hotel restaurant is okay and the rooms could use an upgrade. My most recent stay at this Sheraton property was for leisure, we asked for a larger room & we got a room that wasn't large at all, there were very few towels in the bathroom. After several calls to the front desk we were finally given additional towels. Definitely not what I would expect from a Sheraton, but maybe this was an overly busy weekend.
