Ever wish there were a separate rating for cleanliness/maintenance in Yelp? Sheraton should lobby Yelp for one. This mammoth Sheraton has all the makings of a wonderful hotel: great river view, impressive lobby, lots of rooms, plentiful conference space, and a nice greeter. Top notch at first sight. They even give you a post card when you arrive and offer to mail it for you for free. Nice touch -- But I wish they'd spend those 19 cents on cleaning my room! The rooms are so run down and badly maintained, it makes makes you long for a $50/night motel. Here's a list of things wrong with my room that I noticed in my short one night stay: - Coffee cups not clean - Lid missing from coffee machine - Burned out light bulb in lamp - Broken wire to handset in the phone - Beaten-up toilet seat I'm on hold right now for guest services (using the speakerphone since the hand set is broken) listening to their recorded message brag about their newly refurbished rooms. Too bad they're not newly cleaned too.
