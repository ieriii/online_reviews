I just came back from a two night stay at this place and it's not too bad. If you just need a clean, no frills place to lay your head at night, this is it. I would rather use my money to have fun in the city than blow it on some overpriced hotel. The cable was weird, maybe 10 channels...but HBO did work, so I guess that's a plus, right? There's no microwave, or mini fridge, for those of you who may want to bring food back to the room. The air conditioning worked perfectly, and the breakfast consisted of coffee, orange juice, muffins, doughnuts, fruit, and I think cereal/oatmeal. Not too bad. I'd quickly stay here again.
