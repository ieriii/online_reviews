I stayed here for business at the end of January and really enjoyed this hotel. The front desk told me that they had just finished renovating the lobby a few days before I arrived and it did look very nice. I took advantage of the free drinks at night and the breakfast in the morning. My only real complaint would be that the parking was $44 overnight. I should have just taken the train down from Milwaukee cause the hotel was located right in the heart of downtown.
