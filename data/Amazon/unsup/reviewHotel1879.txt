Quick review of the hotel itself - I first stayed here about 3 years ago. I dig W's because A) I travel alot and W's have a solid theme. You can walk into the W Dallas or the W Seattle or the W Lakeshore and you immediately more or less know your way around the hotel. All of a sudden things become more manageable. B) W's usually have nice gyms. C) W's usually have terrific locations. 3 years ago this one almost turned me off of W's forever. There but for the saving grace of the Lakeshore W - a truly wonderful, friendly home away from home ... However, I was recently in Chicago when the whole darn city seemed to be sold out. My only option was the City Center W. I prepared myself for a sour experience. To my surprise, they have brought things up a bit. Looks like they have replaced the carpets, fixed up the bathrooms, and upgraded the A/C units (less rattlerattlerattle AIEEE!). The staff were friendly and smiling at checkin/out. Things were much better. Better than the Lakeshore? Oh my no. That's still my first choice. But better than 3 years ago? Yes. Give them another 3 years and let's see what happens.
