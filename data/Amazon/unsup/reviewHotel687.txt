Excellent~ Right at the heart of Chicago Downtown... The best Hotel Rate you can possibly find in the 100 yards of diameter... The quality services is the best feature of the hotel... From the front door~ to the front counter~ From the Concierge~ to the reservation management~ Though they claim themselves to be 4 star rating but, you truly get your money worth as 5 star experience Spring in Chicago is just fabulous~ and claim this cozy place for home, for a week, was the best part of my trip in Chicago!
