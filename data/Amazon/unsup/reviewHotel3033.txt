An occasional perk of having gainfully employed friends is the occasional business trip to Chicago. Another perk is dinner on them and a chance to inspect swanky hotels (and every now and again, the inspection turns into a mini-bar/chick flick slumber party). Such was the case in this... um...case. There are a few things to know about this particular W. It's hip. Bumpin' hip. Sparkly top hip. The design choices while interesting, are maybe not the most functional. For instance, the shower is half enclosed by glass with no door so you get a wet floor unless you put a towel down. Also, there's a window on the wall that separates the bathroom and the bedroom which is only closed by wooden shutters (as is the door). If you happen to be staying with someone you're not, say, very comfortable with, you may find it difficult to.... well... shy kidneys, ok? Don't make me say it. The flat screen tv is great, the in-house DVD and iPod players are excellent touches and every room encourages a visit to the sky bar with a free drink card (hello, Mr. Blueberry Mojito). The space is gorgeous, with fresh flowers everywhere that scent the lobby remarkably well. The indoor pool is housed in a space which is a bit dark, but is adjacent to a lovely teak-floored outdoor patio with chaise lounges and a lovely view of the Lake. The rooms are small and the popcorn ceiling was really bugging me given the other fancy pants elements (too picky?). My friend is a platinum member and requested a 4pm check out for me so I could sleep in, however at 8am housekeeping knocked and attempted the door (twice). A few hours later I got a call from the front desk inquiring when I was leaving... hmm. Not impressed by that. Overall I would recommend the W, especially to the young and easily impressed.
