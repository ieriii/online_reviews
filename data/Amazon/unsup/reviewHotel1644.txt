Weird hotel layout. Hotel bar closed at 12 on a Saturday night during lollapalooza. Staff at front desk always seemed harried and overwhelmed. Rooms were tiiiiiinnnnyyyyy. For the price expected better but the room just felt like a mini attempt to be "hip"...it was as if my mom's "decorator" friend designed it. Word to the wise for hotels...if you want to make an older building look updated don't update it with older looking pieces and shabby bathroom fixtures. Also the mirrors all looked as if they had been through the great fire. It was a bit unnerving. I just wanted to look good, but I couldn't tell a thing in them. No wonder I had no free drinks that night! Overall a disappointment for the Kimpton brand.
