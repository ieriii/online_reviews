While I can't speak to the rooms, I can attest to the customer service. My fiancee and I had an appointment at 4:00 pm to meet with someone to see the event space for our wedding. This was arranged 2 weeks earlier. We showed up at 3:50 and were told the coordinator wasn't available yet. No problem ...we waited in the lobby. We proceeded to wait for the next 45 minutes, while the desk clerked just kept shrugging and saying the coordinator "isn't answering his phones." With plenty of other appointments and options this did not inspire confidence in a possible wedding location. We left and still have gotten no response from the coordinator. Their loss.
