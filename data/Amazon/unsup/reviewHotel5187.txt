LOCATION ......LOCATION .......LOCATION!!!!!! Me and my husband, traveled to Chicago for a weekend getaway and stayed at Hotel 71! We absolutely enjoyed our entire stay! Here are a couple of our highlights:* When I arrived, I was floored with the amazing customer service. * We were immediately waited on hand and foot!* Smiling faces and pleasant spirits greeted us.* Check in was speedy and wonderful.* The decor was absolutely divine throughout the entire hotel.* When I stepped inside my room, it was as if I stepped into an oasis of comfort and relaxation.* The breakfast was absolutely delicious!!! Me and my husband are still in awe about sausage, scrambled eggs etc...* The breakfast put is in the mind of homemade southern cuisine. It made us feel like we were at home away from home.* The COFFEE was delicious!!!! I over indulged and had over 3 mugs every morning.*The hotel was immaculately clean! You could basically eat off of the floors!* There was plenty of closet space and the actual room itself was HUGE!*The chaise was so comfortable, that it felt like I had fallen asleep on a cloud.* The VIEW was breathtaking!* It felt as though we had spent the whole weekend in paradise!*This hotel was walking distance to tourist attractions!!!!!!!I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT HOTEL 71!!!!!!!!!!!! I DON'T HAVE ONE NEGATIVE THING TO WRITE...I would most definitely encourage anyone traveling to Chicago to stay at this hotel...
