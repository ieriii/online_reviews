For the price and location, this is a great hotel. It's quiet and clean and all of the staff is professional. It feels like a beach house in the middle of a concrete jungle but it was always comfortable to come back to, especially the gas fireplace. For tourism, it's only about a 10 minute cab ride to just about anywhere you want to go and any landmarks/museums you want to see. I would absolutely consider staying here on a future visit.
