My husband and I stayed here last week for two nights then again last night. This is a funkily redone Days Inn. Sixties/Seventies decor. Very, very comfortable beds. Extra thick and absorbent. We stayed in a Jr king suite which had two bathrooms ! The fitness center is a bit dreary and they could add some 2 and 3 pound weights for us old ladies who like to travel and work out. We stayed here to see our son at Second City so it was an easy walk to the performance. Old Town was great to stroll around at night. The room was quiet. No city street noise because of the neighborhood. However the people in the room next door had a dog who was noisy some of the time. They have been open two months do have some kinks to work out. On our return visit, the room did not have cups in the bathroom and some soaps. Also a chair was missing. It is not luxurious, so not five star, but at a discounted price a good, quiet place to stay in a good neighborhood in Chicago.
