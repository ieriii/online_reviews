Bad experience. Just bad. Arrived at midnight after a long flight. I had booked a room the month before. Was told that they were overbooked, so I had a choice of a "parlor room" or a smoking room for the first night (then get moved for the next two), since no non-smoking rooms were left. The parlor room was supposed to be "better" and have a bed that was "closer to the ground" (??) and they offered to discount my rate. Fine. I get to the room and my key doesn't work. Go downstairs to get a second key. Also doesn't work. Finally they send someone from security to meet me there to let me in. When I get in, I realize that the room. Has. No. Bed. They had given me the living room half of an executive suite (kitchen with sofas). I called downstairs about this and they offered to bring in a roll-away. Incredible. Had a long call with the manager on duty who kept insisting that they had no more non-smoking rooms for the night. After a while, he caved and let me have a non-smoking room from a block of rooms that some other group had reserved which was not being used. So they had extra non-smoking rooms all along? Why the charade? So this new room was fine. Of course, I had to move for the next two nights. To try to make up for the issue the first night, the next morning's manager promised that they had given me a "really nice room". It turned out to be a corner room with great views. But. The heater didn't work. (I didn't try to change rooms again.) After all that, when I was checking out, they had charged me the original rate for all three nights! The person checking me out asked how my stay was. I said, "Well..." and then they comped me for one night. I spoke with some other people staying in the hotel, and apparently the issue with the heaters was widespread. In the middle of winter in Chicago, they have broken heaters...
