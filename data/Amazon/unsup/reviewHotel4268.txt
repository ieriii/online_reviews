I really go back and forth between three and four stars for the Palmer House. On the plus side: - Beautiful Lobby - Friendly Staff - Good price for the location On the downside: - AC in the summer and heat in the winter is not quite enough for what you need - I ordered breakfast off the menu on the last visit and it took almost 45 min to bring out anything (this includes the orange juice) Rooms are fine and comfortable. The hotel is very large and the floors can be a little bit of a maze. Overall I would stay here again based on the price, location, and acceptability of the rooms, so I guess I will go with four stars.
