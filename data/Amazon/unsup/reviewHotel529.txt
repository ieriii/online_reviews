Huh? Did all of these people stay at the same hotel I did? I stayed here for 2 miserable nights and will not be back. The ONLY reason to stay here is that it is close to the redline. I booked a room for some last minute travel right before New Years. Since my stay in Chicago was going to be over the holiday, I wanted to be close to the redline so I could visit friends. This hotel fulfills this need well. The room was clean, but horribly dated. The counter/minibar area was beat to hell. Huge gouges in it, I have no idea what happened. The bathroom was much the same way. The cabinet doors under the sink were hanging off their hinges. Not what I expected staying on the Hilton Honors floor. Putting an LCD tv in an otherwise 30 year old room does not update it. This is all cosmetic, so I didn't care much. And for those of you reading this thinking I simply put down Hamptons, read my other reviews, I tend to stay at Hampton Inns more than any other hotel. This is by far the worst I have ever been to. There was 1 open outlet in the proximity of the bed/desk area. Huh? some of us have to charge our phone and laptop at the same time. Imagine that The ABSOLUTE worst, is the fact it is across the street from one of the busiest firehouses in the city. Nothing better than listening to wailing fire engines all night. I honestly think the guy that was passed out in the elevator when I got back on New Years slept better than I did in my bed. If you are looking for a hotel in the area, look elsewhere, or bring earplugs.
