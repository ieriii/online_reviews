Arrived later in the evening after a long journey to Chicago. Checked into the hotel and given keys to our room. Went up the slow elevator carrying all of our luggage and the keys didn't work. Returned to the desk only to be given bad keys again... Turns out the door was broke so on the third time to the front desk we were given a new room. Second room had a broken shower rod/curtain that had fallen off the wall. Switched to a THIRD room. By this time, we were still not given an upgrade for our inconvenience and it was almost 2:00 (2 hours after we arrived!). Settled into the third room even though the TV did not work and the fruit sitting out was old. Really wanted to like this hotel, but it was extremely outdated and the service was awful. Spoke to management and they were no help with any the issues (and there were a lot). Really tried to give this boutique a chance, but will NEVER return.Great alternative to a Motel 6 or Days Inn. Could not even complete with Holiday Inn... So obviously far out of the luxury category of the Peninsula or Hyatt Regency in the area :( Very disappointed.
