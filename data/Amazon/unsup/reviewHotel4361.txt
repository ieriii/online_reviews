We recently hosted our daughter's wedding at the Palmer House Hilton, in their Honre Ballroom. Jane Himmel, Senior Catering Manager, is unequaled in her professionalism. The event was wonderful thanks to her guidance and the food was out of this world! Everything was handled from the beginning and we were able to enjoy the event, confident that all the details would be handled.
