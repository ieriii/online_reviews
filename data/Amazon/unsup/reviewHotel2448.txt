I like Chicago. When I am there, I like to stay in a reasonably nice hotel close to all the hubbub. The Hilton is a decent enough Hotel. The restaurant stinks but the lobby is beautiful and the rooms are well appointed. It's close to shopping, the El, and the convention center. Be warned, however, that the staff is a little put off by guests roaming around in their pj's on Sunday morning. What?
