Very cute hotel with close proximity to the red, purple and brown lines. We didn't gear the train that much unless our window was open and the only one that would open was in the bathroom so that wasn't an issue. The two bed rooms were large and had a pull out sleeper sofa. Though I didn't sleep on the sofa bed, the other beds were pretty comfy and relaxing after a long day of shopping on Michigan Ave. There are A TON of adorable local food options mixed in with your corporate options all within walking distance. Overall it's a cute place and a good find.
