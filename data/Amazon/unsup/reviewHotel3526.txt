For $100/night it wasn't bad. Just steps off of Michigan Ave. Great views of the city. Slept comfortably. Staff was friendly and valet parking was a breeze. The Elephant and Castle restaurant located just off the lobby is a great attraction too. Great for after dinner drinks and desserts. Definitely would stay again!
