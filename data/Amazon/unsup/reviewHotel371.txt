The Congress is very near and dear to my heart. This was the hotel I stayed at when I came to Chicago and stayed by myself for the first time. It had since then become my go to hotel if I ever need a room on short notice. The hotel is very old but not in a musty, gross, dilapidated, scary way. You can tell that it must have been such a grand and luxurious place back when it originally opened. The lobby is so beautiful with its mosaic work. No it has not been update or renovated very recently but it has been very well maintained. In fact I actually like the way the rooms are just as they are now. I find the Congress very charming, warm and comfortable. It's very clean and all of the staff have always been accommodating and courteous. That being said I do think they must have some sort of deal worked out with Exchequer because both times I asked the concierge/door guy/bellhop he suggested I go there and gave me a voucher for 15 percent off my meal. And this place has terrible service! So I can't imagine they would suggest you dine there unless there was something in it for them But that's another story. Congress also has a pretty decent location on top of everything. Maybe I'm just biased by the sentimental attachment I have to it but I think it's a wonderful hotel and would definitely recommend it. :)
