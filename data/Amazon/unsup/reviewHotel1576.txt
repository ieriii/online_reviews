Even though I live in Chicago, I thought a night away from the house on Valentine's would be romantic. I chose the Hotel 71 for the proximity to the restaurant we were having dinner at, the price and the view of the Chicago River.  The rate of the room was very competitive for the area ($169/night) and the view of the river was great, but I was very underwhelmed with the room overall.  Its my understanding that they are in the middle of renovations and our room had not yet been upgraded and it was VERY obvious. The porcelain in the tub was peeling, the closet door was off the hinges, and there was a gaping whole in the entertainment center where we expected the minibar to be.  The overall decor of the room is also the antithesis of romantic. The comforter and curtains are an ugly brown gingham and they clashed terribly with the leopard-print sofa, which would have been awful all on its own. Service was also lacking. The bar was small and indescript. There was no ice bucket in the room and we had to call down for one. And though the hotel seemed far from full, we were given a room RIGHT NEXT to the elevator. This hotel would be sufficient for a business traveler on a budget, as its near The Loop and the Magnificent Mile. But it is NOT a good selection for a romantic getaway.
