Another Kimpton gem! Wonderful hotel in historic landmark building with nicely appointed rooms and all the usual Kimpton amenities, like l'occitaine in your room and great bedding. I requested extra down pillows when I made my reservation and they did remember to include them, which impressed me. Very reasonable rates as well. I only have 2 comments, one of which is beyond their control: 1) no flat screen tv--odd I think. i'm not a tv junkie or anything, but I think a flat screen is more aprapos for a "stylish" hotel. 2) construction on state was LOUD... so hopefully that will be finished shortly.
