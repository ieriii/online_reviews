My elderly parents needed an ADA compliant room with two double beds. The room was elegant and accommodated them easily. The room was clean, quiet and the beds were "fresh" and luxurious. The door men were always ready to help them in and out of the car. Also, when they did not answer their phone the concierge personally went to their room to make them aware we were waiting for them. The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch only. You don't need dinner because of all the restaurants within walking distance you will want to try from the Cheesecake Factory to The Rosebud Steak House, etc. The breakfast menu is simple and delicious and fairly priced. We had breakfast for $80 with tip for four adults. The omelets were perfectly made and the contents fresh and perfectly sauted. The oatmeal, my favorite, was made well and that means it was freshly made with attention to detail. The bacon was well cooked, but not burnt as I asked. One note, basic single rooms have one king sized bed in a smaller room. If you need two double beds or a larger room there will be an up charge of about $30 or more per night. Parking approaches $60 plus tips for the door man so it is not recommended you stay here if you have a car to park. I made the reservation on Priceline and I saw no difference in how we were treated because of the discounted rate. The sales staff also has excellent email communication skills so you can get exactly what you need and confirmation emails to set you mind at ease.
