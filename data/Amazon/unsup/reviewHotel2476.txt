I lucked out when I stayed here. Came into town early to tour a college with my daughter before staying longer for a work-related convention at McCormick Place. We were able to check in before the scheduled time and the kind receptionist sized me up and suggested a room with a king bed to accommodate my height. We were checked in and were able to drop off our luggage within 10 minutes. Fortunately, the internet was included for convention attendees so that wasn't a sore point for me. My daughter and I had been using the L and CTA to get around so parking wasn't an issue either. My room was on the lake side but in near the lobby. It was larger with a couch in the sitting area by the desk, four windows toward the lake, and a wet bar with a fridge. I can't complain. One event from the convention was at the Buddy Guy Legends bar down across the street. When my friend and I had enough of the Belgian beer they happened to be serving that night, we came back to Kitty O'Shea's in the Hilton and listened to some guys playing some great Celtic-style music. The sitting area in the Lakeside Green Lounge was very comfortable as well, and the park is right across the street. I like the classic old style that this hotel exudes. Sure, there are some things that might be considered out of date, but I found it to be tastefully appointed and the bed was real comfortable. I'd stay here again if I needed to be in the area.
