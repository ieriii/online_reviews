Okay, not going to talk about parking because parking is just bad everywhere and you will pay a lot to do it. 'nuff said! I guess the hotel is a good idea in concept but the execution is poor. The rooms are tiny as are the bathrooms and the amenities are cheap compared to similarlly priced hotels. The front desk staff is friendly in an icey kind of way which was a surprise because this is not an exclusive hotel....far from it. It actually reminds me of a cheap European hotel in decor and amenities. They have the obligatory Hard Rock Shop for your trinkets and clothes. The dining room breakfast buffet is aweful for the price. However, if you aren't too concerned about your comfort while you are in Chicago this hotel is in a great location and there is a Starbucks just a block away!
