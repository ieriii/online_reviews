My parents were planning on going to Chicago for my father's 81st birthday and their 43rd wedding anniversary. When I asked where they were planning on staying, they replied 'Red Roof Inn'. Noooooooo! I quickly called Blu Aqua Hotel and booked a 2-night stay (my treat!) for them. Blu Aqua was awesome! They first looked to see if there were any specials they had for seniors. They didn't at the time, so they offered a breakfast and balcony room package deal. Blu Aqua upgraded my parents room to a corner room (much bigger) with wrap around balcony. They had beautiful chocolates waiting in their room (a birthday and anniversary gift from hotel). They also allowed my parents a super late check out. While in Chicago, my Dad got his wallet snatched (not anywhere near the hotel). The Concierge totally helped Dad cancel his cards by looking online for phone numbers, etc. This would have taken a huge amount of time (and a lot of stress) for my non-tech savvy parents to do this on their own. I totally appreciate how Blu Aqu took care of my parents (especially after the wallet snatching - and helped make such an enjoyable trip). My parents are older (Mom - 72, Dad - 81). It's nice to know someone (Blu Aqu) is looking out for them - when I'm thousands of miles away. THANK YOU, Blu Aqu!!!!
