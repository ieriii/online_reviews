After lodging in a somewhat uppity hotel for a few days, I stayed at the Chicago River Hotel my last night in town. As with any hotel, this one had its pros and cons. Pro: -free wifi. -modern decor in the bathroom. -free bottled water stations by the elevators. Cons: -the floor I was on (11th) smelled like smoke. -bed was cheap. -sheets and bedspread were dollar store quality. So, it wasn't a perfect stay but the free wifi made up for the crappy bed/sheet situation. I'd stay here again, only because it was very close to everything I want to see/do in Chicago.
