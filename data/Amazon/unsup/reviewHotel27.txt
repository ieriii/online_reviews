cheap hotel for the location.. i paid under a 100 bucks a night (not including tax)... as for the hotel itself.. it's a bit dated.. however the bed is really comfortable.. towels are relatively soft too there's only 1 elevator available for customers.. however they will open up the service elevator if it's busy.. the wifi is free and pretty quick too..
