This gets 4 stars instead of 3 because I am in absolute, mad, historically infused love with the lobby and the building. This is a grand dame. The lobby and ballrooms are the stuff of guilded age fantasy-- Tiffany doors, lots of gilding. I just finished reading "Devil in the White City" so I enjoyed the continuing history lesson.  Although I did not partake of the restaurants, the high tea looked adorable and the bars looked elegant and pleasant. They have a Starbucks downstairs!! The staff was increadably nice and helpful. The beds were very comfortable, piled with high quality pillows and down comforters and laid out with soft, high thread count sheets. They were wonderful and relaxing. The room was large, pretty and clean.  The price was not bad-- $118 for a king sized room on New Year's Eve weekend, using our AAA discount. Problems: the noise and the bathrooms. Our room was near the El, so we enjoyed a muted whoosh every 15 minutes or so. The windows were double paned, so it sounded like a very heavy gust of wind, rather than a Blues Brothers tenament teeth rattling. The walls were not soundproof, so I know when our neighbors used the loo or when the maid pulled the cart down the hall. Also the bathrooms were very small. Very, very small. And spartan. Certainly not fitting with the rest of the place. Also, bring change. There are no coffee makers, and the $2.50 soda machines don't like dollars.
