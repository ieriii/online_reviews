If I am ever in Chicago again, I definitely will stay here. Our room was clean, comfortable and inviting. Every staff member was professional. Carolyn on the cleaning staff let us use the staff elevator when we mentioned that there were 3 full elevators that stopped on our floor and we had been waiting for about 10 minutes! I thought that was superb customer service. The location is very close to Michigan Ave and certainly within walking distance to Mag Mile.
