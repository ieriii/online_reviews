This place is cute, but some minor inconveniences made my stay less enjoyable and I won't go back. 1. No blackout curtains in the room. Just a sheer curtain and those fake side panels that you can't pull closed. Nothing to block out the street lamp outside the window. 2. We were the lucky guests who didn't have a do not disturb sign, which we didn't realize until the maid was banging (literally, banging) on the door at 8am. 3. People were screaming in the hallway at 3am. Not the hotel's fault, but knowing that they attract that certain demographic makes me not want to stay there again.
