Warning. My stay here was compliments to my company a.k.a. I'm only writing this review on my stay and not making any judgments on price. I've stayed in Chicago before, near the Drake, and expected similar sized rooms. In other words, small, like what you'd expect in New York. When I walked into my room, I was pleasantly surprised. If I was the one paying for this, I'd probably have my whole family staying in the room! That. Big. Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating, but this certainly is a luxury hotel. Walking in, I noticed the king sized bed and couch sitting more than six feet away from the bed. I then did the usual hotel ritual--looked through/at everything. I ventured to the restroom and saw a standing shower (rain shower for the win!) and a separate tub. The toilet was in its separate room as if this was a master suite bathroom. There was also a vanity. Nice! In the morning, I ordered room service--french toast with bruleed bananas. While the service was really great (he ended coming back up to collect the tray without my calling) and helpful, I would say the bananas were a bit over bruleed. But I guess that's just nitpicking. Although, if I was only rating this off of the environment of the room and room service itself, I would give it four stars. Sadly, poor internet service and the area bumped it down. First, the area: while not bad, there's really not that much to do around the hotel at night if you don't take a cab and don't know anything about Chicago. Granted, that's just a qualm about living downtown, but still. Now poor internet service. First, no free wi-fi in the lobby. For some reason, I thought that was fairly common, but no. $14 per day. Though not bad, the service was SLOW. I tried sending and receiving a few times from my work laptop and my iPhone (with AT&T's crappy service) got the messages and sent the messages even before they were received! Muh. This was certainly a great stay for free, but would I return? Mm maybe. Then again..I live in Chicago.
