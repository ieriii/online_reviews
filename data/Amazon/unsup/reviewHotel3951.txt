This is a hotel with a great location and great prices! I went to Chicago with a friend in 09/2010 to explore the city. We did not plan on being at the hotel very much as we only had 3 days there (4 nights)... so we went for the great deal. After booking the hotel and reading the Yelp reviews, I'll admit, I was NERVOUS. I don't know who is writing these horrible reviews for this hotel, but in my opinion, they were completely unwarranted.  We were central to so many great places, and very close to public transportation. It was about a 15 minute walk down Michigan Ave to the river and the Magnificent Mile. Grant Park is right across the street. The Aquarium is a 10 minute walk. The location was definitely the best thing about this hotel. We spoke to the concierge staff a few times too, and they were all very knowledgeable, friendly and willing to help. I am not one that has to stay in 5 star hotels with every imaginable amenity. When I'm traveling, I view a hotel as a place to rest my head at night only. Why would I want to stay in my hotel room all day when I'm in a great city like Chicago? The hotel was definitely older, but I think that gives it character! Of course, I love older buildings... my home was built in 1895. The elevators were a little small.. but who cares! My only comment was that the hallways on our floor smelled a little bit like an older woman's perfume.... but whatever! Who knows, maybe someone was staying in one of the rooms on my floor with really bad taste in perfume? The room was absolutely clean and acceptable and perfect for our needs. That being said, if you are someone who does not appreciate older charm & who needs top of the line amenities at a hotel, don't stay here. You won't be happy and you'll just be one of those people who writes a really horrible review for a perfectly acceptable hotel.
