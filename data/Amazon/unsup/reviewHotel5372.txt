I was able to get a real good rate through Hot http://wire.com for Wed. 7/13/2001. There was little activity at the hotel.I asked the girl at the desk for a rm. with some view.I said it didn't have to be a lake view, but some city view.She gave me a view of other rooms looking on to a inter roof on the 5th floor.There is no wi fi in the entire hotel,free or pay.FYI, Pickets outside ,because of some on going strike. So expect them to try to talk to you when you arrive or depart.DON'T STAY HERE!!!
