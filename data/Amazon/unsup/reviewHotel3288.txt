Excellent service, all employees so nice and friendly. Treat you like a rock star (sorry to sound cliche). Rooms are loads of fun...instead of cheesy hotel artwork, there's photos of your favorite rock stars and memorabilia. Awesome HDTVs in rooms. Location is great. Hotel is really neat. I would say only for 60 years old and younger. Views are great if you stay in the tower. I also tried out a few awesome Gibson guitars (for free) that the Hard Rock has for guests to use. I know there's a ton to do in Chicago and I did it, but c'mon, this is fun stuff and can be done in between sight-seeing, before dinner, etc. Only negatives: Lighting could have been better in the room...especially at night! AND, be careful to not touch or move anything in the in-room bar like the snacks, sodas,etc. A sensor will say that you ate/drank an item when you didn't. I wanted to put a water bottle in the fridge and moved items to do so! It supposedly happens all the time, but the front desk should warn you about that as $50 of extra charges were on my bill when I took nothing! The front desk removed the charges and understood what happened.
