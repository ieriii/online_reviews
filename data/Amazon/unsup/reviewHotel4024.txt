This place has been RENOVATED! (as of 8/24/2011) so many of the previous reviews may not apply if you see folks complaining about old, outdated decor and musty corridors. First, the Hyatt Regency in Chicago is the largest Hyatt Regency in the US. They have over 2044+ rooms and two large towers. Compared to Vegas, that may seem like nothing (Vdara houses an impressive 4408 rooms!) but here in Chicago, this landmark hotel definitely has presence. I got a deal on priceline and for once trusted my fate at a chain versus the boutique hotels I've been staying at in previous visits and I have to say, for the price I paid, it was well worth it. The front desk was pleasant, check in was easy and the room was clean. It smelled, felt, and looked clean and updated. The bed was large, comfortable, and the shower was well designed so you can let it rain or turn it on power mode to wash out that stubborn conditioner in your hair. The room service was ... OK since the hotel was big and it just takes forever to get anything but aside from that it was a very pleasant experience. This place is almost always crawling with kids, adults, conventions, tourists so just know what you're getting into.
