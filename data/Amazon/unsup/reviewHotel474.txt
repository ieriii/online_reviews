Really loved my stay here especially after my stay at the Sheraton across the street. The rooms are newly renovated so they are fairly new and set up like an apartment with a living/dining room and separate bedroom. There is also a microwave, sink, and fridge which has lots of room for you to buy snacks or drinks, etc. and not full of overpriced liquors you don't want to buy. There is also a Dominick's/Safeway right across the street so there is no reason not to stock your fridge. There are tv's in both rooms so I'd be great for a small family to have some room to spread out. The atrium in the middle of the hotel brings in a lot of light and the glass railings are both cool and scary! The extras that they throw in are what made me love my 3-day stay. Free breakfast buffet, free happy hour from 5-7, a free US weekly newspaper at your door in the morning, and really nice Crabtree and Evelyn shampoos and soaps (this seems basic, but lots of hotels don't give you free shampoos anymore). Oh and they have an internet room that has free printing so you can check-in to your flights or check email. All of this for less than what I paid for a single room at the Sheraton which was decent, but nothing special. (No free anything at Sheraton! Not even good soap!)  I have to admit I didn't have the breakfast here as I was too busy, but the fact that it is offered is a total plus in my book! Yes there were lots of people in line during breakfast, but I asked a couple how the food was and they said the make your own omelets and fresh fruits were good.  The bell hops and valets downstairs are also curteous and friendly. They will help you with your bags or get you a cab in a second.  One tip -- get your hotel on http://priceline.com for the best deal ever!
