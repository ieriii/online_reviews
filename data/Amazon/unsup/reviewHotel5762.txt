My family recently came to visit and I wanted to put them in a place that was close and inexpensive. I walked down to the hotel checked it out and booked 2 rooms about 2 months in advance. Unfortunately, I had to cancel one of the rooms about 3 weeks in advance of my family's arrival. When my parents checked in at the hotel the staff was extremely rude to them about canceling the 1 room. I really didn't appreciate the attitude of the people at the front desk and found them to be rude each encounter I had with both the male and female attendants. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay, I wouldn't count it out since it was clean and somewhat well kept; however if you are looking for a hotel that will treat you like they actually respect your business, I would look somewhere else.
