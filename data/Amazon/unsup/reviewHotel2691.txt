Modern deco, large plasma screen in the room, great in room bar, excellent service, everything you needed with a great location. Defining moment: Called down to have some shirts and slacks picked up to be pressed. Hung up the phone, and didn't even have time to fill out the sheet before the guy knocked at the door. Since he had to wait a second, he looks over and says, "Looks like you need some ice" - then runs off to get some for me.
