Just returned from a 4 night stay and have a few additions to what's already posted....the rooms are adequate, and yes, you will hear some noise from the nearby L-train. Remember, you are in Chicago...if you wish to ride that same train there is a stop only a block away. The comfort factor for the room is great, all the latest gadgets fit nicely on the workspace/desk, the bed is up to the new "heavenly bed" standards, bathroom is well set up (sink is a bit of a mistake, but shower, etc. are fine), and the TV has all the stations you could want. Dined at both the restaurants and the food was outstanding (had the trout for dinner one night and breakfast every morning). Prices are a little high-Hilton Diamond members get breakfast for free-so that's a plus. Overnight parking was $45-again a little high for my taste, but the market rate for downtown Chicago. Next time I may cab it everywhere and avoid that charge. Given the location, you could also walk to plenty of attractions. Rooftop bar was a scene worth checking out...even if it's not your scene. Staff was very attentive, yes, they need some seasoning but they try hard so I give them high marks for that. I will return sometime in the Fall, let's see if they get better at The Wit.
