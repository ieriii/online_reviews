Stayed here for 4 nights & had a very enjoyable stay. Check in time says it's 3pm, but we arrived a couple hours earlier & were able to check in & unwind right away. Desk staff, doormen & bellmen were all very friendly & helpful - quick to give directions or recommend a place to grab a bite & a drink. The hotel bar is basic, but the stools are comfortable & the bartenders are quick with a refill & a joke. The room was very small, but unless you are trying to fit more than 2 people in the room, it is fine. The bed was not as comfortable as I would have thought, but it was OK. The rainfall shower was nice, but the pressure wasn't too strong (use the handheld attachment if you need to get shampoo out). Would definitely return here. I have heard people were treated differently when booking there through Hotwire or Priceline, but I received great service & would return. They also let you print out your boarding pass for free.
