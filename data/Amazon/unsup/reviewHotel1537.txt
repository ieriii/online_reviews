Pros: 1. Great View (especially from the 38th floor) 2. Great location 4. Almost always available 5. Reasonable rates Cons: 1. Loud (especially next to the 38th floor ice machine) 2. Slow internet 3. AC is insufficient, Chicago gets HOT in the summer 4. Rooms are newly remodeled but they clearly kept some of the old stuff.  Not a problem except the desk chair is WAY to low for the desk. An older hotel with a semi-recent remodel, it's a fairly good value for the location. I could have overlooked the loud ice machine and slow internet, but insufficient AC is a deal-breaker. Try to avoid this place during heat waves. PS. Free internet is cool, but as a business traveler we would prefer to pay for internet that actually works.
