The card key never worked. I even got an extra one from the front desk and it stopped working.  The room is big enough to stand up, turn around and thats it. big closet though, odd! The bed felt like a combination of springs and plywood. I think I could've slept better on the floor.  The heating in the building is odd. Its the old cast iron standing system which is controlled by a boiler int he basement. Walking into the room it was probably upper 80's even leaving the window open didn't help much. the knobs on the contraption didn't work.  Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT allow anyone to flush the toilet while you're in the shower. I thought this was something of the past. Oh wait, this place is in the past. Well anyway, im pretty sure second degree burns will happen. I was able to hit the shower head out of the way after the initial scalding. The location is ok, if you like a college town scenario, that college kids are screaming in the hallways between 2-4 am.  Thanks, but.... no thanks.
