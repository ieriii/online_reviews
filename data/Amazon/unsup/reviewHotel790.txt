Note: This is more a review for the hosting an event aspect of this hotel, not the staying here on vacation aspect. When I got engaged, I traversed the whole city in search of a reception venue that screamed "Chicago." Originally, I was determined to have a non-traditional venue, but I begrudgingly checked out some downtown hotels-- and was really surprised at how much I liked the Westin. The ballroom looked out onto Michigan Ave, everything was inclusive of sales tax/service charge so the prices you saw were what you were charged (the 30% was not tacked on afterward like comparable downtown hotels), the decor was clean & contemporary without being too trendy, and best of all, it was nice but without the snootiness. (Seriously, I cannot stand pretentiousness!) The biggest gamble was the food as you sign the contract before the tasting, but it all turned out splendidly in the end. The food was awesome at the tasting and I was just praying it would be the same at the event-- and it was. People are still raving to us & our families about how great it all was, especially the steak. I can attest to its quality myself, as you bet your ass I made sure that I would be eating the meal I was paying for. :-) And while I didn't stay in a typical room, I did get a kickass suite to get ready in, and I took advantage of getting it at the discounted room block rate for the night before as well. Check-in wasn't until 3, but the room was ready for me at noon. It had an awesome view looking out onto Michigan Ave & the bed was plush & comfy-- super important for a stressed out insomniac bride-to-be! This is not your cheapest option for a Chicago wedding, but it truly is a good value for a downtown hotel right on Michigan Avenue, and less expensive than the nearby comparable hotels. P.S. If you do host an event here, and have the money upfront & can make the payments in full, get a Starwood Amex credit card. You'll thank me later. :-)
