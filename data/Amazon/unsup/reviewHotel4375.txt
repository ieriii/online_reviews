Last time I was here I had bad luck with drinks which is rare because I tend to pick great drinks, but when I went last week their winter drink selection was over the roof. I was absolutely in love with it! Drinks: *Berthas mulled wine (red wine, orange and lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, star anise, cloves, vanilla bean, brown sugar, honey): I absolutely loveeeeeeeddddddd this drink. It was pretty much wine that was hot. I know it sounds weird, but it was really, really good. A must try if you go. My boyfriend drank like half of it because he also liked it so much. *Winter dream (absolut vanilla, st german, baileys, whipped cream, cinnamon): this drink was also good if you are a Baileys lover. I wish I had more of a Baileys hint to it though. It is sometimes hard to find seats here and my only complaint would be that I hate it when kids are taking up half the seats. For goodness sakes, it's a bar area and they don't drink, why the hell are they there? Other than that this place was very nicely decorated for Christmas, and I always seem to have a great time here (last time not so much with the drinks though, but this time it was great). The lobby ceiling is amazing.
