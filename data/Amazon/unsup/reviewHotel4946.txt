Chicago's Crowne Plaza Avenue Hotel Downtown (formerly Avenue Hotel) is probably my favorite hotel in the city. Not only is the hotel beautiful and chic, but the guest rooms are a good size, definitely the largest I have had the pleasure of staying in and the service is top notch. A girlfriend of mine was visiting from out of town, and I went for a visit. I absolutely love the hospitality world, and the Crowne Plaza did not disappoint. The decor is charming, especially the zebra chair - LOVE IT!!! Their beds are incredibly comfortable and in my opinion can't be beat. Best of all, breakfast on the 40th floor overlooking the city - just amazing!If you are traveling to Chicago and need a luxurious place to rest your head, this is it!
