During a weekend getaway to the Windy City, my brother and I needed a cheap place to crash after our sight-seeing. We figured a Hilton hotel in the heart of Chicago would be a safe bet. We were wrong. The service and staff were top notch. The location was good. Quick access to the subway. Millennium Park and Navy Pier about ten minutes away. All positives. However, the room was were things fell apart. I agree with many reviewers that the walls were paper thin. Very annoying. Also, the ventilation was poor.  All in all, the room was a major downer. The price online seemed a good value. However, after you add the cost of parking per day (not included) and the not-so great room, I felt ripped off. 2 out of 5 and recommend looking elsewhere.
