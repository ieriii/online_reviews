How can you beat this location? You are 1 block from the Art Institute and Millenium Park. You are located between to L train stations that can take you anywhere in Chicago. You have all the shopping of State street and Michigan Avenue steps away from the hotel. This hotel is gorgeous and elegant and one of Chicago's premier gems. The service was A-1 and the food, both room service and downstairs at the Lockwood restaurant were above average. The rooms were roomy, the bathroom was a bit small, but that didn't bother us. This historic property "feels" like Chicago.....if I were visiting Chicago, I would definitely stay here.
