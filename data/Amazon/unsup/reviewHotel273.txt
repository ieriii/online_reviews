"Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: 'Is this the condition that I feared?'" - Seneca the Younger, Ancient Greek Philosopher While Seneca's meditations on the ills of material wealth are inspirational and thought-provoking, they do not give you much solace when you are staying at a hotel which provides fare which can best be described as scanty and cheap.  The service was no exception. Just one example: I had a reservation for a queen bed, which they would not change to two doubles. When I arrived, I had in my room what was clearly a full sized bed (smaller than a double sized bed). When I asked for a room with a queen, or in the alternative, a rollaway bed, the lady at the front tried to argue that it was indeed a queen bed in my room (without looking at it) and refused to bring even a rollaway without a $50 fee.  Seneca would have been proud of the Seneca, but I certainly am not.
