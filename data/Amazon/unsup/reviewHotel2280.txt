We booked our room here through a Priceline bid process, so we did not pick it, but we got a single night for a room for two for $90 plus taxes and fees, which we thought was a stellar deal! As other Yelpers mention, the location of this hotel is absolutely the best quality about it. We had excellent train access to Wrigley Field and could walk to wonderful restaurants as well as waterfront activities. Getting out of Chicago in the morning was super efficient, driving down Ontario to I-94 for freeway access. We did have some trouble getting to the valet parking entry when we first arrived, as that entry is on Rush street, and when we went past it, it took us awhile, with the one-way streets and the river, to loop back around. The lobby is incredibly busy and hopping, but even so, we managed to check in very quickly on a Sunday. We also had access to our room before the posted check-in time, which was a wonderful treat. We had a room on a high floor with a king bed, but we didn't have views of the lake (ask for that!). The room was not large, but it had everything we needed and was beautifully appointed and very comfortable. In fact, overnight I was sick with a migraine and throwing up, and this is the one time in my life when such suffering away from home did NOT make me wish to be home in my own bed. Everything was very comforting and comfortable. Again, I noticed this Marriott did not include a hairdryer in the room. (I've noticed this recently in Marriott properties.) I brought my own, so I did not mind. Also, the WiFi is NOT included in the room price. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, which we appreciated, and we found all the staffers to be very professional, energetic and attentive. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I have the opportunity.
