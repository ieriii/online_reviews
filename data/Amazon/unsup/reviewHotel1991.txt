Beautiful hotel. Friendly staff. Room was a little small but comfortable. Missed having a tub but shower was spacious. Free Wi-Fi and cable. Their restaurant Filini was delicious. We had breakfast there. A little pricey but worth it. Only drawback was that they never left regular coffee and my husband needs his caffeine in the morning. I called for some but no one ever showed. Thank goodness for the CVS downstairs. Overall a very nice stay and conveniently located in the heart of the city and right next to millennium park. Look for deals on http://hotel.com
