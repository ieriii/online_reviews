I was here for a Chinese New Year Celebration a couple years back and the place was a maze - you could easily get lost here - the celebration took over many different ballrooms and the staff was very friendly in handling the huge crowd and answering my silly questions of getting lost. What makes the Sheraton most memorable for me was after a long night of eating and making polite conversation, my boyfriend (just dating at the time) and I hid away at a small bar downstairs drinking Long Islands listening to the cd that the bartender had playing and he claims that was the moment that he realized he was falling in love with me. Edit: We' just got married there. There were some ups and downs and miscommunication, but in the end, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Robert Neubert was a pleasure to work with and helped make the day go by smoother. Our rooms were a bit small but I love the fact that you can actually get a hotel room with two bathrooms with two double beds - what a great deal! They also treated us to the Daley Suite for our wedding night - what a wonderful experience!
