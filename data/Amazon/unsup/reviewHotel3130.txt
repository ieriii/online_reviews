Like all W Hotels this place is very trendy and cutting-edge and somehow feels like a lounge/club masquerading as a hotel. In contrast to the downstairs concierge/bar/restaurant area the guest rooms and hallways are all very dimly lit and decorated in shades of black, grey and dark pink. Everything is modern, hip and edgy, including the staff. Although after working in a W Hotel on the west coast myself I can definitely say that the employees here were not as friendly or helpful as those in the other Ws I've been in. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my stay here and the location simply cannot be beat -- very central and the only hotel in Chicago that is actually right on Lake Shore Drive. Don't plan on a weekend stay unless you are prepared for the social scene which can include loud late nights full of drunk people wandering around the lobby who are just as likely not to be hotel guests.
