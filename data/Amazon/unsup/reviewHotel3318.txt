Due to unprofessionalism with condo renters, the last minute I decided to throw my friend's bachelorette party in the city on a Friday night. I called around trying to find quotes on suites and every hotel was either way too expensive or booked. The lady at the reservations, she was very helpful and polite. We ended up booking a suite for one night. The day of the party, things weren't going as planned. We were stressed and annoyed. I figured, just go to the hotel and check in, set up quickly, and just relax til 7pm. We get there at about 3:30pm and the suite isn't ready. They apologized and asked if we would like complimentary drinks at the bar as we wait. Tempting, but instead, I asked for free late check out the next morning. Right away she agreed to a 2pm check out. We needed a fridge to store our drinks in for the night, and they said it would be a $10 fee, but they were kind enough to give that to us at no charge. We finally get up to the room and set our things and start prepping for the night. The room was fabulous! Perfect to hold a party, the bed and sofa was really comfortable, it was clean, nice view, and the shower was amazing! Then there's a knock at the door, and to our surprise, the hotel decided to give us complimentary bottle of champaign and strawberries for the celebration!  Despite all the stress we went through that day, the Hard Rock Hotel did their best to maintain a kind and respectful customer service. The girls up front at the desk were polite, friendly and wanted to make sure our stay was memorable and pleasant. The bell hoppers were generous and helpful with the tons of luggage we had going up and down. I completely recommend this place to stay. It's hard to find good customer service these days, but the people at Hard Rock sure knew how to accommodate to our needs! Thank you, Hard Rock Hotel and all the guest service members!
