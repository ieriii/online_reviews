I was a little iffy when my husband told me where we were staying on our surprise overnight stay in Chicago, however upon arriving I warmed up to the old girl as she greeted me with her memories. Our room reminded me of my house growing up, old wooden doors that have been painted over a thousand times, really high ceilings, water that takes a long time to warm up and a bed that felt like a hand down from your Aunt Mary. Realizing that being this old it must be haunted, I searched the internet for confirmation, sure enough there were many reports of odd and unexplainable happenings. My only two experiences with that were, a loud bang that came from within our room, and while just dozing off to sleep the phone rang a half ring, being that no one knew we were there and it was midnight, it spooked me right into my husbands arms for the rest of the night, which is an added perk for the guys! We both slept very well considering there was a massive thunderstorm that night (adding to the atmosphere). I would like to have seen a few more amenities, trash can in the bathroom, a more comfy bed, new carpet etc....Just a little fresher. But honestly I am ok with not so perfect surroundings for the incredible history and ambiance of a very graceful old girl. Awesome location and price, staff was very friendly.
