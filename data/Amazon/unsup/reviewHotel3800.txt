A fantastically modern hotel set just outside the loop. The place is not the cheepest, but if your looking for modern it is a good hit. Rooms are a bit executive looking, but the modern flair is fun and wow the shower is fantastic. Be sure to bring your "honey" almost for the shower alone. It is an all glass rain shower, so not for the kids. The service was very good. I did stay on off days (Sun - Tues), but the doormen to the front desk personnel seemed to know me every time I came through the lobby. They have a nice restaurant in the lobby downstairs open for all meals and a very trendy, almost club like lounge on the top floor with a wonderful view down state street. Overall it was a wonderful hotel.
