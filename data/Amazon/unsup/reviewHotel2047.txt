This is a weird place. First of all, you walk into what looks to be an office lobby and wander around until you figure out that you have to take an elevator up eight floors to the real hotel lobby. But once you leave the cold, sterile feel of the office building-ish entrance and standard elevator car, be prepared to be transported to the warm, exotic environment of....florida. Yes people, this is a Holiday Inn, so you will be surrounded by shades of pink, purple, and turquoise, and other colors and patterns that only a guy wearing a straw hat, hawaiian shirt, black socks, and sandles could love. Despite its really cool location, this is a holiday inn and feels old and worn down throughout its interior. Not going into details, but not a good value for its price. I'm giving this one a slightly below average rating because on one hand its tucked into a nice spot on a bend of a river so if you just so happen to get a corner suite you can look down the river west and watch the trains go in and out of the Oglivie transportation center, or you could look north as the happy northsiders go about their business. On the other side it remains a standard issue Holiday Inn. Pros: * nice location on the cusp of the loop * river views * set away from busy streets and no real low floors Cons: * outdated interior * ugly interior * holiday inn interior Bottom line is that there's a lot of potential here, but for the price they charge, it doesn't deliver.
