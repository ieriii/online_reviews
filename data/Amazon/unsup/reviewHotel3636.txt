Ugh. I hate giving this place even one star. I was thoroughly disappointed. Not what i expected AT ALL. Who expects to have a list with 12 - that's right TWELVE - complaints (in one room) after my 4 day stay here. For freakin' $425.00 a night, someone should have rubbed my feet before I went to bed! or at least I shouldn't have awoke in the middle of the night itching like crazy TWICE!!! This place is OLD and though "The Drake" sounds all hoity toity, it is NOT all that it is cracked up to be. The staff was 50/50.  Don't stay in room 415. It stinks and I think it has bed bugs. I'm not joking.
