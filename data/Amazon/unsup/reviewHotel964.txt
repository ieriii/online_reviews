The wife and I stayed here with another couple while we were visiting Chicago from Toronto. My friend booked this hotel from Toronto since he got a good deal per night from his work. We got there and during check in, we were told that the two rooms were not together but on different floors. My thing is, he booked this hotel a month or so in advance and asked that both rooms be together or at least on the same floor. You can call and put in REQUESTS. When he had requested it, the person on the phone checked and agreed. Yet, when we check in, we are told something different. As always, every hotel is completely booked whenever you need something regarding a room. What's new? So from the first moment, I wasn't happy. We get to the room and it's an okay size and clean. No complaints with that. The continental breakfast is a plus since it's on your floor so you can go in your pj's or whatever. All in all, I remember that this place wasn't pleasant. It's in a good location downtown close to everything you need. I remember the staff wasn't friendly or helpful. The lobby is quite small as well but then again, it's downtown so I guess the space was limited. An okay place to stay at.
