My husband and I read the reviews before we arrived and so our expectations were high to start with... and yet.... the hotel and the super friendly staff completely surpassed our expectations. The hotel is sleek and stylishly designed and you cannot get a more helpful and friendly staff than they have. Aside from the free Wi-Fi, their business center has 4 computers (one of them is a Mac) and a printer and they don't nickle and dime you. The breakfast is good but their complimentary happy hour at their lounge totally blow your socks off -- full bar, they have signature cocktails and real food like antipasta buffet. We definitely will stay there next time we are in town.
