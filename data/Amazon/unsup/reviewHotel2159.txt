I enjoyed a brief stay at the Intercontinental and I have to say that I was fairly impressed. From what I saw of the facilities, they are nice. Fairly well-kept if not a tad bit dated. My companion was laughing a little at the decor in the guestroom. It seemed inspired by Cirque du Soleil, oddly enough. I was NOT laughing at the view though! Straight down onto the Michigan Avenue bridge. Simply gorgeous!! They have an outstanding concierge desk. Maria went out of her way to assist me. I also appreciate that when I called at 6am for a toothbrush, it arrived within just a few minutes!
