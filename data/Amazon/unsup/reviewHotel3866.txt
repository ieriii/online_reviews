Just got back from a few day stay @ the Dana. Very Modern, chic, and alive. The music, the staff, the visual of the great North River view from your room. This Hotel is lovely. The breakfast at the restaraunt in the morning is five star.  The rooms are intimate, and made for lovers, and singles...Don't go here with your family.....the shower has a window, and is just not right with ma or pa in the room. The staff is amazing. A special thanks to TJ and the other bellhops who will help you with anything! The other big positive to this hotel..is location. seconds away from the magnificent mile, rush st, the rock and roll mcdonalds...and my personal fav ..portillos! HA!
