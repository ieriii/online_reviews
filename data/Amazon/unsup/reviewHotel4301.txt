Architecturally amazing hotel...this place is the epitome of the word grand. Some hotels are beautiful, and modern, which is nice...but a beautiful hotel with history and old time charm is priceless. The service, from the check-in staff, to the bartenders in both the outer lounge bar (which I loved), to the bar just down the hall inside the hotel is super friendly. The open sitting area near the bar is comfortable and welcoming. There are bar tables off to one side with iPad's in upright holders, for anyone's entertainment. Bonus...they lowered their valet prices, which is nice, since the hotel rooms are quite pricey. At least you don't have to take it up the yin yang from all directions. I can't forget to mention that there is a Starbucks in the building as well...this is a definite plus for coffee drinkers like myself. The rooms are a nice size, but most importantly...clean! I recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to experience a beautiful Chicago hotel with old time charm.
