I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights while visiting Chicago. The hotel in on Wabash and Erie, two blocks from Michigan Avenue (known for shopping) and the CTA Redline. The hotel is around a busy and safe area. I walked around the area at 11pm at night and I had no issues. There were not a lot of people out at night but I felt safer than other parts of Chicago I visited during the daytime (southside of chicago). They have a friendly front desk who will answer your questions and accomodate your needs (extra soap, problems with the room). The rooms are small but that is fine because when you visit chicago, you are only at your hotel to sleep for a few hours. The bathroom is about the size of your room. They have FREE WiFi and breakfast buffet which had eggs with cheese, sausages, make your own pancakes, cereal, fruit and etc. Hot coffee and teas as well as ice cold water were always available throughout the day. They have a nice, clean, big dining room by the lobby. I like the hotel. The only problem is the ventiliation kept making a sound at night and kept waking me up. I asked the hotel staff to fix it two nights in a row. It stopped for a few hours and the sound came back again. I would definitely go back to this hotel again as it is convenient and not too expensive.
