I'm reviewing from my room because I had to write about this noise problem while I am still experiencing it. It's UNREAL. We're in room 321, right next to the elevator & housekeeping closet & directly across from belmont el stop. This must be the LOUDEST hotel room in the world!!! Els every 15 mins! My bf slept, but no light sleeper stands a chance!! If i stayed here again I'd ask for a room in the back, off the street. Bed was nice and room was clean. High dollar, even with priceline,considering the insane NOISE! Next to ann sathers & close to wrigley.
