Great location! You are so close to Millennium Park and Michigan Ave. The rooms are very swanky. The bathrooms set the bar pretty high. Walk in shower, large tub, bathrobes included. I did have some problems however. I reserved a King bed and they gave me two double beds. They wanted an extra $100 a night for a king bed. I don't think I'll come back for that reason alone. Everything else was great.
