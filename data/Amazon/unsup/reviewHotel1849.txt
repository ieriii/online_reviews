My cousin had her wedding reception here last summer, and holy crap what a shitstorm it was. For one, the food was cold. Every last bit of food was cold. This includes soup, salmon, and fillet mignon - all of which, last I checked, should be at least above room temperature. At least I was served, though. Some tables on the other side of the room never got food, even though my cousin laid out very specific floor plans as to how many of each type of entree each table received. That's just atrocioius, who ever heard of a big fancy hotel not feeding all of its wedding guests? There are two bars, set up in tremendously inconvenient corners of the ball room, so that in order to grab a jack and coke, you had to squeeze yourself between a few tables and knock into about 15 people on your way. The wedding was a Greek wedding, so the reception followed in kind, with a lot of Greek dancing. One of these dances involves the relatives of the bride and groom throwing money at the new couple. Hotel staff was all too quick to sweep up this money on the floor and pocketed quite a bit of it (according to my cousin, anyway). The hotel is lovely; the lobby is modern and gorgeous, and if I were celebrating an anniversary or something, I'd have no qualms about booking a room here. But I'll be damned if I ever think about throwing a large important event here.
