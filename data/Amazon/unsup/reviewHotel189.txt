Five of us stayed here before my wedding, and while the room was clean and comfortable, our stay could have been much, much better. The day of check-in, it was raining. We had quite a bit of things with us, and the bell hops did a pretty miserable job of bringing them in. Worst of all, they had my wedding dress dragging on the floor and dropped my mom's dress for the wedding on the ground outside.  We had booked the suite well in advance, and got a pretty sweet deal online.  Upon check-in, Abraham mentions to us that there are no suites we had booked (2 beds in a separate bedroom, plus the fold-out couch in the living room separated by a door) left, so we'll have to take a smaller room. We balked at this, and he insisted there was nothing that could be done.. until we asked to speak to the manager. Then, miraculously, he found a suite for us. Funny how that works.. The room itself was fine, but a few tweaks could have made our stay much more pleasant. This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in that did not have an exhaust fan in the bathroom. And for whatever reason, we were only given two rolls of toilet paper for five people for two and a half days.. even when our room was cleaned, no new rolls were given to us.  The business center charged the standard BS fees of something like $15 for 10 minutes of internet and $10 to print a few pages out.. and the parking at the hotel was close to $50 a night. There is much cheaper parking a few blocks away, FYI.  I could see this hotel working for someone who just needs a bed to crash in that is conveniently located, but I would not stay here again for a special event and would not recommend this place to anyone.
