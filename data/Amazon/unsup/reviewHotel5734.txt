I stayed here last weekend courtesy of my employer for our post-holiday-party festivities and non-drunk-driving safety. The location is great (though minus one point for not being near any CTA stations) but is also close enough to everything that a taxi ride is quick and easy. Right next to both a 24 hours Walgreens and a Dominicks. Check in was easy and service was friendly (could have given me a heads up about that temporary charge they put on your credit card though). The rooms are super nice and are on the larger size. Rain showerheads and modern-ish decor. Flat screen and balcony (with view of Sears Tower if you lean over and look east). Solid bet for a great stay.
