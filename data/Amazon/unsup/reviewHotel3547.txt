Very nice hotel! Our room was on the 27th floor and we had an awesome view of the city! We found the hotel on priceline for $109 + taxes. Steal! Then, when it came time to park our car, it was $48 for valet, or, the closest garage was $40. Obviously, we opted for valet, (really, what's $8 more?) but were disappointed that parking the car cost almost half of what the room cost.
