One star since negative stars are not possible. Please, for your own well being, stay away from this place. The rooms were hideous, the carpet covered in cigarette butt holes and odd stains, and the bed smelled in the most peculiar way. Stayed in many hotels, motels, inns, etc. and this may have been the worst.
