Hyatt's usually don't let me down...but, this one has sort of (2 stars means that I've experience better). The check in woman was kind, helpful and let me check in early (1030am woo hoo!). That's nice...we all have early flights time to time and just want to put our bags away. Nice...also there was a big bag storage area, so if they didn't have a room, I could've stored my bag (not sure if there was a fee or not though). But after getting to my room...it was very underwhelming. The room is quite small, less than 200 sqft. The room is also unusually dark, I need a light on during the afternoon! The desk is right next to the bed and the tv is on the same desk...get the feeling of cramped-ness yet? The bathroom is nicely appointed and quite large (probably half the room size!).  The 2 stars is in comparison to other Hyatts I've stayed at (NYC, New Brunswick NJ, Phoenix, Albuquerque, etc...I've been to many Hyatts) and this one is probably the second worst. The atrium is beautiful at least, so I guess leaving my room for that is an upgrade. If staying in this part of town, I'd say to stay at the Swissotel down the street. A bit further, but it was nicer there than here. Maybe the other rooms here are nicer, but i can't give reviews based on assumptions and maybes.
