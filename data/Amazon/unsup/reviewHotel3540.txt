One word describes this hotel to a T: sleek. From the moment you walk in the lobby door you are surrounded by modern touches and a friendly staff to boot. The rooms are relatively spacious for a downtown hotel, and the furnishings are very luxurious. After I stepped foot in the room, I never wanted to leave again. Plush zebra print chairs, a beautifully designed bathroom with a huge sparkling clean bath, and the best part of the room, the plush bed that I had to drag myself out of the next morning. I've never ordered room service before but I almost did just so I could stay in bed longer. I live in the city, so my needs for hotel accommodations are few and far between, but should I ever need a room again, I will definitely be staying at Avenue Hotel.
