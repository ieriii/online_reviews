Used a Groupon and had a King Suite for three nights - spacious by city standards. Very clean & great service - needed extra towels & they arrived within minutes. Room service breakfast reasonably priced, delivered quickly & tasty. Bar area cozy with a very good $5 menu - the chicken quesadilla was excellent! A terrific location for shopping & a nice long walk to Navy Pier. Wi-fi was included with the Groupon & reception was adequate.
