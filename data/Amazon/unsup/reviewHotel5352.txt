My favorite hotel/suite to stay at in Chicago. My fiance and I stayed here one night for the first time in Dec 2010 for his birthday and it was fantastic. The room was comfortable and clean. It felt like a small apartment. We had a great views of the lake. There was a complimentary happy hour the night we checked in and breakfast the next morning was great! I would definitely stay here again....and again :-)
