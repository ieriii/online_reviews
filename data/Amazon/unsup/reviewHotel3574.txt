A wonderful hotel, very classy, very charming, very much out of my price range, but along came Priceline and this is where we ended up on our first trip to Chicago. I always prefer the more mid range hotels because they have a few little things included like breakfast, wi-fi, etc. I know that if i stay at a higher end place these things are gonna cost, and it always makes me a bit grumpy. We ended up not eating a bit of food in the hotel because it was just so far out of our price range, and the free wifi in the lobby was in hot demand (not only by us). Our room wasn't all that tiny, I was expecting much worse, but it was a typical big city hotel room. I was very thankful for clean towels that didn't stink like bleach and for a decent room darkening shade so that I could actually sleep in a bit. We stayed 2 nights and even though our coffee cups were replaced the coffee and tea was not replenished. Not that big of a deal since we got coffee at breakfast outside of the hotel, but I do enjoy a cup when I am getting ready. Located at the very top of the Magnificent Mile, we were actually very thankful to be there because it forced us to do a lot of walking, which we definitely needed after eating tons of great food. This is the ideal hotel if you are visiting Chicago and going to the American Girl store, tons of girls with creepy dolls everywhere, and I imagine we'll be back very soon with my daughter. I would give 5 stars, but the lack of any breakfast option included and in room wi-fi being included is a star to me.
