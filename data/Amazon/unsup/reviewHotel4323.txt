Beautiful hotel in a great location with friendly staff. The one-bedroom suite is a must- give yourself a little more room and a little more view. If you're looking to self park, it's a bit of a walk- about 1.5-2 blocks. I wouldn't recommend self parking in the winter time. If you're looking to walk around at night, this is not the hotel for you.. not too much going on after the shops close around here. Some rooms do come with a refrigerator- if you need it, ask for it. Food and drinks are pricey and not too special. I'd suggest getting out and finding one of thousands of great restaurants Chicago has to offer.
