I recently came to the city to do House Hunting for work and because nothing was preferred with my company in the area, I chose the Holiday Inn as I have always been happy with their service; however, there is a first time for everything. I will start out with the good: - Beds are super soft - Wireless was fast and had a good connection - Close to Clinton Blue line Now the bad: Before taking a shower, I noticed that there was shampoo, and two bottles of lotion. My companion called the front desk to get some conditioner thinking the maid just mixed up the bottles because they look similar. Within minutes (good) a man was at our delivering four bottles. However, upon inspection we saw that it was two shampoos and two lotions. We were a bit mystified and wondering if you could use lotion for conditioner all rational thought says no, so we called the front desk again proposing the question. Her response was rather rude as she stated lotion was lotion not conditioner.  Next, the walls are thin. We could hear everything going on in the hallway as well as the neighbors coming back in their drunken stupor at 4 am. Not to mention because the hotel is located close to the interstate and subway, there is a lot of noise at night. The hotel parking is not free. There is a $35/day charge but you can get it for $25 if you sign up for something for free. There is a parking lot located below that you can pay per day but it was very sketchy. As we were walking to the subway, three men were hanging in the area and yelled very rude comments and six hours later when we returned they were still there. I am glad I was not alone as I did not feel safe. No complementary breakfast Finally, there was no refrigerator or microwave so I could not heat up my amazing leftovers from Artisan catering!  Final Review: This place is not worth it
