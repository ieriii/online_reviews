One of my friends in Chicago was diagnosed with kidney disease and I desperately wanted to see him. So, we shopped around online and landed a good deal with Hotel Allegro. Our flight to Chicago was scheduled to arrive at 7:30 am. We called the hotel and asked if we could have early check-in and explained to her the reason of our visit. The manager on duty was terrific and extremely helpful. Since the hotel was not fully booked, it was no problem checking in at 8 am with no extra charge. Now, that's a service! To top it all off, she did a research before we arrived and gave us a list of flower shops, in case we want to get some flowers for our friend in the hospital. Yes, the room was small. But it was beautifully decorated, with touches of modern and glam decor. Marble bathroom and vanity. It was clean. The bed was comfortable. Good location and fairly quiet at night. Our verdict? We would definitely stay there again.
