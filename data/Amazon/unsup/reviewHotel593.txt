I was initially excited about this hotel, but after staying here a couple of nights, I was disappointed. We had a 2 room suite, and while the rooms were large, the bathroom was tiny for the size of the suite, but it had two walk-in closets. Who needs that? Go figure. Also, if you drink coffee, there is no coffee maker in the room, forcing you to order room service at $7-9 dollars a pot. No hair dryer in the room, and minimal toiletries. They didn't even replace them the next day. We had requested a room early on the highest floor and they gave us one on the 6th. It has 17 stories, I believe. Also there is not even any complimentary coffee in the lobby. I went to the bar area to buy some. $3.50 a cup! I just went and got some down the street at Starbucks. Also, no exhaust fans in the rooms. On, the positive side, the lobby and Pump Room were renovated well, and full of trendy people on Friday and Saturday night. The staff was nice and efficient, good customer service for the most part. The drink prices are on the high side, even for Chicago. Would I stay here again? No, there are much better places in Chicago.
