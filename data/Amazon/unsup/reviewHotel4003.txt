The beds are really comfortable, but that may be one of their only redeeming factors. At 7:30am there was a really loud knock on our door that woke us up. Confused, my friend got up and opened the door. For some reason a maid decided to bang on our door and walk away. Really? We went down to the front desk and complained, which got us 2 vouchers for brunch at the bistro. Their buffet was not worth the $22/person, and we would have been very unhappy if we had actually had to pay for it. There's nothing special about it at all, but at the same time it wasn't bad.  The location is good, and the people at the front desk are nice. It's also super busy, because it seems like huge groups on business choose the Hyatt Regency. I only stayed here since my friend was visiting for the weekend and didn't want to trek back to my apartment. In the future we'd definitely book somewhere else.
