I stayed here for a nursing conference. Reservations were easy to get, the rate was great compared to the Grand Hyatt it was recommended we stay in, it was a 6 block walk from the Magnificent Mile, and free parking. Great, right? There's a billboard in the parking lot of the hotel. EVERY morning at 6am, work started on changing the billboard. Really? I could hear my neighbors talking in the bathroom, and the full conversation of the people upstairs. So quiet, not so much. Everything was clean, but smelled funny. Disinfectant funny. The bed was very comfortable. The facility had 3 elevators, and not all of them would get you to where you had to go. My car stayed underground and came out in 1 piece. No breakfast, but walking distance to lots of great places. The staff was great, very efficient. Until 5am when I got up to take a shower and had ice water. I called to the front desk and got a "run it awhile, it should warm up" after 10 minutes the water was still ice. In fact, after 14 hours, the water was still ice. I went to the front desk, and somehow it got fixed-well at least to the point I wasn't going to freeze in the shower. The knob was all the way to "scalding" and the water wouldn't pass to steep tea. The staff gave me suggestions for bus routes and passes, extended my checkout to 2pm, and worked with me on a payment issue for my stay, all of which was greatly appreciated. Would I stay here again? Unlikely.
