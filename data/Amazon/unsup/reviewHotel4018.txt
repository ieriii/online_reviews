Book your room on Priceline. I named my price and got a killer deal on a room. This Hyatt is a symbol of luxury and fine hospitality. The staff are extremely helpful and will accommodate most of you needs with in reason. Check in is usually around 3:00 pm but since my flight came in at 10 they let me check in at 11 am and also gave me a late check out till 2:00 pm the next day (fyi: if they're not fully booked, they will do this for you as well). The rooms: extremely warm and welcoming with comfortable beds and a clean toilet. However I do wish there was a little more lighting available in the room. Food/Room Service: highly expensive. Michigan Ave is a block away and a lot of restaurant in the neighborhood so I would not recommend eating here if your looking the save a buck Parking: don't drive. take the cta
