Discovered this hotel with an online advertisement, we picked to stay at Hotel Burnham because of its convenient location and historic interest. We always liked more boutique-style establishments than their big-name counterparts. Moreover, Kimpton chain's super nice pet policy was an A-plus when we traveled with our dog. Service from front desk to housekeeping was across-the-board attentive, courteous and friendly. The architecture was unique and interior was bohemian. Only did I wish they had a glass of absinthe waiting for me at the bar but they did serve you glasses of red or white wine at the turndown hours. Although the size of the room was relatively smaller, the high ceiling compensated the area and made it feel not as claustrophobic. We loved having a descent restaurant in our hotel and the hotel's Atwood Cafe was fantastic. Food was up to par with some good restaurants. At least we kept going back for several more meals. We had no regrets staying at Burnham and for sure we would look for other Kimpton hotels in other cities too.
