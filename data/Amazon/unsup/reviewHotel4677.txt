We stayed at the Felix for a weekend in Chicago for fun. The hotel is located about five blocks from Michigan Ave. It is a quick walk to shopping and dining options. The rooms are small but, I have stayed in other hotels in Chicago that are the same size. If you are coming to Chicago, are you going to be in your room all day? They also allow you to park for free if you drive a hybrid. We have a Prius so that saved $42 a night for valet parking. The rooms are comfortable but, the walls are a little thin. Again, something I have experienced at other hotels. Overall, a great stay at a great little hotel. If you want to stay in Chicago and want to be within walking distance of a LOT of stuff, keep the Felix in mind.
