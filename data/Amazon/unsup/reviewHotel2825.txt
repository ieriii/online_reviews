we were there for a new years wedding. the wedding was great, the food was very good. i don't love bleu cheese, so i didn't have the salad ( there were no choices) but the fillet and salmon were excellent. the ballroom was a little chilly but when we were dancing later, it felt good. maybe turn on the a/c a little closer to the end of the meal? the breakfast the next morning was good, there was a nice variety to choose from. i was a little hungover, so didn't eat much. but my husband, who is a lover of all things breakfast, enjoyed his fine. the room however was lacking. we got there early, my husband was in the bridal party. check in was 3, we got there at noon and our room wasn't ready. they did have another room available and switched us no problem. the remote control for the tv wasn't working, the linens from the previous guests were in the hall until at least 4pm ( i know noon was the previous check out time, so i understand at first. but 4 hours later?) the toilet had a broken handle that had to be manipulated to work. we had a special rate for overnight parking, but had to go to the front desk to have the bill fixed. we probably won't be back, but then again we have small kids and a hotel downtown isn't high on our list right now. :)
