The staff was wonderful! Everyone was very nice and very helpful. The Concierge was great! The room was just fine for a family of four. It was much bigger than most rooms with two queen beds. The location was great and hotel was very clean. I loved that the hotel was in a great location yet very quiet. We heard NOTHING at night and in the morning.  I will definitely stay here again.
