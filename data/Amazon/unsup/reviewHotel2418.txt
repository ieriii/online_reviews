The reputation far exceeds the reality of this place. Yes, it's old, and yes, famous people have stayed here. That's about it. The rooms are NOT luxurious in any way. The cleaning people didn't even do a very good job. Our tub was always clogged and gross. And the elevators? Horrendous. You'd think with that many people staying at the hotel, they'd have fast moving elevators. No way. The best thing about the Chicago Hilton is the guy who'll call a taxi for you and open the door. That was the highlight of my stay at this hotel.
