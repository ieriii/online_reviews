My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel because it was pretty cheap (112$ a night) and had some great reviews. I have to say, we were overall pleased with it. When we got there, the staff was VERY nice and helpful. Our room was very cute, very clean, but very small. Not a big deal thought if you're not going to spend too much time in it. The hotel was right across from Lincoln Park (really pretty park with a free zoo in it). And close to buses and trains that would take you downtown or to several attractions.The only negative point I could think of when it comes to this hotel is the parking. You can do valet for over 40$ a day. Instead, we parked at a garage a few blocks down for $20 a day, and used the transit system the entire trip.
