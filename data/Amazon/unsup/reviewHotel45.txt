If you want a reasonably priced, clean, non-chain downtown Chicago hotel that's close to the Gold Coast, Mag Mile, CTA, etc. and can live without trendy decor or practically any amenities, this is a good option. As others have said, the decor is outdated, but the antique-like furnishings do give this place character, and it's very clean. You can't beat location -- stores, restaurants, lakefront, etc., are all very walkable. With the exception of wi-fi and shampoo/handcream in the room, this place offered absolutely no amenities -- even the free continental breakfast they offered last time I was here is gone, and they charged me $3 to store my luggage for a couple hours after I checked out -- every other hotel I've ever been to does that for free. All in all, I wanted a reasonably priced, clean, convenient place to crash while I was in Chicago, so this was a great option, but on trips to Chicago where my company is paying or I want a little more comfort, this would not be at the top of my list.
