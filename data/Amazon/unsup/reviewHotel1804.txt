I was coming back to Chicago for a quick weekend and thought it would be fun to stay at a hotel since I was bringing a friend from Minneapolis. The W actually was the cheapest hotel in the city that weekend (and still by hotel standards not cheap). I had never stayed at a W, only have heard about its character. The front (desk? Counter? Pod?) person was super nice, as well as the bartenders in the lounge. I thought the room was cute. Yes, small but not the smallest I've been in. My friend, who has stayed at W's in other cities said while this room was nice, it was not as fresh and updated as the one in Mpls or San Francisco. However, I did love the amount of electrical outlets. Many outlets at a hotel are a must these days! If we weren't really there to just sleep I would have probably taken more advantage of the concierge concept. Looked and sounded great! Notes: if you are a new Chicago visitor and want to be walking distance from anything, I would stay a little more east and north. This place is quite alright if you don't mind always hopping in a cab or on the train. There are tons of garages nearby if you don't want to $55 overnight park. I paid I think $12 bucks at one at Franklin and Wells for 12 hours. I'd stay again for sure.
