Luckily for me, work pays for my hotel and the Westin River North has been great so far. The interior is, in a word, classy. I've heard that the hotel was an Asian themed hotel in a prior life, and you can definitely see it in the decor. The house restaurant has sushi available for room service, haven't tried it but I've heard it's pretty tasty. I did look at the prices and it didn't look any more expensive than a regular sushi place. The rooms are great. Bathrooms are huge and sleek, dual-shower heads and big towels. The beds are...well Westin Heavenly Beds. Super comfortable and takes about 10 seconds to fall asleep. Good views of the river and right across from House of Blues doesn't hurt either. Location isn't bad, close enough to walk to places like Rockit and there's a 7-11 close by for snacking needs.
