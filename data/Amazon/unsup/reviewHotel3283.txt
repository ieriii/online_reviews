Overall, I wasn't too impressed with my stay. The rooms could use more sound proofing and a furniture upgrade. I had an unimpressive view of a office building and got a wake up call that I didn't ask for or need. They could also use a concierge upgrade. On the plus side, they offer free high-speed WI-FI, the location is solid, the rooms clean and the exercise room is decent.
