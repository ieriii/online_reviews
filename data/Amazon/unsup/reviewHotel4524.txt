If the rooms in this hotel matched the style and substance of the lobby, boy would this place be something. As it is, most of the rooms I've stayed in are indistinguishable from a Holiday Inn. The bars in the hotel are decent, but the concierge staff doesn't do so good - rely too much on recommending the restaurants right next to the hotel, which are less than good.
