I would give this hotel a 5 star rating for the views alone, if my stay hadn't been so horrid. Let's just say the rooms service it almost non-existent, as well as the management. The room was average, like what you see at a Hilton. I was not happy overall--I wouldn't stay at the Embassy Suites again.
