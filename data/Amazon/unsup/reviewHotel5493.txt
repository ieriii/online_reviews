My fiance and I stayed at the Sutton this past weekend 3/11 - 3/13. Although the location was great, our biggest issue with Sutton Place was the overall service, and the valet. There were hardly and bellmen present to help with bags, and doors were not automatic. When employees at the hotel saw me struggling with my bags and trying to open door, no one offered to help at any point in time even though concierge was present. As for the Valet, it was a complete disaster. We would call 15 minutes in advance from our room for our car and be told it'd be ready in 15 minutes. We come downstairs and ended up waiting 20-30 minutes in addition to the 15 min heads up we gave the concierge. This happened on 4 occasions throughout the weekend. Each time we called down for our car, we would end up waiting another 20-30 minutes in the cramped lobby. I would expect when parking is $45/night, the time it takes to get the car would be more efficient. We were late for multiple engagements because of the timing of valet even when we gave advance notice. This seems to be a recurring issue for the hotel as they are not staffed properly in this dept. Also, the staff that was on hand was not friendly or helpful. Valets/concierge did not open doors or assist with luggage to and from car. Overall, our stay at the Sutton place was a stressful and uncomfortable one. Will never stay here again. Much prefer the Sofitel a few blocks down the street.
