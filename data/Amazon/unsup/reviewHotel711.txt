I stayed at this hotel tons for business. I knew the front desk folks by name, and they knew mine, too. They made an extra effort to make my stays go smoothly (even before I stayed with them often). The Starbucks in the lobby is convenient if not the smoothest running location I've seen. Remember that Courtyards are for business travel, so there's a concentrated rush in the morning. Viand has to be the best restaurant I've ever seen at a Courtyard. High quality breakfast foods (sorry, never tried other meals) cooked to order (buffet on weekends I think). The staff are attentive and caring. If you ask for a dinner recommendation they won't just give you a photocopy sheet like some places (though they do have a brochure)--they'll talk you through what you're in the mood for, and tip you off to newer places if you're into that. This is not a luxury hotel, as CY's are not, but the service is classy! I like that.
