I've stayed here twice. First, my fiance (at the time) decided to celebrate our "half way through our engagement aka half way of living like a college student because weddings cost a small fortune" weekend. We stayed at the James for free as part of a promo package for Gen Art. It was wonderful! We both had a fantastic time. 5 months later, my lovely bridesmaids decide to rent a double room for my bachelorette party! It was SO MUCH FUN.  Before the festivities began, I hung out with my 3 maids in the room and we all got ready together. Then, the rest of the girls arrived for a private shower. Since there were only a dozen girls, we were comfy. I wouldn't put any more in the room though- they are a little right. Do you know why I know that my bridesmaids love me? They let me take the Kiehl's tolietry samples home.
