Do not book this hotel using an online site like http://Hotels.com. We booked a King bed non smoking for a one night stay to celebrate our anniversary. Upon arriving a very rude front deck clerk informed us that they"Crowne plaza metro" did not have to honor our King bed booking because it was made with an online service and instead we were going to get a Double room. If we didnt take it we would lose ALL the money.Final in the room we find two small beds. Im a big guy. So, To make a long story short. After all the planning and money spent, I spent my anniversary sleeping alone! My wife woke the next day with a rash from the detergent they use. (We hope thats what it was) So thank you Crowne plaza Metro for an Anniversary that nether my wife or I will ever forget!
