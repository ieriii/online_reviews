Chose this hotel for price/location. This is a older city hotel- rooms are smaller than you might be accustomed to. That's not a negative, simply a head's up. Prices are reasonable for the location: South Loop in Chicago, Within walking distance of Natural History Museum, right across the street from Grant Park, and close to Columbia College Chicago and DePaul. Easy drive to McCormick Place. Great location! Bed was comfortable, sheets were soft and in good condition. Pillows sucked. Worst pillows I've ever slept on- stuffed with lumpy little pieces of foam. They could/would not give me an extra pillow. A/C was super noisy but it worked. We stayed in a king suite, which is an open L-shaped room w/ a king bed, and a loveseat /single pull out bed in the 'L'. No privacy between the living and bedroom areas, so if that's an issue, get two rooms. No blanket for the pull out bed and three single size pillows for the whole room to use- all lumpy, btw. Fridge and microwave in the room. Again, it's an older city hotel so they don't splurge on space. Great views of the city. It's close to the "El" so you will hear the train rumbling by every 10-15 minutes during the day, less at night. Parking is valet with in and out privileges. It fills up quickly so you will have to call to specifically reserve a space or check-in early. We were unaware of this. There is a public valet parking garage right next door for a few dollars more but without in and out service. However, you are in such a great location that you can walk or take public transport or a taxi with no problems. I would stay here again because of the location/price, and I would recommend it, but, those pillows... oh my gosh... Please fix those pillows!
