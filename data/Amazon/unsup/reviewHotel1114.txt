I have stayed here a number of times. The rooms are very cool. The restaurants/bars are more numerous than the nearby Swiss, but the in hotel restaurant Aria doesn't compare the the Swiss's powerhouse Palms. The Aria Bar is a sushi bar that is more like a club for downtowners at night. The wine bar inside the Fairmont though is very nice and has a good selection. Hopefully you know a lot about wine because the few times I've beent here the person working didn't and actually gave me information I knew was incorrect. There is another Eno bar down Michigan that is better in my opinion, but if you just want a drink or two before bed this is a good place to go.
