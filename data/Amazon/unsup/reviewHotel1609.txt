When I did alot of business in Chicago, I always wanted to stay at this place. Finally I arranged things so that'd happen. I ended up with a room that had a nice view of the river, but I was about two feet from the elevators. Service seemed dismal, at the time the bar didn't have an alcohol license yet (the hotel had been open at least a year). There's so many other great hotels in Chicago, spend your money elsewhere.
