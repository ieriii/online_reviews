There is a reason why I like boutique hotels. First, it's small and that usually means great customer service. Second, the products are usually better. Third, I like knowing that I'm in an unique hotel. Which is exactly my reaction from my recent stay at Hotel Felix. Great customer service from check-in to check-out. The room was smaller than I anticipated but that didn't mean I didn't LOVE it. I adored it! A bit pricier than I would have preferred but it was so wonderfully located in downtown Chicago I just couldn't complain. I highly recommend!
