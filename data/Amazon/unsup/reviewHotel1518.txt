The best hotel! The view was ok, but the room & staff made up for it! Very clean, friendly. Right from the first step out of the taxi, bell hop, front desk. Not the first complaint. Close to everything! Would stay here again. We stayed in the jr suite, and had plenty of room. Really loved this hotel. Came into town for a Bears game, close enough a taxi only cost about $6.
