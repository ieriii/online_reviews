I have a personal understanding of the hospitality industry and I know how hard the business really is. This is why I'm super impressed with my stay at this Marriott and plan to write a personal email to the front desk managers to honor some extraordinary staff members of his such as Crystal Kwak and John. My stay at the hotel began with a sour note, due to my flight delay i didnt not arrive until 11pm and came to find out that there is no room at this marriot for me even though I have a confirmed reservation. John, the front desk staff, explained the situation and a room was quickly rebooked for me at James Hotel which is just 1 block away. Without me requesting it, a staff member, Rick, walked with me to James hotel for safety measures. Exhausted from 15+hour of travel, my stay at the James hotel was a pleasant one. The next day, when I "re-check in" at the front desk I was greeted with Crystal Kwak, an assistant front desk manager. I told her my name and she had the look immediate that she knew me, she told me how sorry she was to know that I had to get re-booked to another hotel last night and that she's so glad I'm staying here now. Her warmth and sincerity resonated with me and I, too, was glad to be back in Marrriott. Afterward unpacking my bags, I had a surprise room delivery of a complimentary bottle of Merlot, 2 iced bottled water and a large box of mint chocolate. Needless to say, I went back to Crystal the next day and thanked her personally to make my stay a pleasant one. This hotel has amazing location, close proximity to just about everything, staff is courteous and thoughtful, and this is for an extremely busy hotel that's buzzing all the time (yes even at 11pm!) Which only makes me appreciate all the personal touches even more because it's easy to forget a customer's value in a sea of customers but they didn't do that. I would come back and stay here again and would recommend this hotel for your downtown Chicago stay.
