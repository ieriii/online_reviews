My sister and I stayed at the Congress Hotel on June 8th, I liked it alot. The decor was beautiful we took pictures in the lobby. We had a drink at the bar which had very nice workers. Check in was easy. Our windows didn't face the park but we only slept there. The room was nice and cool and I loved the pillows. The decor was nice. And you couldn't hear people walking and talking in the hallways or in the next room like you can in alot of other hotels. We ate dinner in one of the inhouse restaurants it was pretty good. The only downside was the restaurant in the lobby that only serves breakfast, skip it, we waited almost 40 minutes for eggs, and my sister said the bacon tasted funny. There where lots of people going to the bathroom in the lobby. Since there are bathrooms in the rooms I guess alot of people come in off the street. Not cool. Yes, I would stay at the Congress Plaza again with or without the ghost.
