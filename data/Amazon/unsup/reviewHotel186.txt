I recently had a wonderful stay at this Hilton location. The linens and curtains were surprisingly modern and tasteful (unlike at some hotels - ahem, plaid, floral, etc!) in neutral colour offerings and the suite was very spacious. The hotel itself was very quiet and insulated from all outside noise. I booked the room using http://www.hotwire.com (highly recommended). The hotel was perfectly located in the popular "Magnificent Mile" near several subway lines. If you want to experience "the windy city" this is the place to do it as there are so many tall buildings surrounding it, it's constantly blowing!! Conveniently located right across from the John Hancock building. The only downside is the internet - you can get wi-fi in your room but it's expensive ($12.95/day) or you can use the business centre if you're even MORE of a moneybags (pay by the minute I think). IMO it should be more affordable, especially for such a large hotel. Would definitely stay there again for a no fuss, flexible stay. Check in/check out times were reasonable and they gladly held our bags for no charge after we had checked out so we could enjoy our final day without baggage.
