I proudly was a resident of this amaaaaaaaaazing hotel when I was 7/8!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I looked out of the windows upstairs with a big expression on my face like..."I want to be here forever." I was so spoiled for the rest of my life thinking I could walk out with everything at my fingertips in the hotel and go outside to the lake, the malls, the big museums, the Shed, etc. my parents used to get me books so i could read as i looked at the snow falling outside! It was a dream! I dreamed of this place the moment my parents made me go back to the crappy quiet IL area I was from - all right it was a nice town but just not my bag, baby, as Austin Powers might say - and from this point on, I knew that while my parents chose a different life, I was going to become a working child at 12 so I would never again have to leave my favorite Midwestern metropolis. I certainly made that true when I began working in journalism and running around Springfield and Chicaboomboomwow town at 14 for work. Was it all due to this experience? Nah probably not, but the pampering love I found here lingered in my heart and still does. I remember being treated so well when I was a kid. I know before that, I had gone up with my parents when I was 6 as I remember my dad taking me to watch Aladdin at the theater just across the block at the Water Tower, followed by getting me the little genie kit at the mall. I know I was up here back and forth. I miss it. I'm sorry, I know this whole thing sounds idiotic, but when people are so nice to you, the hotel you're lingering around forever has great food....great views....everything you could ever dream of as a little kid up til now.....I wish I could live here but my career choice wouldn't allow it.... ;( I can't stick around in IL if I want to be a mega successful chef/editorial model......
