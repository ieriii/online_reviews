I once found a key on the sidewalk near here, and thinking that it might belong to the Milshire, took it inside to turn it in. The lobby reeked of cigarette smoke (and this was after the indoor smoking ban took effect) and the guy behind the counter could barely understand what I was talking about. Not that there was a language barrier; there was more of a cognition barrier. Genuinely frightening. For the voyeuristic among you, try a Flickr search for "milshire hotel chicago" and you'll find a series of shots taken in one of the rooms. I think they were going for the so-called "heroin chic" look, and yeah, they nailed it. If you wanted to live the down-and-out drug-addled dream, this would be the place to do it.
