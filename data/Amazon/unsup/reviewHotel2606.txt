I went to the Victor Hotel for the first time for a birthday party otherwise I probably wouldn't ever have stepped foot in there. We had a private room that was supposed to fit 50 and I doubt anymore than 30 could have if we tried. Plus, it got really warm in the room so quite a few people ventured and stayed out of the room. I don't think there would be any reason to go there not having a room honestly. We didn't have to pay for the room but had to turn around and pay for it with the food and drink. Champagne ranged from $90-1500 a bottle with other types of alcohol (vodka for example) started in the $200's. A plate of mini-burgers and a full plate of cheese & fruit cost $30. The service in the rooms was pretty good I thought, we had our personal server and she brought out all kinds of mixers for the vodka and made everyone their first drink (when it wasn't crowded). The area kind of scared me walking up in the dark alone. I got there early b/c I wasn't on the guest list but around 10:00, they were charging $20 to get in. If you like techno music pounding in your brain, then this is the place for you. The clientele was very eclectic and by the time I left at 12:30 the place was still more than half empty, lots of room to stand, no sitting and no line outside.
