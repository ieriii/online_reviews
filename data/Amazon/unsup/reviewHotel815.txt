Wow. This really is the worst Westin in the nation. I've actually been lurking on Yelp reading reviews for a while now, this hotel prompted me to register and write my first review to warn people. My wife and I frequently stay in Starwood properties, and we have been Platinum Preferred Members of Starwood for some time now. So far, so good (until recently). I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to hotel rooms, and I understand that you get what you pay for. All I ask is the room is clean. Sheets, surfaces, etc. If I pay for a luxury room, I expect a bit more, but overall pretty easy to please. For Westin, I was expecting middle of the road. OK, lets get to the hotel. The first room we got upon check-in was dirty. I mean, there was a crust (not sure what) on the glass covered nightstand, a layer of dust on the lights, the carpet was stained in several places, the chair looked like it was from a garage sale (stained/dirty) and the toilet, lets not even go there. I called and spoke to the "Director of Client Relations/Satisfaction". I asked her, please just go look at the room and see what you are putting your guests in...... She declined.  Our new room on the "Preferred" 14th floor (for only preferred guests) was just as dirty. The ceiling in the bathroom, I have to guess, is lower than seven feet (in San Francisco, that's illegal, not sure about here). Bottom line, location is great, lobby is nice, and the rooms represent the worst Starwood property in the nation. Avoid it, stay somewhere else.
