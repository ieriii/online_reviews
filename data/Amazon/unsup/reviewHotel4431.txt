I went to a friend's weekend wedding reception/event there (& stayed there for that reason). The lobby is actually on the 2nd floor, but it is very ornate & beautiful! (It's an old historic hotel). I initially had a hard time figuring out how to get up there from the 1st floor...stairs/escalators aren't in really obvious places. The first night, the reception was also in a beautiful room with a short staircase entrance just off one end of the lobby. The 2nd night (yes, there were 2 nights of festivities, which were fun), there was another dinner reception in another room, & apparently, there was another wedding reception going on then in the room next door. Was kind of tempting to go crash the other one out of curiosity.  Our room was quite big...we even had 2 bathrooms and 2 closets. It must've originally been 2 rooms they converted into 1. Great decor.  Only minus I noticed was that the hallway we had to walk down to get to the elevator from our room had an area where the wallpaper was peeling off. I guess none of the managerial types had walked down this way while we were there that weekend because it remained that way the whole time we were there. There's an multiple hotel serving shuttle to & from Midway (that's where I ended up flying in & out of). Pretty convenient. Luckily, I didn't run into any problems when I was leaving, as the Chicago Marathon was that day, but I think it was pretty much over by the time I had to go to the airport.
