I have stayed here now three times over the course of four years and I keep coming back. For the price, it is excellent value. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff are helpful and knowledgeable. The place is bright and cheery. There is something a bit unreal about the "island chic" decor in the middle of a Chicago winter, but I rather like the contrast. The location is very convenient to both Downtown and to the more residential northern and western neighborhoods. The 2-block proximity to the red line is definitely a plus. They also stock the bathroom with nice Aveda products. The only draw backs I can mention are that (1) the hotel is in need of some sprucing up! It's definitely a bit battered and some new furniture, rugs, and paint would make a difference. When I first stayed here, several years ago, it sparkled. The shine has dulled. But it's still very comfortable, clean, etc. (2) The walls and doors are a bit thin. You can hear everything in the hallway (vacuuming, cleaning staff's walkie talkies, other guests roaming the halls), so if you are super noise sensitive, you might find this to be a problem. (3) The food available downstairs and by room service is not fantastic. But there are several really excellent dining options within walking distance. And since you are in Chicago, you should really be exploring the phenomenal restaurant landscape this city has to offer, not holing up in your room. The bar downstairs is a decent place to meet a friend for a drink, but again better options are nearby, including the cute and cozy Third Coast Cafe, about 3 doors down the street. All said, I highly recommend the Hotel Indigo.
