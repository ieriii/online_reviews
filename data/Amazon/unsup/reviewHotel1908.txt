The W: Very upscale youth hostel. Thin walls. High concept. Disco ball spinning in the main lobby. Comfy, modern lounge couches all over the lobby. Friendly front-desk staff behind hip-looking glass (or stone) lit from within. Expensive drinks, and you have to wade through a clot of self-important people to get to the bar, but that wouldn't have been a problem if I'd seen the nicely-tattooed waitress earlier. My room was tiny (my traveling partner said his was huge), but super-stylish and comfortable. Nice TV, DVD player included, space-age design to the desk and all the electronics. Cheesy-yet-fun strip of disco lights under-lighting the bed. Cheesy-yet-fun inspirational saying on the wall instead of a generic abstract painting or seascape. Sadly, the walls are so thin that I could clearly hear the movie my neighbor had going -- though he/she probably had it too loud, it wouldn't have been so bad with real insulation. I'm surprised in the refurb they didn't fix that. It took 2 calls to the front desk to get it quiet enough to sleep. You can't beat the in-the-Loop location -- at least not by much. Overall, I'd stay again if the price is right, which it was on this trip.
