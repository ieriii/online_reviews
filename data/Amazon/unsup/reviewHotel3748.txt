The Dana Hotel is absolutely beautiful. The location is great close to pretty much everything. The rooms have a very modern yet comfortable feel. The hotel staff is great from arrival to check-out. We had a corner king room. The floor to ceiling windows made for an excellent view. There were only a couple of reasons that i am giving the hotel 4 instead of 5 stars. 1 is that it is extremely noisy and makes it hard to sleep, I do realize this is not fault of the hotel but if this is something that may concern you just know its loud. Another reason i deducted a star is because i was given a handicapped room so we didn't get the cool peek-a-boo shower and i was really actually looking forward to that by the time i got to my room and unloaded my stuff i realized it and was not going to change the room. Also, it is complete chaos on a Saturday night in their lobby and when you have to go through a sea of people just to get to your room it is kind of a pain. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to go back and stay again.
