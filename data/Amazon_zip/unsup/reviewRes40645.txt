I think I want to like this place more than I do, but it is a fun place to eat! The appetizer where you get to make your own wraps is really fun, and the staff will enjoy watching you struggle as well! I find the food to not have a lot of flavor...I suspect that in Vietnam (and elsewhere is less factory farming) all of the ingredients are more flavorful and aromatic, but with America's bland vegetables, it is hard to get going without some sauces. I do not blame Tank Noodle, I blame myself. And Monsanto I will keep coming back here, because I am convinced there is something on the menu for me! And the service is always great! Don't leave just because you see a line, the servers are very quick, but to be prepared to eat family style!
