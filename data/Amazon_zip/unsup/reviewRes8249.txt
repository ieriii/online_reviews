Fogo de Chao has amazing food and I love it. If you like meat this place is going to become you new favorite hang out. The service is top notch and each staff member makes sure that you are happy with what you get. Don't like meat? Well they have a salad bar and it had lots of green selections. Every table gets sides and they keep on coming. Mixed drinks aren't really what this place is known for so I'd suggest you do with wine or beer. Price you ask? Well its a little expensive but it is all you can eat meat! I'd suggest you don't eat before this tasty treat!
