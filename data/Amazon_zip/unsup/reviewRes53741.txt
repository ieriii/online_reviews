Hot Doug's makes the best Italian sausage I have ever eaten. They butterfly the Italian so that it's got a nice char all over and room for the delicious hot giardiniera to rest. Combined with their excellent fries (have yet to even try the duck fat ones) and a bottle of Green River, it's my favorite lunch by a long shot (and darn cheap too).Doug's always there to take your order and emphatically thank you for placing it. After going there for lunch a handful of times he began to recognize me, making the Hot Doug's experience that much better. He tells me that the sausages are either made to their recipes or bought locally.  This place is legendary for good reason.PS  You can, for the most part, avoid the very long lines by going after 2:30pm.
