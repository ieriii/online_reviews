I've been frequenting Piece now for 3 years, and It never gets old. The Pizza is in my mind and on my taste buds, the best in Chicago. All of the staff are kick ass people, even during the busy hours, when it gets REALLY crowded. So if u can get there early! Im not a big beer drinker (prefer vodka), but have tried all of the beers. Not bad at all, just I can only have 2 beforeI get really buzzed! All in all, my favorite place to hang-out and have pizza in chicago!
