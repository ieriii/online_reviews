I'm disappointed with Yelp! now that I can't give a zero star rating. I hear Spacca makes a good pizza but I wouldn't know because the owner gave away our table.  We had a reservation for 10 people at 6:30 pm. 5 of us were there, ready to be seated and start the ordering while the rest were on the way. At 6:35 the OWNER, a complete hard-headed moron in way over his head as a business owner, told us if the whole party wasn't there in 5 minutes they were giving away the table. At 6:38 they broke the table down and kicked us out, literally one minute before everyone else arrived.  In the short time I was there I saw him arguing with another patron, swearing up a storm, and putting his hostess in awkward situations. The man is such a disaster, I'm sure he'll run his business straight into the ground.  Pizza in Chicago is not hard to come by. I'll be going elsewhere and I would recommend you do the same, especially at peak times.
