Many of us can probably agree that drinking quite a few alcoholic beverages prior to eating can make mediocre food taste like victuals from a feast of Hedone. However, an odd occurrence took place when I ate at Pequod's. Even with more than 4 glasses of wines swishing around inside of me, I did not find Pequod's version of deep dish pizza worthy of my palate. All you lovers of this faux deep dish can get mad if you want. I don't like it. I don't like the thin flavorless sauce, the way the toppings seem to be lackadaisically thrown into a heap atop of it all (Ingredients are supposed to be inside of a deep dish. In.... Side.), or the cheese. The crust; let's talk about it. At first, when I shared my underwhelment (I made it up) of this pizza, I was told I should have had the caramelized crust. Upon checking with my friend who brought me here, I learned that I, indeed, had had the caramelized crust. Caramelized, seared, lightly whipped.... whatever the crust has to be in order to taste good, it is not. If a pizza tastes like this to me after that much wine, and while seriously hungry, I'd hate to consume it while sober. This is a transplant's deep dish, in my opinion. And when I really think about, that is mainly what has recommended this pizza to me; transplants. I ought to know better.
