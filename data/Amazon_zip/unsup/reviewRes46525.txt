One of my go to places in the neighborhood for good sandwiches at a decent price. I usually get the cajun chicken with cottage fries which are fresh made potato chips. They also have a decent craft draft beer selection which changes often. Many of the servers have been there for years and are quick and efficient. One problem is they pack too many people into the space.
