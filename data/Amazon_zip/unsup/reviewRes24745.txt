I love turning back time, I remember the fondue craze in the 80's. My bf was cleaning out all of our various coupons after we made a pack not to buy another groupon until we used up the existing ones. It was getting crazy; we were buying all kinds of certificates and coupons like the end of the world was approaching with the end of King Daley's reign. With an Open Table coupon, he made a week day reservation and we ended up in a very romantic booth, in the corner of the dining room was a guy playing a guitar - classical/Spanish music. It was perfect: dark and dreamy, candlelight and soft guitar music wafting over us. We both ordered the premiere dinners at $45 - $50 per person, included in the complete dinner is a small but tasty salad, cheese fondue starter, entre, chocolate fondue dessert and coffee. I picked the beef and shrimp and my bf went with the chicken and shrimp. I loved the cheese fondue and the shrimp were large but as someone else said "cooking your own food wears off fairly quickly". I do like the idea that someone else posted about having a choice of a vegetable both for the cooking liquid in place of only oil. All in all we had a nice experience, food was good, service was excellent and the ambience is perfect for insuring an amorous night with a starry-eyed first date.  I don't think we would return anytime soon but I would recommend it to anyone that has never done a fondue place or just wants to turn back time. So many coupons and so little time, next up a mani-ped, 1 hour massage and a yoga class... yes a yoga class, what the hell was I thinking
