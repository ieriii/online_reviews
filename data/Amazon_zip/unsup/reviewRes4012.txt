I would give this place zero stars if I could. This is my experience trying to get a reservation. About a year ago, I tried to make reservations to Schwa. It was a very special occasion and I wanted it to be perfect. I called everyday at least 3x a day and left a message every day for about two weeks. I planned accordingly so that my reservation would be a few weeks away. Since they weren't returning my calls, I wrote them a letter, a very nice one at that. That's right, I wrote them a freaking letter and they still didn't respond and I was trying to make reservations for a WEEKDAY! I refuse to believe I live in a time and age where the roles have reversed and I have to beg to eat at a restaurant. There are plenty of options out there and this kind of service is ridiculous. I ended up calling L20, two Michelin star higher and much more accommodating.
