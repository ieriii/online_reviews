I came here on a Sunday night for dinner. As a vegetarian, I wasn't sure if this was going to be as satisfying of an experience, but I was not disappointed. Even on a rainy Sunday evening, the restaurant was bustling with people, which right off the bat told me I was in for a good meal. My companion and I started with some beer off their extensive beer list and perused the menu. As I had just returned from a stint in NYC, we decided to go with a true Midwestern treat- the cheese curds. This was perhaps the most disappointing part of the meal. The cheese was not salted enough and on the whole they tasted a little soggy. Moving on. You can substitute a veggie burger into any burger on the menu, and the waitress was very helpful with the popular vegetarian selections. I went with the Left Coast Burger Reuben. I was not disappointed. The burger itself was good and didn't taste like a boca burger loaded with protein substitute but rather a patty loaded with lentils and veggies. The rueben part of the burger was also tasty. The pretzel bun was not overwhelmingly heavy or pretzel-y, if that makes any sense. The creamy special sauce and crunchy slaw made for a nice mix of textures and flavors. I had the fries with chipotle seasoning, and to be honest, I couldn't really tell. Maybe it was because the flavors of the burger were so overpowering, but I also don't think mine were seasoned very well. Overall, I would come back here. The vibe was fun, the beer list was extensive, and the burger selection was creative and fun.
