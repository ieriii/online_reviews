alinea -- what an experience! first of all, we were so lucky we got reservations. from what i've read you need to make sure to book 3 months in advance! i took my boyfriend here for his birthday. and sadly, achatz wasn't there. anyway, even walking in is an experience. everything was fun and delicious, and we had great drink recommendations -- starting off with champagne. the two desserts were a little disappointing though, one being a little too peculiar and the other too sweet. roughly 350pp. but for one of the top restaurants in the world, AND for the number of courses they offer... it's a steal. our waiter was awesome. i couldn't believe after we had sat for 4 hours! they gave us nice menus after to take home. anyway, artistic presentation is impeccable, and it's interactive/playful. achatz definitely has incredible vision.
