I love trendy spots that cater to yuppies and hipsters. This particular spot has mediocre beer and subpar food. It is pretty though. All woodsy and shit whit the required high ceilings. Service is ok at best and the staff is way to cool to wait on you. Been there a few times and at best my experiences have been marginal.
