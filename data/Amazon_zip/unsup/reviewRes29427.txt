Cheap and delicious. That's basically my first thought when it comes to this place. I like the salads, the chicken & bowties, garlic cheese bread. I've never had the pleasure of eating in the actual restaurant but delivery is always fast. The food is surprisingly hot when it gets there. It's a must on my list to visit.
