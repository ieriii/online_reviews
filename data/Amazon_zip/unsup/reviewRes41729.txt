We went here for Chicago Restaurant Week and the food was amazing! Our steaks were served to us on a very hot plate, thus retaining the warm temperature of the meat until actual consumption. The steaks had a garlic, buttery taste which was delicious! It was the best steak I've had in a while! We ordered the molten chocolate cake for dessert and that was also very, very good. Just be sure to order it before you finish your entree.
