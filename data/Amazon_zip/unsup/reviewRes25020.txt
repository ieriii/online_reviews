Since I have already reviewed how amazing the food is here, this review is on the restaurant's catering. We wanted something different to serve at our anniversary party and I quickly thought of Irazu. I'd been telling my friends about it so I figured it be a great idea to serve it for dinner. I requested a quote through the website and Henry quickly called me. Our party was on a Sunday and I didn't even realize they are closed Sundays. But Henry said he would promise to make it happen, they never turn down opportunities to please their customers. The food arrived on time, setup was great and there was plenty of food and food for 3 days after too. My guests were very impressed and were already making plans to visit the restaurant. Overall, I was very impressed with not only the food, but Henry was especially professional and extremely accommodating. Thank you Irazu for making our special day a great success.
