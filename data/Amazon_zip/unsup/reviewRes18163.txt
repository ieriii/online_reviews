I was very disappointed with Caro Mio's food and service. We went on the coldest night of the year so far, about -15 with the windchill at the time. Upon entering, we noticed there were about 5 of the maybe 12 tables seated with people, and we waited a good 5 minutes before anyone popped their head out of the back to see if anyone came in. I know 5 mins isn't super long, but the way the restaurant is laid out, it's just awkward to stand there. A real head-case walked out and sat us by the front emergency glass door, where there was a draft of -15 degree air. Nice. We gestured from across the room for another table, and he pointed to another table, not saying a word, but his eyebrows almost touched his receding hairline. Unprofessional. Oh, our server...he was such a sweet young Italian man, but we really didn't understand more than 3 words when he was telling us the specials. He meant well, though, and tried hard. His accent was just very thick. We ordered the eggplant appetizer which I thought was very good, but the other person in my party insisted was not cooked completely. Also the table bread was stale. I had the chicken tortellini. The pasta was overcooked and almost mushy, and the chicken was just gross and dryyyyyyy. I will say, however, that their sauce is really good and fresh. For dessert, I had the tiramisu which was probably the worst I've had with way too much espresso soaked into the lady fingers. So much, that I requested a spoon to scoop it up before giving up halfway though. It was a mushy mess. But props to the lemon sorbet dessert -- it tasted amazing, actually. So, I'm torn about this place. I suppose it's possible I ordered the wrong thing, and given the other great reviews, I'm willing to try this place again sometime. But leaving the place with an $80 bill just made me feel like a fool.
