I'm a sucker for gorgeous restaurants. I've heard about this place many times before I had a chance to actually go. My company had a private party at this joint the other night and we enjoyed every bit of it. (No small fact that it was all company-paid. FYI, The Gage ain't cheap.) Our bartender, Edwin, was extremely accommodating, attentive, and awesome, in general. Our servers kept the food coming and boy, was it good. Meatballs skewers with horseradish cream and fried onions, mini samosas, hand-cut french fries with a curry cream dipping sauce, naturally-sweet shrimp with a spicy remoulade and chive, sliders with caramelized onions and cheese, and the winner of the night, snapper ceviche on a homemade tortilla chip. The noshing was complimented with open jars of assorted olives and pickles. The drinks were strong and glasses were never empty. My recommendation, if you can afford it, make the trip and enjoy it.
