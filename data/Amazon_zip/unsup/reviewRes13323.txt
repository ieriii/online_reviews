I'm not so into Glenn's, but this review is based on lunch. I'm thinking that if I'd have eaten fish, I'd have been a LOT happier. If I ever go back, and I hope to, I'll revisit this review. Anyway, the best thing I ate was the salad dressing. Sadly. I mean, it was REALLY yum. That always makes me nervous, too, because there's every chance it came out of a jar supplied by a big food service company. I'm not saying it definitely did, but it could have. Anyway, it was balsamic vinaigrette, and it was, again, yum. But the spinach/tomato benedict was nothing but ho-hum. The hollandaise itself was so freaking bland it made me sad. And the potato pancake had a really strange cheesy taste.  We had a reservation, so we didn't wait (make one! I watched party after party asking for a table, being told the wait time, and then walking out and away, to find their lunch elsewhere). It's a nice convenience that they offer them. Oh, and the service was indifferent; one of my tablemates asked for an omelet with four add-ins, only got three, and was still charged for four. And two people at our table had breakfast pastry, but no syrup was brought. When was the last time you had to ask for syrup with your pancakes? Weird. Still, I definitely want to try the fish, which is supposed to be the main attraction here.
