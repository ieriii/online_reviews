Attention all Economy-Sufferers, come to Yolk if you want to be full for a day and have very little to pay! After reading about this popular morning spot on Michigan Ave I finally found time to experience what a true brunch is supposed to taste like.  My mom and I, after sitting walking the city on a lazy Tuesday afternoon in search for something that would keep us full for the remainder of the day, came upon Yolk and were pleased to see there wasn't a wait. Our waitress was almost too friendly and was one of the highlights of the meal. She was there for our every need and we rewarded her handsomely for her hard work. OK, OK, I know you want to hear how you too can eat for pennies and be full for a day(s) on a single meal. The sweet tooth kid in me stumbled upon three words that had never been matched together until now: "Peach Cobbler Crepes." Game-Set-Match. These crepes came loaded with warm peaches and topped with a sugary crust on top that made each bite sinfully sufficient. After eying the other appealing option, the Banana's Foster Crepes, I was very pleased with my selection. My mom ordered some type of Eggs Benedict with corn beef hash (forgot to mention it was St. Patrick's Day) and she ended up eating every morsel as well. For $22 including tip, please tell me a better bargain for real food (no place with a drive-thru counts as real food in this little test). Go to Yolk and do your stomach and your wallet a favor.
