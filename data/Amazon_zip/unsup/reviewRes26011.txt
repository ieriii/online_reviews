The only reason I am not going to give Mercat a la Planxa 5 stars is because it is too pricey and the waiters are inconsistent, but this is an amazing place. Let me start out by saying that I love Chef Garces. I've eaten at all of his restaurants including my favorite, Amada in Philadelphia. I ate at Mercat for the first time four years ago when I first moved to Chicago. Garces was not an Iron Chef yet, so the place was less packed than it is now! I still go to Mercat any chance I get. The menu changes twice a year and I prefer the Autumn menu. My favorite things on the menu: the mushroom soup with caviar and crme fraiche, Wagyu beef, patata bravas, and the chocolate croquettas. This places is expensive because the portions are so small you need to order a lot to walk out satisfied and the alcohol is also expensive. I've gone to Mercat several times and the quality of the food never changes. The wait staff however is hit or miss. I've had two bad occasions there, once when the waiter wouldn't leave us alone and was being too pushy and the other time when the waiter mocked me for not knowing that the menu changed when I asked for the soup I loved, he was relentless and brought it up the whole time during dinner. Also, Mercat has a tight seating layout, you sit VERY close to other people, so if you're looking to have a romantic dinner you have to specifically request a table.
