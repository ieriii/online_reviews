Great location - close to Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, downtown, and Grant Park. While location matters a lot to me, the hotel wasn't as great as I had hoped. The rooms were clean - but not sparkling - and they charge for EVERYTHING. Internet (even in the business rooms, it cost $13 for 6 hours), access to the gym, water, parking... when you pay more than $300 for a night's stay, you'd think they could throw in SOMETHING.
