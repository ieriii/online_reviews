This is a review of their banquet facilities only; my graduate school alumni board, of which I am a member, recently held an awards ceremony at the Marriott and I think that it wound up being what is expected from a top-tier banquet hall, but with a few outstanding perks: *The entrance immediately gives you a feeling of being somewhere important. You walk in the door to a stair entrance down to the lounge/lobby and bar area, which is very welcoming. *The first course, a tomato bisque crostini (crostada? crostadelicious is all I have to say) was impressive- rich tomato cream soup served in ramekins covered with a pot-pie like flaky crust. Pretzel rolls and a variety of others complimented the first course really nicely and had me excited for the rest--dinner (chicken/mashed potatoes) and dessert (tiramisu) were fine but not noteworthy. Average wedding food fare. *The decor: strange jellyfish/bubbly like chandeliers that weren't so weird as to be distracting, but were still pretty enough to comment on. The room decor and lighting overall were pleasant. Also, to enter for dinner, a guy walked around with a mini-vibe set playing to get our attention to announce that it was time to sit down. Old school style.  Otherwise this was a pretty average experience. The house red wine at the bar upstairs (7th floor was where we were at) was Estancia, which I have found is becoming increasingly common. It's okay but not preferable. I'm sure that has to do with our budget as well as the Marriott's own choice. Anyhow, it's a nice venue with a few defining factors and it served our purpose quite well. I would use it again.
