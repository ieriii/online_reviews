I got 2 veggie tacos and a side of patacones - it was amazing and fed me for three meals, which is always a plus. I think everyone I ate with was more than satisfied with their food - next time I'm getting the chile relleno and horchata - wow yum. The waitstaff was friendly and accommodating and despite the wait, the overall experience was excellent. There is no corkage fee and the atmosphere was pleasant. Minus one star for Styrofoam to-go containers - next time (and there will be many next times) I'll bring my own.
