I am quite biased towards Tecalitlan's burritos suizos, but the one I had at Garcia's the other night was pretty tasty. I thought their veggie burrito had less flavor than Tecalitlan's, but I tasted my husband's chile relleno and it was very good. He also had a cheese enchilada which he enjoyed. The food was generously portioned and it was inexpensive. It was a wonderful find and I would go there again. In addition to good food, the place was very cozy and not very crowded, which I appreciated. However, I would still not give it a perfect 5 because with two t.v.s showing different sports events (GOL! GOL! GOL! Los Tigres!!!), the environment was kind of loud. The service (after our food was served) was ... also ... incredibly ... s...l...o...w.... The women were really nice -- lots of smiles to go around -- and happy to help when you wanted something, but we (and everyone else that was there) had to get up to get the servers to get our checks, go boxes, etc.  All said, if you want a laid back atmosphere, maybe a place to catch a Sox game AND a soccer game, drink a few beers (or excellent licuado), and have decent (though not amazing) Mexican food for a GREAT price, go here!
