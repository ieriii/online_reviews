My fiancee and I had a wonderful time dining here. Our server Julie was very helpful and attentive... We ordered a bottle of Tempranillo for $36 to share - not bad. For a light starter, we got the bone marrow on toast. It came as two large halves of a shank bone, with caramalized onion and sauteed flat-leaf parsley. Yummy.  Then for our first course, we had a peach salad with manchego cheese and candied walnuts, followed by a pasta dish of bucatini with chicken, artichokes, and mixed herbs. Our main course was their limited-quantity coal fired ribeye steak, seasoned and cooked medium rare to perfection. For dessert, we tried one of their candied treats, the mango jellies.  We were very impressed by the quality of their food overall. The dishes were creative and well-portioned out for sharing. There was also a wide selection of items on their menu and it was difficult for us to decide what to eat, so we will definitely be returning to sample some of their other dishes.  I should also note that they have a hidden "cash-only" bar downstairs that our server said opens at 8pm - we did not go down there to hang out but perhaps will do so one day in the near future.
