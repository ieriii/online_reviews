I recently stayed at the La Quinta on a recent business trip. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised as my only experience with the La Quinta brand are the road-side hotels-more-like-motels establishments. Upon arrival I was greeted by a bell hop who guided me towards the front desk. I did not have a wait upon check-in and within a span of 5 minutes or less was checked in and in my room. The rooms are adequately appointed, not opulent or awe inspiring, but most decidedly functionality. I found there to be ample closet space, working space and bathroom space. However, the set up did trigger one of my biggest pet peeves about hotels and that is there were an insufficient number of outlets. To plug in my phone charger I had to maneuver my way beside the in-room refrigerator and then pray the cord reached to the nightstand. Of course it did not and so I ended up using my laptop as an extension cord. Anyone who travels for business and prefers to use their phone as their alarm clock will find this annoying. Unlike some of the other reviews I did not encounter any early morning noise but I did hear a family complaining in the hall when they, upon entering their newly assigned room, found that it was already occupied. I also was able to access the internet without issue. The complimentary breakfast was actually quite nice. I would definitely stay here again when traveling for business.
