I can't make enough positive comments about the James Hotel. It's an upscale hotel in a great location. The rooms were comfortable and very clean.  But there's more. This hotel separates itself from the others in two ways: 1. They don't 'nickel and dime you' to death. Everything's included in the price, even the internet. 2. The staff is incredibly personable. While the hotel is upscale, it's not snooty. Everyone is so nice. All the staff talks to you. I'm not one who stays at the Ritz because they have great service, but lack personality. The James isn't like that. They combine quality with amazing, personable service. Stay at this hotel. And tell the front desk staff that Ken sent you...  ;)
