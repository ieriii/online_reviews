My friend and I were really excited to try this place and when we saw a crowd around brunch time on a Saturday, we thought for sure this place was going to be amazing. The wait was about 30 minutes so we grabbed coffee nearby before we sat down. The place was completely packed and people were practically eating elbow to elbow. The restaurant was echoing from the nonstop chatter at every table. When my friend and I finally got seated at a table, it was an awkward spot near the door. We quickly ordered the Tomatillo Salsa Scramble which was probably more on the healthy side since it had egg whites in it. Since my friend and I are girls and don't eat very much, we decided to split that dish and we also ordered two side caesar salads. The food was okay. I mean it's an egg white scramble... there isn't really too much to do to jazz it up without it losing its' sole purpose of being healthy. I shouldn't have expected very much since we did order something that was on the healthier side. No big deal. The annoying thing was that there was table next to us in the corner and the server had to keep squeezing past my friend's chair to get through. Why are you going to put tables like that when you have to keep asking a customer to move so you can get through? It got super annoying and our server wasn't very nice to us either. I understand it's busy, but you should still slap a smile on your face and pretend to like your job. This was probably one of the worst places we went to during our Chicago trip. As much as I wanted to love it, it just made us grumpy instead. "Meh" is simply the perfect word to describe it.
