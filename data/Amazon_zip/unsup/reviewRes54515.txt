This place definitely has its share of rave-review customers. But when I went, I was not too taken aback. Though the menu has a lot to offer, I don't think that they had to put in alterna-meats in every dish. Vegetarian food is great, but imitation meat...not so much. The food I got was bland and dry and I'm hoping that it was just a fluke. I'm willing to give this place another chance--any place that draws in such a loyal following deserves me trying it out for a second meal.
