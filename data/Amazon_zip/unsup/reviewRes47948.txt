a vegetarian walks into a churrascaria... i know it isn't fair for me to review this restaurant but here goes anyways... a work event brought me here. i can't say anything about the meat entrees but the salad bar was pretty impressive. it included a good variety of meats and cheeses. the edamame salad, spicy long beans and pearled couscous salad were delicious. the other prepared salads, however, were too overdressed.  i loved that some of the vegis - broccoli, squash, asparagus, etc. were served plain/lightly seasoned but accompanied by some interesting sauces or relishes on the side. i also really appreciated the displays - all daintily placed on chilled platters vs. big chafing dishes. it didn't make you feel like you were at sizzler! the dessert platter was pretty amazing - bite-sized red velvet cake, spice cake, chocolate mousse, brownies/blondies and cheesecake.  the bar area is very cozy with a psychedelic fireplace and huge TVs. great wine selection and fun drinks (people rave about the blackberry mojitos and the martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives) as well.
