Even though it's primarly a seafood joint, there are vegetarian options(just watch out for the Bloody Mary which has clam juice and the roasted red pepper&tomato soup which is chicken broth based. ) I had the veggie burger which was housemade and soooo good! My non-veggie friend said that the crabcakes were awesome! But beware, service isn't the greatest...
