Went here for my birthday a few months ago and it was definitely one of the best dining experiences I've ever had even though it is located in Logan Scare (definitely outside the perimeter). First off, BYOB at a tasting menu restaurant like Bonsoiree is absolutely genius. Call ahead and they will give you suggestions as to which types of wine to bring. We brought about 4-5 bottles for 3 people. Needless to say, we were pretty bombed by the end. Our server was really cool and helpful the entire time. My favorites included the Japanese squash soup, scallops (super rich but not over the top), uni grilled cheese, lamb duo (super tender), rabbit carbonara (best rabbit ever), pumpkin 5 ways (loved the different components) and finally the amaaaaaaaazing mango "eggs benedict" desert. I think I just listed everything we had. Oh well. Every time a dish was brought out I was slightly saddened because it meant the end was getting closer and closer. Thats the only negative thing I can think of. So you should definitely go. Now. Feel free to invite me because I will 100% say yes.
