How do they manage to keep the prices so low here? The food is of exceptional quality you would really expect to pay alot more. The place has kept pace through the years thanks to the devoted efforts of Aunt Irene Mastropaolo, who knows good food and loves people! I have to attribute the extra 5 pounds I've been carrying around to the cannoli here, which are the perfect way to end a meal. Favorite entree: Veal Saltimbocca. YUM!
