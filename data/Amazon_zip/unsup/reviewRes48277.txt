We started with the pork rinds, and moved our way to the charcuterie plate, which had a sampling of various pork preparations, all of which were enjoyable, but my fave being the pork pie. If you are a pork belly fan, it is an absolute must you try this. It was flawless, with a crispy and tantalizingly sweet glaze. Servers were attentive. If you can, book a reservation for one of the "pig pens", they are private and spacious and fun for small groups.
