For a hotel this size and the location, the service and friendly staff far exceeded any expectations. The house keeping staff deserves an extra special gold star. Our room for some reason turned out a little messier than usual, so cheers to the nice team of people picking up the room service trays and cleaning up the stray crumbs and refreshing the room twice a day.  The king guest room was the second type of room I stayed in here. Last trip it was the movie room which had a pretty cool pimped out king size "futon" with a projector and bose speakers. These two types of rooms were both comfy and had great space.  The Kheil's products are always great as well. The bed is super comfy and being a light sleeper, the curtains that black out 99.9% of the light were great.  Looking forward to many returns to this property. And the David Burke Primehouse as the restaurant has great meat!
