See my review for Great Lake Pizza Company. This place is the exact opposite of that craphole. This place is AMAZING (said in Oprah Winfrey voice). Great pizza, beer, and atmosphere. Servers and staff are just a treat. A Sweet Treat. Plus, it is in Bucktown and there a lot of hot dudes there watching sports.
