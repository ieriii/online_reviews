Taste: 4 Value: 4 Service: 5 The food here is excellent. And I should start by saying they have Goose Island Matilda on tap. Great with any meal! We had a spread of food that i can't remember completely here. One thing I was disappointed in was the beef satays. My favorite style is when they wrap it around sugar cane. Here, they just wrapped it around bamboo. So you get excited about sugar cane, and then get no flavor when you reach the center. Their Chilean Sea Bass dish was by far the highlight. We were already stuffed when it arrived, but put it down after tried a bite. Compare to West coast Asian fusion places, this place is overpriced. For 4 people eating, I wouldn't expect the bill to close in on $300. If you got the money and are itching for some fresh fish (which is hard to get in Chicago for some reason), try this place out.
