And now, a poem: Hands down THE BEST mac & cheese I have EVER tasted. This mac & cheese is not for the purist. With its sweet cherry tomato confit bitter arugula savory market mushrooms creamy mornay sauce and dunbarton blue bread crumbs and a few drips of basil oil this mac & cheese is for the perfectionist. * In addition to a fantastic meal, L&E has friendly servers and great cocktails. It was literally the first place we went to after arriving in Chicago and it'll be my first stop the next time I go back.
