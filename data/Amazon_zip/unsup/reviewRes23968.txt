AMAZING!! We went here today for a Friday afternoon lunch. It is very accessable by the Blue Line (Western stop).  Our server, Amanda, helped us pick out just the right items. I highly recommend the veggie burrito. They will make it vegan with no problem. There are actually several vegan options which was amazing. We had a pitcher of the Lava Juice. My advice it to just go ahead and order the pitcher. You will thank me. It's highly addictive. It would have been very good with some vodka or tequilla but since we had to go back to the office we opted for no alcohol. Your choice but it is BYOB.
