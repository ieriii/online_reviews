I took a good friend :) of mine here last night and really enjoyed the food! we sat down at our table and it was nicely laid out the room was really cozy very family like. I had the gnocchi with bolognese sauce which was divine :) it's a BYOB place and without a corking fee made everything really affordable. A really great place good food, home like atmosphere and great prices.
