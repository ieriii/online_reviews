It's true...the falafel here is very good. And so is the chicken shawirma dinner, which is what I usually get every couple weeks or so on my way home. Food's good, prices are more than reasonable, and I can be in and out in under 5 mins (unless there's a long line). I also end up here a lot if I'm hanging out with vegetarian friends. Makes everyone happy. Definitely a neighborhood gem.
