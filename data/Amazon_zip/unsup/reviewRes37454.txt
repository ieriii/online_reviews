I used to live in Belgium (Bruges) so I know my Belgian ales. So imagine my joy when the Hop Leaf opened.  They only serve good beers here, no bud, miller or coors crap! Yes, I am a beer snob and proud of it. They have opened a kitchen and now serve good food which are based on Belgian beers like braised meats and steamed mussels. Major downside is that on fri and sat evenings it is really really crowded. It is hard to find a spot where you dont have to move every two minutes to let someone by.
