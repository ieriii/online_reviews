There's a lot of hype around this place.  It is a good hot dog place and the variety is excellent. However, I will be a bit nit-picky. Why would anyone stand in line for 30 minutes for a hot dog? They are not THAT good.I think that the dogs are supposed to be good because of all the hype so everyone's brain is getting tricked.Service is fair - in and out and then get out we have more customers type of mentality. Yes they smile.Their hours of operation are not that good. Always closed. They make so much money, they close their doors whenever they want.I don't get the hype. I'll give them 4 stars cause the dogs were good, not great. People get over it, they are just hot dogs, man.
