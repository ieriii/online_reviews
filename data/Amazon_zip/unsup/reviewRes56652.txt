I have to say I have never written a review on a restaurant in my life but, this one deserves a fabulous review. I cannot say enough about Davanti's!! My only concern is that it is almost too good to be true and I just hope they never change their concept!! Delicious food and fabulous prices and that goes for the wine too!It is such a treat to go to a restaurant eat, drink, not break the bank and leave with a amazing experience! It's the reason we go out to eat! I want to be wowed and Davanti's restored my faith in dining out! We had the large ravioli and I have not stopped talking about it!! It was something that I would have never ordered on my own because I do not like eggs. I am here to tell you it was divine! It was recommended to us and what a recommendation it was!! I can not wait to order it again.We also ordered a pizza which was fantastic and larger than was described by our server!We ordered the rigatoni and sausage. This was our least favorite dish. I feel bad saying least favorite as if to allude that it was not good because, everything we ate was delicious. There are just so many other dished that left a longer impression.Lastly we ordered the burger.....heaven. If you love burgers or just can take them either way you will remember this burger it is absolutely melt in your mouth goodWe arrived around 6:15 on Sunday night and were seated right away(probably due to the playoff game with the bears) we ordered 2 bottles of wine. A very nice bottle of wine that was $77and in other restaurants is well over a $100 and a more reserve bottle that was $15. This was plenty of food for 3 people.Our bill was just under $150 and well worth every penny. We normally do not order such nice bottles of wine normally but it was a special occasion and the other prices we so reasonable we were excited to splurge!If you do have a chance to get to davanti's you will not regret it!! I cannot wait to go back and when I do I hope it is everything that I remember! Thanks!!!
