HEDONISTIC. The best pancakes you will have in Chicago! And also probably close to the best breakfast, period. Their pancakes are a hedonistic delight of dessert + meal merged into one. Their menus seem to shift periodically, but all I can say is that every pancake type that I have tried has been heavenly (and I think I've tried about 8 different kinds). I love that you can order anywhere from 1 to 3 pancakes for each stack. I tend to go for single pancakes in a variety of flavors to share with friends so that we can try the greatest number. I've also tasted their french-toast as well as breakfast burrito, and they were equally fantastic.
