What an abysmal experience. I can't believe an establishment like this can survive for long. Going for lunch at the Bistro was such a comedy of errors you didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Took 30 minutes standing in line to get seated, 20 minutes of which was waiting for them to bus the empty table. Once finally seated, warned that it would take up to 30 minutes to receive our food. Oh great - nice expectation setting there. No silverware. Asked for silverware for our party of 4. They returned with 2 sets. Asked again. Nothing. Again. Still Nothing. One server for the entire restaurant! Finally got order taken. 20 minutes passes, still no drinks. Ask for drinks. They come relatively quickly after that. Coffee is cold. First my meal comes - turkey with cranberry. Fairly decent. Then two of our party's meals come out. 10-15 minutes passes. Our fourth person still has not been served. Asked manager where it was. Surprisingly, he knew of the order. Server apologizes, says kitchen is at "wit's end." Huh? Did everyone call in sick today? It's not even that busy. Overhear other conversations: "Sorry, we're out of that." Table who was seated 15 minutes before us just got served, perhaps an hour later. Staring at tables that hadn't been cleared for 20 minutes or longer - an obvious sign of a poorly run establishment. Acknowledgement of poor service offered by the manager, 25% friends and family discount subtracted from bill. Too bad I didn't have a Groupon - at least I could have gotten my money back. Don't go here. Simple as that.
