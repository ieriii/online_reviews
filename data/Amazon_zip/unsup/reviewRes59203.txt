Good Chinese Style BBQ!!! The food seems fresh and fairly priced. Go for the small BBQ combination(good value over there), try all of the meats, check out which one you like better.The BBQ skin duck is really tasty.If you go with a group, go for the Whole Duck BBQ, its a nice experience, they actually cut it all for you and serve it to the group... Good Stuff!!!
