Love to watch Chef on TV and also enjoy authentic Mexico cuisine, however our experience was not good. We walked in on a Friday night about 9:30 and promptly got sat. The server took 5 min to greet us and get our drink order which does happen on occasion but not at a 4 star restaurant . Usually when a server does miss a table they make up for it after they realized their mistake, the service never improved. We ordered 6 dishes and 4 of them came to the table cold, they probably would have been great if they were hot. We would have sent them back but there wasn't follow through service with our waiter. The hostess was texting on her cell phone all night not even saying good night to the guests as they left. The young lady would even look up at them but no gesture. I figured I had caught the restaurant on a bad night till I saw that Chef Rick was THERE! I would have been so much happier eating a microwaved burrito and a bottle of Rioja saving myself 2 hours of my time and $280.00
