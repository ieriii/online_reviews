Pineapple & mixed berry marmalades are house-made and very tasty. Oatmeal is available, but I suspect it is made with cream. Beautiful table of wood, lovely paintings, beautiful heavy well-balanced flatware. Huge omelet big enough for 3 people. Good coffee. Healthy start breakfast sandwich made from egg whites, veggies, multigrain bread . The fresh fruit serving is enough for 2 people. Pomegranete and orange juice blend is delicious. Service was very good. The price point is steep, but worth it. Street parking is painful. If you go, be sure to bring your appetite.
