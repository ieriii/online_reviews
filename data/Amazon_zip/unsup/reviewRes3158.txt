So after reading the mouth-watering reviews of Crisp, I decided to take the plunge. Albeit, anyone who offered me wings and delivered for a nominal fee was a contender. I ordered the Whole Jumbo Wings with Seoul Sassy sauce and the Crisp Chicken tenders with Suicide sauce. They scored a star for me because my order came much earlier than expected and was HOT. I run up the stairs, open the box, and I am slightly perplexed. Who would have though they actually would give me the WHOLE wing, not just some flimsy drummette. This is worth 2 stars. The pricing NOW makes sense. I bite into this chicken and it sure is heavenly! The 2 more stars. Now the crisp chicken tenders.. you can pass on them. It was a nice attempt for spice, but I am a spice junky. So it did not make the cut hence the minus 1 star. Would I order these again, absolutely! Probably in about 5 months. There is so much goodness on these wings, you cannot afford to eat them to often. Then again, this would be a nice treat to impress out of town or less explored native Chicagoans -- is that a word?
