I've been trying to get here for years. That being said my expectations were high. We had an overpriced mediocre appetizer plate. The entree (the pork loin with mashed potatoes) however was scrumptious. The Vida Margarita sounded great, but when I ordered it they were out of bitters:/ I tried a couple other margaritas and they were good. The service was slow at best. When we got there it was packed and we were quoted an hour to an hour and a half wait, but it only ended up being about half an hour. So when all is said the entree won me over, thats why they got four stars.
