When seated you are quickly brought out salsa and chips. The salsa is spicy buy hey it's a Mexican restaurant, and I like spicy. The place is small and service is rapid. My wife and I never had to ask for refills on water or chips and salsa. We ordered queso fundido for an appetizer and it was spicy and again damn good. I ordered a chorizo chimichanga; it came with rice and beans. The rice was fluffy and flavorful and the beans had a slight sweetness; both were excellent. The chimichanga was a perfect crisp topped with guacamole and sour cream; it was excellent. I'll definitely be going again.
