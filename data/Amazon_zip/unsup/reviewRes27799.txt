I know I'm just about the only person in Chicago who HATES Pequod's Pizza, but I do, much to the dismay and chagrin of my Pequod's-loving boyfriend. I hate the "carmelized cheese" on the crust. People, it's BURNT cheese! Granted, I've only had it once, and maybe it was just an off day, but I don't have any desire to go back anytime soon.
