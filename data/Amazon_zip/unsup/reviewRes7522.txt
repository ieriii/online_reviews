First, this is the nicest BBQ restaurant I have ever eaten at - the inside reminded me of an old plantation house, it is certainly not the dive-y type place most BBQ joints are. They have a nice selection of beers and wines and they offer flights of bourbon to accompany your meal. As soon as you sit down they bring out house made bread and butter pickles and potato chips with a dusting of cayenne. I am not a fan of sweet pickles, but others in my party thought they were the best pickles they have ever had. The chips were amazing, my party ate 5 bowls of them before our meals came. We didn't try any appetizers, I usually don't in BBQ places because the serving sizes are so big, I can't eat my meal as it is. I tried the pulled pork shoulder and it was amazing. It just melted in your mouth. The accompanying choice of sauces is nice with something for everyone included - standard BBQ, hot BBQ, carolina, and a mustardy southwest sauce, all delicious. The house made fries and coleslaw are top notch. Others in my party had the Kansas City ribs and they literally fell off the bone, which doesn't usually happen with a Kansas City cut - they were cooked to perfection. We also tried the Kobe beef brisket which was even better than we anticipated. I am not a big brisket fan, but this was the best I have had outside of Texas (and honestly, even in Texas). The Chef walked passed our table and I asked the waiter if she could stop by our table, we wanted to offer our much deserved compliments. Lee Ann was so great to us, she not only stopped by the table, she gave us a tour of the kitchen and smokers and then came back to our table, gave a round of their special bourbon on the house and she even had a shot with us. The waitstaff was wonderful and the manager was most accommodating when we called to make reservations for friends the following evening. An absolutely wonderful experience!
