Everything you have heard is true. Go!....after checking their website to see if they are open, of course. 3 out of the 4 times I made the trek out there (twice with out-of-town guests), HD was closed. Personally, I love that he gives his employees so much time off, so consider this a friendly service announcement and not a complaint per se. Hot Doug's is best experienced with a group of friends as there are way too many interesting dogs to try. I would say 2-3 per person is enough and that a serving of the justly famous duck fat fries will keep 4 people happy. Besides the Foie Gras dog (which is an absolute must), my only other advice is to steer clear of the hotter dogs: they pack some serious heat and may detract from the other items waiting patiently to be devoured.
