Milk and Honey brunch is fabulous, but be prepared to wait it out on the weekends. I love their huevos rancheros, which is only served on the weekends, unfortunately. Their food is fresh and delicious and their yogurt and granola is outstanding. I am a fan of their blueberry pecan granola. However, I am not a fan of their potato chips. They have no flavor and aren't worth the calories. Besides that, I would get over there, order a giant coffee to go with your yogurt and granola and enjoy watching hipsters interact with each other, which can be totally amusing within itself.
