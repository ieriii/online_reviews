Really great staff. We stayed here and had a tight budget, but got treated totally well. When they found out the bf was about to deploy they really pulled out all of the stops to be rele nice. It is expensive for us, but it in the heart of downtown and everyone who works there is super. I don't think you can train people to be that awesome. The person who put this crew together desrves 10stars.
