we were looking forward to our experience at Graham Elliot. Unfortunately, we were seated more than one hour late for our reservation.   The only items that were on time were the wine selections.  our main course arrived more than 40 minutes after the appetizer course and two of our four main course meals were cold.  The pace is off here and the food is not allowed the opportunity to live up to its potential.  Based on our experience, we will not return.
