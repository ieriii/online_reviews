I've been a hot dog fan for years and was happy to find Hot Doug's on California. Not actually on your way type of place, but worth the drive since it's the only place in Chicago and one of the only places anywhere to enjoy unusual sausage combination like hot dogs made from lamb or ones with truffle oil! The fries are deadly good. And as far as the brilliant classically trained Doug, kudos for finding a restaurant job with good hours! You go guy.
