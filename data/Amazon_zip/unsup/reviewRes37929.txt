I never would have guessed that this place would have such AWESOME mussels!  The front of the bar is a bit smoky, even with the windows open. The bartenders are not always super on top of things, but then you see the bar tab you see that with the reasonable prices you aren't paying for someone to like you. And sometimes the hostess is a bit off in her ability to keep track of things. The mussels, anyway, are delicious. They have great salads and other entrees as well.  Definitely one of my favorite places to hang out and meet up with friends...like Rob from the band Bumpus!! :-)
