q was great!  came here for a 30th birthday party, and my friends rented a private room for saturday night. dinner was family-style, which was perfect because there were 15 of us and we didn't have to take all night to order. there were sweet pickles and cajun chips to start, already waiting out on the table. i'm a dill pickle fan, but the sweet pickles were pretty damn good anyway.  for starters, we had the hush puppies and the fried green tomatoes - both were really good, although i really like lillie's q's puppies better. our main meat came, and we had the chicken and the ribs. the ribs were FALL OFF THE BONE! the only ribs i've ever had that were fall of the bone were homemade by my brother-in-law, so i was really happy to see these were, too. the chicken was juicy and flavorful. the meats came with 4 different sauces on the side. our sides included mac & cheese, baked beans (with kobe beef), and cornbread. everything was really good. it was hard not not finish the plate. dessert was phenom, too. while everyone had the peanut butter brittle (im allergic), i had some sort of chocolate mousse pie with caramel and pretzels. it was amazing. the decor is super cute - old country, yet modern, homey, clean. i ordered the sauv blanc all night, but others had the mint julep (in sno-cone form) or pimm's. i am definitely going back!
