Concept dining that is equally enjoyable and intriguing. Rating 4.5 stars 4-course on a Wed. night Food: 4.5 star / Presentation: 5 star. Ranked in order of liking: Starter: crispy Suzuki (Japanese bass) was delicious! paired with an excellent grilled haricot vert - perfect crunch and seasoning, garnished with lotus root for interesting texture and impressive flavor. Soup: (perhaps my favorite presentation) shot of artichoke curry infused sharp contrast to the fava bean/spring pea soup, curried crisp cauliflower added perfect visual/texture complements. Dessert: gingerbread ice cream sandwiches were scrumptious, salted candied pecans added intense flavor. only knock is that these were not served chilled enough, ice cream already half melted, should be served on chilled plates. Main course: chickpea confit, flavorful potato skins, smoked shimeji mushrooms, and a delicious wasabi mustard almost stole show from the grass-fed lamb roast (rather dry) Service: 5 star. Staff was engaging, accommodating, unpretentious. Struck rare balance of accessible expertise, happy to share an experience of their craft. Ambiance: 5 star. Tucked away behind a nondescript front, intimate yet breathable feel. Hard to find concept dining executed in such fashion to put you at ease. Highly recommend for special occasion/getaways.
