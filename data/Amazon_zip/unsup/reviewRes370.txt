I ate at Alinea for my 25th birthday (I work in restaurants; I made the reservation about four months before the fact and scrimped and saved to do the whole thing), and it is absolutely the most amazing meal I've had. I went with a buddy, and we had an absolutely amazing experience. The service was officious without being stuffy (especially after we talked to them and got them to loosen up a bit), and the food was superfluous. I don't think I ever need to spend the kind of cheddar we did for that meal ($400 APIECE), but it was an absolutely amazing experience.
