We've been going to this Chicago location since the grand opening in June of '08 and still recommend it to anyone and everyone! During our first visit, we were blown away by the service. It was my first time being at a restaurant where as you reach for the door to enter, a server will open the door for you, where when you are about to pull out a chair, it automatically gets pulled out and pushed in for you to sit, where when every time you stand up to visit the salad bar, your towel gets folded into a crisp triangle awaiting your return. The setting of the restaurant is beautiful. As you enter, there's a bar and lounge-type area while you wait for your table. In the distance is the enormous salad bar with an extravagant floral piece sitting atop. In the dining area, there is a floor to ceiling high wine shelf with an acrobatic dancer moving about. And now the most important part: FOOD. Definitely make sure you come hungry! And don't get carried away at the salad bar, because the main reason you're coming here is for all the kinds of meat. After dining here over 7-8 times, I can say everything is DELICIOUS, but these selections are THE ONES that still bring me back everytime. Salad bar favorites: quinoa salad, artichoke hearts, grilled garlic, various cheeses, smoked salmon, seared tuna Meat favorites: house special picanha (make sure you get the edge pieces with the crispy fat), beef ribs (SOO tender), leg of lamb (I was never a fan of lamb before, due to the gaminess, but TBD really opened the door to this new meat for me!) For the meats, don't forget the chimichurri sauce and the mint sauce for the lamb. And don't get too carried away with the amazing cheese bread balls and carmelized plantains at the table. Enjoy!
