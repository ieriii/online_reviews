I have a mixed feeling towards the Hopleaf. When I first arrived in Chicago I fell in love with their mussels but over the past two years I have noticed a decline in quality. They are now palatable.  The crowds are large, I would recommend going on a weekday early in the week. When it comes to the beer selection it is amazing. I always get to try something new and I am never disappointed. By far the best beer selection I have seen in the city.
