The medianoche is delicious! So are the masas de puerco, which I think might be a special some nights... If you're not sure, ask the staff. They are SOOOO nice and offer up lots of great suggestions! I usually get my food to go, but the hubby and I like to grab an empanada to eat there while we wait for our orders. I find the goat cheese empanadas to be delicious. Also... the coconut flan... ohmygod....
