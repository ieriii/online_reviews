Love Korean food! Love this place! the place can be very hectic and the lack of good service can be trying at times, but I do visit this restaurant when me and friends wants to experience great Korean food! So just try to be patience and grab any waitress that you can see coz they will help, even as far as grabbing the water boys if you need small things, they will help when they can lolThough, when you do go in the winter time, do not bring your coats in coz they will smell forever and ever. In the summer time, make sure that is your last stop coz the smell lingers even longer on your clothes.Sometimes, Cindy, the owner, even go as far as serving you herself and if you have any question on the food, she will explained how to eat and if you love the bbq, she even help putting and setting the meat accordingly.If you are having bbq, make sure you order the kalbi and Bulgogi!! they are too die for!Parking can be difficult though.
