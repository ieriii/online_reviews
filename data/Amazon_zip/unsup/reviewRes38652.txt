Amazing beer selection: the bottles and draft selection will blow your mind. The sandwiches and other entrees are good, but overpriced - I would stick to appetizers. Waitstaff and bar tenders often seem short-staffed. The crowd is a bit too hip and trendy for my tastes and the place gets packed quickly, but neither of these have ever stopped me from jumping at the opportunity to go here.
