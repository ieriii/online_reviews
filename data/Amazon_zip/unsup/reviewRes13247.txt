Glenn's is pretty good, but it can sometimes be a hit or a miss. The clam chowder is amazing, and paired with the delicious potato pancakes can be a great meal all in itself. However, sometimes the wait can be 45 minutes + for a weekday lunch, the service tends to be a little slow. What really disappointed me is that they have so many delicious breakfast specials, including great pancakes and french toast available every day of the week, but they don't serve real maple syrup. I'd rather pass on pancakes than dump Mrs. Butterworth's on it - the two main ingredients are High fructose corn syrup, and then corn syrup. Blech. Seriously, when you're so high class on the fresh seafood and everything else, why skimp on the syrup?
