A place that is very hard to get into, rightfully so, can be enjoyed by creepily standing near or at the bar waiting for others to leave their tables. Yes, this is the trick, don't know any other way to put it. That is exactly what happened a year ago, the only time I've been lucky enough to snag a spot at the bar within 15 minutes. Every other attempt, well, has been given up. I am a mexican at heart, with tequila running through my veins, so I HAD to try this place. Margarita please! Yum yum and strong. Chips and guac are amazing of course and I had the Tacos al carbon. I got the chicken and It came with two salsas, mmmm, beans, more guacamole and tortillas. Pretty flavorful stuff right there. The menu is huge and apparently changes seasonally--I wouldn't expect anything less from Ricky B. It's pricey, as you would expect; every dish is about $10 more than your average mexican restaurant in Chicago. I would love to come back again in success and try something more exotic!
