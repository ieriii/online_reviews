Best sushi EVER!! I absolutely love this place and the unique ingredients they use in their sushi and drinks! If you want a "experience" this is definitely your place. It's very trendy, young and hip. A little loud inside and hard to hear. If you want just causal sushi I would choose a different environment. Went here with my sister late night at 9, and went with my mom at 6pm which was perfect for both - at 6 it was quiet enough to have a conversation, since my mom hates to talk over loud music!
