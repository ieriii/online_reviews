Much better the second time around! Came here with a veggie friend and was inspired to order like a true vegan - no "fake" meats - so I sprang for the homemade black bean veggie burger. Served with lettuce, tomato, onion, creole mustard and an addition of avocado, this burger was heartily + pleasantly stacked. It was quite possibly one of the best housemade renditions of a black bean burger I've ever had, and the accompanying fries sealed the savory deal. The carrot cake still stands its own against any carrot cake in the city... I'm pretty sure it's not low-calorie, but let's just say it's better for you. That's what I choose to believe, anyway! The Chicago Diner... wowing meat-eaters with the meat-free since '83.
