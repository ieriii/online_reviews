Flew direct from Kauai to Chicago and had to rapidly adjust to the time difference. Thank goodness for the warm weather and this superb recommendation from my neighbor. Only had time for late lunch/early dinner and ordered: Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes Sicilian Iris Irony is the pig's ear served in an adorable ceramic pig. The combination of the fried egg with the fried pig's ear was brilliant. As for the milk braised pork shoulder, it was juicy, tender and one of the best I've tasted. Pure swine delirium which rekindled my love for cooking. Unfortunately, I don't remember much about the dessert so whatever. The Purple Pig was a pivotal moment where I truly agree that "life is too short to have bad food."
