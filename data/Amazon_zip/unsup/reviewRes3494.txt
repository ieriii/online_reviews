OMG DELICIOUS! I love trying new places, thanks to my travel buddy I got a reccomendation for this place over the phone in the car. I was trying to figure if I heard correctly... Korean burrito? what on earth is that? My friends and I ended up getting a buddha bowl (aka bi bim bop), chicken (seoul sassy and crisp bbq.. yumm to the latter), and a beef burrito. plenty of food to fill, the owner is super nice and chatted with us. love! and its definitely affordable for being specialty and fusion food.
