The Burrito Suizo Ranchero was great!! The structure of the building is good and cleanliness.But i have to agree with the other reviews the service was horrible..after attempting to tell the waiter what we order she rolled her eyes and walked off.you have to flag them down in order to get a refill..Good food bad service...I would defiantly go back for a burrito TOGO!!!! and pick up some green salsa from somewhere else or make my own....
