We had an absolutely delicious and fun meal celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. The wait staff was fantastic and the decor is classic for a steakhouse. We had the scallops for an appetizer (at the suggestion of our waiter)- some of the best I have every had. I had the big eye tuna special and my boyfriend had the Kansas City strip. The tuna was seared perfectly and he said his was the best steak he had ever had. They were complemented perfectly by lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. For dessert, the waiter brought a chocolate pudding cake with a birthday candle and Happy Birthday written on the plate in chocolate. This was a completely memorable meal- I whole-heartedly recommend Mastro's to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion!
