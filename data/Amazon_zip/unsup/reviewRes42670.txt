Ah, Gilt Bar gave me exactly what I was craving tonight. Delicious drinks (great Dark & Stormy, delicious Vodka Smash), comfortable environment and fantastic food. My lovely dinner partner and I started out with the ham and cheese "fondue" with the farm egg. So good. I had to refrain from wiping the dish clean and eating the "no more toast" leftovers with my spoon. I had the fettucini with artichokes & braised rabbit and wawaweewah! Hot damn that was good! I don't usually order pasta when I go out, but all their pastas just looked so freakin' yummy. I will say though, the rabbit sealed the deal for me on that one for me. Mmmm, delicious rabbiiiit. I'd eat it again tomorrow. Possibly the next day. And the next day too. We didn't have dessert, but that doesn't mean I didn't see anything I wanted. I was wearing skinny jeans, people! Dessert was just out of the question. Got a peek at Curio on the way to the bathroom (which is going to be the inspiration for my next bathroom remodel) and would love to go hang out in there as well. Merci, Gilt! I'll be back!
