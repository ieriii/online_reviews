What can I say that hasn't already been said? This place is fantastic! The wait isn't too bad (30-45 min depending on time of day), but by some dining pacing (it is only hot dogs after all), you always get a table by the time you get to the counter and place your order. Doug takes the orders at the counter. Always very friendly and helpful (got to love an owner of a place this successful that still so engaged). We always get 3 dogs (this time, polish, brat, and fire), fries (no duck fat today!) and soda. Best.Dogs.Ever.
