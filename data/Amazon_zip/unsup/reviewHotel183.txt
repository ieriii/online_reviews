Very nice room. Very nice price. AWESOME location. Did valet parking around the corner for $28 for the night, not too shabby for Chicago. Room was laid out soo well, we almost felt like we were in an apartment. Bed was very, very comfy and I have a hard time sleeping throughout the night at a hotel. Check in/out was quick and everyone on the staff was willing to help us if needed. The only downside? The elevators were insanely slow. We waited about 5 minutes every time we needed to go somewhere, thank god the Ice Machine was on our floor!
