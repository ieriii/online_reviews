The Bongo Room in Wicker Park is fantastic! This is not an understatement either. I have never been more happy after eating Sunday brunch. Although the wait is a hefty one... ours was over an hour... it is well, well, well worth it! My dear friend, Harsh came to the Windy City for a nice weekend of fun in the sun, great drinks and delicious food. Boy, did he leave town on a high note, this being his last meal before hitting the road back to Saint Louis. The three of us sat belly up to the bar, where our waitress kept serving up our coffee and tea while we reminisced our ventures over the weekend. I was fortunate enough to get a bite of a few things from their short, but sweet menu. My great company had eggs benedict--two ways. Tyler had the feta and spinach, while Harsh opted for the beef tenderloin selection--both orders were savory and GOOD! I, on the other hand gave into my sweet tooth and had the lemon ricotta and coconut pancakes with homemade walnut butter--heaven on a plate topped with powdered sugar! If you are looking for a new brunch spot to try, or are in the mood for sweet and savory Midwestern goodness--this is your answer!
