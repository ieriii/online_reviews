I can't get enough of this place. I want them to franchise and go nationwide. If you are reading this Crisp, contact me I'll try to put you in touch with business people to make this happen! Whenever I need to go to a party and bring food, I stop into Crisp and pick up the whole chicken special, with Seoul Sassy and BBQ sauce, and fries and o-rings, it is rockstar and everyone begs for more and it is gone in like 5 minutes at the party. When I eat in, it is the Seoul Steak bowl all the way -- the Atomic sauce is amazing. The helping is huge. They will do it with brown rice. The boneless chicken strips are also amazing if you don't feel like getting messy. I want them to be open til 4am so late at night I can empty my wallet there. Please expand! If you need space you can use my kitchen, if you give me Seoul Sassy stuff every day! If I could give them 6 stars I would. This is my favorite place in Lakeview.
