The best! I have been several times and I keep coming back. My favorite is the Quattro Formaggi. The crust is the best part, chewy and smoky from the wood burning oven. Last time we were there the bus boy dropped my boyfriend's left overs sent to be boxed up... they made us a whole new pizza, in four minutes flat!
