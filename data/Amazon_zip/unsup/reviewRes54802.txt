Great place to stop by any time of year for delicious food & beer pairings. It is a great place to take in a drink & read the paper/magazine/book or go with friends or your current main squeeze. The portions are generous, the staff is friendly & knowledgeable, the location is great & the patio is lovely when it is open.
