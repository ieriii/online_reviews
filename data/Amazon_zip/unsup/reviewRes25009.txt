I had tried real tapas in Spain, I think this place is as close as you can get from being authentic and amazingly good. Everything we had was delicious! And don't regret a penny (actually, our bill was $300 so kinda regret a bit but eh, it was for work).  Wine selection was great but beer wasn't. Service was good, no long wait, and waitress was super friendly and even rushed some of our orders.  Things you should definitely try -bacon and dates -shrimp -pork belly -rice pudding (and no, it's not because I am Asian. It was really good here) I highly recommend this place although it's not really a good place to take your clients out to eat.
