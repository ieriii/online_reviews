If you must wait for a table, be sure to grab a sexy drink at Wang's while you kill time. You'll enjoy yourself and in no time, be headed next door, literally, for some good sushi.  I was intrigued by the varieties of combinations and enjoyed that they had several "chef's choice" options. When I'm indecisive about what sushi I want, letting someone else make my choices is certainly the way to go. I was game for it and the sushi chef impressed me by the selection that was served up. All of it was delicious, fresh, and none of it on the skimpy side. I'd highly recommend going that route, especially if you're feeling a little adventurous and not a picky eater. My favorite menu item was a fantastic take on miso soup. This version had jalapenos! I loved it even though the miso itself was not spectacular. The great combination of miso and jalapeno was a soy-spicy match for life. It added that perfect extra kick to ready me for plenty of wasabi later on! The menu ranged in prices, many on the pricier side. I was pleased to see I could make it work on a budget without breaking the bank completely. The BYOB option helps! This is a good spot to go with a small group or a date. Either way, I'll definitely be back with a bottle or two of my favorite beverage!
