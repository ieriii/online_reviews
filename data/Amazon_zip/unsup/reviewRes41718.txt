They closed off the open kitchen! Probably to share the kithcen with Bavette's next door. Their food menu seems a little smaller, but still the great go-to's: Steak Tartare Truffle Pasta Mussles Blackened Cauliflower Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Table Wines (Red or White, $4/glass!!!) Other proteins and veggies are good too, just get what you like. Some dishes can run a bit salty - this always seems to happen here. I've been here probably a dozen times over the past couple years, and it's a great spot.
