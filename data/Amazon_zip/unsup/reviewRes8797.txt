Sheeesh kabob! Everyone has a weakness and/or hankering for a particular type of food. In my case, it seems to be Middle Eastern/Mexican. Whether I end up finishing my plate or leave a lil bit for later, I never feel guilty or gluttonous about what I've just consumed. There are plenty of fast food/dine-in Middle Eastern joints around my area, but this place is worth the trip. Their delivery service is great, but I opted to dine in during lunch time. The decor is beautiful and simple; white tablecloths line the tables with a slightly dimmed lighting. It ain't no fast food joint, that's for sure! My foodie-in-crime ordered the Soltani (Juicy marinated filet mignon & ground sirloin) & for muah.. the Joujeh combo (charbroiled chkn breast & seasoned chkn breast). While we waited for our entrees, we noshed on the fresh, warm pita bread with a plate of fresh herbs, radishes, and feta cheese. Delicious! The wait staff was decent. Our waiter looked a bit nervous, but he was friendly nonetheless.  Yes...the price at this joint is a bit steep, but lemme tell ya, it's worth every penny. They do it right, all the ingredients are fresh and perfectly marinated and seasoned, and the portions are generous. I love the meat & poultry here. It's not overly salty and everything is so tender that you can cut your meat with a fork. The dill rice is something I've never tried at other Persian restaurants. It's a wonderful surprise. I grab a little piece of Pita, cut a small piece of grilled tomato, and pieces of chkn with dill rice, and pop some feta cheese into the mix..and voila!!! You get one wicked pita sammy :)
