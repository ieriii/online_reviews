This place was ok, It didn't really wow me in anyway and I'm not sure if I'll come again. I really wanted to like it due to it being my first greek restaurant in GreekTown but sadly I just can't jump on board. The location is pretty nice and the ambiance is very welcoming but I think due to the volume that they serve, the quality of the food has probably suffered. I went with my family and some family friends on a sunday and I ordered a greek salad, calamari, and charbroiled sea-bass. The greek salad was kind of disappointing at first I was expecting a bed of tomatoes, cucumbers, feta cheese, and onion but instead I got ice berg lettuce, a few tomatoes and a block of feta cheese.... If there isn't anything I hate more, it's IceBerg lettuce... so I was buming. The Calamari was awesome, fried perfectly and the batter was nice. I was amping. The SeaBass was decent although I wasn't terribly flavorful, they told me it was charbroiled with olive oil but I couldn't taste the olive oil at all. Fortunately once I squeezed some lemon on it, it was ok. The rice and potato that came with it was alright... I don't know maybe I need to come back and try the gyro but I feel like I can find that anywhere in this town...
