3.5 stars We took some out of town visitors to this place, and everyone had a good time. The photobooth by the bathroom was a nice offering. I definitely liked the mojitos...but the popular raspberry mojitos tasted like medicine to me. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves, but I think the atmosphere overshadowed the food a bit.
