Great food! Ethipean food may not be for everybody but it should be! Demera was extremely busy the night we went do to a Group-on invasion! Still, they got us in and seated in under 15 minutes and we got to listen to live music and watch the dancers in the meantime. Which was pretty great. Service was decent, considering how busy they were and the food was amazing. Big portions and lots of options. Spicier than I am used to even for Ethiopean fod but amazingly tasty just the same.  A great place for someone to start eating Ethiopean food with a really fun and festive enviroment.
