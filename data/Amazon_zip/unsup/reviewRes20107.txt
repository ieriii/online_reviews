I really enjoyed this restaurant, I see that many expected it to be a pub like atmosphere, Make sure you know ahead of time that you're venturing into a business casual restaurant that could very well be out of your price range, but if you go in knowing and accepting the reality of it all, you'll probably find your experience much different and better than those who did not. I've been here on two occasions, one business and another with my boyfriend on a Saturday at noon. (I enjoyed my first time so much, that I went the second time to share the experience with my boyfriend. I took care of the bill.) First thing of note, the service. Our waiter was everything you could imagine you'd want in a waiter. He was friendly, knew the menu and the dishes like the back of his hand. Offered us mimosas, although we weren't drinking that afternoon. He was attentive, made conversation without intruding or becoming annoying. He had a magnetic personality and watched him with the other tables around us, He made jokes and talked with the tourists helping to answer any questions they had about the menu, the drinks, the CTA, you name it. I am so sad I didn't get his name, But he got an amazing tip. the food is excellent. Both times I went I was incredibly pleased with my order and both times, the portions were rather large, My boyfriend ordered the Gage burger and could only eat half, came with fries. They have a beautiful bar, the interiors are very nice, dark stained wood, glass or ceramic tiles. I love the division of space, we were sitting in a rather private area. It's incredibly crowded due to its location, but the space handles sound really well, I was able to have a nice lunch that day without having to strain my voice. I recommend it to anyone that can afford it, the location is great also, there is much to see in the area before or after eating.
