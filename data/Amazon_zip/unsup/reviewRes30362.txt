You can't beat quality ingredients, a well thought out menu, and friendly service. And the best part is that the prices are decent considering the portion size and deliciousness. The wait staff is ridiculously friendly and makes you feel like you are at a home away from home. It is great for breakfast, dinner, dessert, or just drinks. The chocolate chip pancakes really hit the spot on a Sunday morning!
