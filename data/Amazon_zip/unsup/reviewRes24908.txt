If you can't decide what to order, get the mango yogurt mousse. It's got the texture of a mousse with the flavor of a mango lassi. If you like chocolate, the Valrhona is good. If you like cinnamon, the walnut baklava roll is very cinnamon-y, very sweet, and very nutty. The American doppio (espresso and water) is pretty good, too. It's light and less acidic than drip coffee. This is currently my favorite place to get dessert in Chicago. Not that I have a lot of places to compare to, but it was so good I couldn't wait to write a review. The pastries are not that pretty or neatly made, but the flavors and textures are great. I will definitely be back!
