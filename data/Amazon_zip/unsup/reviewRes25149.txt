love this place. it's BYOB so the meal is never very expensive. i love the vegetarian burrito which is $5. $5?? i am pretty sure a chipotle burrito is more than $5. we spent some time in costa rica and it always takes me back. in central and south america i basically lived on mango smoothies and i love that i can get one (even in december) here. i'm probably just sentimental, but irazu, i dig you.
