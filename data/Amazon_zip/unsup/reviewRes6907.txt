Love this place. I brought my BF here for his birthday because of his love of Italian. I had seen this place on Chicago's Best. We were not disappointed. Our server helped us find a great wine and we ordered an appetizer and our entrees. I had the shrimp and broccoli and it won best entree at our table. I loved our server, he was attentive even when it started to get busy. What a great place - looking forward to visiting again.
