So Longman & Eagle. I must say, I was impressed. I went with three friends and started with a whiskey cocktail (it was a girly one named after a flower) and a shot of Rebel Yell - we all had a shot of something since the shots were only $3 each. I liked my shot quite a bit - a first! For our small plate we all shared the duck meatloaf - with the fried quail egg, very delicious! For my main meal I got the boar sloppy joe. Wow. That was incredible. I loved the jalapeno on it as well. The fries. It took everything I had not to eat them all like a hoss! My friend got the cauliflower with lentils and curry which was hearty for a vegetarian dish, my boyfriend got the burger which he said was over cooked. The other boyfriend copied me and got the sloppy. All was fun and I would definitely go back.
