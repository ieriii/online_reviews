Ok, where should I start? First of all, my boss just took us to this place today for lunch. She says it's one of her favorite restaurants. So, I come to Yelp to read reviews and most of them are pretty good...most....here's my take on this place:The saganaki or flaming cheese was SO SALTY...oh my goodness! I ate it, because it's CHEESE, but it was so salty...I'd probably never order it again simply because of that.I agree with most on here who says the food seems like it was sitting around for a while...I ordered the seafood kabob and the shrimp were hard as rocks...I mean they were TOUGH! The entire kabob was really bland, so needless to say, I really didn't enjoy eating it. The salmon was cold and chewy...I KNOW that kabob was sitting out..you could tell by the texture and temperature of the food. NOT GOOD GUYS. My baked veggies that came on the side were actually veggie mush...it looked like stew....they were WAY overcooked. I just couldn't see what the big deal about this place is. The staff were OVERLY hydrating us by constantly filling our water glasses after ONE sip. That is highly annoying.Needless to say...don't know about everyone else, but I was not impressed and will not be going back. I still can't get over that old ass food I was served.
