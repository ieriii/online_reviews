WOW! How have we missed this little gem? My fiance and I were drove past this place after having a delicious PHO meal at another nearby favorite spot (Tank). Seeing the crowds of people nearby, Sun Wah caught our eye and we made the mental note to come back and try it soon. So glad that we did! The roomy ambiance with interesting high wooden-ceilings and exposed brick walls didn't make it seem like the other traditional Chinese restaurants I've been to in the past, but the glass/plastic -wall exposing the kitchen definitely brought the traditional "Argyle" feel back in. I went with the roast duck on rice and my fiance had the roast pork tips on rice. We also shared the beef and noodle won ton soup. The entire meal was delicious and they provide you with huge portions. We were more then full before we finished our meal. The prices are amazing, with the 2 entrees, soup and 2 tsingtaos (beer) our entire bill came out to $21! Great little spot for a yummy, quick meal on a budget.
