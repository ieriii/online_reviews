Huge menu, great selections, very attentive wait staff and lovely ambiance. I had the Meli omlete, green envy juice and mocha. The omlete was very tasty as was the green envy. They even made my mocha to suit my taste. If I had any complaints I would say less salt would be appreciated and they need a bigger bathroom. I came here on a weekday so having only one stall was not too much of a problem but there were 3 women waiting after me so weekends are rough.
