First of all, you can't beat $5 valet. You just can't. Next, you are treated to some pretty nice ambience. Ever been to the Rio in Vegas? It's a similar carnival-like theme. Also the place was huge and two levels. There was an outside seating area and private rooms for larger parties. The food was excellent as well. We started with the shrimp ceviche and the tacos de pescado. Both were tasty and was enough for a party of four to each have a little taste. Our entrees were Ropa Vieja, Churrasco, Bistek Palomilla, and the Arrachera. The steaks were cooked to how we liked them and the chimichurri sauce tasted so good. The Ropa Vieja had a nice kick to it and was very different from any type of braised beef I've had before. For dessert, we had the birthday flan, banana cream pie, and the carnivale ice cream cake. The flan was okay (quite different from the Filipino style I'm used to), but the banana cream pie and carnivale ice creams are must haves. Our server Jonathan was really good. He let us be for most of the time, but checked on us at perfect times. Bus boys were hard at work and are to be commended. Our tab was about $240 (for four people) including tip and some cocktails. Pricey, but hey you get what you pay for. All in all, an excellent evening with great food and ambience.
