We FINALLY made it back here for brunch--I had a taste for fried-green tomatoes, and some strong coffee. Just as fabulous as dinner--the fried greens were AMAZING, and the rochambeau (steak, eggs, and potato cakes) was just out of this world--tender steak, crispy 'tater cakes, and perfectly poached eggs (HATE when they overcook). Service was just as great as it was the last time we dined here, and both coffee and water were refilled constantly.
