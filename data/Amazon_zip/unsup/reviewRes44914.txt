Hands down, the best pizza I've ever had. I love Chicago deep dish! Each slice of the pie is a meal in it's self. It's well worth the wait and the price.Fresh ingredients, hearty meats and cheeses, delectable sauce, and perfectly crisp, golden brown, flaky, "melt in your mouth" crust! New York has nothing on Chicago when it comes to pizza, and Giordano's is a perfect example of this!
