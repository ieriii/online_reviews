Gotta say I was seriously dissapionted with the food. The pizza was almost flavorless, and they charged me for ingredients I ordered but weren't anywhere to be found on the pizza! I figured I would give them a second chance and ordered online so they get the order 100% perfect thinking maybe it was a mistake but it happened the second time too, pizza was flavorless and again an ingredient was missing as well as they included sides with a meal that were the opposite of what we ordered. It's like what's the point you might as well just send me whatever food you have sitting around the joint. Lost my business.
