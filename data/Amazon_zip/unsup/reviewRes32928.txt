We had reservations for 12, 2 bailed at the last minute and I was bracing for some kind of runaround but the hostess never flinched and guided us towards the bar while we waited for the rest of our party. 5 minutes later they were seating us which I think is special for the city of Chicago on a Friday night. Service was top notch with smiling, informative servers, attentive manager (at one point he sat and chatted with our "group leader") and the executive chef even visited our table. We ordered over a dozen dishes/appetizers and for the life of me I cant remember half of what I ate. Crispy pata, loompya, oxtail potstickers, rock shrimp tempura, corn fritter, BBQ pork ... The chef even sent out a "gift" dish not yet on the menu. This was probably the best meal I've ever eaten in Chicago. If you like asian inspired food, this place has out of the ordinary dishes and old time favorites (prepared with a twist) that really hit the spot. Aside from the excellent food and service, there was an abundance of eye candy at the bar. Topping it off, after dinner the manager arranged for our entire group to be escorted to the front of the line down the street at The Underground. Can I give this place 6 stars?
