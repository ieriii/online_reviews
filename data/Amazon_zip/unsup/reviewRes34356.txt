Yolk is possible one of the better breakfast place in Chicago. The place was packed on a Sunday and I believe that the Neuroscience Conference at McCormick Place increased the traffic at the restaurant. The service was fast and seating was quick (within 10 minutes of writing my name down). The portions were average but very delicious. If you want to see how their service work, just sit at the bar and you'll see a live representation of "Hell's Kitchen" without all the cursing.
