In every corner of this grand old edifice -- in both basements; in the beautifully lit Palmer Lounge; in the Empire Room; in the ornate lobby with its glorious circular bar -- in every single room, and from every possible direction, you will feel the gnarled, grasping claw of rapine reaching into your pocket. For the love of God. I'm willing to pay three hundred dollars a night for a hotel. What I'm not willing to do is pay two hundred a night, then be nickled and dimed for the third hundred. As I check in, I'm informed that the valet service will cost 60 dollars a day. It's not uncommon to pay for valet service, but 60 dollars seems a bit steep, and it'd have been nice to choke on that figure before I surrendered the car. Use of the internet costs 15 bucks per day -- unless you want a porn-streamable connection, and then it's 20. Use of the gym 10 bucks per day. There is a cheap plastic cork screw sitting on my desk, and I will not be surprised one goddamn bit if a nominal rental fee for its use magically appears on my bill tomorrow morning. And in this fashion, a high end hotel turns in a low-rent customer experience. A particular shame given that the service people are consistently and exquisitely gracious.
