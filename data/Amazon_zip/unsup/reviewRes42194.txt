Wow! nothing beats a glorious steaming bowl of pho in any possible combination you can imagine. For a Vietnamese food newbie I was asking "what's that?" and "can I try that?" during lunch with the family. The possibilities are endless here and that's what makes Tank so much fun. Only drawback--it seems the soups are the way to go (it is a noodle restaurant after all) because the lemon chicken was a bit dry. Still going back again and again!
