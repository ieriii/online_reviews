They have a really cool salad bar with chicken, shrimp ( cooked), a few curries ( i could make out one, and it was okra), and random salad stuff. Everything looked quite fresh. The bf got the lamb shwarma and i got chicken dinner. The portions were above average, but the hummus was amazing and so authentic! We got the pomegranate chocolate cookie too ( its horrible). My chicken was very well spiced but the lamb i thought was kinda bland. Ive definitely had better shwarma no doubt ( in nyc) but for the price ( 9$ per platter which came with-meat, rice, hummus, and 1 pita or 4.65 for just the sandwich), its definitely something i would return to :) Overall, its kind of a cute, cozy place, away from milwakee and all the rush ( which is great, cause you can actually find parking). Besides the sandwiches and salad stuff, they sell random things like candy, jordanian almonds, dried figs etc ( expensive tho) OH BTW- its cash only! They do have an atm inside, but to avoid those nasty charges, just bring cash:)
