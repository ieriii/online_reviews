I emailed this to Fox and Obel this morning, but the email address they offered on their website bounced back. Fox and Obel has been slipping.... I have been a loyal customer for 4 years. Each morning I head to F&O for coffee (usually multiple, as I get Streeterville for my doorman) and a muffin, or a brown box breakfast. Yesterday, my brown box options were limited to one option, then I was not able to check out in the front of the store, as no one was there. I waited for a few minutes, but no luck. Today, I had zero options for brown box breakfast. Customers like myself who shop in patterns like consistency. I know that you have had some issues with service, etc and have worked hard to make changes.I noticed the slide in service and the effort to turn it around, but I would hate to have to locate a new establishment for my morning needs. I want to know that I can depend on F&O for my AM needs.
