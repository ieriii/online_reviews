Place is cool, the line to get in is long but they move it along. The service is excellant. The pizza is very meh! The pizza just didn't seem cooked and I think it's because they're so busy that they hurry the order. Having said that, I still think it's a tourist must for Chicago just to say you did it. After that, go around town to local places and the deep dish is so much better.
