I've been three times now to Lao Sze Chuan, and each visit has been a bit of a culinary adventure. My only complaint is that the menu is so sprawling and sometimes vague or clumsily translated into English that it's hard for someone who isn't "in the know" about traditional Chinese dishes to make decisions. I prefer to visit with a large group in order to try a bit of everything. Better yet if I can visit with Chinese friends who can really steer me in the right direction. I'm a very adventurous eater, and it's nice to be able to process all the details of a menu before making final decisions. All that said, everything I've had has been terrific. The famous "three chili chicken" is as good as its reputation. Pig stomach in garlic sauce was spicy, garlicky and a welcome addition to my culinary repertoire. I even love the little cabbage-in-chili-oil amuse bouche presented on the table before the rest of the meal is served. My preference is to order a variety of dishes (meats, vegetables, seafood) in varying degrees of spiciness. This being a Sze Chuan restaurant, "spicy" is usually the order of the day, but there are variations to be found in noodle and dumpling dishes to help cool down from some of their more intense creations. One word of warning: this place gets crowded very quickly, and one should expect a wait for a table during peak hours. The staff aren't the most helpful people in the world (not rude, but not inclined to engage in friendly banter either). If you are at a table during peak times, you may have that feeling that you're getting the eye from someone who is anxious to clear your place and give it to the next person in line. It may not be the most "traditional" Chinese restaurant for some who know better, but it's a quantum leap ahead of the completely Americanized "Chinese" restaurants that serve up gelatinous servings of sweet-and-sour pork.
