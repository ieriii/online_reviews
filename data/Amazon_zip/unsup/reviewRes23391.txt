I've been coming here for a while now and my last visit just reminded me that i was on yelp and should write a review! the place is really small and always crowded, so if its nice out i suggest sitting outside. I've tried a handful of dishes all very tasty! if you can't have sodium in your diet then i can't recommend much on this menu as they love to use salt on everything! its BYOB and if you forget there is a wine shop across the street!
