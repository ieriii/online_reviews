I have been to Sunda three times, and I should preface this review by saying I don't like Sushi and am not generally a fan of Asian food. Despite these preferences, I think Sunda is very very good. The menu is very diverse and offers many different options, so those who do not care for Sushi still have a considerable number of choices. I've tried several of the Sushi options here and have liked most of them. The lobster and waygu roll is amazing. The Chilean Sea Bass is some of the best fish I've had...moist and delicate, in an interesting preparation. The Crabcake Ahi Tuna is unique and also excellent. On each occassion the sevice had been friendly and fairly good. My only difficulty with this restaurant is the noise level. On a crowded night, it becomes almost impossible to carry on a conversation. Desipte that, I will be back!
