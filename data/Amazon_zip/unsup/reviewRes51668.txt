Greasy food and slow service. Their vegetarian burrito is good and the only thing on the menu that hasn't made me sick afterwords...avoid anything with meat in it. The place mostly caters to yuppies...not the most authentic experience. Service is also a problem...I often find myself waiting for exorbitantly long times to place an order, have my drink refilled, or even to get my food when I know it only takes them 10 minutes to make it. Take out service is better and recommended unless you're REALLY not in a hurry.
