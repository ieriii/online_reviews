What a great experience, time and again.My first time was at the recommendation of a friend for brunch. We ended up brunching for 2 hours with 11 friends, some coming while others were going - and the service was friendly, warm and always welcoming through it all. The food not only exceeded my expectations as a Southern boy with lots of New Orleans time under my belt, it blew them away.The crabcake benedict was flawless, and every other meal at the table was equally as perfect. Needless to say, it was my first choice for a birthday dinner a few nights ago, and has quickly become my most recommended and talked about hangout.Kudos for creating such a warm, inviting, friendly and professional spot among the many, many attitude and dismissive establishments in North Chicago.
