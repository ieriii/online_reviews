We came here on a Friday night for a 7:00 reservation and sat on the patio. It was lovely. Our server, Alberto, was fantastic. He took our order without writing anything down, and recited the specials and menu highlights from memory without a stumble. Normally I get this feeling of annoyance when servers don't write down my order, but Alberto is a veteran and was clearly one of the more requested servers. We definitely lucked out having him take care of us. The food was delicious and from start to finish there was perfect execution to our evening. We began with the Tenderloin Carpaccio, followed by a caprese salad and fava bean salad. For our entrees, I had the Spaghetti Neri (black spaghetti with a wonderful tomato sauce and seafood) while my husband had the fish special of the evening served with a white white lemon butter sauce and capers. We had a bottle of Chianti with our dinner, and finished with a slice of the ricotta cheesecake with fresh berries. Our server never rushed us, and the timing ad execution to our meals was perfect.  I can't wait to come back and enjoy the beautiful patio again soon. Definitely a Chicago gem.
