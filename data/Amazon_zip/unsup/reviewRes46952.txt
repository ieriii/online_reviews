The only restaurant worth going to in Roger's Park--without it I'd have moved long ago. Always been a big brunch fan there (best chai latte ever), but the already solid dinner menu continues to improve.  While your hippie friends enjoy the wonderful [organic] sunshine salad, you now can enjoy succulent pork belly and rillettes appetizers with a fine glass of Matilda. What else is needed? The duck is consistently perfectly cooked, burgers satisfying (especially with sweet potato fries), and the desserts are not to be overlooked. Be sure to order the apple crisp, and double check for the chocolate bread pudding (actually made from cake, served with gelato and grilled white peaches), which makes rare special apperaances. It may cost a little more than Heartland Cafe down the street, but I'm done kidding myself, and just cough up the extra money for the better food.
