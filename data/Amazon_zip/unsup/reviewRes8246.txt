I don't understand how a person could not love this place... first, the salad bar is amazing in itself! Seriously, I would come here to eat at this amazing salad bar. It has everything one could want. We went on a Thursday night and actually got there at 5pm and they were able to seat us immediately without a reservation. Every piece of meat that I tried was delicious and the service was amazing! I cannot wait to go back and stuff myself again!
