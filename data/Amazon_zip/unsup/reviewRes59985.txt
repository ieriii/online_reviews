Went here for brunch on a Saturday. Ambience is pleasant but the food leaves more to be desired. Latte - was brought out coldCornbread muffins - dry but the accompanying butter was good. Cheddar corncakes - bland and flavorless. The redeeming dish was the Gumbo. The waitress "warned" me that it was dark and slightly bitter but it was really good. That would be the only dish that I might go back for.
