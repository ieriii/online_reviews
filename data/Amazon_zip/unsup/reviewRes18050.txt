We returned to the Bad Apple last night to have a burger and beer. We had two burgers - the Black and Blue and the Reuben Burger. The Reuben burger (burger with cole slaw and thousand island on a pretzel roll) in particular was outstanding and perfectly cooked. To accompany our burgers we had sides of curry and truffle fries - with a particular nod to the curry fries (although I'm biased). The beer selection here is outstanding and quite large. I settled on a nice St. Bernardus to drink with my burger but there were at least 9 others I'd like to try some other time.
