I was pretty happy with my trip to Piccolo Sogno. I went on a nice summer day, and their back patio is gorgeous. Very garden-like with umbrellas for every table. I also saw string lights, so I bet it would look pretty nice at night too. Their olive oil is gross, and it's kind of funny that they private labeled it and are selling it. I had a pasta for lunch, and I absolutely loved that they provided "appetizer" portions, which ended up being a good sized entree. It was a pretty good version of fresh pasta too. The asparagus was a nice touch, and it wasn't too greasy.
