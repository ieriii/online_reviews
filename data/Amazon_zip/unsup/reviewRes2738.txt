Divine. Sublime. Superb. I didn't know exactly what to expect about TRU, I had never been to a world class restaurant like this so I was worried my tastes weren't refined enough to appreciate the cuisine. I was wrong. Everything was outstanding, but the highlights for me were the sweet potato soup (sweet, rich, lots of distinct flavors), the grilled foie gras that accompanied my ribeye, and the peppermint indulgence dessert (just get it). Service was stellar; very professional and calculated without being stuffy. Bar none, the best dining experience of my life.
