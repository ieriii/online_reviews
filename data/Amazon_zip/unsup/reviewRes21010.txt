This was an interesting experience! We went here on a Saturday night (7pm) and the house was packed; I mean packed. That's a great sign: it means the food is fresh (turnover) and the taste keeps people coming back. The wait was an hour and forty five minutes so we ended up sitting at the bar; which was fine. Sushi was very fresh; I got the chef's special ($15) and my wife got a couple of various rolls ($19). I was impressed with the taste and imaginative use of flavors. My special included a deep fried salmon spring roll which was the best I'd ever tasted. It came with a coconut crme dipping sauce accented with orange peel, perfect for clogging up my arteries. The taste was sensational but the portion size was the smallest I'd ever seen. It literally left me hungry. The BYOB aspect is helpful but I think many BYOB places boost their food prices knowing they are not making anything on the drinks. The atmosphere is very loud; people are clearly having a great time. Overall a great experience in flavor and taste, but the serving portions left me empty.
