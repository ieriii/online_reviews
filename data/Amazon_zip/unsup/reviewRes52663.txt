Went here over 2 months ago for the lunch buffet and we loved it! I thought that the $20.00 lunch buffet was well worth it. The meats are amazing, so tender, juicy, and tasty! I loved the roasted pineapple, I had to get a piece everytime the waiter came around. Their salad bar is small, but everything was fresh.
