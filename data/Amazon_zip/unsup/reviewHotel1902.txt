We visited Chicago over Memorial Day weekend and stayed at the W City Center. It has the same feel as other Ws we've been to; hip, stylish and sleek. The interesting thing is that once you enter the cavernous lobby, you look up and the architecture appears to have a more Victorian, turn-of-the-century feel. Ornate ceiling moldings and the like, juxtaposed against sleek modern...definitely an eye-catching combination.  The elevators have an interesting sleight-of-eye decoration inside and truly, I wouldn't want to be tripping when riding in one of them. Just being stone sober inside the elevators could give you a headache if you weren't careful.  Our room was recently updated, according to the deskperson, and definitely smelled of fresh paint when we opened the door, The paint small clashed a little with the gentle orange scent that otherwise perfumed the air. The room itself was utilitarian, but TINY. I'm talking smaller than New York City hotel rooms. Really. A great little space, but emphasis on little. As long as you're not staying in your room much, the space is just fine for sleeping. The bathroom was updated nicely and was surprisingly spacious compared to the room itself.  Overall a nice place to stay, centrally located and near a Starbucks which is nice for morning coffee. We'd stay here again!
