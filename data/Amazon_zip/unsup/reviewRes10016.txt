Yo girl, can I get a piece of that?!? Thoroughly enjoyed my pizza lunch and more so due to the fact that Piece seems to be one of the only places to get tasty thin crust 'zzah on a Monday! Who knew? All Pizzerias go dark on a Monday, yo! Well, not this one... Oh no, it's all open and all for the taking on a glorious Monday (and, um, all other 6 days of the week). Bravo! Went pizza pie mad for their crispy, buttery thin crust and enjoyed the build your own element to the menu. One part fresh basil + one part fresh tomatoes + 2 parts fresh garlic + all parts tangy red sauce and mozzarella made me a very happy girl. Loved the light hand of the sauce and cheese while the overall feeling of the pizza was still abundant and generous. All pizzas come out piping hot on a rimmed baking dish and with a cute little accompaniment of a parmesan, red pepper and oregano shaker toppings bar. 'Cuz who doesn't love a toppings bar? I invented the muthafuckin' toppings bar! An addition of the ample Piece Mixed Greens Salad featuring pears, pecans and gorgonzola cheese roundly out the meal beautifully. Truly, the only thing lacking was one - or five - of their signature, made in-house, craft beers. It was a Monday. It was lunch. It was back to work for me. Pizza and beer on the next round! Who's buying?
