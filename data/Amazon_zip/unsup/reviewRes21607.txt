This place is great, I'm going to make this bad boy short, sweet, and to the point: Service - great, waiters are kind, wonderful, and attentive - even cued me in to 1/2 price margarita night! Food - SO delicious. None of that greasy, bland, tasteless food here. The food has great flavour, you can taste that they don't skimp on cheap ingredients, and I've loved everything I've ever tried here (Chimichanga is my fav though - go hard or go home right?) Get there early on Tues/Thurs so you don't have to wait, Tip your waiters well, this isn't some dirty joint, and be prepared for a great meal that is easy on your wallet!
