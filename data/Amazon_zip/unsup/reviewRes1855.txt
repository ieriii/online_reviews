I'm a bit of a health nut, but even I didn't find the meats too greasy (of course, I didn't have the foie gras and duck sausage and duck fat fries. Another day...). I had the spicy mole chicken sausage + the keira knightly. AMAZING! I loved it!!!!!! My friend had the regular dog which was just as good. Will definitely be coming back. The outside seating could be a little more inviting, but eating inside was fine. It is clean and despite the line wrapped around the building, there were plenty of open tables.
