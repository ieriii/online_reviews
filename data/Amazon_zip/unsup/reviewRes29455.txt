This place was great. I had my birthday party here and the waiter was so nice and accomodating. I like the atmosphere, very pretty! It's sad but I rate asian food by how good the crab rangoon is. This place had the best crab rangoon I've ever had. I ate a little from everybody and I liked everything I tried. The best part...it's BYOB and there is a liquor store right on the corner, plus no corkage fee. We went through 3 bottles of wine and a 6 pack. The totals came to $15 a person, but that included a ridiculous amount of appetizers and food. My friends were happy campers.
