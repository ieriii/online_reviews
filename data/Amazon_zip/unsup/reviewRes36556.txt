I am a sushi addict and cannot ever get enough! My friend lives up in Edgewater and turned me onto this BYOB sushi restaurant about 2 years ago. Now I live in the Ukrainian Village, so getting up there does not happen as often as it should. What this place becomes to me is a fun adventure with a great end result! It takes me a good hour to get up there from where I live, but the jaunt is SO worth it. By far this is my favorite BYOB sushi restaurant in the city. Indie's specialty Maki is to die for. There are generally 1-2 special Maki rolls that do not appear in the menu and from what I've been told, those rolls are being beta tested before adding them to their regular menu. Alongside the tasty Maki rolls, their wait staff is very attentive to everyone's needs. I am never left waiting long and that speaks volumes to me as a customer. It means that everyone gets the attention they deserve to make this restaurant one of the best in our fine city. The dim lighting and atmosphere are also strengths behind a dining experience at Indie Cafe. The mood is seductive, so this place is great for dates. Plus, the whole notion of this restaurant being BYOB is just smashing from the date angle. I've never been here for lunch. Maybe one of these days... I also have never tried their Thai food. Seriously...the sushi is to die for and it takes me a good hour to get up there. I am generally on a sushi mission. Maybe some day I'll try the Thai. For now the sushi is some of the best inside Chicago that I've ever had!!
