Went to hopleaf on a date a few weeks ago and was really impressed. GREAT selection of beers and the female bartender was really nice in helping us make our decisions. The menu was very original, compared to other bar & restaurants in the city. We shared the Belgian mussels for two with a side order of fries. YUMMY! Only downside: the 45 min wait... then again, with such a great beer selection who's complaining?! Date or no date, I'll definitely be back.
