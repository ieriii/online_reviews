My Boyfriend and I stayed for 2 nights and our total bill was about $250. Not bad at all! Our room was great, I mean it's no Ritz-Carlton, but it was perfect for it's price. Everything was clean and orderly and I wasn't grossed out at all. Although we were only there for 2 days, we went to their gym so we didn't feel too guilty about all the Chicago-style pizza we just scarfed down our throats and it wasn't too shabby. We never ate the complimentary breakfast, but we did see it and it look delicious, and what is there to complain about if it's free! On the last day we had to check out at noon, but our flight didn't leave until about 7pm and we still wanted to walk around so we asked the front desk if they could hold it for us and they were pretty nice about it. My only complaint is that a couple of the front desk guys were pretty snooty/douchy, but the all the girls at the front desk and the bellhops were really friendly. This place is perfectly located too. If I ever go back to Chicago, I will definitely be staying here again!
