food was great! 1st time there and im sure to go back. chicken was delish, as well as their potato salad and mashed. pizza was mouth watering! wish they had some salsa to go with the chicken but the food really doesnt need it :-) great staff also - very polite and hospitable! you must try! fyi location is small so no large groups but they do offer take out and delivery.
