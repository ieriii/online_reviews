came here for brunch yesterday with a group of friends and was very happy with the omelette i ordered -- it was light, fluffy, totally delicious. i ate the whoooole thing. not as happy with the bacon that came with it , which was light and crispy, but because it was too crispy it lost its flavor. our server, although not very friendly, was professional. loved the decor and the pig paintings on the wall.
