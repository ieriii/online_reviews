Truly excellent pizza. The deep dish IS really bready, I admit, but it tastes so good I'll forgive them. If someone could invent a deepdish pie that is right between Giordano's cheese soup and Pequod's bready loaf, I would be in heaven. The carmelized cheese crust is a delight, but the kicker is the toppings. Outrageously good sausage, big honkin' slices of peppers, nothing canned or stingy about this pie. Mmmmm. We also ordered the mostacholi with meat sauce - the noodles were a little soggy (probably because it was delivered and had to sit a little while) but was still very very tasty.
