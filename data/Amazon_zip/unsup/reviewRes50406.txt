This was the first warm weekend of the year, so my boyfriend and I wanted to eat outside. Milk and Honey was closed (4pm on Sundays), neither of us felt like eating at Crust and we spotted a few open tables on the patio outside Fifty/50. I didn't even know that place existed, what happened that Bravo Tapas place? Anyhow, the Cubs game had just gotten over, so at our request, the loud speakers outside were turned down and switched to radio. If the owner hadn't have switched it, we were going to have to eat somewhere else. But regardless, the food was pretty good. If I had not been trying to recover from the night before, I would have enjoyed a drink or a banana split. Hmmmm banana split, what a great idea! Oh, and they have a glorified mac n' cheese on there that is essently that: an $8 bowl of mac n' cheese. I'll be going back though. Good food. And if I'm in the mood for upscale bar food, it's a much better option than Boundary.
