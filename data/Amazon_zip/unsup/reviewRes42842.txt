I was just there last night and I loved it. The only reason it didn't get the 5th star was that I didn't eat an actual meal so can't judge it on that yet! My friend and I sat outside on a beautiful evening. It's a great place to sit outside in that it's not incredibly loud and busy in that area. Our waitress was extremely friendly, attentive and helpful. We had the table cabernet, which was cheap and which we both really liked, as well as a couple of apps which were delicious. Grilled peppers with parmesan and a corn dish with I think ricotta in it? Delicious. I will be back!
