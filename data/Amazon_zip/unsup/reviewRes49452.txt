Delicious!!! Food was unbelievable...I ordered the chicken stuffed with spinach and cheese, and it came with a potato, rice, salad, and fried banana. Everything on my plate was delish!!!! We also ordered empanadas and the corn bread with chorizo as appetizers and they were also really good!!! Hubby had the entraa, which I did not taste, but it looked sooooo good! And he loved it! The restaurant itself is nice, and the decor is unique and reflects its Latin menu. The bar is awesome, in particular its fresh-fruit mojitos. I had the mango mojito and it was really good, and not everyone could make a great mojito!!! I gave it four stars only because the restaurant does not allow for reservations for parties of less than 6, the wait will usually be between 45-1hr 30 min and it would be nice if we could reserve without having to invite 4 others to join us!!!
