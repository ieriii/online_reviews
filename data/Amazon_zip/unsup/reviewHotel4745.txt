My husband and I just got back from a 5 day stay in Chicago. We were looking forward to a great stay at an interesting boutique hotelbut were unfortunately very disappointed. The rooms were so small and lacked comfort and personality. The staff were slow and unprofessional. As we entered the elevator, two employees... were very obviously wrapping up a drug deal and laughed uncomfortably when they saw us. Room service food was cold and tasteless. If I could get a refund, I would still feel like I wasted 5 nights in a beautiful city. Priceline rated this a 3 1/2 stars?!?! Doubtful. The only positive point of our stay were the very helpful doormen. They were wonderful. I would strongly suggest avoiding this "boutique" hotel and staying at one of the many other fine hotels in Chicago.
