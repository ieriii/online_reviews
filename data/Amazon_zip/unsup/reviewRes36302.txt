My review is based solely on the establishment's attitude. I showed up for lunch as asked for a table for two as I was meeting a friend. I was told that I won't get seated until the rest of my party arrived. Considering that the tables for two are the same tables they seat parties of one, I was flabbergasted by the attitude. So I turned around, walked across the street and went to Artopolis. Meli's attitude needs no encouragement.
