After living in the flat state of Illinois for 4 years and failing to have a decent Chicago dog, I have finally come here. Walk in to a warm and small hot dog place that is served by friendly and funny people. Order what you want, pay half of what you expect to pay for a popular place, and enjoy the food. They really love and trust their customers here with free refills and condiments all lined up for you to use and take to your table as you please. Love? Love. The buns are perfect. Not too dry and strong enough to hold the dog. The dogs really vary. I love the names of them too. If you're new, stick to the traditional dog. It will be clean, and taste like what you THINK a hot dog should actually taste. Thank you, Hot Dougs, for not being crowded at 3 pm. Yes, go at an off time. If you don't know by now, that's the trick. If you want to go somewhere that is popular, go during an off time. Foodies... You should know that.
