I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet! This is my all-time-favorite pizza. Ever. Ever ever. I'd take this any day over Lou's or Gino's East or Giordano's or anything else in Chicago. Sausage is hunkier than Jordan Catalano and only slightly cheesier. There is no better deal than their $5 personal pan lunch special complete w/ blah-domestic beer (whatever. the $5 for the pan alone is worth it....I'll take any excuse for alcohol on top of it.) Thank you, Pequods. Thank you from the bottom of my satisfied gut.
