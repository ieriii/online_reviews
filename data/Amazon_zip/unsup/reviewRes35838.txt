I've been here a few times and we always get the duck. Its excellent 5 star dinging for a 1 star price. The bowl of mussel soup was humongous and so cheap. The food is always delicious. Once my friends meal came to us cold, and I don't like how they slice the meat for you right through the bone because little bits get in your mouth, but other than that no complaints. Friendly staff. Roomy dining area.
