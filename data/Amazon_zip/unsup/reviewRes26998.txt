If I could, I would give this place 10 stars! LOVE LOVE LOVE it! The queso panela is to die for. The dishes are authentic, and delicious! The food is cheap too...a great value for what you pay. And the homemade tortillas are really good! It is always relatively busy so that is also a good sign to fresh, delicious food! Also, every time that I have come here, I have had GREAT service, waiters are kind and attentive and it is evident that this comes from the superb manager that always greets us as we come in! What more can I say? If you have never been here yet, definitely stop by! Again I have to say, QUESO PANELA! YUM-O!!!
