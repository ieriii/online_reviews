If you're looking to spend a lot of time in your room, you probably won't like the Palmer House. The rooms are fairly small, though certainly clean and well appointed. I stayed in a single room -- which is to say it had one double bed -- and it probably wasn't much bigger than your bedroom at home. Depends on your home, of course. And it's hard to judge, since in addition to the bed, there was a desk with a chair, a no-longer-in-service minibar, a side table, and an armoire with a TV. More furniture than would fit in my bedroom. But I digress. I've seen single rooms with king sized beds that were larger than this, and the double rooms are quite a bit larger. But if you're staying in downtown Chicago, what are you doing staying in your room? So what if it's small -- it's within walking distance of everything. Get out! Also, the Palmer House has an honest to goodness lobby, where you can sit and relax and have a drink and even eat, depending on the time of day. And it's a huge and beautiful lobby. So if your room is small, but you don't want to leave the hotel, and you aren't completely afraid of other people, hang out in the lobby. The Palmer House was built at a time when people socialized. They enjoyed it, even! Socialize. The registration area is surprisingly tiny, and the hotel is undergoing renovations, so only one entrance is available (on Monroe) and some areas are blocked off. The hotel is a destination spot for proms and business meetings/conventions/seminars, so be prepared for some congestion. And elevators are slow. But these are minor quibbles in a grand old hotel. Don't expect the latest Vegas luxury resort, and you'll be fine. An historical side note: the chef at the Palmer House invented the brownie, more than 100 years ago. The Palmer House still sells their signature brownies. At 10 bucks a pop. I passed.
