Earl P hit the review perfectly. Loud, trendy, good-looking crowd. Everything we tried was fantastic. The rock shrimp tempura and the firecracker roll were our faves. The loompya and the shaking beef were good but not as awesome as the other stuff. The service was good considering the wait staff's workload. The place was packed.
