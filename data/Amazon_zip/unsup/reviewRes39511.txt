Late night Korean up on the north end of the city. They are not 24 hours even though they claim to be. We got ousted out at 5 am (they reopened a few hours later). However, they do not mess around when it comes to ordering food. If you are vegetarian and ask to swap tofu for meat, prepare to be laughed at. And if you do not know how to use chopsticks, I have witnessed the waitress feed the uninitiated. Thumbs up for grilling tableside and the assortment of panchan (side dish apps) available. Prime yourself to smell like BBQ upon exiting stage left.
