Another hidden gem!  Now that the season calls for some warm to your heart savory meals, you can't get any better than Caro Mio. With their BYOB policy, you can have a great family style meal or an amazing night out of gourmet Italian. I'm not even a fan of Italian food, but their pasta is home made and the Porcini Mushroom dishes are amazing. Make sure to bring a great bottle of Chianti or Pinot Grigio and have a toast over some great tasting food.
