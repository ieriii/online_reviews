We got on the wait list for a table on a friday night. They said they would call my phone in 45 minutes. We killed some time at the book store and music store around the corner, then walked back over. Of course there still was a wait, so another 20 minutes till we were seated.We enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks. I can see returning, but the whole line at the door issue is stupid. Later in the night, the booth across from us was left open for a good 15 minutes before 2 people were seated, and this is a huge booth that can be easily split up to two groups. Seeing this, I thought the line outside must be gone, but sure enough there were 15 people crammed in the hallway as we left.The doorman was nice to us and appeared to be doing everything he could to seat people fast, but obviously theres a few flaws in their system.
