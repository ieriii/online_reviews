It's hard for me to write this review, because just thinking about my trip to Hot Doug's makes me hungry! Oh, I'm sorry, are you still there? I just spent 5 minutes dreaming of the Cheddar and Jalapeo Duck Sausage with Smoked Gouda and the duck fat fries. My friends loved their Chicago-style Polish sausage and Ribeye sausage with Brie. None of us could stop eating the duck fries, even once we were full. This place is worth the hype. And the wait. Though, honestly, if I'd had to wait much longer, I might have been too hungry to really enjoy it. I think that's probably why the ice cream man parked his truck right by the line!
