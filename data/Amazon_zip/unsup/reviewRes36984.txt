Delicious beer and delicious food. For dinner, I had the potato croquettes and a red cabbage salad. The croquettes were perfectly crispy, and the vinaigrette they came with was amazing. The salad was also excellent, with roasted hazelnuts. The food portions are a bit small for what you pay for, however. That was the biggest disappointment. Hopleaf is usually pretty busy, so come early. I got lucky and had friends arrive a bit before I did, so they already had a table. Otherwise, waits will range from 30-over 60 minutes.
