My take on Yolk is that it's pretty much a fancy diner. That's not a bad thing because it's clean, lively, and the service is fast. I ordered the huevos racheros which weren't that good. I can only blame myself for ordering tex-mex here. The service was good and the waitress we had was pretty cool. I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area but may stick to an omelet or pancakes.
