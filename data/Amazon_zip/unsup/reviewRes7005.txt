Love this place. As many reviews mention, this feels like visiting a friend's home (albeit a super classy, beautiful home with lots of seating). The atmosphere is comfortable and clean, with friendly service that enhances the cozy experience. The food is outstanding, and arrives quickly. In lieu of a complimentary bread course, everyone receives homemade chips and pickles. The chips are this outstanding, interesting blend of smoky-spicy and lightly sweet. I could eat an entire bag. For a kinda embarrassing taste-treat, dip your chips in the spicy barbecue sauce. For main courses, our party ordered baby back ribs, some other cut of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich and kobe beef brisket. Everything was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. The kobe beef brisket was my favorite, and the star ingredient in my "best leftovers sandwich ever" the next day. We also shared a milk & cookies dessert, which was highlighted by an amazing oatmeal-bacon treat. My only complaint is that they don't appear to have beers on tap. What? That's just weird. Get some taps in that bar, Q. Otherwise, keep doing what you're doing so well.
