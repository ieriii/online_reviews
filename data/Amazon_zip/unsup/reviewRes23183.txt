I already gave this place a 4 star review, but... after this past weekend, definitely upping it to five. This past Thursday I had about 25 people here for my birthday... and the folks at Irazu COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ACCOMMODATING. We sat in the covered outdoor room, a little warm... but it's mid July! God bless my mother for birthing me in the middle of summer! Constantly refilling chips and salsas, waters, bringing in a cooler of ice for the wine/beer that needed to be chilled. I could not have asked for better service, or food, on my birthday. AMAZING. I REPEAT (ALL IN CAPS, ON THE INTERNET, SO YOU KNOW I'M F'ING SERIOUS) AMAZING.
