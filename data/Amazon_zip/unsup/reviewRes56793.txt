Went on a Friday night and was able to sit on the patio without any wait. The waitress was kind and spent time explaining appetizers and pizza to us, since its all italian we had no idea what half the ingredients where. Food came out quick and while we where waiting we got some cheesy dough thing it was yummy. Will definetly go back.
