The first time I dined here it was 2004 and I had no idea who Rick Bayless was but that didn't matter because the margaritas were so great, I thought about them for years. (True!) To date, I've eaten here twice and each time the wait has been INSANE. It doesn't seem to matter when you show up, so make a reservation or go with an open agenda. Having said that you can usually snag a place at the bar, which I did this past Tuesday. I started with a pretty basic margarita on the rocks with salt. At the bartenders recommendation I ordered the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena. That is, a Creekstone Natural Black Angus rib steak marinated in spicy red chile. The dish was served with black beans, sweet plantains (my favorite) and guacamole. While it probably wasn't my favorite cut of beef, the rib steak was was tender and well complimented by the sides. I liked that their beef is typically "natural", grass fed, and/or local. Given what we know about food, health and the environment I feel that at this point in time every restaurant should at least offer one local item. That aside, the portions were ample and of high quality. Even though I alternated between small bites and taco making (with fresh tortillas that come with the entres) I ended up still leaving a good amount of food on the plate. (Except for the plantains of course!) The drinks we're awesome once again. I tried a few different versions of margarita including one with an aged tequila and another coffee version that was delightful. I highly recommend that as an after dinner drink. Mmm Overall this place is great. I'll definitely be back but for smaller plates. There's just too much goodness on the menu to commit to one.
