I've lived in South Loop now for 5 years, and this place is no good. Go to the Bongo Room if you want breakfast. Yolk has large portion sizes, and a nice atmosphere.. but the food is bland and flavorless. I can't recommend a single plate... perhaps get a wrap if you're forced to come here- and prepare to wait for a long time. If you're going to wait to get in somewhere, wait for the BongoRoom on Wabash. The Yolk is good to the typical American taste (flavorless), the ingredients are the cheapest you can get ahold of- this place is the high fructose corn syrup of the breakfast world. If you've never left the US and never lived in France, Spain, Mexico or Italy (visiting won't qualify for building a real palate), you enjoy large portion sizes with no flavor- eat up at the Yolk.
