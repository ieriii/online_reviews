I went in with much anticipation due to the gushing of the masses. I stopped in on a Thursday evening around 8 pm, to find a line and a slight wait until a table was ready (inefficient). Similar to other less-than-impressed reviews:DECOR 4LAYOUT 3 (awkward)SERVICE 7FOOD 4 (see below)My friend and I ordered the Carnitas soup, the Ahodaga torta, guac / chips and the Mexican hot chocolate. Unlike street food in Mexico, these prices are not reasonable or representative of anything other than what Rick Bayless can charge in downtown Chicago. $11.50 for a bowl of soup ... need I say more!!GOOD: there are some interesting flavor notes. The chocolate was thick and rich. Guac & chips ... perfect and proven.BAD: SALT, SALT and more SALT in both soup and tortas. I had two sips of soup and shoved it aside. I was hoping someone might ask why we weren't eating it. The torta was upended in the sauce. Not a bad idea if the sandwich was ingested within a couple minutes, but otherwise the bread becomes soggy and the wood fire crunch is lost.Hopefully Rick is taking notes, reading our reviews and adjusting. His perfectionist ways lead me to believe he's doing that as I type.
