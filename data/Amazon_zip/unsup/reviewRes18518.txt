I've only ordered delivery from this place. I don't even know how I stumbled upon this or what made me decide to try this place for delivery (probably some powers from the dear sweet lord in heaven), but what ever delicious italian god made me do it... this place is amazing. I legitimately have a love affair with the chicken tortellini... be careful because it will put you into a food coma... but everything I've sampled from Caro Mio has been fresh fresh fresh as the dickens and really flavorful. The bread is always freshly baked, just dont' order the calamari unless you really REALLY love garlic because it's garlic with a side of squid.
