This place seriously never disappoints! We came here Friday night, and once again the food was spot on! We started with the Scallop salad and the scallops were cooked to perfection and the salad was super fresh light and crisp! For my main, I had the sauteed jumbo shrimp with asparagus and onions in a spicy sauce. Um, I ate every last morsel of this dish. It was perfectly spicy and the shrimps were cooked to perfection. My dining companion had the Grilled Trout cooked in a banana leaf served with a side of curry sauce. Im not a big curry fan, but this dish was phenomenal. We sat and talked for hours and were never rushed out. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Its most definitely my favorite restaurant in the city...hands down.
