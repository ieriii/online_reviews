Went here for a quick, casual meal on Friday at around 9 or 930. They said it would be an hour wait for 3 of us, so we figured we'd have a few beers while we waited. Right when we got our beers, three people at the bar left, and we swooped and took their seats. Everything on the menu looked good, but we decided to start with the soft pretzel and we all ordered burgers / sandwiches. The soft pretzel was tasty, and I really enjoyed the cheese sauce and mustard that came with it. I was also intrigued by the bacon fat popcorn, but we resisted the temptation. I had the forest burger, with mushrooms, gorgonzola, and fried shallots. The burger was a perfect medium rare, and the toppings were great. I got a caesar salad as my side, and it was good, but nothing special. They had a great selection of beers, and I liked two out of the three I had. The Bottom Up Wit and the Weizenbock were delicious, while I wasn't a big fan of the Iron Fist Pale Ale.  Overall, the place had a great vibe, and I can understand why it was so crowded. I look forward to my next trip here, when I can try more beer and more food! Bacon Popcorn Next Time!!!
