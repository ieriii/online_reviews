Sammy's is a shack across the street from Midway Airport; feel the building tremble as airplanes pass overhead! I know. Five stars for a diner? If you go into Sammy's knowing what to expect, you'll leave happy. It's a small...a very small family owned diner that only serves breakfast and lunch. There is nothing on the menu that I would go out of my way to recommend or say is something you NEEDED to try if you stopped in (except maybe the 757 Burger) but when you're talking about spending $5 per person (including drinks) for a home cooked meal with great service, it's hard to not give a place five stars for being good at being what it is... I don't know if that makes much sense, but what I do know is that when I come to this place with my son, they cut up his pancakes into little bite-sized portions before they even bring out our breakfast. That way I don't have to spend time doing it myself while my breakfast gets cold. Look, they anticipated my needs just like a real live classy joint.
