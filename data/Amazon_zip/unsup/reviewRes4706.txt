When we ordered our first appetizer, some type of roasted nuts dish, there was a long hair in the food. Eek.... The waitress did not seem to care much about it! She seemed to have the attitude of hey, 'Your at the world famous Purple Pig how dare you have a complaint'. Seriously? The most horrifying restaurant experience. We just finished our drinks and left. With the prices they are charging you would think that they would make more of an effort with the food and service.  The Purple Pig is a great place for those who want to be seen and like a stylish crowd.
