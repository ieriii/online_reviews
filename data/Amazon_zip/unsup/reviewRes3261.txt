If you like chicken wings you have to check this place out. Get both the Seoul Sassy (sweet) and the Spicy BBQ. The wings are huge (get both he wing and drumette)...so come hungry. You will be licking your fingers its so good. I also had some rice/chicken bowl....added a fried egg on top...it was good too. But you really should go here for the wings! P.S. The guy that worked the counter yesterday when I went was cute...thats always a plus!
