Really like this place, Coffee is outstanding (I mean it is really good for some reason) and the french toast options such as red velvet or cinnamon roll are great. Strawberry orange juice is mentioned quite a bit and it is very good as well. The eggs didn't blow me away but lets not take this as a back handed compliment... this place rocks
