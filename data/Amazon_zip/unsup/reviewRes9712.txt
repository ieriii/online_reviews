If you want fun in food and drink, Sprout is for you. My wife and I recently had our anniversary dinner here and it was magnificent. The food was wonderful and interesting, the service was great, the drinks fun, and the presentation and ambiance was fantastic. The five course meal was an abundant amount of food - we left over satisfied and thought the price was quite reasonable. We are already thinking about which friends we want to take there for our next visit.
