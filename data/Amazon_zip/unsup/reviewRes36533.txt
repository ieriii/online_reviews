After reading all the great reviews, I assumed that Indie cafe must be sushi heaven. Maybe my experience was so bad because my expectations were set so high. The fish was good quality, but that's about it. The nigiri we ordered were made with non-sticky rice, it fell apart when you picked it up. All of the specialty rolls were either overwhelmed with a strong flavor (like cilantro) or drown in some kind of heavy sauce. The extras totally overpowered the taste of the fish. I couldn't tell if i was eating tuna, yellow tail, salmon or shrimp. The service was good, the interior was clean and modern, but the food was bad and I will not be back.
