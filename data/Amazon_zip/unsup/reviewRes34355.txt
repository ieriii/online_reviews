I love this place! Everyone has said the falafel is great (true) don't forget that the lentil soup and curried rice with jerusalem salad are also delicious. Everything I've ever tried from here has been fantastic and the prices are insanely low. My only complaint is they really need a menu board, it can be hard to find the one laminated menu that gets passed around the line or hidden on the counter.
