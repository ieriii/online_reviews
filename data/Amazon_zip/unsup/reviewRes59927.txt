I'm only rating one thing here- The croissants. Alliance bakery makes some of the freshest, flakiest croissants in the city. I'm not sure about everything else there, but if you need a killer petit pain with your coffee, this is the place to visit in the area. Other than that, I say service is mixed from amazing to arrogant to unresponsive and sometimes the sitting area is kind of dirty/smelly.
