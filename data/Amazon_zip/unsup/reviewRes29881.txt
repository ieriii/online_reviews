Take my word for it ... there is NOTHING more comforting on a snowy afternoon than holing up here for a while over an irish coffee and raspberry scone. (Yes, weird combination. I've accepted it.) A place that meets both of my legal drug needs: coffee AND liquor. I've only ever had the scones, never been there for an actual meal. Sorry. But the scones are enough. They bake them for you. No, I mean really. They aren't under glass at the counter. You actually have to wait. BECAUSE THEY EFFIN' BAKE YOUR GODDAMN SCONE RIGHT THEN AND THERE. Bake it! Do you get that? BAKE IT. The scone covers a multitude of the sins I've been keeping track of ... the too cool for school service, the priceyness, the fact that it takes forever to get your check when it's time to go. I forgive you, Third Coast, because you have "delicate antique plumbing" in your bathroom, because of your wood panelling, because of those weird gas jet things at the door (heat?) and because of your motherfucking SCONES.
