This place is pretty good. It ain't much to look at on the inside. When you finally order your food, though, you'll have a hard time concentrating on anything else. A good friend of mine invited me to San Soo Gab San, referring to it as the Korean equivalent of a "greasy spoon restaurant." How can you possibly go wrong when you're suddenly presented with a deep, coal-filled fiery grill and a plateful of raw meat? It's a good time. The waitresses will also assault your tabletop with a ridiculous number of tiny shallow bowls containing numerous Korean side-dishes (at least, I think they're side-dishes). There's so many that you'll get to try a wide assortment of items, but they're small enough that you can move onto something else if you're not a fan of one of them. It's fun to hit with a group of people; plenty of involvement for just about anyone that feels safe slinging meat and cooking it on a grill.
