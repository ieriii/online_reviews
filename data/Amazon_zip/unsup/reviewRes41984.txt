I've lived in Chicago for 5 years now and I've tried about 25 of the city's deep dish offerings. I can safely say that this hands down, my favorite option. I've tried the big 3: Lou's, Giordanos and Gino's....and they just don't match up. The sauce, cheese, toppings and crust are all noticeably tastier at AoP. As a long time Yelp Reader and now a first time Yelp Reviewer, I felt as if Art of Pizza deserved the nod as first review. It's definitely that good. Do yourself a favor and order this soon...go for the green pepper and mushroom. It's awesome.
