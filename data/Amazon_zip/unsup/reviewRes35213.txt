You should hit this place for the experience (it felt like authentic Chinese to me, but I'm not exactly an expert on true Chinese cuisine). Do the Duck Dinner for 4. They'll wheel a whole roasted duck right up to your table and carve the meat onto a platter. Commence mouth watering and stomach growling. PROTEEEEEEEEEEEEIN. They'll use every square inch of this duck later in the meal, when duck fried rice and duck soup are brought to your table. The sauces at the table are great - of course you can't go wrong with Sriracha sauce. You can use the steamed buns to make some duck sandwiches. Throw some veggies and sauce on there and you're good. to. go.  It's within walking distance of the Riviera Theater, so it's a great stop before a show. And the value here is awesome - our tab came to $45 with tax, so it's a cheap feast for 4. Bravo.
