Great selection of stuff that is otherwise difficult to find. There is no doubt that the quality of their items deserves more stars than I am giving. I just hate the fact that this store has to be so damn upscale and expensive. Having grown up in Europe, I'm really glad that there is a store nearby that carries all those goodies that I grew up with and love, like hearty breads, a wide variety of cheese, meats, etc. However, I don't generally buy them here. There are plenty of little ethnic markets and stores in Chicago that carry everything you can get here and then some at far lower prices and with a more authentic experience. Don't get me wrong, they have a lot of great stuff and all in one convenient location. I just can't justify buying here when I can go to Little Italy or somewhere similar for the same stuff. Bottom line: good selection of foods, great convenient location (to me), but totally overpriced and pretentious - although people who valet park at a grocery store probably aren't concerned about that anyway.
