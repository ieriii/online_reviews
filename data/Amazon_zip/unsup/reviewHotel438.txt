i consider this hotel like the old bait and switch scam. it's called the chicago south loop hotel. so i assumed it would be somewhere near the loop. it is about a 15-20 minute bus ride south from the loop.  it claims to be a "boutique" hotel, which it is totally nothing like. the first night we rode in on the train and took the bus over to the hotel. as we got further and further away, we asked a passenger next to us where to hotel was and if we could get something to eat nearby. he suggested not trying to walk anywhere at that time of day in that neighborhood and to just order pizza. our first not so great sign. the hotel itself is like in nowhere land. there is nothing within like 3 city blocks of this place. on http://hotels.com it is described as 3stars and the amenities included free wifi, continental breakast, a bar and restaurant and a internet/business center. my friend michelle and i only got to use two of these, the others we found to be missing. the business room was two computers with internet and a copier from 1996. they even wanted to charge for computer use. the bar was closed at 10pm the first night we arrived and was never open when we wanted to have a cocktail. the only good things we found was the bus stop directly across and chinatown is very close. i would have given more stars, if the website and description wasn't a total lie. because really, the hotel is a little bare bones, but it's fine for cheapness and just sleeping while enjoying the city. i was really unhappy with the fog and mirrors in the description though. love, juston
