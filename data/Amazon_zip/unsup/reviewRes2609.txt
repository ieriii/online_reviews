This place is a fun stop on a weekend outing. Everyone can find something to like, even small kids (hot dogs) to adventurous grown ups who try the game sausage. My dad likes this kind of sausage, and I haven't gotten him to try this place, yet. Still, the line leads out the door, and there's very little seating so you just get your food and go.
