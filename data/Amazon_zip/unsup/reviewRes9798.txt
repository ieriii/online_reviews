I usually don't write reviews for restaurants, but my disappointing meal at Le Colonial inspired me to sign up for a yelp account and write a review. I went to this restaurant with my husband to celebrate a special occasion. The atmosphere was nice and service was good, but the food was terrible. All of the seafood was overcooked and the seasoning was off. We skipped dessert because we were so disappointed by the meal. I would never go back or recommend this restaurant to anyone.
