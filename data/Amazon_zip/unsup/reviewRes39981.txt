I went back for brunch. Disappointed again. Okay so I didn't have the fancy schmancy duck confit (pronounced confee) or any of the special dishes they serve. I just had the chicken and waffles. This is the first time I've had chicken and waffles. It was a little boring. The food was just so-so. And the coffee? pretty average. a step above diner coffee. Didn't make enough of an impression for me to be going back any time soon.
