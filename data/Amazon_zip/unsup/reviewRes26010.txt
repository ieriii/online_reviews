i thoroughly enjoyed this place. a friend & i went on a "hot date night" (bc we had a groupon). the place is super "romantical" but i have a few qualms with it. pros: the cheese fondue was fantastic as well was the bread. ~the interior is super cute and dark and cuddly ~the chocolate fondue was great & they flambe it at the table to roast marshmellows ~the salad dressing on the salad i didnt even know we were getting was fantastic. cons: they were playing christmas music which was a buzz-kill ~request a booth (if thats possible) we were sitting reallllllly close to a middle-aged couple from boston and there was mutual dislike for both parties ~i dont like marshmellows ~they offer a lot of fruit with the cheese fondue. i'd rather have meat/potatoes/cornichons/or just more bread ~the spiel the waiter said was a script. which i understand. but it was like the exact same script. verbatim. any who i would totally go back like once a year for a date night. i left full & happy & feeling romantic. FONDUE IS REALLLL
