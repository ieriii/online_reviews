The steak was really, really good. The baby octopus were excellent, too, really well seasoned and I just generally enjoy eating things that will gross out most Americans. I'd never had yucca before, but it's totally tasty, and plantains are a favorite of mine already. We shared the empanadas as an appetizer, and it was fantastic. I'd go back just to eat those. The mojitos were good, but heavy on the mint- I was worried about the mint sticking in my teeth and scaring my date. Service was good, and not overbearing, and the crowd was mixed- from Trixies and Chads to older Lakeview residents (and then tattooed hipster me). I'd definitely come back to try some of the other dishes they offered.
