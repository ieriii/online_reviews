There are some places/services in ChiTown that a gal just can't live without: An amazing tailor, a fantastic hairdresser, a competent doctor, Doughnut Vault (you know it's a necessity, don't even play...), a reliable bike mechanic, a farmer's market... and Gilt Bar. Gilt Bar, Gilt Bar, Gilt Bar...how I love you so. Gal's night out? Let's start it at Gilt Bar! After work cocktails? Gilt Bar! Just desserts? GILT BAR! I hope to God they still have that almond tart thing... Late night snack? Is Gilt Bar still open? Friend coming in from New York? Yeah, I'm totally taking you to Gilt Bar when you get here! French fries? Kennebec heirloom potatoes turned into golden rods of delight! And the aioli? Don't get me started... Who can resist local, seasonal produce turned into delish food? Who could say no to perfectly crafted drinks? And you're a monster if you turned down one of their many perfect, perfect desserts. Grab a seat where you can see the kitchen (it is run super efficiently and all of the boys who work back there are dreamy), and tuck in! You're going to have an amazing night. And if you don't? Well, then that's your own fault! ;o)
