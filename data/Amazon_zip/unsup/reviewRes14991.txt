Oh man--I love this place! Every detail, from the bar and the taps to the tin ceiling and lovingly restored dining space is first-class. Food and beer to die for. My only complaint is that they aren't closer to my place in Hyde Park. Well worth a trip to Logan Square--we'll be back again many times over the next few months, I'm sure.
