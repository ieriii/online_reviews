I would like to bump this up to 4 stars. I got a follow up from the manager saying that she could credit me for the guac and it was a misunderstanding. That was really nice of her to follow up, a lot of establishments don't care to follow up with the customers. She also mentioned that the birthday flan was not charged, we didn't notice that there was a credit on the bottom of the tab. Like I said, the food was great, service a little on the slow side, but really great management for the follow up!
