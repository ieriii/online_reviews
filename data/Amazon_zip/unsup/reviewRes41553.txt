Not great, but pretty damn good. Reservations on a Saturday night ran about 10 minutes after our scheduled time. Pretty cramped at the entrance, but not too big of a deal... I suppose. The service is what stood out during our recent visit. These guys are pros for sure. They know what they're doing, they're very helpful and give plenty of explanations and recommendations, and really wait on you hand and foot. The menus, both food and drinks, are extensive, filling, and obviously pricey. You definitely get your monies-worth in the food department, however the drinks are a bit high, and didn't live up to their price tags. My Grey Goose on the rocks was a bit disappointing, as it was mostly ice, watered down, and went down way too easily. Had to ask for a lot less ice on my second go-round. Food-wise, the Sliced Tomato and Onion and Lobster Bisque apps were well-sized, well-seasoned, and great alternatives to the more traditional side or Caesar salads. My wife's petite filet and shrimp were great, although the temperatures seemed a bit inconsistent. One filet seemed a tad overdone, the other underdone. Not a big deal, as they were still juicy and packed with flavor. I grabbed the Vegetarian Selection, comprised of Spinach Au Gratin, Asparagus with Hollandaise, and a Baked Potato. The Spinach was rich, creamy, and one of the best I've had. Not a huge fan of the Asparagus with Hollandaise, as it was a too bitter to completely enjoy.  All in all, it was a very filling, intimate dinner worth a recommendation to my friends and fam. Might check out Gibson's or Frog Bar next time...see how they match up.
