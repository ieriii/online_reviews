Favorite Chicagoland Restaurant! I have been going to Las Tablas for over 10 years and I absolutely love this place! This is a must see, must taste restaurant. My favorite dish is the "Matrimonio" ($20) which is a chicken and steak combo and quite possibly the best grilled chicken and steak I have ever tasted! The dish comes with a baked potato, yucca, and plantains. We also love the green "salsa-like" concoction that they put on the table. It's super spicy and addicting! I have been here before in groups or just my SO and me. We've made reservations before and also walked in off the street. The longest wait we have had on a walk-in was 15min on a weekend night. When Las Tablas was across the street in a much smaller space I remember waiting close to an hour- it's that good! The wait staff is friendly and attentive and you will not be disappointed!
