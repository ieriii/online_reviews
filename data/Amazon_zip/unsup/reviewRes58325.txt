awesomeawesomeawesome. Of course on a Fri night the place was jammed, but we were treated well, seated about 20 min later than our reservations, and had a top notch waitress who told us what to expect, and we were not disappointed at all. The food is not cheap, but this was a no holds barred dinner for my family and will be a lifetime memory of indulgence. Oyster sampler and huge lobsters, YUM. We WILL go back when we go to Chicago.
