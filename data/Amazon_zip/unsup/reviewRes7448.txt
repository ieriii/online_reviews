They had a great deal going on for $68 which included bruschetta, 2 house salads, basil chicken gnocchi, clam/oyster/shrimp/scallop spaghetti, tiramasu, and a bottle of wine. Everything was delicious - no complaints at all. Our waiter very friendly and helpful. The staff in general is great. There is constantly someone filling up water or clearing your table. It's a very small yet classy restaurant. We enjoyed every aspect of Sapori!
