Let me put it simple I always get whatever ravioli they are serving because it is always sweet and savory. The menu frequently changes and the ravioli is always something different BUT never ceases to be A-mazing! The onion tart they give you is a good little treat & the bread and olive oil go nice with one of their Italian wines. I have tried a lot of their apps and have picked off my guys dinner plate a number of times and can honestly say I have not had one bad thing here to eat. And I don't know what some people are talking about the server for .. He's just doing his job in a small, crowded restuarants. I always get the guy people are talking about with the glasses and he means nothing but well. He always had suggestions on great wine to go with a meal. He also reccommended apps and entrees to my friend and I. Maybe people caught him on a bad day? But I have had him 5 times in a row and he has been nothing but helpful. So maybe give him another try - he's busy as well as everyone else and ask questions ( coming from a former waitress) ! Otherwise, you will be helplessly lost because I was - I could not read the menu. :( waaah
