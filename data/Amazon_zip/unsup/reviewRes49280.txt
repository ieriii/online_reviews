Great spot for dinner on a night I didn't want to walk far from my hotel. TONS of wine options. Bonus: you don't have to spend an arm and a leg to drink one that's tasty! Describe the flavor of wine you like and the waiter will make great suggestions at varying pricepoints. I had the bin 35 (a petit syrah)--it was amazing. I even bought a bottle to take home with me! We had the Hummus to start. They sprinkle something spicy on the pita bread (maybe cayenne??)--nice zip with the cool and smooth hummus. I had the grilled pork porterhouse with roasted peaches and fried green tomatoes--it was AWESOME. As a girl that has spent a bit of time in Iowa, I know what good pork tastes like. The baked peaches and flavorful sauce were a wonderful compliment to the juicy hunk 'o meat on my plate. My dining partner had the halibut and oohed and ahead alike. Presentations were awesome and food was plentiful. No shabby portions at this joint! Great service, no pushiness to eat and run. Thanks Bin 36! Can't wait to come back to try the cheese/wine/charcuterie options with friends!
