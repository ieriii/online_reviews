I absolutely love Revolution. Friendly and genuine service from the bartenders and the servers. That means a lot to me. Ridiculously good food. We get the pretzel with cheddar ale soup every time. My boyfriend loves the burgers, and I recently had the Harvest Pizza, I was in heaven. I can't wait to try their brunch menu and take the free tour of the brewery. I'm not much of a beer drinker unfortunately, but all the sips I took of my bf's choices were really good. They have a gorgeous open kitchen so you can kind of watch depending on where you are sitting. I prefer going on an off night to avoid the crowds and get a spot at the bar.
