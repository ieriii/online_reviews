I would have given GE 5 stars but the desserts were lacking and well our waiter was a tool.  I never got around to reviewing this place as I went last July shortly after it opened. We had 8pm reservations and were sat immediately, although it was a weekday. Excellent service apart from our tooly waiter who explained that the crispy buffalo chicken was 'similar to buffalo wings we would find at our local pub' - are you serious with that speech its like shut up fool, we know what buffalo wings are and taste like. Apart from that he knew his stuff. We got 3 appetizers as it was our first time there: the cheez-it risotto - which is totally NOT over-hyped gnocci - I enjoyed this more than the risotto beet salad with whipped chevre - i have to say that this was a nice refreshing well balanced salad, and lets be honest, whipped chevre is divine. main course - my friend had the pork chop cooked in root beer - this was not a winner, as the rootbeer flavor was too strong or maybe he didnt like root beer as much as he thought...either way he ended up stealing food off of my plate. mahe mahe ( i dont remember the fish) with mango and black rice - ok im not sure exactly the name of what i ordered but i know that all of it was gone and i wanted to lick my plate in public and i didnt care who saw. whatever was in that rice was liek crack, like clarified butter. mmmm, good. also, there was foam. foam is always fun. Seriously, this was a well executed dish with flavors that complemented each other perfectly and the sole reason i will return to GE's. I'm not going to bother talking about dessert as it was blah, not memorable. some semi-freddo. I will say it was different and worth trying, it just wasnt great.
