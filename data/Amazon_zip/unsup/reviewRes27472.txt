This is a perfectly adequate Mexican restaurant, but its popularity is inexplicable to me. It can be completely packed at peak hours, though there are many nearby alternatives are at least as good as Nuevo Leon and some that are considerably better. It's not a bad place to experience once, but I won't be back.
