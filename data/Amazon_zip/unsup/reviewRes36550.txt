Great spot for breakfast. My partner and I stopped in here this morning. The food was very good and the wait staff very friendly. The have the best hasbrowns in town. Real thick cut diced potatoes. Those what you call hasbrowns. They serve a great omelette... Seating was a little tight for me but the overall enviroment is very good... We enjoyed and will be going back for breakfast again real soon....
