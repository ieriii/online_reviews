Sometimes you find a great place that captures a wonderful cozy vibe, great decor, supports local artists (and sells their work), has wonderful open mic nights, books fun musicians, has a friendly and helpful staff, with great food, uses local produce, great drinks, and better coffee. And you're really happy when you do, and feel very fortunate. Then they open a second location and managed to pull it off again. We came here tonight to have dinner and see some musician friends perform and from start to finish had a great night. The "new" Uncommon Ground is just wonderful. And they're in the process of being certified as having the first organic roof vegetable garden in the country. In lots of cases, those are the veggies you see on your plate. (awesome!) I highly recommend the artichoke goat cheese pesto dip. If I was a different person I'd have licked the dish clean. Wow. The chicken sandwich, pumpkin ravioli, and winter salad were all worth noting as well. I'd skip the mac & cheese. It wasn't bad by any stretch, but the clear loser at the table. The staff is all friendly and helpful, the decor is wonderful, and honestly, I'm in love with their bathroom. The mosaic in there is some of the most gorgeous and inspirational stuff I've ever seen. The performance space is great, and learning from their mistakes at the Clark location, they set the sound booth outside of the main area so it doesn't interfere with the room flow. I love you Uncommon Ground. Can't wait to come back.
