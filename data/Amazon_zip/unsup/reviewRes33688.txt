This place is awesome. falaffel is great, and the lowest priced around. Lamb schwerma is amazing (especially the dinner plate. Don't forget to check out the great salad and lunch bar, or their amazing baklava (only 1$ a piece!). They also got a coffee shop now ect. This place has been around forever. The service is quick (even when it's busy) there always seems to be at least one open table, and they freaking recycle +1 for that.
