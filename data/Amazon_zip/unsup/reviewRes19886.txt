I would definitely go back to Coast for sushiii! I went to Coast for the first time with my girlfriend who was anxious to take me there after she had gone a couple of times in the past and had great experiences. This was my first true sushi experience and it couldn't have gone better as far as the freshness and flavor! The Po Boy maki was huge and delicious. I could really taste all the individual flavors from the cream cheese to the eel sauce. Among others, we also tried the Spicy Sweet Potato tempura, which was definitely the "guilty pleasure" pick of the night. Who would order a sweet potato sushi? Well, we did and it was great! Prices were reasonable. Plus, it's BYOB. However, our waiter told us it was a 1 bottle limit on parties less than 3. Not sure if this was a special Valentine's day rule since there tons of reservations that day or what. But they wouldn't uncork our second bottle:( One other minor complaint was that the tables were super close together. Once again, maybe it was only this way because of all of the Valentine's day reservations. Either way, I felt a lack of privacy. However, this could be meant to make the sushi experience more social... so I can see how this could be a positive too. It seemed like almost everyone dining there that night was a twenty-something like ourselves. It's definitely a hot spot in town and with food like theirs, it deserves to be.
