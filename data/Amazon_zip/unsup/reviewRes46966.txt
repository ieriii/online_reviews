Upon walking in we were greeted at the door. As the hostess proceeded to ask us if we had a reservation, we began to feel the shame. I mean how dare we try to walk in on a Wednesday night of all nights without calling in first! I should have known due to the smashing reviews on Yelp. It was a slightly awkward moment of silence after we told the hostess that we indeed did not have reservations. Awkward moment aside, once we were seated I felt at ease again. I promise to know better next time! For starters I tried the cream of asparagus which was delightful. For my entree I had the Sunrise salad and I must say that it was pretty impressive! Being the carni that I am, I'm all about having some kind of meat in my entree but surprisingly the salad did not fall short at all. Let me also add that I'm usually not a huge fan of sun-dried tomatoes and in lieu of my excitement over the menu, I overlooked this item in the salad. But it was in fact, the star of the salad! There was also a special on their sangria which was a bit on the sweeter side but I got over that quickly. The food was a bit more pricey but the quality is worth every dollar. I also love that they are very eco-minded.Uncommon Ground- I dig it!
