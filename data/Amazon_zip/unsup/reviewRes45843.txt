Love this place. I would give it five stars, but they recently took my favorite thing off the menu.. so I am slightly disappointed. Where are my philly cheese steak wontons?! Urrrgh Okay, the grilled shrimp is the best. Their seasoning is awesome. Cole slaw is very unique and I love it. Their ranch dressing will put you in orgasmic state because they make it from scratch in-house, but its a garlic ranch.. so bring breath mints. :) Drink of choice? Every single one on the menu. I know.. thats terrible and I feel like a fat-a$$ saying that.. but the Strawberry Martini is made with real fresh grinded strawberries, and the Belini is amazing.... its all good. Which desert? Definitely the Creme Brulee or the New Orleans Bagnets. However.... if you are feeling really daring.. get the Chocolate Molten Cake.. because it just has the best effect on your mood 5 minutes after eating it :) The New Orleans Bagnets are just a little too much food for 2 ppl (unless you are pretty hungry after your meal, which is rare for most people) because its an entire basket of fried dough. haha, good comfort food though.
