You get what you paid for. One roll of toilet paper and if you need more call and request it, phone not working, room service cleans your room around 4-7 pm so you have to wait for them to clean your room and get clean towels, elevators extremely slow, the beds mattresses are really flat and uncomfortable as well as the pillows ( you only get two pillows per bed), free Internet, close to downtown and conveniently closed to train, fair prices for being close to downtown, okay lobby, staff were also just okay, could have better customer service, AC worked, and you can not open the windows, no bathroom vents so it gets stuffy.
