This was a 5 star pace for me until I realized how many of their seafood options are unsustainable - from bad fisheries and farms. Their veggie options are great, but if you care about the oceans, you might want to give second thought to buying their fish. Monterey Bay Aquarium has a sustainable sushi cheat sheet on their website of you want to see what's an eco-friendly option and what's harmful. How disappointing...
