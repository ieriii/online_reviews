My meal at XOCO was one of the highlights of my visit to Chicago. I tried the tortas, agua fresca, hot chocolate, and churro and everything was delicious. Even though we went during lunch hour madness, the employees were efficient and the line was quick. Rick Bayless did not disappoint! My only regret is not coming back home with a bottle of the hot sauce. Super tasty!
