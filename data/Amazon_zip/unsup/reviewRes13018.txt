My two very awesome friends and I checked out Cafe 28 yesterday and had a great experience. My friend with the Groupon was running a tad late, but we were seated quickly. The place was hoppin' for a Wednesday night, with a mix of friends, cute and cold couples and moms with quiet babies. Our waitress, Veronica, was super nice and came back regularly to answer any questions. I had a 7pm mug of coffee with soy and the Vegetarian comal. Very tasty, especially the bean dip. More please!. My friend had the Pistachio chicken and enjoyed it plenty. Our friend who came about an hour later enjoyed a meal assortment of appetizers, which I didn't try, but they looked awesome. We all had dessert. We shared a few bites each of chocolate cake and gelatto. I brought leftovers for my husband and had a wonderful time with my friends. Worth checking out if you're in the area. Don't be shy...parking isn't all that bad.
