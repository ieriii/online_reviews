Came here a little after 5:00 on a Thursday with a friend and his co-worker and it was already packed to the snout. We got seated shortly thereafter at a communal trough and were ready to pig out. We shared the prosciutto bread balls, the Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, the Purple Pig Platter (a charcuterie plate), Charred Ramps and Scallions with Romesco Sauce, and Jamon Serrano with a Duck Egg and Asparagus. I liked everything I tried and there were many more dishes I wanted to try but I did not have any more room in my pork belly. Four oinks up!
