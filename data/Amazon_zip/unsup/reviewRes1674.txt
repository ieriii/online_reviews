I was told by my friend that we were going here, and I really had little choice as I was staying with him. I was not prepared for the line. Or at least a line that moved so slowly, when it was cold. I truly blame my friend as he didn't tell me this otherwise I would have brought my jacket.  1 hour and 40 minutes after getting on the line, the hot dogs arrive with the duck fat fries. I had a steamed regular dog with everything, which made for quite a busy hot dog. I also had the Celebrity, which was a steak dog with cheese and fried onions. That was phenomenal. The duck fat fries were good. I didn't really get that they were the best fries I'd ever had, but they were tasty.  So I enjoyed this place. The line was really long, which means if I lived here I'd probably come here not as often as I'd like. But Doug was so nice. Far more nice than I would be if I had to see hundreds of people.  Good stuff. Glad I went. Wish I brought my jacket.
