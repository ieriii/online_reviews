Great for late nights. Don't make the mistake of taking a date there. Good portions of decent but not great quality mexican food for relatively low prices. I recommend the fish tacos, chorizo tacos and their enchiladas are very good. The fish tacos will make you feel like you are eating semi healthy since it is a healthy portion of tilapia topped with guacamole all for 2 bucks!
