In a city full of some of the best and most plentiful food options in the world, I can safely say that Simply It is my FAVORITE Chicago eatery. The food is always fantastic and fresh and affordable. Also, of all the Vietnamese places in Chicago, to my tastes, it comes the closest to all the wonderful food I enjoyed during my time in Ho Chi Minh City. Very authentic and very good.Not to mention the service is always prompt and incredibly cheery. The owner is particularly sweet, always happy to greet you with a smile. Whenever anyone visits from out of town, I always make a point to bring them to Simply It. Because it's simply the best!
