I posted this a year or two ago but will repeat my simple Hot Dougs strategy for beating the often long line. It helps that I work kitty-corner from Dougs, so this is easy for me, but here it is: first, go online to http://hotdougs.com and figure out what you want to order - then, just call ahead (773-279-9550) and place your order for pickup - it will be ready when you arrive (give them 5-10 minutes), you can walk right in past the line and either get it to go or grab a table on the spot if one's open (don't forget about the Al Fresco outdoor dining area - named after the used-car lot on Ashland where Doug bought his Dodge Dart)(I made that up). CAVEAT: they won't take phone orders on Saturdays, and they won't take advance orders for eat-in customers.  Good luck!
