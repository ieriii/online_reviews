Save it for the tourists. There is always a really long wait for what reason I'm not sure. I will not be returning. Although the food is decent, it's nothing to write home about, and the service is just awful. We have eaten there several times and not once have we had anything above a horrible quality service experience. They also are not extremely friendly here which is not something that I look for in a weekend neighborhood breakfast spot. Go to Bongo Room around the corner... they actually care about serving their customers, and the food is inventive and delicious.
