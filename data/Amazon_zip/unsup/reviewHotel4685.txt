This is about the hotel lobby bar. Damn, I want their fireplace in my house. It was so toasty and warm. I will be back when it's really cold out and will order overpriced wine or drinks just to sit next to it. The lighting could have been a bit dimmer at 10:30 on a Saturday night but I guess it has to be bright since it's part of the lobby. The bartender was cool. We actually didn't stay and order drinks because it was too pricey for what we wantede. But that fireplace...I can't wait to enjoy it again on a super cold day.
