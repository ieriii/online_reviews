Zed is a place of meetings for a group to which I belong. This place may seem like expensive, but they do have a few special that makes Zed451 affordable for any vaulet. Try Zeds burger its outstanding and will not put you back by your weekly paycheck. The assortiment of beers is very good too. Have I mentioned that it's a classy place worth to take a date to?
