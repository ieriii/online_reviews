I like coming to Mayan Palace with the sort of friends I don't feel like sharing Cesar's with. I am not sure why, but it's how I divide my groups of friends. But this doesn't mean I don't like Mayan Palace, I actually like it a lot. My favorite dish are the enchiladas, any kind of them are awesome and I love the salsa and sour cream they put on top. The homemade guac appetizer is also really good and worth getting while you wait. Of course everyone likes to come here on Tuesdays and Thursdays for the half off margarita pitchers and they are friendly enough to make sure everyone at the table gets an even amount the first round from the pitcher. Because of this great deal it can make dining in there cramped at times with large parties. I actually prefer to get my order to go and eat it at home on those nights and dine in the others.
