This place is truly as good as it gets. Don't come here looking for a boisterous time, this is casual class. Cozy and inviting, flawless service and a great menu. Not only is Third Coast my 1st choice for client meetings (and they have ALL become repeat customers regardless of where they live) but it is my favorite qo-to place to relax. Good food, great wine selection, ever changing art displays...you have got to experience this hidden gem.
