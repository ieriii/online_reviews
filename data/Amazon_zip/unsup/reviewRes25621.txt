I'd like to carmelize my shoes the way Pequod's carmelizes their crust. There's a few places that make pizza like this. Burt's and Gullivers to name a couple. I've heard some history from some friends that Burt originated both Pequod's and Gulliver's, then he sold the establishments and the recipes to have his own little nook outside of town. I dont care how it all wenkt down, I'm just happy places like this exist. There's nothing worse than a crappy pizza joint. Pizza Hut, Dominos, PaPa John's, Hungry Howie's, etc. etc. etc. The wait can be long for your pizza. Just order a salad and have a few beers to quell your impatience.
