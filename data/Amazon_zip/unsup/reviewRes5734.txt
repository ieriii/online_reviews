I lived in Miami for 5 years, and really didn't think cuban food like this existed in Chicago. Some friends took me out for a celebration dinner, and they couldn't have picked a better place. I loved it. I had the Puerco Rostizado and it was awesome. It's a pork dish that's roasted over night, with bacon and I have no idea what else. If there's one thing Cuban food is known for, it's pork.  Awesome. I loved the black beans and rice plus sweet plantains too. Great for the price too.  I picked the dish because it was featured on "Diners Dives and Drive-Ins Chicago", but everything on the menu looks awesome. I'm looking forward to taking my wife there soon.
