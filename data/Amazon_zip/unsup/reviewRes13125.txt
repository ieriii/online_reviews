Very expensive for what we got and everything was drowning in mayo. I got the crab cakes which were 23 bucks and came with a lemon mayo dipping sauce, a side of creamed corn* (*not really creamed corn, as the corn was dripping in mayo and not cream) and mayo-based coleslaw. The service was decent but not phenomenal. At the time, the waiter asked me what I thought of the corn drenched in mayo I mentioned that the food was very heavy on the mayo and our waiter seemed to shrug it off. My friend's scallops looked good but were drenched in sauce and bacon drippings. This ain't the place to come if you're looking for healthful seafood folks. Avoid this place if you are someone who likes crunchy veggies and want to taste the actual fish or crab.
