We went to this place on a Saturday night for a dinner. We made reservations to sit on the patio. We got there at the time of our reservations, but they told us that we have to wait for 15 minutes for a table. Table that was given to us was on in the area that leads onto the patio and we were exactly where people were passing. So, we had to complain and they moved us after few minutes to the patin (what we actually reserved in the first place). And just FYI, if you are coming to this place when the weather is nice, make sure to eat on the patio because it is gorgeous! Our waiter was an Italian gentleman who had great suggestions for meals and answered our questions about menu in great details. The portion are quite big, so my husband and I split the dinner after eating appetizer. We ordered SPAGHETTI NERI "FRUTTI DI MARE" and this was the best past ever! I will seriously come back to this place just to have this past again! Also I would suggest that you save some place for desert because they are quite delicious!
