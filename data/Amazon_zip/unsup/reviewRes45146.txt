We live close by and love to eat out so we thought this could be a new go to place. Let me tell you I have NEVER had such a horrible experience. Our waiter hated us. I am a vegetarian we asked the waiter what I could have and he pointed to one dish and one appetizer. So as a vegetarian I don't really have a choice. Our food was ready in less than five minutes, which made me think it was precooked. My dish was salty to the point it was inedible. My boyfriend's food was bland. I understand that people love this place and each his own, but I will never eat here again. There is another Italian food place down the street named Calo which has better food at better prices.
