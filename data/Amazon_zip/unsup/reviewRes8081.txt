Simply put, I don't like ppl that don't like brazilian steakhouses.  Just like ppl that don't understand or like seinfeld......don't like 'em. I can't believe I didn't yelp fogo before. I was going to update my review, but instead I'm writing one! We went on sat. night, 6 pm. We were told 45 mins to an hour. We actually didn't get seated till about 7:30. It was a bit menacing, but like the other yelpers have already stated, it is well worth it and a reservation is highly suggested. I started w/ a salad......i know.....what a waste of space, but I love my ruffage, so I opted for some hearts of romaine, w/ croutons, some fresh mozzarella, and an amazing ranch dressing! I should have paced myself with my carnivorous gorging, but.......all's well that ends well.  The bottom sirloin is always the cut of choice!!!! I also loved the ribs! yup, I ate w/ my hands........and even requested for the ribs to come back around. The rest of the meats were awesome and filling, as you can imagine. I felt bad for the chicken and sausage guy so I agreed to a piece of chicken.........yup, I really don't like ANYTHING wrapped in bacon. I finished off w/ the apple salad from the salad bar. Boooo for no Rutherford Hill Merlot and a shrugging of shoulders for my daring request of Caymus by the glass. Everything was damn scrumptious!!!!!! Can't wait to go back. :P p.s. Brazazz SUCKS!!!!!!
