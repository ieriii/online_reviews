This hotel came up on Hotwire for $108 a night. We wanted to stay in this area so we took it. The Tremont is an older hotel updated to boutique style. I'm rather amazed by some of the other snarky reviews -- if you want rooms like the Drake or the Four Seasons, book yourselves there and pay the price!  In fact, our room (910) was fine. It's a bit small, but large enough to hold a rather monumental king size bed with a giant headboard. Perfectly comfortable. There's decent free WiFi and plenty of outlets. The bathroom has a slightly odd layout but is a bit larger than at the Inn of Chicago, where we stayed the first two nights we were in town. You also can't beat the location -- half a block west of Michigan Ave. at the Water Tower. So there's no end of shopping and dining facilities. You're a couple of blocks walk to Oak Street Beach and the El station.  It's true that there's only one elevator, so be prepared for it to be slow, especially when it's check-out time. But this is a small quibble. Haven't tried the continental breakfast at Ditka's yet. But we did notice a caf in the plaza at the John Hancock building across Michigan Ave. that offers breakfast, coffees, etc. that probably should be decent. There's also a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel. Also the hotel has only 20 TV channels and doesn't carry MSNBC, to which I'm kind of addicted.  In short, no real complaints. The Tremont more than meets our needs at a great price!
