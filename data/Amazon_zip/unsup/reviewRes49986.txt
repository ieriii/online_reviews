A friend of mine had a Groupon and took me to the Lincoln Avenue location. A sign was posted at the hostess desk that read Groupon holders were required to have a reservation. Given that the restaurant was virtually empty, we asked if we could have a table anyway. She restated what was on the sign. We asked if we could make a reservation for ten minutes away. She checked with the owner who said we could not. We asked for the phone number to call to make a reservation. She refused to give it to us. We left to go outside to view the Groupon on my friend's device. We called the phone number listed on the Groupon repeatedly and got only busy signals. In Las Tablas' defense, the Groupon did read a reservation was necessary. In my opinion, however, that does not excuse the denial of making a reservation and the discourteous behaviour on the part of Las Tablas on Lincoln Avenue. We went to a different Colombian restaurant called Pueblito Viejo and felt especially grateful for the warm reception, service and fantastic authentic meal. Although we didn't mention it, my friend is Colombian AND works at Groupon. Fortunately, he will get a refund for the purchase of the certificate. Though I have been to both Las Tablas locations in the past, I do not plan to return.
