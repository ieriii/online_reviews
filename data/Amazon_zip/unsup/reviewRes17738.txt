Had dinner here with a friend last night. Great food. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala (which is something I try the first time at an Indian restaurant) and the Tandoori mixed grill. Both were 9/10. The Naan could have been a bit fluffier, but was still fine. The atmosphere is nice and the service was very fast. Would definitely go again.
