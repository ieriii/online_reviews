These days I feel like Thai food is like your typical Chinese take-out; greasy, fattening, and largely uninspiring food that you regret eating once you're done. Don't get me wrong, I like Thai food, but I think that most places miss the mark. After eating at Opart Thai, I can gladly say that there are still some places that serve up good Thai food without making me regret it. I've visited both locations, and I'm a big fan of the curries. I REALLY enjoyed the Basil Chicken, and various noodle dishes (particularly the Kuay Tiew Kee Mao) are delicious. Easy to get into, quick and friendly service, and above all else, really good food. Opart is my new go to Thai place in the city!
