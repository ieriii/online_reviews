This restaurant is a like museum for the taste buds. It's more about exploring culinary sensations than filling your stomach (though by the end of my meal, I was perfectly full.. not stuffed, not still hungry, just wonderfully satisfied) So don't expect to absolutely love everything, but definitely expect everything to be an amazing experience. The service here defines fine dining. There was always a server nearby.. not hovering, but ready to approach if needed. They were courteous, cognizant of their customers needs, and just all around fabulous. The level of service rounded out an incredible culinary experience making this one of my most memorable dining events.
