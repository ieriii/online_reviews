Came here for a late lunch ( "late" because of the wait) ... here are my thoughts: 1. Relatively easy parking on street 2. 1 hr wait 3. CASH ONLY 4. Regular hot dogs are cheap $2 - $4 (def worth it) 5. Specialty hot dogs are almost $10 (only worth it if you pick the right ones) 6. Duck fat fries - good but did not live up to the hype. HUGE ORDER and only available on Fridays and Saturdays. 7. Free refills - the bf and I got a small coke and shared it in order to use all the cash we had on hotdogs.. haha We ordered a total of 6 hotdogs and duck fat fries for the 2 of us. We are very hungry people and we thought we better try as much as we can, since we waited in line for that long.  Here is the line up (in order of deliciousness) : 1. The Frankie "Five Angels" - italian sausage - AMAZING. SO SOFT AND FLAVORFUL. This would be the reason I come back. 2. The Keira Knightley - spicy goodness - this sausage used to be named Britney Spears. haha, guess she's not hot anymore. 3. The Marty Allen - pork and garlic hot dog - nothing special 4. The Elvis - a Polish - the BF liked it but it was only ok for me. 5. The Dave Kingman - Santa Fe style by recommendation - it was only ok 6. Our special hotdog was one with cottage cheese on top? - it was my least favorite and wished i spent the money on two more regular hot dogs instead. But I have to give Hot Doug's props for having so many unique hot dogs. Overall, we left happy and full. Great friendly service. Everyone in line around us were all first timers, just like us. I wonder if they get a lot of returning customers.. I mean, it's worth the wait if it's your first time, but I wouldn't come back unless I'm with out-of-town friends visiting Chicago.
