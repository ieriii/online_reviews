Went to Hopleaf on a Thursday. The crowd was pretty average, which was nice. I started with the duck reuben- a clear mistake. Luckily, I switched to the CBJ. Many have raved about this sandwich, and I agree. The taste is best described as eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with cheese between two fig newtons. Trust me, it works. The beer selection is enough to make even a novice beer consumer drool (as I did). I chose a peach lambic; typically hard to find outside of Belgium. If you wanted to visit Belgium but cannot afford it, here is how to get Belgium out of Chicago: Go to Hopleaf and grab a few Belgian beers and the Belgian appetizers (mussels, frites, etc). For dessert, go to Baladoche- the only place in the US to find the zucher street waffles straight from the streets of Belgium.
