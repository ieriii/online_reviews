I was here with four girlfriends for one of their birthdays and had a lovely experience. I called ahead to ask whether it would be okay to bring in a cake; the hostess said it was against their policy but that she thought it should be fine. I was worried that I might run into some trouble when I actually arrived, but as soon as I walked in the hostess noticed the cake, asked if I wanted them to bring it out with the candles to sing and then take it back to slice it, and took it right off my hands with a smile. Very much appreciated that! I don't have too much experience with steakhouses, so I thought it was fun that they brought out the different types of steaks beforehand to present and explain. I had the Del Monaco medium rare, and thought it was perfectly cooked. We shared the asaparagus with hollandaise (nothing too special), lyonnaise potato gratin (delicious), and the sauteed spinach and mushroom (my favorite!) as our sides. We were seated against a wall so had plenty of space, and the ambience was wonderful. Mostly low conversations in soft lighting, very nice. The service was impeccable (water glasses never empty, napkin re-folded when I returned from the restroom, our server offering to take a group photo for us). A great dining experience! Happy Birthday, KHUSBU!
