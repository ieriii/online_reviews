It's a decent place, but overrated and the quality is extremely inconsistent. Is everyone rating it on a single visit or something? I've eaten in the restaurant a number of times and get takeout quite a bit due to its proximity to my home. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's really. not. good. Don't get me wrong, I'll still eat there or get takeout on occasion, but is it really worth the attention and glowing reviews it gets? Meh. If going out with friends I prefer less crowded, less expensive maki fare. ...Or maybe I'm just drinking a different kind of Kool-Aid than everyone else?... P.S. I almost forgot to specify why I keep coming back. I can order takeout (or delivery) direct from them online and then walk there to pick up my order. Never had a problem with that service.
