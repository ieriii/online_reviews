I really enjoyed my stay at the Best Westerm Hawthorne Terrace. The room was great, very clean and full of lots of amenities. Everyone that workers there is so nice, friendly and helpful. No matter what time of the day or night, I was always greeted with a welcome smile. Even when I booked my room, I felt that the clerk went above and beyond normal to get me a great room at a fair price.  So, if you are ever looking for a great place to stay in Chicago, call the Best Western Hawthorne Terrace first. You won't regret it.
