Nice hotel, but it is near the track so it is loud and it is loud all night long. I like the vibe in the lounge and the whiskey blue bar. It has a very nightclub like feel. The drinks are ok the service is awful. I think it was because I didn't have suit on or wasnt dressed properly. They had good music. The rooms are nice, bathrooms are much bigger than I would like. I would like to have had more room in for the room itself and less for the bathroom. I love their bath products by Bliss, they are usually excellent and I enjoyed them. They change the carpets in the elevator so you know what time of day it is. The elevators I think were trying to be very 3d-ish but I think it just got me dizzy and was quite annoying. The workout room was small but they had voss for water. I have been to the W's in New York and would say its about the same but probably quieter depending on which W you are at.  Trendy, dark boutique hotel. Decent for the young hipsters and the like
