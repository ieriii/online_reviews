So nice, I had to come twice. You will notice a few 5-star reviews for my trip to Chicago..that's because they know what the hell they are doing over there. Great, great food city that rivals NYC. Purple Pig lives up to its name as it offers many different delicious parts of the swine as well as other unhealthy cuts of meat, offal, and spreads. First time we dined at the bar, decond time at a communal table (what's with Chicago and communal tables?) Had a great bottle of Nero d'avola both times for a great price..we fell in love with this wine and I will be looking high and low for it in every wine shop I enter. I run doen of the food we consumed ravenously- -pig ears with crispy kale, cherry peppers, and poached egg -bone marrow -foie gras -pork blade steak -steak -fried deviled eggs -sweetbreads with fennel and apricot -chicken thigh kabobs- -sicilian iris -desert panini with hazelnut and banana and marshmallow there were one or two other things..drawing a blank..but it was all great stuff.
