I just recently went to Carnivale to celebrate a friends birthday, i loved the decor other reviewers may have thought it was tacky but i thought that it matched the theme and style of the restaurant when you first walk past the curtains your amazed at how large the room is and how wonderfully colored it was. It fit the theme of nuevo latino very well. I had the Raspberry mohito and that was spectacular, for my first course i had a heirloom tomato salad with ricotta stuffed avacado it was terrific. Then my main course was the Lamb chops with lamb chorizo i loved the flavors of the entree but was disappointed with the size. i left this place having finished 2 courses yearning for more food in my belly and im not that big of a eater... but yeah other then that it was a terrific experience
