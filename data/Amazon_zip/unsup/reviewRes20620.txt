Took a cab here with a colleague one afternoon to check out Rick Bayless's new resturant. Meh... it was OK. It was a good thing we went early because it got packed around noon. There is limited seating here. I totally forgot what I ordered..some ham with avocado? I'm more into authentic Mexican food (aka Frontera Grill... sort of) and the real deal. The food was kind of off.. on a tangent perhaps? Like I said... just meh.. I was pretty overwelmed the the menu. The service and cashiers were really friendly.. service was prompt.
