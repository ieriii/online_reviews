Update based on my most recent visit. One major change: The little table display says they now offer delivery! Yippee! I figured I should also round out my review with a second thought... I realize I'm considered some kind of traitor to my fellow Chicagoans for rejecting the stuffed and/ or deep dish pizza varieties. For those of us who worship the thin, dare I say, New York (gasp!) tradition of pizza tastiness, Piece is where we get our fix. So many options for toppings and style (red, white, or plain). Oh yeah, they're also a brewery so you're set for an excellent pint as well. Fresh guac and chips for an app and a delish salad and you've got one square meal to savor. It's a popular place with no reservations for groups of 4 or less so keep that in mind when you're next jonesing for the best 'za in Chicago! Worth the wait.
