If you love good food and authenticity, this place is for you. I love the decoration,but the lighting could be brighter. You'll see alot of family gatherings here so it pretty loud. I especially love the mole-cheese-beef enchiladas. The mole is the best I've ever tasted. The Horchatas here is the bomb! Rated on Check, Please! , it's more of a reason to check the place out!
