The place looks pretty cool and the carhop service is heaped with nostalgia - but the key thing is that the dogs are the biggest & best in Chicago. I grew up on Vienna dogs on the south side but they just don't compare. The curly fries are great too. I want to try a grilled polish or dog some day, but I go infrequently enough where I weaken and just always order that Superdawg.
