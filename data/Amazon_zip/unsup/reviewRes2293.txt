In-freaking-credible. All the sausages but the elvis were gluten free. so I helped my self to two dogs sans the bun. the duck fat fries were insane. SO GOOD! Doug, the owner, was very friendly and still had a warm disposition and demeanor at the end of a long day. we stood in line for a little over an hour, but it was worth it. My hubby got the foie grais and said it was orgasmic. By brother got a dog with chili, but we are from Detroit...and we think of chili two ways:chili dog chili and "chili" and the chili a really good "chili" not "hot dog chili" ( it had beans) so it was, in his opinion "delicious, but inappropriate"
