Came to Chicago on a trip with 2 of my friends and stayed here for 2 nights. We paid for a deluxe double room with A MAGNIFICENT MILE VIEW, paying extra for the view. I wish we could attach pictures to reviews, so I could post a picture of our "view" because all we could see was the unattractive building next to us, and the ugly roof and heating ducts of a shorter building below us. Our TV was broken, which wasn't the worst thing in the world because most of our trip was spent sightseeing, but it was kind of a bummer when we got back at night and wanted to put it on. The maid ASKED us if we wanted our room cleaned (YES!). The WiFi was free, but was so painfully slow I half expected to hear the hissing of a dial up connection. However, the location is fantastic, very close to the Navy Pier, walking distance to Millenium Park, nice area of the city, good restaurants nearby. The price was very reasonable (despite paying for a view we didn't have). The front desk staff was extremely nice and helpful, especially a woman named Nikita I believe. Overall, not an atrocious experience, but definitely nothing special.
