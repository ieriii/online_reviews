1 hour and 12 minute wait Sir! Just as I figured, this is obviously a tourist-magnet. The Pizza was great but wayyyy to stuffed. This might be a good thing but in all honesty Pizza should taste like Pizza and not Lasagna. Ordered a Pepperoni, Ham and Sausage Pizza. Overall a great tasting pizza just make sure you come w/an appetite - you're in for a whole lot of pie - Ejnoy
