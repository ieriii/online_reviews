There's something just plain disconcerting about waliking into a place where roasting ducks are taken off the rotissery, beheaded, poked in the gullet and having the juices pour out into a large vat. There's something equally disconcerting about roasted whole pigs hanging in the window. If you're going for take-out, this is the scene that's going to greet you. Well, this and being surrounded by a large number of Asian people who seem completely nonplussed by the whole experience. But, take in the aromas, and I'll bet, like I did, you ask what kind of intoxicating soup they're making. It's the duck soup. And it's extraordinary. What this place does well, it does very very well. What it doesn't, it doesn't. Don't expect this place to excel in the classic Chinese fare that Americans seem to love. They don't even *have* potstickers. The Mongolian beef is subpar. But that's not what you're here for. You're here for the barbequed meats, and, you're in for a treat.  If you want Americanized Chinese food, there are a thousand other restaurants that will satisfy your taste buds. If you want Chinese barbequed meats, this is the place.
