Once upon a time, I became completely obsessed with the show "Dexter". I then became obsessed with all the delicious Cuban food Dexter & Co eat on the show. Then I couldn't stop thinking about Cuban sandwiches. What's a girl to do? Thank God I only live minutes away from 90 Miles. I scarfed down the "Media Noche" sandwich, which is a Cuban sandwich (roast pork, ham, mustard, pickles, Swiss cheese) on sweet bread. Holy. Moly. That sandwich was a cornucopia of taste and textures. Crispy bread. Melty cheese. Crunchy pickles. Sigh.  I was slightly disheartened when mid-sandwich I saw a decorative sticker on the wall, of course it had a picture of a pig and a diagram of possibly a tapeworm (EEK) If you get scared off, I highly recommend you try the guava empanadas and fried plantains.
