Hopleaf is currently my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Once i came here and ate duck crepes, rabbit legs, and lamb stew. I literally ate a petting zoo. If the idea of making a meal out of what some people might keep as household pets makes you a bit squeemish, I hear they have some pretty good vegetarian options, but seriously, who needs that shit?
