I've benefited from Yelp reviews for a long time, now it's my turn to pay it forward. First of all, Wakamono is hit or miss. I've had decent dinners there before, tonight was not one of them. I ordered the shrimp tempura roll (on special, and now I know why). It tasted bad, and when we tried to send it back the waitress said she wouldn't take it off our bill--that they "smelled it and the cooks tasted it" and it was fine. Hmm... really? That skeeves me out even more than funky shrimp.  The waitress' attitude didn't help. Sorry Wakamono, you lost one neighbor's business.
