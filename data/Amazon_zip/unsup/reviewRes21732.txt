The "Superdawg" name is misleading because the hot dog is just a regular sized hot dog and it is not that super. Presentation is pretty cool because it comes in it's own individual box but my hot dog bun started to get soggy because of the condensation. No one likes soggy buns =( The hot dog itself--I mean, the Superdawg--is pretty good and juicy but it's nothing special. Pinks in LA is still the number one hot dog spot for me, and it would take a lot for any hot dog establishment to push Pinks down to #2.
