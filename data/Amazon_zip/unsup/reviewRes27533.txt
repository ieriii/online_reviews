I tried Pequod's for the second time last night. It's good. Yes, it's good. but. It's not great. The crust is fantastic. but. Those last few bites are immensely enjoyable. The caramelized/burnt cheese crust is everything an aspiring pizzeria should strive for however the rest of the crust had a pretzel-y flavor to it. Not the flavor intensive crust edge that this place is supposedly know for. The ingredients are good. But. They are not of the highest quality. Minimal spinach. Half ripe tomatoes. The sauce has an almost processed tasted to it. There was not any real essence of Italian seasonings, olive oil or the like. The sausage chunks are great however. Large, liberal sausage. That's how it should be. The cheese is quite delcious too. Lots of cheese. If you are eating deep dish you need lots of cheese and they did not disappoint. My largest concern is the price they charge for this average pie. For a large pan, 3 ingreidient + delivery it cost around $31 dollars. For $31 I could have orderded a LouMals (The BEST deep dish in Chicago...This is fact...do not argue this for I will find you do bad things). Delivery was the standard hour wait from most respectable pie joints in the city. All this being said...I will say... this is my 2nd favorite deep dish in the city. Better than Art of Pizza...and better than the conglomerate Giordano's machine. Much better than Uno's (duh). In line with Gino's. Did I miss any heavy hitters?  I am thinking back on this review and decided on another star. so there.
