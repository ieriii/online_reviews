I went to this place on a Tuesday night at 8pm. We waited 1 hour and there were empty tables everywhere. It was super annoying and inefficient. The 'small plates' as they call them are super small and are really expensive. I guess you pay for the artsyness and intricate tastes. I got something with liver and white chocolate and watermelon. It was horrid and it cost $20. The entrees are bigger and more reasonably priced. The service was bad our hostess was mean and did not even give an accurate timing of when we would be seated.This place is not worth it. Go somewhere your money will be well spent!On top of it all it's filled with hipsters...
