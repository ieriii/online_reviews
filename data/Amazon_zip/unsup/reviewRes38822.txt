I hate to say it, but I've never had anything here that I liked. I've been here 3-4 times with my girlfriend (she loves the oysters Rockefeller) but whatever I order is mediocre at best. The latest disappointment was the spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs. The meatballs were decent but the sauce, to me, tasted like it came out of a jar. It was very plain and pretty much tasted like pure tomato sauce. The service is great, as is the atmosphere. This makes it so much harder for me to rate it 2 stars. I keep reading good things about the pizza here. Next time I'm back (I know I won't be able to keep my girlfriend from those oysters Rockefeller for long), I'll give that a shot and hopefully boost this rating.
