If you know good, authentic mexican food then you can stop reading right here. This review isn't for you. If you love chipotle, then I'll start by saying garcia's is pretty good. The burritos are tasty and pretty cheap for how much you get(think chipotle and a half). FREE chips and salsa are always welcome. And they're good too. Today, however, I ventured out of the realm of the innocent burrito and tried their torta dinner. Probably wouldn't order it again. The rice was just awful. Unless their goal was dry, flavorless rice. They did that perfectly. But those are just the sides, the torta itself was decent. The beef milanesa wasn't particularly flavorful, nor were the rest of the vegetables inside. Service was fine. Haven't ever had any of these horror story experiences. TL:DR - stick with the burrito unless you know what you're doing.
