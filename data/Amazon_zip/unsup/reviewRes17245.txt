Eh, I thought it was just ok. Maybe I got something boring. I don't know. The place, as far as the atmosphere is pretty nice, I have to admit. It's really different and really fun. As far as the food though, I felt like it was overpriced and not really up to par! I'm not sure I'd want to go back anytime soon, I think our bill ended up being around $60 a person, and that only included 2 drinks or so... Just wasn't that impressed. There are a lot of better places in my opinion.
