drinks are excellent. food delish, esp love the truffle pasta. been here a few times and the only thing im not into is the "im too cool to be a nice bartender" attitude. they also forgot my drinks last time. stood there waiting for 20 mins and never got an apology. that said, id keep coming back. yum!
