Loved it for the wine list alone! The wine selection was extensive and exotic. It was nice to see such a comprehensive list of non-Californian, or even American wine for that matter. Also loved the option to get half bottles of any wine $40 or less- what a fantastic idea. The dishes were tasty too. We ordered the fried deviled egg, which was a bit disappointing in flavor, but mesmerizing in technique. I'm still not sure how they deviled the yolk but managed to keep the whole egg intact and fry it. We also ordered the bone marrow, which was very rich but kind of bland at the same time - the rock salt and herbs that accompanied it helped, but I'm beginning to think that I'm just not a fan of bone marrow. The pig ears and pork shoulder were the highlight of the night. We ended the meal with some podda cheese. Note: cheese portions are VERY small. Bottom line: stick with the pork dishes and French Rhones and you won't be disappointed!
