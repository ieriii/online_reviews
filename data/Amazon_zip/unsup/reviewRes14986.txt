I am soooo bummed that this place wasnt good. I had the Ceasars pizza, which tasted more like a frozen pizza, and the Beignets as dessert, which were NOT beignets....they were dinner rolls with some sugar sprinkled on top. My husband had the fish n' chips...his stomache was causing him problems later, he thought because of how gross they were. I was so stoked to have a new Logan Square spot, with such a promising menu. But, will not be returning.
