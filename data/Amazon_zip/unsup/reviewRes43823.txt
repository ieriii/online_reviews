the food was good, but i don't dig the whole "self service" vibe...esp since they don't tell you that you are expected to pick up your own OJ and then you forget you don't have it until halfway through. at least TELL me it's there & i don't mind, ok? maybe i would have been told if the girl who took my order were not such a RAGING BITCH. cheer up, buttercup it's not that bad...or actually maybe you are pissed because you have such a bad haircut. etiher way-i don't need your crap on sunday morning--just my OJ, thanks. i also ordered something to go and had the pleasure of her taking my order for the 2nd time. and it was no better than the 1st.  the pancakes were good and the huevos rancheros looked amazing. i totally wished i had gotten those. but my friend's scrambled eggs definitely had a weird texture to them...like breakfast buffet eggs where they are baked in a huge pan and sit there for awhile. they tasted real, but felt fake in your mouth. weird.  all in all-glad i checked it out because of the hype, but i won't be back.
