I went to Kumas, but there was a 2.5 hr wait and all I wanted was a Mastodon burger, so we went over to Lockdown, which was playing Mastodon on all the TVs for hours. Needless to say, I was stoked. Then I had the Thanksgiving-esc burger with cranberry and stuffing on it. Best burger I've ever had. Too much awesome in one place. I wish there were something like that in L.A..
