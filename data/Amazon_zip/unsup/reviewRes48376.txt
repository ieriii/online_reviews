Do you have one of those friends who is like, the most amazing cook ever, and whenever they host a party you almost feel bad about yourself because the food was SO good, and their house was SO amazing, and all their friends were SO cool and you know you can never compete? This place is like that. A whole bunch of interesting people from all over the place--tons of industry foodies (a good sign), locals and a couple of tourists, all sitting around communal tables, sharing good, hearty fare (and just when you thought you might want one more little thing--a pretzel? some pickles?--you get them and they're better than any you've tried before), and sometimes making friends with your neighbor. To me, this place is quintessentially Chicago. It's social, revolves around meat and beer, and is totally unpretentious. They're always packed in here for a reason--the menu, although a bit on the pricey side, is inventive without being intimidating, the service is personable and informed, and the atmosphere is lively. The beer list is out of this world, and the wines by the glass rock too. I think this place definitely lives up to the hype.
