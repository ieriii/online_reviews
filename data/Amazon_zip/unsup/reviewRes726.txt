I went to Alinea almost two years ago and I wasn't a yelper back then so I'm writing this a little late. The space is very high tech and simple. As you walk through the entrance hallway you aren't sure where to go... then a door on your left magically slides open (very inspector gadget!). We did the tour menu with wine pairings. It was the single most delicious, impressive, amusing... (I could go on and on) meal of my life. Every dish was outrageously creative and tasty. Just when I thought things couldn't get any better they placed a lavender infused pillow in front of each of us. They gave us a minute to take in the lavender scent. Then they brought our plates and put them on top of the pillow, as they did this the lavender air slowly seeped out and the pillows deflated. The dish was some sort of rhubarb, goats milk and onion concoction. OUTSTANDING! Bravo to chef Achatz, he has serious talent and creativity. I'm so excited he is opening another (more reasonably priced) place, Aviary. I live in New York now, but can't wait to check out Aviary next time I visit Chicago. Hoping Chef Achatz will open a place in New York eventually =)
