Yummmmmy! Cute atmosphere - Check Good food - Check Good prices - Check Menu not over crowded - Check Great out door seating - Check Pizza that's a little more chard for my taste - Check Great place! Only complaint is the pizza may have been a little to chard but not bad enough to send back. Will SO come back to this place. While there are other pizza places that I like better, this place knows how to pair ingredients nicely!
