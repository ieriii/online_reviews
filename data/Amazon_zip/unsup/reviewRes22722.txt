Tried this place for the first time today and was really happy with the whole experience. Before we even ordered, my friend spilled his water everywhere and the staff rushed over and were really nice and cleaned it up right away. The three of us ordered the vegetarian chicken appetizer, which was very interesting...I didn't really like it, but it was something different. Definitely not like you'd find at Chicago Diner or in the Morningstar freezer. For the entree, the three of us ordered three different dishes and shared them all, which was a great way to do it. We all agreed that the eggplant in "garlic" (I use quotes because it did not taste garlic-y at all) sauce was the best. The sauce was kinda spicy-sweet and the eggplant itself was fresh and tasty and well cooked...and I'm not a huge eggplant fan. The homestyle bean curd and sauteed potatoes were good as well.  Usually I end with a complaint but honestly I don't think I have one about this place. Check it out!
