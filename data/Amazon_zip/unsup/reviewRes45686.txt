I liked this place, it was so cozy I could have fell asleep right in front of the fireplace and no one would be the wiser. The food was just ok. My guy and I went here and we both felt pretty sick when we left, but thats probably because we both gorge ourselves to the point of sickness. My neighborhood needed a place like this. kudos.
