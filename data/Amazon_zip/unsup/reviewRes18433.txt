I have been to Caro Mio twice now, but I can not believe the two experiences took place at the same restaurant. Our first time to Caro Mio, my fiance and I both had pasta dishes. We had calamari as an appetizer and shared the lobster ravioli and the gnocchi for the main dishes. For dessert we made on the fly lemon dish which featured limoncello and sweet lemon meringue crumbles. I am not a huge fan of calamari, but the dinner was a celebration dinner in her honor. The dish was cooked perfectly, tender, breaded perfectly and seasoned well. Both pasta dishes we delicious. The sauces were great, a little rich but great. The dessert, especially for an improvised dish, was nice and refreshing. Last night we had a completely different experience. We ordered the green bean salad for an appetizer, and it was by far the best part of the meal. The beans were served with tomatoes, a hint of garlic, olive oil and balsamic vinegar and fresh mozzarella. Our main dishes were the linguini all' arrabbiata with a side of meat balls and beef tips in a white wine and marinara sauce. The linguini was pretty good, but the meatballs were a disappointment. They lacked flavor and were slightly over cooked. The presentation of the beef tips was the first turn off to this part of the meal. The dish looked a bit like slop. There was way too much sauce on the plate. The beef was a bit stringy, but not horrible. The sauce was lackluster. Overall, the dish would have benefited from the addition of onions and peppers. I am on the quest for the perfect Tiramisu, so we order it for dessert. The presentation was nice, but the lady fingers were soaked too long. This caused the dish to be soupy and grainy. This was definitely on the lower end of the scale for Tiramisu. We love the atmosphere and the BYOB aspect. We will definitely give the place another shot, but I think we will stick to the pasta dishes.
