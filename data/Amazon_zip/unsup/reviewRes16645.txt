I'm the type of person that would rather have Indian food at a dingy place on Devon street than a fancy candlelit place downtown. That being said, this place was actually really nice. Its nice and dark and relaxing on the inside, the service was really great, and the food was definitely up to par in quality. It's definitely pricey for Indian food, but made up for it ambiance. We were trying to stay away from the typical things this night, so we tried a Lamb Coconut Curry (from South India) called Lamb Madras. It was really amazing. It was like an Indian Curry with hints of Thai from the coconut. They we realized that South India is really damn close to Thailand. They we patted each other on the back for being such amazing detectives. We also tried some "Bombay Street Fair" which was basically wafers covered in all the delicious Indian sauces you're used to: Raita, Mint Chutney, Tamarind. Also, major bonus points for fresh naan and masala sauce when we first sat down. Yum! We also ordered the Samundari Kadhai (mixed seafood), which I wish I could tell you what the cooking process was, but I don't remember. There's a whole part of the menu that talks about Kadhai Khana, which is how this dish was cooked. I dunno, it sounded interesting. My dining companion loved it but I thought it was funky and ate more lamb instead. I'm sure its just me being weird. Anyway, it's definitely worth 4 stars, even though I probably will be sticking to my Devon street adventures.
