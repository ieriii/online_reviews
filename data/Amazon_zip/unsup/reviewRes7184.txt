The ambiance is whats to be expected for the neighborhood with a feel of east coast, cottage interior. My "q" burger tasted like it was stuck in the fire rather than nicely grilled. I was chewing off burnt embers; dry as a desert. My dad is an expert on the weber, so I'm educated. Medium rare is medium rare...and a bbq place should know that. The smoked melted gouda on my dry, not-medium rare burger still had the rind on it which made it difficult to bite through. I just peeled it off in one full circle...kinda gross. Also, the waiter told me not to get the "classic burger" because it's equivalent to a mcdonald's burger. wtf? this place is nice dining experience and he is using a mcdonald's reference. i kinda wish i got it instead of the "q" burger. My sister had this maize salad that tasted like feet. It's a type of corn feed, with black beans, tomato's that were wrinkled and other veggies that you could not taste because of the overwhelming taste of feet. For all the shit that was in this "salad" you would think it would be tasty...not the case. also, i asked for a cappuccino which they did not have. wtf!? and instead i got cold coffee. gross. fuck this place. it's over rated except for the wooden siding on the wall and the lamp shades.
