Some friends took me there for dinner and I was very pleasantly surprised. I am gluten intolerant, and at first looking at the menu I wasn't sure there would be anything I could eat, between breadcrumbs, deep fried things and cornbread. But then I asked our waiter about gluten-free options, and it turned out they have lots! The cornbread they brought before the meal was gluten-free and delicious, then for my entree I got deep-fried catfish (battered in rice flour) with greens and cheese grits - YUM! They even had a gluten-free dessert -- a chocolate tart with a somewhat odd but still tasty accompaniment of cream cheese frosting, raspberry granola (made from puffed rice), pumpkin butter and a truffle. The service was great, and the food was delicious (and a lot was local, organic, and/or sustainably raised). It was so exciting to be able to eat 3 courses of foods I usually wouldn't dare touch in a restaurant. Thank you for a scrumptious meal!
