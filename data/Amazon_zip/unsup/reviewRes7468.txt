Came for dinner last night and had such a great experience. The restaurant is adorable as it's situated in a row house and is nicely decorated in a modern farmhouse fashion. The service was wonderful and they even accommodated a special request that I had submitted when I originally made reservations (no reminder required). They were running an $18 prix fixe special for tax day, which was a steal. I got the cheddar bacon hush puppies for an appetizer. They were fine, but the real star was the St. Louis-style ribs. I got butter-honey cornbread and found it to be a bit dry and crumbly. For dessert, cinnamon ice cream and homemade cookies with milk - yum! I'll definitely be coming back here - good ambiance, service, and food.
