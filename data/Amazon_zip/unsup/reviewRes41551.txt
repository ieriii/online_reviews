Great food, if you're verrrrrry careful what you order. They have a liberal interpretation of the word "beef" - you can't assume it's the usual parts of the cow you eat. Stick to the pho - I prefer the chicken pho because it's good, soothes the soul, and chicken looks like chicken - you can't be fooled. I went off the grid once, and ended up with very beefy stock with parts of cow I'd never seen before.  And you need to request cilantro, they won't give it to you otherwise.
