Came last night for the first "Iron Chef Monday", which was featuring Mexican chocolate. We got the Iron Chef tasting menu for two, but also ordered additional items since those portions were smaller. Tooootally didn't have to do that, since I was struggling half way through the meal... or maybe that was because I had huge burger for lunch.  The Mexican chocolate tasting menu included 3 courses and a dessert (each course having 2 menu items and 1 Mexican chocolate dish). I now realize some of our chocolate dishes were substituted with regular menu items. The kobe beef tartare never came out and we never got the waffle with chocolate sauce. Instead we got a chocolate "funnel cake", which was more like chocolate covered rice krispies with a papaya sorbet. I was just so full I couldn't think straight. But it all makes sense now, since the table next to us was told they had run out of the Iron Chef menu portions. Out of the the special dishes I tried, both were okay. The smoked duck over the chocolate linguine was perfectly cook. The chocolate mole pork loin could've been a bit more moist, but the chocolate tamale was delicious. Out of the other dishes from the tasting menu, the only one that I really enjoyed was the serrano ham & fig salad. The salad was wrapped by serrano ham, into a salad meat log. Filled with figs and large crispy chunks of pork belly. Also the bacon-wrapped dates were delicious. Crispy bacon, stuffed with almonds, with hot blue cheese poured over. Other then that, the rest of the dishes were just okay. Service started out great, with our server informatively describing some of his wine recommendations. But as the night went on, the service got much slower, and it took a very long time to get our check. I'm glad I tried the Iron Chef Mexican chocolate menu, but nothing I would come back for. Maybe just some of those bacon-wrapped dates at the bar...
