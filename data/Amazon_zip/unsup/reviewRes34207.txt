This place is perfect when you are craving Middle Eastern food.I've been going here for awhile and I love getting a falafel sandwich. Anything else from here is just as good. My boyfriend loves getting the chicken shwarma and he claims he doesn't like Middle Eastern food. Sometime I'll just come here and buy a container of hummus and baba ganoush. I also highly recommend the kabobs. The decor is very cute and all for a very low price.
