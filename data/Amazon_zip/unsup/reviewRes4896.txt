I'm a bit tardy with my review of our lunch at the Purple Pig. So, I'll keep it short and sweet with what I remember from our lunch here. -They were packed. -Communal style dining table for us, ugh! -Someone at my table drank my water. Not my glass, but still MY water. -Big Ayinger Weis Biers for me and my lady. -Marinated Olives -Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette -Salad of Asparagus & Hazelnuts with Arugula & Treviso -Trifecta of outstanding cheese: Blu di Bufala, Capriole O'Banon and Parmigiano Reggiano -Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde -Saltimboca -We loved everything we had. The beets, salad and cheeses were all very tasty. The waitress suggested octopus was some of the best I've had. The Saltimboca was the traditional preparation that I've seen at Lupa. If you dig that dish, you'll want to get it here. It was the best thing I had at the pig. I really don't care for those huge tables, unless we're there with a bunch of friends that take up most of it. That said, I still really liked this place and I'm sure we'll be back for more Ziggy Piggy.
