A friend and I had an incredible dinner at Carnivale. The ambiance was grand and festive. Walking into Carnivale is not stepping into a restaurant, it's stepping into an experience. The decor of the main dining hall is colorful and dramatic with vaulted ceilings and creative lighting. The setting was only outdone by the amazing dishes we ordered. We started out with a sashimi-style ceviche - delicious! As an entree I ordered the skirt steak complimented by a chimichuri sauce. I've told friends it was THE best skirt steak I've had. The latin flavors were divine. My friend ordered the seared tuna which was also incredible.Carnivale was the best part of my weekend trip to Chicago!
