Yep, this place has great deep dish, and for a price that is well within reason. It's in a bit of a sketch neighborhood, but the pizza is extrodinary. Light, flaky crust with some high quality cheese and pepperoni make this place a real gem. Even better is that its BYOB, and there is a liquor store across the street. It isn't a nice looking place, but when you're talking about pizza, why does it need to be?
