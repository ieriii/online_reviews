The subtle perfection of every dish I've had here makes this one of the best in Chicago for me. Words can't do the food justice, and the ambience is so vietnamese- french authentic, you'd think you were waiting in line for that ride at disney land. But back to the food- Pho is complex and delicate, curries are not your run of the mill, fish is cooked to perfection, with a hint of the most appropriate sauces, all the desserts are excellent exclamation points to the wonderful meals.
