Everyone said that this place was fantastic. I must have had the wrong breakfast then. I ordered the vegetarian skillet. It came out fast, but was bland--truly lacked any sort of flavor. It was basically a bunch of peppers and onions sauteed in olive oil I think. Which is great, but you have to add some sort of flavor to it. I might go back and give it another shot though.
