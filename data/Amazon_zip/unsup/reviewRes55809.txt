Sabatino's is unbelievable...menu..wine list...staff. We have had a great experience every time that we have visited. This place is a hidden gem on the North West Side, it has incredible Italian food, if you live nearby and have not tried it, you are missing out. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, it seems like it is small from the outside until you you are seated and it keeps going and going The latest owner has owned it for 30? years, and I bet it is as good today as it was back then. The Spinach Gnocchi, among many other dishes, is great. The Gundlach-Bundschu Chardonnay is the perfect start!
