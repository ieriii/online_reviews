I recently had two friends in from the Sonoma/Napa area of California. They came to visit the city and specifically eat at Alinea. They asked that I attend with them as a treat for my birthday. Quite the treat indeed. First of all the couple had met the chef in the past and also new someone else connected to the restaurant.... which led us to having a special 27 course meal ....along with wine pairings. Needless to say, this was one of the most amazing dining experiences of my lifetime. 27 courses and 5 1/2 hours later our dinner was complete with a look of amazement on all of our faces. The food, the inventiveness, the service.... all outstanding. I agree with another yelper.... multiple foodgasms happened that night. I cannot recommend Alinea enough. My favorite courses: Monkfish done 3 ways. Wagyu beef (and I thought Kobe was amazing) with yuzu, seaweed smoke and sea grapes. Cheese in a cracker. Rhubarb done 6 ways. Hot potato, cold potato wit black truffle and butter. Foie Gras with spicy cinnamon, apple pate de fruit..... the list can go on and on. Plus an amazing combination of Italian, French and German wines that made me giddy. To top off the evening..... going into the kitchen to see the amazing staff of chefs and meeting head chef Grant. WOW on every level. Thanks again to my friends, I cannot thank you enough
