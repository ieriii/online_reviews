This place is for everyone, tourists (although I hope you stay away), romantic dates, drink connoisseurs, or just anyone looking for a taste of something different. Its Allison Wonderland meets Sexy hipster in a vest with perfected cocktails. And a splash of 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Enjoy. I just took Violate hour down to 4 stars because the last two times I went and brought out of town guests it was really disappointing. I think It has gotten so popular that you wait forever and the host wasn't so nice to the people in line. Then when we were sat after waiting forever they were short staffed, and it took 45minutes to get a drink (maybe more then that). I was embarrassed after raving about this place.
