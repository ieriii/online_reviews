i recently realized that i haven't been going out to brunch very much lately. i think this is because i haven't been that happy with the places i have been trying. well, this changes everything. this was a fantastic experience other than the wait (but that was our own fault...our party of 2 got there at 11am...brunch rush hour!). at least they give you one of those light-up-buzzer pager thingies to tell you when your table is ready. so anyway, not their fault i was ready to eat my arm by the time the pager lit up. when we were seated, the experience was awesome. the inside of the place is very nice without feeling too fancy (i hate too fancy). the muffins came with homemade raspberry preserves, orange marmalade, and sweet butter (all of which are available for purchase to take home). we tried both sweet and savory crepes...both were excellent...especially the orange infused mascarpone-filled crepes. the service was excellent without being *too* attentive, and we did not feel rushed at all. the portion sizes were generous. oh, and the fruit smoothies were excellent, as well.  i will be back soon.
