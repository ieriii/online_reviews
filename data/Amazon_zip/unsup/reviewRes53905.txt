Just had a fantastic late lunch here. It was just me so I ordered the salami, goat cheese and olive tapenade panini, a side of prosciutto, and for dessert, the nutella, banana and marshmallow dessert panini.The savory panini was amazing and I can't recommend it enough. Note that it consists of 2 sandwiches - so this was slightly more food than I was expecting, although they weren't huge so it wasn't a problem. The prosciutto was okay - I like mine with more flavor but it was still very good. The dessert was excellent and definitely worth trying, but it is literally the same as the other paninis, but with powdered sugar on top. So for me, there was too much bread and not enough of something else on the inside - I think it needed more nutella and probably needed to slice the bananas a little thinner so you could consistently get the flavor of the 3 components.Only major downside was the music - I sat inside and the music (I sort of hesitate to call it that) involved a lot of very loud yelling without anything musical going with it and was on very very loud. It seemed very unnecessary as I was there in the mid-late afternoon and there were few patrons inside.
