The Bongo Room is a hopping brunch and lunch spot in the heart of Wicker Park. The line is always crazy, but there is plenty of window shopping and coffee shops near-by to keep you preoccupied for the 30-50 minute wait for weekend brunch. Their food is absolutely worth the wait. It is INCREDIBLE. Like mouth-watering, dream about it type of brunch. I've only been there a couple times, but every time, I tried something new and loved it. I've had a breakfast burrito, an omelet that had artichoke hearts, feta cheese, spinach, and more awesome things I can't remember. They also have a selection of brunch cocktails to choose from, my favorite being their mango mimosa. I highly suggest Bongo Room if you have an open Saturday or Sunday and are not too hung over to wait for it.
