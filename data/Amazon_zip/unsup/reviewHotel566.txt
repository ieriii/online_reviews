Customer service here was exceptional! From the moment we got out the cab, everyone was on their toes ensuring that our stay was comfy and stress free. The white plain but modern rooms were trendy and unique. Although it was close to nothing but white, the furniture around the room made the difference. The bed was so soft and comfy that I didn't want to get up - also because it was 12 degrees outside haha. This hotel looks like it aims for the 25+ young professional crowd, it reminds me of the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. This is like a mini version in the Windy City and without the casino and bright lights. Love it!
