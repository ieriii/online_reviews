What happened here???? I was here for the first time the day after Christmas and LOVED LOVED LOVED every morsel that I put into my mouth. FIVE STARS! I did not write a review because there were already 250 reviews raving about this place so why bother. I could not wait to go back. I was there about a week ago with a friend who had not been before and was so excited to introduce him to the restaurant. Last time my friend and I ordered one soup-carnitas and two sandwiches. The portions were so huge that we could not finish everything we ordered. We were able to take home leftovers so I felt the bill was justified. This trip...soup was in a bowl half the size-half of the masa potato dumplings were gone and they added cucumber. CUCUMBER IN A HOT SOUP?!? What?? It was like baby's breath in a floral bouquet...CHEAP FILLER. The sandwich was so thin you could barely see what was inside the sandwich.  Half the food for the same price??? Not fair.
