Q is one of the best places I have been for BBQ. Not sure what to get...do the BBQ flight and you can see what you like best! The baby back ribs were also amazing, along with the coleslaw which I think might be the best I've ever had! They even give you a tour of the kitchen which is just the coolest thing ever.
