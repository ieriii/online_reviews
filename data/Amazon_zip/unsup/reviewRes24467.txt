If you are looking for something totally unique, delicious and romantic this is it my friends. My boyfriend and I were tucked away into a booth amongst bottles of wine and antique inspired decor. The menu is very straight forward although they do help you through what you are looking for and what is recommended.  We enjoyed each course immensely and won't hurry back which is the downside that it is such a unique and special experience that it would be hard to come on a weekly basis. We enjoyed our time and it is worth it to go for a special occassion.
