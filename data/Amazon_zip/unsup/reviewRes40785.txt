This is the *southernmost* La Pasadita restaurant on Ashland Ave. This is the specific location which La Pasadita's owner most coveted when he began the restaurant. When it finally went on the real estate market, he couldn't decide which of the other two he should close. So he closed neither. I had the steak burrito this time (carry out). The burrito was savory. I used the green sauce in it, which was not as fiery as I expected. [Check me here - the red sauce {salsa rojo} is typically the milder, and the green sauce {salsa verd} is the hotter?]. I requested tomatoes be omitted. They were. The burrito's size was average. There is a bigger burrito you can order should you want more. This La Pasadita gets a solid four-star rating, edging up to 4 1/2 stars. To get up to five stars, it would probably have to make the bigger burrito the one you should order (such that the smaller 'regular' burrito was not as good a value for the money).
