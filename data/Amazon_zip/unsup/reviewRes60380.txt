Of all the Asian restaurants in Boystown (and that's no small number), this one has by far the best sushi. Then again, that's pretty much all they have so if you don't like raw fish you're SOL. And they get ubercrowded after 7:30 on weekends, so it's hard to just drop by if you feel like sushi on a Saturday night. But their sushi quality is top notch, and not any more overpriced than you'd expect.
