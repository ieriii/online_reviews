All things considered, this Hotel is OK. A few annoyances: they nickle and dime you ($1 a minute) for Phonecalls in the same area code. 2. The Fridges have some bizzare borg-inspired technology that "senses" if you take something out of the fridge (ie. to put your own drinks in) and charges you accordingly. 3. The Elevators - Slowest Elevators in the WORLD. We waiting 30 mins to get one on a Sunday AM on the 20th Floor. Yes, Really. Aside from that - It's pretty OK. Room sizes are adequate, very VERY Touristy being so close to Michigan Ave.
