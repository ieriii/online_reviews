I enjoyed everything about my evening spent at Mastro's. The waiter was very attentive and suggested we split sides to ensure everyone got what they wanted without having too much food. I had the bone in filet which was absolutely marvelous, you must try the lobster mash potatos and the warm butter cake. I cannot wait for another reason to visit this steakhouse.
