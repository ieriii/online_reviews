For a restaurant that doesn't nearly begin to specialize in Vegetarian Cuisine. I was highly impressed. Let me first start off by saying that the restaurant was immaculately clean! The floor, table tops, glasses, silverware, bar, and table legs, and also the bathrooms were elegantly glimmering. I like that. It means people work hard at appearances. I have dined here twice and look forward to many more occasions. On both occasions I ordered the Slow-Roasted Cauliflower on a bed of Beluga Lentils & the dish that has Pea Tendrils and White Truffle Oil. Delicious! The food was prepared beautifully, the ingredients were fresh, and the flavors blended perfectly well with no ups or downs-- the dish was incredible. I finished with the Creme Brulee served with Plum-compote and Cats' Tongue cookies. Mouth-watering! The service was outstanding!  The waiters/waitresses and busser's, including the managerial staff were attentive, intelligent, and witty. And I also like that despite the fact that my roommate works there, I WAS given the royal treatment. I hope to have many more wonderful occasions there.
