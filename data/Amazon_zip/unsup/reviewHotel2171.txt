I have stayed at many hotels in Chicago over the years and this has been a favorite. Being the only hotel with a front entrance right onto the Magnificent Mile it is great to wake up in the morning and grab a cup of coffee from the Starbucks downstairs and walk right out onto The Mile. Location aside the lobby and rooms were modern and well appointed. I had a great view of Michigan Avenue from my room. Being busy I had not the chance to take advantage of the pool but I'm sure I will on my next visit which will actually be in two days. I can't stress enough how much location really matters in Chicago and this is in the perfect place. The staff was friendly and helpful, the valet service was on point but a little pricey...but on the same note it is downtown Chicago. I am staying again so that should tell you all you need to know.
