Do not EVER have an event here. All time worst service handling an event that I have ever seen. I had to create a YELP account just to tell the world how awful they are. I'm still in shock at how poorly they handled my party. Go to Roof, Citizen, or one of the other rooftops in the city - Zed's service was absolutely horrible.
