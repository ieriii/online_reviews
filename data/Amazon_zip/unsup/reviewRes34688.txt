LOVE THIS PLACE! LOVE THE SERVICE AND THE AMBIANCE!  I am a regular here and I love the sushi here! The fish is so fresh, it melts in your mouth. I love the spicy tuna roll and the yellow jacket maki roll. It is also BYOB which makes it so awesome too! The manager Mikey is super nice and accomodating. I love their portions and their artwork on the walls. I feel like family here and I will always come back here for my sushi fix!
