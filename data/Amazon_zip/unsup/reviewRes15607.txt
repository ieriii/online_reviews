I love Calo.  It's partly sentimental for me 'cause this is where my partner took me on our first date too many years ago for anyone to care, but it has remained a favorite.  The ribs and penne a la romano (with angel hair instead of penne) are two of my default dinner entrees here, but my absolute favorite is the rack of lamb they do on Saturdays. Oh my Allah, it is bone-suckin' good!  They also have a good creamy garlic salad dressing, and coupled with the focaccia in the bread basket, it's a perfect starter to your meal.  Finish with a tiramisu and a snifter of Frangelico, then sit back and listen to the live music and watch some of the old-timers mix it up on the dance floor with the newcomers. OK, so the "bands" are cheesy, but that's part of the charm.   The service here has always been top-notch. (are Sandy and Luis still there?) They aren't overbearing with the "you're my-best-friends" crap, but they just seem to know when to appear at the table.  When they did the remodel job (which is fantastic, IMO) I thought they were going to go way upscale. The place looks like it's going to be expensive, but it's really reasonable considering how cute that neighborhood has become. They actually tried, but the experiment failed. It's too long a story to go into here, but if anyone remembers "Finestra", they'll know what I'm talking about.  I haven't been to Calo in at least three months, and just writing this is making me crave a visit.  I see a rack of lamb in my future! Oh, and they have a small parking lot across the street; a big plus.
