It's review update time, and Publican is still great. I visited at the weekend with a friendly carnivore, and we devoured the charcuterie plate and the spicy pork rinds as appetizers. The charcuterie was great as usual. The pork rinds were pretty good -- I'd be interested to see the Publican's take on "pork scratchings", the British version of pork rinds, which are less puffy and more solid. I bet they'd do an great job. I digress... As an entree, I picked the Belgian Blue steak tartare. It was excellent, but when my friend's dish came out, I lost all interest in it... the pork belly: wow. Only problem was, he didn't order the pork belly. The server came back, and we pointed out his mistake. He apologized, told us to keep the extraneous pork and he'd have the correct dish on its way shortly. He did, and the bollito misto (cotechino sausage, smoked turkey, and pork shoulder) was excellent -- every piece of meat tender, juicy and delicious. Still, neither of our deliberate entrees was a patch on the accidental one. If you go here, you must order the pork belly. Order something else too, if you must, but don't skip the belly. The beer list is also outstanding, and they all seem well kept and perfectly poured. The only thing I don't love about the Publican is the space: it's cavernous -- a huge, very brightly lit room, with high ceilings, which is not at all cozy. The servers were almost sprinting around the place. They have closed-in booths around the side, which might have a more intimate atmosphere, but the main part of the room is like a mess hall.
