I loved Sprout. This was where my love took me for my surprise birthday dinner and I was so excited to try it as I've heard lots of good things about it. We sat in the front dining room, which had good ambiance - high ceilings, red brick floors, dark wood tables. Started with some drinks and then selected our dishes for the $65 prix fix option.  I chose the Licorice (salad with butternut squash puree, goat cheese, macadamias and pear - the server ground some licorice root on the salad at the table - terrific flavor), then we had a little tiny soup sample of butternut squash/apple (had some heat! smooth, creamy, oh so good), my main dish was a snapper fish fillet with shrimp and veggies (crisp fish skin, miso broth, delicious), then had a grilled cheese sample with a pairing of a hard apple cider (o.m.g. I would have been happy ordering that entire sandwich and a jug of cider! tangy cheese, crisp bread, apple?, and a grain mustard to dip it in). Finally, for desert, I ordered the chocolate/peanut/banana/coconut concoction - could this really go bad given this list of ingredients? I don't think so, it was indeed, very tasty. He chose the duck, monk fish, and bacon/apple dessert. We enjoyed everything we tasted - all with unique flavor combinations and beautiful presentation. The one thing we both agreed on is that the entree portions could have been a little bigger serving size.  This was a pricey bill when drinks were factored into it, but it was a really fun, pleasant night out trying all these delicious dishes. Great for a special occasion.
