The first time I went I thought the Kalbi was one of the tastiest that I've had in the city, and I suspect that I've sampled almost all of them. But just went back with a large group of 18 this past week, and while the Kalbi was well textured and not too fatty, there wasn't enough seasoning. Great seafood pancakes. The Daeji Kalbi is nothing to write home about. Love the solid choice of side dishes- pretty substantial compared to other restaurants.The waitress was on the inattentive side, and never came around to our private seating area in the back. The price is really reasonable.
