Schwa is a treat for the adventurous palate. The experience was certainly more palatable for me since someone else paid for my meal. While you might not love every dish, you will appreicate chef Michael Carlson's audacity. FYI, he was one of Food & Wine's top chefs of 2006. You can choose between a $55 or $105 menu, which buys you a 3-course or 9-course meal, respectively. Don't worry about going hungry if you order the smaller menu; they bring you extra items in between the listed courses to keep you satisfied. The night started with a chocolate-covered truffle with a unique bacon powder and a beet juice concoction as a chaser. Next up was the sunchoke soup, a heavily (IMO too) creamy soup with the consistency of bisque and interesting citrus accents including candied kumquat and blood orange. The quail egg with ricotta, brown butter, and parmigiano reggiano was divine; the initial saltiness is quenched with the most delicious cheesy, creamy mixture you've ever tasted. The main course choices that night included delicous sturgeon (I stole a piece from my friend) or the equally delightful pork with black truffle, parsnip, prosciutto, some sort of mushroom, and other tasty garnishes. The candied apple with hint of sea salt and I think some sort of peanut powder was very yummy. My dessert of pretzels with a a paste of caramel and dates and unique turmeric ice cream was pretty good. I was jealous of my fellow dining companions who had the chocolate brownie with pumpkin ice cream. There is no wine list. However, there is a negligible $5 corking fee for BYOB. I recommend bringing along a red, a white, and a Riesling to complement your various dishes. The resturant is small and the decor is minimalist. It is easy to walk right by the restaurant as there is little to clue you into the location from the outside. Reservations are imperative; good luck getting one.
