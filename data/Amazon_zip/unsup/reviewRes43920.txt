Milk and Honey is the ideal breakfast fare. I love how you go up and order your food, so by the time you get your table, your meal is beautifully prepared and its so fresh. I love food and to me, it's about the quality and freshness of the ingredients. Not only do they make their own granola-its perfectly toasted, but to have it with fresh fruit and yogurt. I've tried a few of their brunch items and just can't get enough, I can say everything is delicious. Everyone who works there is really friendly and they serve you so quickly but give you enough space to let you enjoy the moment. Everything is delicious but you have to get the granola, or get a bag to take home. It's absolutely wonderful!
