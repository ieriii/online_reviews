By now, you know all about this place. Yeah, I stood in line for 100 minutes, but it was as fantastic as you have read. Our choices: Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Beer-Washed Truckle Cheese Uber Garlic Pork Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise, Vintage Cheddar Cheese and Roasted Garlic Cloves Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris Besides the fresh encased meats, the toppings are of such a great quality. That's real cheddar on there -- not some factory-made, day-glo-orange Kraft krap. All 4 dogs, 2 drinks and fries for $40. Best bang for the buck anywhere. Duck fat fries? I've said it before, but I don't get it. Tip: if you can, order ahead and get it take-out. Had I known, I would've, and they post the specials on their web site. Which is nice, too, because I can check it out from a 1000 miles away and vicariously enjoy the variety.
