opart is my favorite for thai delivery. you can expect a 45 minute wait or longer for the food, but it's worth every minute. i've only dined in three times. the dining room is nice enough, and it's BYOB, a nice plus. some stand out dishes are the eggplant in oyster sauce (ask for it extra spicy - pow!!), sliced roasted duck with broccoli, kee mao noodles and pad thai. and for once, spicy means spicy - yeah!!
