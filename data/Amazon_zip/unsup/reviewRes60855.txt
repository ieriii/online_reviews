The lounge is very upscale, trendy and sexy. If only it didn't take 20 minutes to get a drink each time. I really don't care how freaking fantastic a place is, if it takes the server 20 min. to bring me a drink each time, I'll pass and go somewhere else. I had their blood orange mojito..the first one was very good, then they switched bartenders and the second mojito, well, I don't think there was any rum in it whatsoever. If they get better waitresses in the lounge area or if there's an open seat at the bar and actually put booze in their drinks I'd go back. Also, I hear their rooftop's pretty cool, in the summer. Maybe I'll just bring a flask with me and order pops while sipping out of my flask during the 20-min. it'll take for the waitress to bring me my drink.
