This little restaurant was pleasing from start to finish. The ambiance was cozy and welcoming. Our waiter had a good sense of humor and was very attentive. From the beginning, our kinda average bread was served with a DELICIOUS flavored butter, with tastings of honey, cayenne pepper and 15 other "secret" herb ingredients. We started with 3 appetizers. The green tamales threw us for a loop as they were served "polenta style". Once we bit into them, with the dallop of sour cream on top, it was delightful and tasty. Really excellent was the Papas Rellenas. I would go back and have a double serving of that. Jalapeno mashed potatoes with chicken stuffing and a saffron sauce. Oh yeah, it was lightly breaded and fried, and it was perfect. The Tamal Cubano was the least of my favorites, a bit dry with not near enough reduction sauce. We split the Almond crusted Halibut. It was wonderful. Perfectly cooked and the halibut was buttery and flavorful. Of course we tried two desserts. We had the homemade Chocolate Pudding which for all you choc-o-holics is a must! Oh, did I mention it comes out warm?! YUMMY! I just wish I had it all to myself. We also had the Tres Leche cake. Which was good but had coconut in it, which I had never had Tres Leche with coconut and because coconut is the one food I do not like, nor did it mention it on the menu, I was a bit disappointed. Would definitely recommend this to others and keep going back myself!
