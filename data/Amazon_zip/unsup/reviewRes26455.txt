The spinach and garlic pizza is a revelation. Ha, ok, seriously, I've wanted to type something douchey like that for a bit. I don't know what revelatory food actually tastes like, but the spinach/garlic does fucking rule. The pizza at Pequod's is so good you'll need a cigarette. The pizza at Pequod's is so good you will call it back. The pizza at Pequod's is so good you'd pay full price to see it again. The pizza at Pequod's is so good it should be signed to a multi-year extension. There's no place like home, except for the spinach and garlic pizza. In a game of paper, scissors, rock neither paper nor scissors nor rock wins, the pizza at Pequod's wins.
