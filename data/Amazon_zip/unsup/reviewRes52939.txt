I went to this restaurant for the first time last night and I will definitely be back! The decor and the ambiance of the restaurant are great, as is the food. Drinks are served in medium sized jars. This was pretty different and pretty cool. This place is BYOB. Not having brought any alcohol with us, as a drink, I had Materva soda, which has a sweet taste, kind of like Inca Cola. We had the tostones rellenos as an appetizer. Basically, they are like Mexican sopes, but smaller, with tomato sauce and shrimp as toppings. The tostones were delicious! As an entree I had the puerco rostizado. The pork was tender, juicy, and extremely tasty. The pork is supposed to be cooked with guayaba and it gives the meat a juicy taste. Also served with the puerco were white rice, maduros (fried plantains), and frijoles negros. All of these sides were very good and tasted even better when I combined the frijoles negros with the rice. The service by the wait staff was also very good. Our server was named Felipe (I think, I am horrible at remembering names) and he made great recommendations (in fact, the food that we ordered was what he recommended), offered to answer any questions that we had, and checked back on us regularly. This is definitely a restaurant that I will go back to and is the best Cuban restaurant that I have been to in the area (much better than Siboney). Aside from being good for a date, this restaurant also seems like it would be fun for large groups.
