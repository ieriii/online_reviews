Not being a huge carnivore this is the perfect place for me. Their burgers are delicious but moderately sized- not tiny like DMK Burger Bars or massive and steak-like Kuma's Corner beasts. I've had the Frenchie and the Margherita and both are dynamite. Perfect buns, toppings, and cooked to perfection. The fries are hit or miss- I absolutely an obsessed with the Old Bay Fries (love that briny, sea salt taste to them) but the Truffle Oil fries that everyone raves about were just meh. Whatever, the burgers are the real stand out anyways- save your cals! ;) Service really was the icing on the cake- all of the (male) servers were funny, attentive, kind, and one even let me borrow his lighter so I could indulge in my last, bad girl habit. Now that's my kinda place!
