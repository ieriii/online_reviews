A border wall? DON'T PANIC! We gots the food secured, yo. Few frills and a boisterous atmosphere, the food here will make you believe in cornucopias...and unicorns. The margaritas are made from scratch with fresh-squeezed limes, the prawn tacos with spicy chili mayo are so good they'll alter your perception of reality. Literally everything on this menu is world-class. All the dishes feel hand-made with love...like someone is sitting in the back grinding maize between two large stones just to make you a fresh tortilla. Imagine sitting cross-legged on the beach roasting your own fish, beans and chilies in banana leaves over an open flame...you get the idea. Skip Topolobampo (although the food is fantastic at Topo, it lacks the liveliness that makes Frontera such a delicious experience...and the food isn't THAT much better). You'll feel dizzy from pleasure after leaving here. Sorry SoCal, you have nothing close to this midwest gem.
