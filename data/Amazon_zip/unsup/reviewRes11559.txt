I really really loved this place. Luckily I was there on a beautiful day so although there was a long wait, I was outside. I think it would have sucked if it had been cold. I am not into the eggs and bacon breakfasts, so bongo room fit me perfectly. I had the banana s'more pancakes which were to die for. I also had the pear and raspberry mimosa. That was amazing as well. The only thing that was disappointing is that if you get there toward closing they "run" out of certain menu items. Since I had my heart set on the chocolate tower french toast that kind of stunk.
