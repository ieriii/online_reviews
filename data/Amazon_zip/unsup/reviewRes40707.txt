It's like True Happiness is somewhere between the top of the sweet, simmering Pho and the bottom of the bowl. It's there, right next to the perfect cooked vermicelli noodles, thin strips of meat, and my childhood memories of summer rain and puppy love. I have a tear in my mother-frickin' eye. When I have this godly soup I feel Pho-drunk, and in slurs, I exclaim, "You're all beautiful, each and every one of you" pointing to the fish cakes, the beef tendon, the mint leaves, and the, oh yes, the lime (I haven't forgotten about you, love.) And as I hastily slurp them down, they whisper, softly in my throat and belly, "Yes, yes, I love you too." I gently close my eyes in bliss. Sigh. Who knew True Happiness was extra large and only about $7.00? Sigh.
