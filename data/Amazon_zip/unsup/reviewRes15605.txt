They will not honor reservations. My reservation was set for 7:00 this past Tuesday. My wife and I show up promptly at 7:00 only to be handed a pager and told that we would have to wait "a few minutes". While we were waiting we glanced in the dining room and counted 13 empty tables! So apparently they just want you to wait in the lounge and spend more money on drinks and make it seem like they're such a busy place that's hard to get into. We gave up at 7:20 and returned our pager and walked out. If they won't even honor a reservation, I have no desire to go back.
