I recently went to celebrate a cousin's birthday. It was about 10 of my relatives including my boyfriend. There was live music which was nice and I enjoyed the ambiance very much. I ordered a big piece of steak with yuca and potatoes and I had a coke. I am not a picky eater so I enjoyed my meal very much. However, some of my family members were not too happy. My cousin and the birthday boy did not like their piece meat. One was undercooked so he had it redone but he wasn't happy and didn't really eat. The birthday boy acted like he liked it to be polite, but later told me that the piece was tough. My boyfriend wasn't a big fan either. For dessert I ordered the coconut flan which I always order. Some of our previous visits have been better, but from my own personal experience, I did enjoy it. However my boyfriend and I do prefer Sabor a Cafe Colombian restaurant.
