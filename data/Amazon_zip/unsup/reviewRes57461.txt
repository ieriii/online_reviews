So this has always been my favorite gyro spot in greektown but had been extremely disappointed on the rest of their menu on my prior visit. Decided that it was worth a second chance since the gyros are just that good and figured that it is typically a pretty crowded restaurant so maybe I just got a bad experience. Turns out I am very glad that I went back a second time. The lamb dishes were fantastic, the meat just slipped easily off the bone and was very tender. The grilled octopus was also a very good appetizer with just the right amount of smokeyness. And of course the gyros were as good as I remembered. Overall a solid choice for Greek food and glad that I gave it another chance.
