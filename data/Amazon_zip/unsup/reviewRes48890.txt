finally made it here and overall liked it. you can tell they really take a lot of pride in everything they serve and do. the beer list is pretty awesome; a diverse menu at pretty decent prices. and the food was pretty good; interesting preparations and flavors that i was anxious to try out. out of everything i tried (pork rinds, frites, charcuterie, hamachi, suckling pig, artichoke, oysters, sweetbreads, boudin blanc) i thought everything was great but nothing quite blew me away. i definitely want to try out everything else though. the service was very friendly and helpful, proactive about educating us on some of the more unfamiliar items on the menu. the only knock is that we got our orders pretty sporadically; a few dishes at one time, a longer wait than wanted, then the rest of our plates. kinda screwed the flow a little bit, but easily overlooked ultimately, i'd definitely be happy to go back. at least to try absolutely everything else
