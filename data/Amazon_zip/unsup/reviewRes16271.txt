I take extreme delight in visiting unmarked/underground bars, clubs, and dance halls. The Violet Hour fulfills my abiding ardor for all things sumptuous and concealed. There is truly an Alice in Wonderland effect going on here--upon parting the blushing, melting violet curtains a world with high backed white leather chairs and glasses made of ice materializes. I felt like one of the chosen and paying $12.00 for a drink was wholly justified just to be there. And then there are the drinks... The bartenders actually use real-live eyedroppers to perfect the taste of each drink that is prepared. The man who served me actually spend a good five minutes tinkering with something that at that point had become more of a concoction than a drink, as he siphoned drop after drop and in between tasting it some sort of mixing thing before he discarded it. When he was finally satisfied, I tried the thing. The beverage was more bitter than I would have liked, which is why I almost rated this establishment a four, however, his effort was remarkable and his devotion unerring, which redeemed it. All in all: if you want to felt like an aristocrat by splurging on a $12.00 drink/concoction while surrounded by furniture and drapery that scorns anything plain and tasteless, then this place is for you.
