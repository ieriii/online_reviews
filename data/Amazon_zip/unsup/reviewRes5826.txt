I eat here at least once a week. I love the fixed price menu - appetizer, main (I usually get steak) and dessert for under $35. You can't beat it! My steak is always cooked perfectly and stands on itself - no A1 sauce needed at this restaurant. But by hands down the best item on the menu is the Wildfire chopped salad with the citrus vinaigrette. To die for! This past Sunday we went for an early dinner at 415pm. The sunday special is Thanksgiving dinner - turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry relish - it was delish! they ran out within the hour and I can see why - juicy, moist, delicious gravy. omg. I love this place.
