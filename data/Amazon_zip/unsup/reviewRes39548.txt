Went back. Wow. Much better. Portions seemed more filling thatn previous visits and not as hard-hitting on my wallet as I expected. Buffalo style sweetbreads are a must. Rabbit could have been a little more interesting but everything else was too excellent to take a star off for that. I will be back again shortly...
