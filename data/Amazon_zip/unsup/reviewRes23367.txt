We found this restaurant while walking through the neighborhood. After surveying our other options and reading reviews on the Yelp app on my phone, we decided to give it a shot. We sat outside and were instantly brought water, a basket of chips with some spicy salsa verde. Mmm.. as the busboy dropped off the water and chips he immediately asked, "Would you like to start with some guacamole?" -Which who wouldn't instinctively say YES- I mean hello, it's guacamole. I was able to refrain. After looking over the menu I noticed it's $6.50 for the regular portion of guacamole (which looked delicious and was a generous portion) but wondered how many guests may have thought the guacamole was complimentary? Anyway, we ordered an Oatmeal milkshake to share (this was one of the highly recommended items on Yelp). I've never had an oatmeal shake of any kind so it was an exciting experience. Tasted like a cinnamon topped dessert in a glass. The best part about having this is that it helped to cool down our mouths after eating some of the spicier items we ordered. As far as food we had the Casado entree with the Gallo Pinto (this is a HUGE plate of food) and a Pepito Sandwich. We had a lot of leftovers to bring home after this meal. The food was awesome and so cheap! (BYOB: we ran across the street and grabbed a large beer to share) After finishing our meal, I kinda wish we had just ordered the guacamole and the sandwich because the entree was so large but the entree adds a lot of different elements of flavor which was great. I'll be returning, at least for the guacamole ;-)
