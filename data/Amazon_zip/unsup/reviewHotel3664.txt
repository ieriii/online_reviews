I've lived in Chicago for most of my life, and had never been to the Drake. Everytime I was driving down Lake Shore Drive, I thought...WOW, one day I'll stay there. Who would have thought....The best day of my life thus far was at the Drake Hotel. If you have the opportunity, stay at the Drake in the Presidential Suite. The room is absolutely amazing, and you will feel like a princess. The views of Lake Michigan are awesome. I can't say enough about the room, it was by far bigger than any apartment I've ever lived in. It's a tad pricey for a night's stay...but OMG it is worth every penny. Why did I go, the best guy in the world proposed to me there.....I'll never forget it!
