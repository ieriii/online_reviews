Take note, yelpers: 5 stars rating on a Chinese restaurant, from a very critical Chinese diner. Yes, it's that freakin good! Okay, I am a Chinese food snob. I lived in Shanghai for a year, and fell in love with Sze Chuan cuisine, particularly the "ma la" (translated as "numbing spicy") spice. Most Chinese restaurants in the US will have some form of "Sze Chuan Chicken" on their menu, but, lacking the "ma la" spice, it's usually a pretty embarrassing representation of Sze Chuan cuisine.  And that's why I loved Lao Sze Chuan--this is authentic Sze Chuan cuisine. Finally! I don't care for the trendy "fusion Asian" crap, or the gloppy, syrupy Americanized Chinese food (Orange chicken? Gross). Give me REAL Chinese food, something that people in China would actually want to eat. Lao Sze Chuan? Bingo. We ordered the Eggplant with pork (owner Tony's recommendation), the garlic Dou Miao (eek, fob moment--don't know what this vegetable is called in English), and the Lalala (ie, "spicyspicyspicy") chicken. Tony, who happened to be good friends with my fellow diner, also brought us a beautiful five plate sampling of spicy "cold" appetizers--I hadn't had these since I left Shanghai three years ago, and man, it brought me right back. The food? Amazing. Tony? Incredible entrepreneur, with such charisma.  Congrats, Tony... I think I found my favorite Chinese restaurant in Chicago!
