The spicy falafel sandwich here is THE BEST I have ever had. It is the benchmark by which all other falafel is judged and discarded. This place has seriously ruined falafel for me because nothing else comes close. If you must order something else let me recommend the cheese baked Zatar bread which is this delicious fresh bread backed with spices and cheese. There is also a Zatar bread created with a fried egg on top that is nearly as good and can serve as a meal when paired with some goodies from the salad bar. Overall this counter service restaurant is perfect for a quick cheap AMAZING lunch or dinner--I wish there was one on my side of town so I could go more often without battling the traffic at the 5 corners.
