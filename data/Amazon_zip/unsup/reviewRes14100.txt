I LOVE THIS PLACE. My husband read about it in the RedEye and suggested we try it out. The food is amazing. The lechon is on point. My dad is Cuban and he makes his food the same way. It was like being at home... I have been to Cuba and fell in love the the mamey drinks out there. I was amazed to see that this place had it. I didn't think I would ever taste mamey again, and it was so good! This is a small place but that doesn't change my opinion at all. They are expanding to an Armitage location so lookout for that. The food is AMAZING, the owners are so nice... what more could you ask for? When you go there (because I know you will) get the Lechon sandwich, Mamey shake, and Cafe Cubano. Trust me! I absolutely recommend this place to everyone!
