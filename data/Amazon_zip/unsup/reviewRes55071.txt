Excellent food, from the cornbread to the gunthorp chicken, the vegetable sides to the pork belly, and the delicious gnocchi, everything was great. Interesting preparations grounded in flavorful regional beginnings. We had a group of four and we were dickering over the iroquois cornbread (I won). Very dark ambiance made it difficult to read the menu (but isn't that what that flashlight app is for); a bit noisy as the room fills. Our server, Mark, was exceptional - humorous and knowledgable. We will all be back often!
