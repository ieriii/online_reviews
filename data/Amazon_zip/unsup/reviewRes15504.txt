Pretty good place. I was really digging the layout and vibe of the restaurant. Food was decent. Beers, I see potential. They were decent but nothing that I crave or left a lasting impression. This place will get it right eventually. In the meantime it is a fantastic chill spot, especially when the weather is nice and they have the front windows open. Expect VERY long waits during peak times, only to get worse as the word spreads.
