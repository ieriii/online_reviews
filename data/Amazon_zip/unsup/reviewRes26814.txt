Free soup + chips and salsa + combo platter = delicious heaven! I will say, my enchilada was on the greasier side, but the rest was delicious! Its definitely worth the trip (for those who snub the Pilsen area). Nothing better than grabbing good Mexican food, and catching an ice cream cart right out front! The service was on key!  One complaint... the music was a little too loud for me. But otherwise great food!
