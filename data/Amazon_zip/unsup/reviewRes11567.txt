I *love* the Bongo Room! We don't make it here very often (although I'm not sure why, it's not that far from the boy's place), but every year after the Bucktown 5k, we head straight over to the Bongo Room for some much-needed post-race sustenance. This year, I was lucky enough to get the best breakfast I have probably ever had - the lemon raspberry hotcakes. Lemon pancakes drizzled with about a gallon of hot raspberry coulis, and then topped with lemon whipped cream. Talk about a party in my mouth! Luckily, my egg white-omelet loving sister let me pick at her potatoes to compensate for the sweetness of the pancakes, but let me tell you, I would go back to the Bongo Room in a second and get these pancakes again without even thinking - yummy!
