India House made me a huge fan of Indian food. Thank you India House! Who knew I was missing out on sooo much great Indian food all these yrs. It's officially time to catch up! My only compliant is that the service was sub par. Maybe it was just our waiter but he did seem a bit annoyed that it was our first time there and that we were taking a while to order. We asked for suggestions and he basically said that everything was good. Not much help there...eerrrr. Last note. Not all India Houses are created equal :) There are other India Houses in the burbs but my experience with the food was the best here at the Chicago one.
