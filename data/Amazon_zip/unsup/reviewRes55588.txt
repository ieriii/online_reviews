Besides the aforementioned French toast, the Bongo Room also does wonders in the egg department, culminating in magnificent, albeit somewhat less creative, omelets. The breakfast burrito with cilantro, jalapenos and scallions is a gooey work of art which, when combined with the croissant sandwich, covers almost every breakfast item in the northern hemisphere (muenster cheese and hollandaise anyone?). Not a bad catch for $8.95. Fun specials such as the raspberry lemon pancakes may be a bit too sweet for some, but the Bongo Room's excellent coffee works as a nice counterbalance.
