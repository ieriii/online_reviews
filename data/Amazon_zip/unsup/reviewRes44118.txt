I went here with a friend a few days ago. We came around 6:30 and after we sat down, it got full shortly thereafter. I brought a bottle of wine because it's BYOB (they also have a full bar). Corkage fee is $5, well worth it considering that one glass of wine is $6 easily. We had the Fire Dragon, Godzilla, California and Philadelphia rolls. The first two rolls were some of their featured rolls. You know how the feature rolls usually have 4-6 pieces? These had 8 pieces and were huge. The Godzilla one was by far the best roll. It had crunch and was spicy and just all around good. The Fire Dragon was good, just not as good as the aforementioned one. Both the California and Philadelphia were 6 pieces each and pretty tasty. For the two of us, we spent $37 each with tip (this also included dessert), so it wasn't nearly as bad as we had thought it would be. Definitely worth the price, but go early enough and BYOB it.
