Ok, I admittedly don't know dick about Cuban Food. For all I know, they were serving me Indonesian food but what I do know know is that this place rocks! My date was from NYC so she is very familiar with Cuban food and this is one of her favorite places. It's been a couple weeks since I have been but everything I had there was great. I had the goat cheese empenadas and maybe a beef empenada or croquette of some sort and they were both awesome. I think I may have had some sort of steak dish but don't remember, it was good though. Definitely want to go back!! The patio is great and I went on a weekend and was seated right away so no complaints there.
