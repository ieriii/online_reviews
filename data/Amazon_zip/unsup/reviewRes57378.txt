I've been going here since they opened. I'm glad to see that they have been successful and I continue to be loyal. Although success doesn't always translate into better customer service - they require a credit card for reservations over 4 people and spend too much time telling you that you will be charged if you are a no-show. Hello? I came here once a week when you didn't even need a reservation because the restaurant was never full!! Sushi is still delicious and fresh. Must pick up Sake from Olivia's Market down the street.
