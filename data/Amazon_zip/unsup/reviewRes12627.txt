Just tried this neighborhood place for the first time the other night and I am a fan! The food was quite good (I had the salmon) and the tres leches cake was very yummy. I also had a non-alcoholic (pregnant) mojito which was great - and my husband liked his real one even more. Atmosphere and wait staff was good - will definitely go back - so glad this is in our neighborhood!
