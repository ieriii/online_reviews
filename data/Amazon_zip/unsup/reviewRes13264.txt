The food and service is slipping. I suggested coming here on a weekday after my sister and her partner had a wedding ceremony at Buckingham fountain. Thought it would be a solid option. French fries were cold on everyone's plate (in a not busy restaurant), slow and apathetic service. People had to keep asking for refills. Had a former waitress at the table and she was unimpressed. It was like we weren't the type of customers they like (we had 2 toddlers) and not many drinkers. I thought it was embarrassing since I had suggested it would be good and this was a special occasion. If you are going to call yourself a gastro pub pushing great food, then step it up people! Don't take ANY customers for granted. Stay focused on consistency and quality. Also, the waiters can lose that beer snobbery attitude a bit at lunch, not everyone wants to drink beer all day on a Wednesday.
