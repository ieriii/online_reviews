Okay, so they bumped up the price for mid-week 3 course meal to $30. Okay, that doesn't include everything on the menu. Okay, they charge $5 corkage fee even tho it's a byob place. But the food is WONDERFUL!! My girlfriend and I had their special garlic and celery root soup, can't remember the salad (due to how yummy the soup was). Then, we had butternut squash ravioli, skate wing with the most fabulous sauce. If you think banana bread pudding is not your thing, try it anyways here. It's their signature dessert and it is unlike any bread pudding you've ever had and of course, flourless chocolate cake to top it all off. We also noticed at the bottom of the menu that they have a 5-course meal on Sundays for $40. That'll be our next meal there!
