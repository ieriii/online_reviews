DO NOT STAY HERE! Perhaps the worse Hilton ever. First, expect to wait up to 60 minutes to check-in. Second, expect to find your room unmade and dusty/dirty. Third, the halls smell like decaying flesh. Fourth, the in-house PBX phones do not work. Everything, especially Internet service, is extremely expensive. I was promised 25,000 miles for all the inconveniences and still waiting to see them.
