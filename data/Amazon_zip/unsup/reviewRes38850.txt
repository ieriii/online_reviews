My husband thinks their thin pizza is the best in the world. I admit it is very good. We have eaten in the restaurant quite a few times. Huge variety in the menu and always great! Great variety of Pizza (types and toppings), pasta, appetizers, and other Italian dishes. Parking can be difficult sometimes, especially if the banquet rooms are being used. But always great! 11/08/07 Update My 2nd daughter Bridget was born less than 2 weeks ago and my inlaws live near La Villa. They came over last night to see the baby and bring dinner - what did I ask for? Pizza from La Villa. I was in the mood for it - maybe post pregnancy craving? And I knew hubby would be happy. They brought a party size thin with sausage, mushrooms, green pepper. Excellent and perfect! The best and not as much leftover as I would have liked. Going to go finish the few last pieces now! :)
