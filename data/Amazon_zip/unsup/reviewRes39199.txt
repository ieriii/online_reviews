A little bit of Korean history, the Korean War was started over the fact that Korean restaurants refuse to have a wait list at the door. After having 20 people shoved into a cold, little waiting area and with rude lady refusing to write anyone's name down, tempers flared and the rest is history. Sadly, the lesson was not learned and San Soo Gab San continues the policy of not really caring if you are there, waiting, while 30 people push into you.
