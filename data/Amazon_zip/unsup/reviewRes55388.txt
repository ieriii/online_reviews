I have enjoyed Noon O Kabab's cuisine for the last seven years and have never once been disappointed. The recent expansion and renovation of the restaurant compliments its gourmet cuisine and presentation. The humus is excellent. The Kebab is so flavorful and melts in your mouth. The menu selection is great for both meat lovers and vegetarians. The wait staff is extremely friendly and attentive. It is an overall an excellent dining experience.
