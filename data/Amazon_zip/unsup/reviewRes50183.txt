Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me - you can't get fooled again. I wanted so desperately to like Big Jones. I was SO excited when I first saw the menu. The glowing reviews make me wonder if my experiences are anomalous, but the fact is that after two visits, I've found Big Jones does exactly one thing well, and that thing ain't "meals." So I'll start with the good. Big Jones has some damn fine charcuterie. Maybe not the best in the city, but good enough to get me to eat blood sausage and head cheese and refuse to leave any on the plate. But the food? Yikes. It's run the gamut from dry and bland to inedibly greasy and salty, completely skipping over the delicious happy medium between the two. On top of that, serving sizes are totally inconsistent. It'd be one thing if all the dishes were small, but my husband ordered shrimp and grits so skimpy he was starving within two hours, while my large omelette with grits (the same price, I believe) filled me up until dinner time. We also had issue with service the last time we were here. While our server was friendly enough, it was only after we were about 1/3 through our dishes that he offered the (oh my god so desperately needed, HOW CAN SOMETHING FILLED WITH SEAFOOD AND SAUSAGE BE THIS BLAND?) salt and hot sauce. Several minutes later he swung by with some black pepper. I dunno, guys. Maybe if I lived in the city, I'd come here just for the charcuterie platter, or give the main menu one more shot, but I just don't get to Chicago often enough to waste a trip to Andersonville for one more utterly mediocre meal.
