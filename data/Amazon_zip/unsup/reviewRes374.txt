Wow. I went here with a friend just to go. It was absolutely amazing. The "black truffle explosion" is the best thing I have ever had. It tasted exactly like it's name. We did the 12 course tasting with wine pairings. Some Yelpers have said to do the 24 course full tour with no wine pairings. I would disagree - if you have to pick one or the other, do the 12 course with wine. The wines are so perfectly paired that it elevates the entire experience to a whole new level. At about $750 for two 12 course meals with wine pairings, coffee, tax and tip, it's not cheap...but it was worth it!
