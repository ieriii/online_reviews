Zed was a great experience. I went with a group of friends and it was perfect. I love their funky decor which is modern yet provides a chic-lodge feel. On top of the great rooftop bar, their food is delicious and is great for groups since there is a large selection even for vegetarians.Definitely a great and fun place to go with friends whether for a cocktail or an entire meal--you won't be disappointed!
