falafel sandwich's are cheap and good as are the rice and soup. I tried the fish once, good but kind of greasy. I one time felt a little off after a visit to their salad bar. NOW to the service staff: Once I ordered a dish that included rice and it came to me with no rice. The guy dishing the food overheard me tell the guy at the register about the missing rice. The food disher started yelling at me demanding it was my fault for not ordering rice yet on the menu it said 'with rice'. The register guy got me a bowl of rice and I sat and ate my meal, the whole meal enduring frequent menacing stares from the server. On another occasion I went to Sultans, which appeared to be open due to their 'Open' neon light shining brightly in the front window and a few customers sitting around inside.  I attempted to open the door but it was locked. An employee came to the door and asked what I wanted to which I replied to eat. He told me they were closed to which I politely suggested they turn off their open sign. He sarcasticly stated 'yeah sure' dismissing my stupid suggestion to which I demanded half jokingly, half pissed off that he didn't at least acknowledge that one shouldn't have their open sign on if they are closed 'turn it off NOW!' The employee didn't find it funny and started swearing and going off on me.  I've had a few other less notable unpleasent experiences with the staff at Sultan's as well. Some of their staff are arrogant, dickhead rage-a-holics anonymous candidates.
