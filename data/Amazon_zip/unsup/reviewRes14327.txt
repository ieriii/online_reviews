Service- We had conflicting info on whether we could make reservations or not. Before we couldn't now we can... maybe? Four to our party 2 arrived at 6PM were not allowed to be seated unless everyone in party is present fine if its busy, but more than half the restaurant had open seating. No hostess yet, just waiter who said we will reserve your table until next 2 arrive. When the two arrived at 6:03PM, hostess was clueless, and seemed frazzled like was her first day and had masses of people coming at her. She said all tables are reserved, how about the bar? Some open, but even bar reserved. WHO RESERVES BAR SPACE!!? Luckily we talked to same waiter as earlier and he straightened every thing out. Our server was good Food- Ordered 1.pretzeled walleye 5 stars (Great) 2. Mushroom soup 2 stars 3. Clam chowder 4 stars (nice smokey flavor 4. Mussels 2 stars (had better sauce) 5.Shrimp po boy (heaven on seven does better) 6. Shrimp Ceasar salad (shrimp good, but not enough) 3 stars Conclusion 2 Stars for now because did not live up to hype of other reviews for food, it was just ok. Would go back because of other good reviews for second chance, but would try 11- 6PM specials, for more inexpensive dinners and just order their fresh catch fish dinners only. Also only decent seafood I know in this area.
