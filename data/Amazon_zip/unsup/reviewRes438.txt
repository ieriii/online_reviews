Went in 2007, and it was the best dining experience I've ever had. I can go on and on about the sensory experience will provide you or how amazing the food is but I think it's well covered. I do have a few things to note to add to it's awesomeness: 1. The company I was with (God forbid she ever read this...) was in love with my ex, so I thought it would be a few hours full of awkward turtleness. But no, the food made us bond more than anyone would have expected. Since she was with me during my first experience in the House Grant Built, she'll engrained in my memory as a good friend. 2. I've experienced the tasting menus of Tru, Spiaggia, Moto, Spiaggia, etc. and I must say for the splurge you'd do at any, the quality of this one makes it a steal compared to the others. (respect to said others) 3. I usually collect the menus from fine dining establishments and have the chef sign them. After our meal, Grant came out to meet us. I had my menu and pen ready, but he was so good-looking, I froze and didn't ask him to sign my menu. (blush) I still cannot believe someone so young and handsome made the best meal of my life, kicked cancer's ass, and has a slew of accolades. I'll work up the courage next time!
