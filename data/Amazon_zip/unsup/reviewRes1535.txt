What can I possibly say that hasn't been already said in 1,200+ reviews? Hmm, I could say that I wasn't very impressed with the andouille sausage that I split with my wife. I thought it tasted like dirty water; she just didn't like it, period. It also wasn't spicy at all, despite the warnings. The owner was very helpful, though, in telling me the best toppings to go with it. I also got a polish (with mustard and sauerkraut) for myself and enjoyed it thoroughly; my wife got a hot dog with all the toppings (except tomato) and loved it too. Their fries are also very good. I didn't go on one of the days that they serve duck fat fries, though, which is a shame. I would have liked to try them. So, despite the lackluster andouille, I liked this place a lot. And the price for everything is fantastic, too.
