Yes it's true...Great fish...yadda yadda yadda... but I go here mostly for breakfast. Check out that egg sandwich! it's ridiculously amazing. Super nice employees there too. Love the patio in the summer. My only complaint ever is that they need to expand. It's too small and sometimes the wait is too long (especially weekend mornings!) It's too small! But yeah, food and service is great all around.
