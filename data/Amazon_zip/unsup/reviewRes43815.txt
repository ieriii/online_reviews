I went to Kinzie Chophouse twice in two days. The first day I stopped in to have a drink and an appetizer at the bar after a long day of walking around the city. Paul, my bartender, was very nice and helped me choose a good glass of wine. The restaurant was pretty empty when I showed up at 5:30 pm, but as it was the night before Valentine's Day it began filling up very fast. I still had quick service from the server and the bartender. I ordered half a dozen oysters and they are some of the best I've had in the city. At less than $2 an oyster, you get a generous plate of plump and beautiful little bivalves on the halfshell, with two lemons, horseradish and ketchup. I got some Tabasco too. I was sad when they were gone. I went back the next night for dinner on Valentine's Day. Even though the restaurant was packed me and my friend were still treated wonderfully by all involved. Our hostess, Fannie, helped us get a table in the section we requested. Paul once again gave us great service at the bar while we waited for our table, and Corey our server made sure we were well educated about the different cuts of meat and what sauces and sides would best fit our dinner plan. I chose the bone-in Delmonico ribeye and my friend ordered the filet. We both got those amazing oysters for an appetizer - I am craving them again right now. The food was spectacular at dinner! My ribeye was perfectly cooked medium-rare with an impressive flavorful crust. The complimentary sauces we shared were not at all overpowering, rather highlighting the flavors of the meat. Our sides were a most excellent broccoli fondue and the mushroom risotto, which my dining companion declared some of the best he's ever had. All in all, great food, great service, totally worth two visits in two days! Conveniently located off the brown line stop by the Merchandise Mart, I am sure I'll be back soon.
