I can never get enough of this plate. I have gone four times and have walked out full and happy all four times. My favorite is the Truffle egg toast + fontina + asparagus! What might seem simple is the most delectable toast, egg, asparagus combination I have ever tasted. I love, love the Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori al forno. It has just enough for two to share, to savor each bite. But honestly, you can't go wrong with the menu. It's a long wait but worth it because you can go across the street, grab a glass of wine, and they'll call you when your table is ready. If you've got some time and craving for some delicious food, it's a food experience that is well worth it!
