We heard the hype of this place. It was recommended by more than a few of our local friends. After waiting for over 1.5 hours, we finally got our pizza, and were floored by how underwhelming it was! Mountains of rubbery mozzarella cheese, no sauce, nothing good, let alone extraordinary! Crust sucked, veggies were soggy and droopy...meat was nothing special. The tastiest part of the meal was the marinara sauce I had to order to dip me pizza in because there was just no sauce. This place was a major disappointment.
