It is currently after 4:00 a.m. I have been trying to sleep for the past six hours. In short, this is the worst hotel experience I have ever had. First, we were moved because we had a room above a night club. The noise was absolutely awful. A few minutes ago we were woken up by a party next door, or should I say in the hallway. This has been a very bad experience and, at TWO HUNDRED PLUS per night a very bad choice. DON'T STAY HERE.
