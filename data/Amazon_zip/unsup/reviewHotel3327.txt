I was skeptical about this place but I found a good rate on hotwire...and hence...made reservations. Much to my surprise I really liked it. The room was very nice and the staff was very helpful, especially for the affordable rate. The concierge made three restaurant recommendations that all panned out. The bar can get rowdy so if you are not into that, just avoid it. That is what we did. I would stay here again on a repeat visit. Oh yeah, the location is just perfect. You are right on Michigan but not in the shopping section.
