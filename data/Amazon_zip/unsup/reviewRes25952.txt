The BEST fondue place I have ever been to. I don't know why you would consider going to any other place since it is family owned, romantic ambiance, fairly priced (even though they have increased quite a lot within the last 4 years), and delicious (as long as you don't mind all the oil on your food). The dessert fondue is delicious, so don't eat too much where you have to pass. I'd say this is a perfect first date spot. I recommend making a reservation well in advanced (ESPECIALLY for Sweetest Day or Valentines) online through http://Opentable.com. It is always nice to go on a Thursday night with a flamenco band playing 7 pm onward.
