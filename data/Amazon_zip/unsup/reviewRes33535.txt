I rarely go out to have pasta because it's pretty damn easy to make at home. Plus, I find that a lot of places tend to keep their sauces on the really acidic side which is actually attributed to them not cooking down the tomatoes long enough to actually develop the sweetness that is naturally found in them. BUT low and behold, Mia Francesca... you do me so well. Can I just say that I'm a sucker for restaurants that have consistently changing menus? I'm someone who likes to try new things often so this definitely caters to my needs. Their carpaccio was decadent. I love the salty bite of the parmigiano reggiano and the briney capers. mmmm and the hearts of palm? yes please. Oh not to mention that you get a huge platter of carpaccio for a (very) modest $8 Let's just say my 5 year old brother LOVES carpaccio because of Mia Francesca... Wow, I just hyped up Mia Francesca a whole lot over one dish but alas, there are some downfalls.. like their salad.. Insalata Francesca.. go away. You're over dressed, over cheesed, and the vegetables need a little perk. I'll forget you ever happened. But onto the Carbonara... soo rich. but oh so tasty. honestly you probably can't eat it too often.. it sticks to your ribs. but man I love a good carbonara and they do it just right. I have no qualms over this other than its adverse effects on your health. but you only live once right? I've also had their conchiglie with smoked mozz. love smoked mozz, can't go wrong. So all in all.. pretty solid pastas (from what I've had so far) and my go to carpaccio spot for boystown. No regrets.. well unless you're one who doesn't like cramped interior b/c they have every intention of meeting the seating capacity set by the fire marshall.
