Great food and wonderful service. The only downside I have I'm split on: the atmosphere. On one hand it's beautiful and upbeat and enjoyable ...but on the otherhand it can be a bit too "open". Depends on just what your plans are for the evening. For example, sometimes I'll cozy up to the bar for a flight of champagne ...just solo. For that, it's nice to people watch. Other times, bringing a lady-friend here, just didn't work (she was like "ummm... let's go somewhere else ...it's just not intimate at all"... and she was right).  What might help it out is if they added some kind of booth seating - yes they already do have some - but perhaps more, with something a bit "private" in some way (not sure quite how it would work - I'll leave that to an expert in decor). Again though - really nice place for good wine or champagne.
