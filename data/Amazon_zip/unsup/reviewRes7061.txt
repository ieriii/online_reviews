Very quick review: After walking out of a restaurant down the street (Select Cut Steak House) because they couldn't manage to seat us in a virtually empty restaurant. I wasn't in the best mood, or with very high hopes of getting a table when we entered Sapori Trattori and saw it was packed. Jam packed. It was Mother's Day.  I was greeted by the very busy maitre d' who smiled and, after a quick glance at his computer screen, said we could get a seat, but asked to let him go check to see if it was ready. Before leaving he said that if it wasn't ready there was a 2 top we could have, indicating one in the main area of the restaurant. Not a great table (in the middle of the other tables, tight, and next to the main traffic area), but there and ready. He left and quickly returned to show is to a 4 top in a relatively quiet area, set and ready to go. Damn!! 2 walk -ins for dinner on Mother's Day and he gives us a 4 top when a 2 top was also available. Then we had a great dinner. A fine Cesare salad, a terrific meat lasagna, and a terrific tiramisu. We knew the portions here are very generous so we split everything. We both left filled and very happy. We also split a delicious bottle of wine that was discounted for Mother's Day.  The service was terrific. The food delicious. The atmosphere relaxed and friendly. We'll be back.
