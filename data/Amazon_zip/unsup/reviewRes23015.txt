If you are looking for spicy, Szechuan style Chinese food at an affordable price, this is the place to come to. We had a ton of dishes and it only ended up cosing about $15-20 per person. Definitely ordered way too much food, but if you are looking for variety and some tasty Chinese food, here are some of the dishes I recommend. I don't remember all of the dishes we got, but I really enjoyed this popcorn chicken like dish, the deep fried pork spare ribs, the fish fillets with bok choy, their spicy shrimp, mongolian beef, and the ma po tofu.  If you can't handle spicy food, make sure to tell them to make it non-spicy. However, I would say their mild is pretty good and certainly not spicy to the point where you can't enjoy it.
