Hands down the best deep dish in Chicago. And it's not a secret. Like most, expect to come in, put your name in for a table, and then wait to be seated for a good 30 min-1 hour. Thankfully they have plenty of big screen TVs and a bar area so it's not like you're twiddling your thumbs the whole time. They're also very smart and let you go ahead and order your pizza before you even sit down. Since they take about 45 minutes to bake, once you're seated you usually get your food shortly after. I went with my husband and we ordered a medium cheese pizza-couldn't finish the last 2 slices. It's just so much! The cheese/sauce/crust ratio is spot on and the seasoning in the sauce is perfect. If you come here for lunch, you can expect to waddle out and definitely not be hungry for dinner. Love this place!
