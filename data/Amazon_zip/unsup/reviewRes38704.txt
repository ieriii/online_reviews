I wasn't blown away. They have a ridiculous beer selection, mostly belgian's, too bad I'm not crazy about belgian beers. Went on a Wednesday night ~ 6:30, waited about 40 minutes for a table, not bad. The food was ok. Their special, the mussels, not that special. The brisket platter, pretty dry. If I go back, I would try something else, but I'm not in any rush to get back there.
