I've heard wonderful things about Uncommon Ground, so I decided to finally try it one rainy day at lunch. I had the vegetarian chili which was good. It wasn't great, but it was certainly was nice enough. My boyfriend and I shared the sweet potato fries which were delicious. My experience was just a tiny bit odd, as it was late on a Saturday afternoon and though the restaurant had few people in it, we were sat RIGHT next to a table of four along the wall. And the tables were in very close quarters. I always just assume that they need to fill certain servers' sections when they do that, but...always a little creepy to kind of be sitting in someone else's lap when there is room in the restaurant to spread out. The other weird thing was that there was some kind of kids' band playing really loudly in their next room. When I say "kids' band" I mean straight-up Sesame Street music. Customers in our adjoining dining room were singing along. So...yeah.I would say the food we had was good, and I'd be willing to go and try it again. I'm not so sure the prices are worth it, but I'm still hoping to have that "great" experience there that I keep hearing about...
