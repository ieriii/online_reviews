Great Great Food! Unbelievably fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is very warm and the staff is very nice. I recommend the sultani filet and chicken kebob. The eggplant dip is good too BEWARE of delivery though..food is always cold, and it just doesnt have that same taste when its brought to you fresh from the kitchen
