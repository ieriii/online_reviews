My husband and I came here for a romantic wine and cheese meal and got what we asked for and more. We did a few flights of wine and of cheese. We were young and didn't know much about cheese at that point so I just told the bartender what kind of cheeses we liked and he ordered us 5 that he knew we could handle. The ambiance of the place is great.  I highly recommend it!
