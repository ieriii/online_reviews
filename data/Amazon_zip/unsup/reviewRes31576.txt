We've been meaning to try Sunda for a while and I am so happy we finally did. To break it down: Bar service: fair. Peared saketini was really good. Table service: fair to poor but the attention we received from the     maitre d (?) more than made up for it. Food: Amazing! Ordered so much food that the 3 of us shared because we wanted to try almost everything on the menu. Lobster wagyu beef roll, oxtail potstickers, uni, lemongrass beef lollipops, firecracker roll, crispy pata, adobo braised pork belly (the best of the bunch), Chilean sea bass, pansit canton, and ended the meal with the ridiculous for dessert (a little underwhelming). Overall a great experience. Planning to go back soon.
