I love this place and can't get enough. I brought visitors from all over the country and even abroad and the concur. Brunch on the weekends is a bit of a wait, but worth it. I have tried the delicious veggie croissant and the sweet potato black bean burito for brunch. For breakfast, you absolutely must taste the pancakes. I have never had better, my top two favorites are the chocolate pretzel and the banana oreo with vanilla sauce. There is also a caramel apple one and a red velvet. They are to die for! Take this one word of advice and order a single portion, it comes with one huge pancake with all the toppings which is more than enough and cuts down on the price. Seriously, I love eating and this was plenty!
