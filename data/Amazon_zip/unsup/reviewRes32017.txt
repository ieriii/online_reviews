I've eaten at Chicago Diner more times than I normally would. I'm not vegan. But, it seems like all of my vegetarian & vegan friends who live out of town flock here when they come to visit me. I can see why, too. One friend who has been vegan for the better part of 12 years commented that this is the only place where he can eat vegan "American food." I'm not a fan of fake meat. So, when I'm there, I tend to eat the non-fake meat selections, or the dishes that have a small amount of the fake stuff. I usually order the Santa Fe salad [the dressing is amazing] or the nachos. The nachos portion is HUGE!! All in all, the Diner is a tasty restaurant. Oh yeah, beware of the cornbread muffins. I was served one that could double as a hockey puck. It made for a great laugh, though. Wait, a couple more oh yeahs! Their oat bar treats are amazing.
