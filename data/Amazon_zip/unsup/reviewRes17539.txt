Honestly, I'm not much of an Indian food fan, so I don't know how fair it is to have me rate this place. My boyfriend is the one that loves Indian food so I thought we'd try this place out for dinner. I have to say, it's the only place I actually ENJOYED Indian food. We got naan with this delicious tomato bisque type dip, lamb samosas with four different and delicious sauces, and then chicken spicy rice, tikka masala, and this amazing yogurt cucumber sauce. It was all very good. I'd go back again for sure!
