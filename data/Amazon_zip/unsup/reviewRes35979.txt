Mmmm... This is a place worth going to multiple times. I went with my boyfriend to get the Peking duck.  Next time, we'll be grabbing 1 or 2 more people because it was really too much food for us. But back to the food... They bring out a cart with a whole roasted duck on it. Every time you hear wheels turning on the floor, 25 heads perk up from tables all across the restaurant, hoping that it's their duck. Unfortunately, the wait is long for this dish but much like all good things in life it's worth the wait. The duck comes with warm buns, veggies (onions, carrots, scallions), a huge bowl of soup and a huge plate of fried rice. You make sandwiches with the duck that they cut in front of you into thin and tender slices. My mouth is watering right now just typing about it... If you can wait, don't get any appetizers or anything other than this dish. You'll want to eat as much of it as possible when you taste the meat melt in your mouth.  Also, this place is BYOB. But they also serve Matilda for $5. Awesome!
