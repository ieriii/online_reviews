Someday... ::Ring Ring... Ring Ring...:: Graham Bowles: "Hello?" Me: "Hi Graham! Listen are you busy October 6, 2012?" GB: "Well that's kind of far away... who is this by the way?" Me: "Oh forgive my manners! This is Sarah, last month you made sure your staff gave my fiance and I a surprise engagement dinner to remember? You secured the complimentary champagne toast. The best seat in the house. A server who gushed over our engagement story and made sure we sampled every hot and cold small plate we fancied? Served us out-of-this-world cocktails and just in general made us feel like the most important couple in the restaurant?" GB: "Uh huh, well I do like to make sure my guests are taken care of. Especially those celebrating a special occasion..." Me: "Exactly. And since you took such good care of us, I was wondering if you could officiate the ceremony. Your food and your restaurant were just such a memorable part of our engagement that I wanted to bring that over to the ceremony. It won't be weird at all." GB: "But I don't even know you..." Me: "I know you, Graham. I know you through your food. It's all that matters." GB: "Riiiiiiiight...well listen. I'm happy to have helped make your day so special, but perhaps you'd like someone you've actually met to officiate your wedding." Me: "I love you." GB: "Hanging up now..." I will always think of this restaurant as the cream of the crop for celebrations. Because the staff here truly makes you feel so special. Not to mention the level of ingenious creativity Bowles actualizes in his food is rare, and the cost to experience such creativity is unexpectantly reasonable.
