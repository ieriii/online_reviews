I went to dinner at Wildfire last night with my friends (they recommended this place as a great steakhouse). I loved decor, food, service... Prices are high - that's the only reason I'm giving 4*! We started with their bread - its great, just don't eat too much! Soup of the day, then file minion - trio, we get to choose flavors and creamed spinach, boys had halibut with roasted vegetables... pie for dessert. Everything was delicious! Will go there again probably...
