Part of the joy of Hot Doug's is taking people here, and part of the unexpected challenges of Hot Doug's is taking people here who hate lines and have no reason to know why they're on one that might take an hour on a Saturday morning. I took my boyfriend here and good grief he was such a pill the whole time, like a grumpy four year old who had a hangover and kept insisting that it's ridiculous to wait this long for "just a hot dog." My testament to the deliciousness of Hot Doug's comes not from my love of exotic meats and their excellent cheese accompaniments, as well as quality ingredients and creative flavor combinations (and most of all my willingness to wait for them). It comes instead from the look on my grouchy impatient boyfriend's face when he scarfed down not one but two of their specials and half a basket of melt in your mouth duck fat fries. Then those three beautiful words, "you were right!" So I will reiterate that it's good to be skeptical of anything with a hype, anything with a wait, and anything that insists on inconveniences like cash only. Contemplate that the entire 30-40 minutes you're on line, and then open your mouth, insert anything on the menu, and then hug the person that dragged you there.
