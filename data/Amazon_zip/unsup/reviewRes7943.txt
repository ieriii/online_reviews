If your a carnivore like me then this is the place for you. ALL YOU CAN EAT MEAT! Basically flip your card green if you want more, red if you need a break. Last time I went here, I was so hungry for some beef, steak, pork, etc... I never even made it to the salad bar. So if you want great quality meats served to you at your table quickly. Fork that money over and get crackin'.
