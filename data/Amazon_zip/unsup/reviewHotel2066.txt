I agree with Allen M. I'd like to add that room service is fast, but the food is bland. they did not deliver the food on a tble so we had to eat on the bed and desk...ugh. No mayonase was delivered as asked or onions for the sandwich. All the food was clean and well made, but just tastless. The pizza was bad evenby kid standards (they eat anything). The pool was cold to me, but the kids seemed to enjoy it. I enjoyed the sauna. There is no whirlpool, ugh! Service was fine. The only special thing I can say about this place was the bar. View was excellent and they allowed the kids to sit and drink Shirley Temples. Must add that I left something in the room and it was returned. I should have been called when it was found, which is what happened at Disney when I left something. They actually called me and sent the items to me. It ought to be standard to call when things are found.
