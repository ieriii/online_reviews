Love everything about Brazzaz!! The salad bar is amazing, though I usually try to save room for the best part and not over-do it too early. The fresh mozzarella and asparagus catch my eye along with the traditional beans and rice with some farofa sprinkled on top. My favorite cuts of meat are the bacon-wrapped fillet & chicken, the garlic beef and of course the picanha. The grilled pineapple, polenta and fried plantains are also really great when you need a break from the meat overload. I've come here too many times to count over the years and can't say I've ever had a bad experience. It's good for large groups or a dinner for two. Just make sure you arrive with an empty stomach and are prepared for a massive food coma when you leave. It's worth every cent, but if you aren't one to splurge on meals or just aren't buying into the idea, you can always try it for lunch and get an even better value out of it!
