This is one of the most popular Mexican restaurants in Pilsen. The colorful interiors are decorated with murals, masks and other artifacts. The place is packed with crowds gathered for parties as well as couples looking for authentic Mexican food. For starters, everyone gets crisp nachos, jalapenos and pickled carrots, and plates of yummy meat and beans topped with a tortilla. I enjoyed my dinner of mole and cheese enchiladas, although my friend did not care for her order of barbacoa, tender beef that was too salty for her tastes and accompanied by refried beans reminiscent of the canned variety. She has been here before and assures me that the food has always been good, except for this particular order. The horchata was not bad but nothing special. The prices at Nueva Leon are shockingly reasonable, so it's no wonder the crowds come here while other nearby restaurants are deserted.
