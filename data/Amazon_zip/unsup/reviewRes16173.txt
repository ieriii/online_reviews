First- if you are goiing to worry about the price of your drinks- don't go here. It's quality over quanity here. I love to knock them back too, but with great cocktails like these, I (at least like to try..) to sip and enjoy. The drinks are awesome, original and fresh. I think their menu has been revamped- and the food is a lot better then last time I went there. I think my table (of four) got three of the crab appetizers- one after the other. They were that good. Oh, skip the sammies... they arent that good... In my experience, the waitresses have a bit of a 'tude but the bartenders and bouncer are great. Due to the set up and the nature of the bar, there is not a lot of socializing with other patrons. Make sure you actually WANT to talk with the people you are going with. If you are on a bad date or with someone that drives you crazy- this is not a good venue for that. This place rocks- it's different, special, cool and fun.
