You may sound like you're being healthy when you order the Vegetable Platter at Wishbone, but if you feel like it, it can be a plate of all carbs-- like crispy home fries or creamy macaroni and cheese-- or my favorite combo--mashed sweet potatoes, cheese grits, and sauteed spinach (cause, you know, I'm being healthy).  Seriously though, these three things are the best things on the menu, and it's good for any meal of the day. The sweet potatoes are whipped and light, the cheese grits are salty and creamy (a brunch must-have), and the sauteed spinach is unlike any other spinach I've ever had-- almost kind of lemony. The veggie plate's even served with a piece of cornbread (yay! more carbs!) The BBQ pork sandwich, omelets, crabcakes, and salads are all pretty good too-- but, don't say I didn't warn you, when you fill up on all the sides first.
