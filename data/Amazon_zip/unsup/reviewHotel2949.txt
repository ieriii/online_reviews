I had a wonderful stay at the Sheraton. The staff was top notch from check-in to check-out, the bed was super comfortable, and my hotel-room-scavenger-hunt yielded free PORN! That's right, I found two magazines from August 1993 (Hustler & Velvet) - their similar dates lead me to believe they have been in hiding for 13+ years. I also found a vintage bottle of Christian Brothers Grand Reserve V.S.O.P. Brandy, but alas it was either completely consumed by a previous guest or evaporated over it's years of impromptu storage. The only thing I would change about the room was the bath. The vanity and shower hardware are starting to show their age and the amenities were Pantene branded. A little spit and polish would do the bath setup some good.
