Came here on a Sunday night and fairly busy but not too packed. Order a regular and rasberry mojito after reading all the great reviews...and wasn't disappointed. They're as good as everyone says they are....and definitely strong. My advice is to take a cab here because you can't taste the alcohol in these and that's dangerous....the waitress said they're about 1/2 alcohol!  You get bread and this yummy seasoned butter while you wait...we were so hungry we finished two baskets. We ordered a house salad, papas rellenas, and pork chops to share. House salad was refreshing given the warm weather and the papas rellenas were pretty tasty. The pork chops and sweet potatoes were MORE than enough to share between two people. The sauce actually reminded me of a sweet Chinese soy sauce. Interesting flavors and really tender. (*Note: Only complaint is that the pork chops were a bit fatty and the waitress seemed a bit out of it.) Will definitely have to come back and try to halibut that everyone raves about.
