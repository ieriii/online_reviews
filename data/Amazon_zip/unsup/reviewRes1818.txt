My husband and I have tried to go four times, and for one reason or another it hasn't worked out. We finally made it when I took a Friday off work for my birthday. Expect a long line- as long as it was on a cold Friday, I can't imagine how long the wait must be on a warm Saturday. That said, a long wait won't deter me from going back, yum! Seeing as we were celebrating my birthday had no qualms about ordering the decadent Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. And the duck fat fries. And a corn dog. And a celery soda! Everything was amazing, definitely worth the (thousands of) calories!
