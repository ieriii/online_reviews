The wait at Frontera Grill was 2+ hours so we decided to try Xoco instead and still get a bit of the Bayless experience. Delicious! I had the Pozole. Succulent broth, huge, tender pieces of chicken, fresh, crunchy cabbage. Need I say more? It was the perfect combo of textures and flavor. My friend had the Carnitas Torta, which he said was rich, spicy and succulent. Luscious piece of chocolate cake was the perfect ending. A bit loud for my liking but I guess they need to keep the crowds moving through.
