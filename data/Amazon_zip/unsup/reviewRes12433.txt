this place has such good pizza, and they brew their own beer. need i say more? alright, i will. for one, i am not a deep dish kind of girl, and thoroughly enjoy the plain pizza here. people think i am weird, a pizza with no mozzarella, but its sooo good. try it with toppings. i swear by it. their golden arm is a nice light beer that goes really well with any pizza and you can buy a pint or something to take home. unfortunately they do not deliver and the wait can sometimes be a bitch, but its worth it.
