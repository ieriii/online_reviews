I'd been reading about this joint for years and had never gone in. The location is a touch out of the way and the bar is, while inviting, not all that interesting visually. The typical old posters of Belgian greats and a wall of bottles that shows off their impressive list. I had a Van Honsebrouk Gueze Fond Tradition that was superb. A tart, refreshing mix of 30% wheat and 70% barley that was spot on and, according to the beer list, a Hopleaf exclusive. The beer prices here run about the norm in Chicago, which is, sadly, way over-priced. The only real issue I had was that, while I had heard rave reviews of the food menu here, I found it to be just adequate. The house specialty Belgian-style mussels were good and the frites and aioli that came with were great (is aioli every anything but awesome?) However, I would have traded half of the huge amount of frites for a few more mussels.. I'm sorry, but mussels for one in my mind requires more than 20 shells. Give me a whole pot for $12 thank you. A great bar nonetheless and it will require more exploration in the future. Which will be awesome.
