Maybe the reviews are lower because this is technically a chain affiliated with Cheesecake factory, but 5 stars for Grand Lux all the way! Awesome location on michigan avenue with a really cool atmosphere and decoration. I'd recommend waiting for a table at the window at least once. Dining above Michigan ave, especially in the round room, is really fun. Good food, never had something I didn't like. And the prices are on par with cheesecake factory anyways. Recommended: ceasar salad, bbq pizza, or any pasta. Great service. good free bread while you wait, fun classy atmosphere
