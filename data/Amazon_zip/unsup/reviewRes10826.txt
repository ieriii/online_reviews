Went in for Sunday brunch for 2, the hostess rudely informed us that it could be up to a 45 minute wait (the restaurant closed in an hour), despite there being space at the bar and a table for two clean and open. She refuses to take a phone number, and there is no space to wait, so she advises us to just "stop on by later". We walk next door, investigate an antique shop for 10 minutes and decide to stop back in and see if they are willing to let us have that empty table. The ice queen purses her lips and leads us to the bar. Once at the bar, the waitstaff is kind and attentive, the coffee is tasty and the food is excellent. It's busy, loud, and definitely not an option for group events. Apparently you just have to wear a parka to get by the front door.
