Really good pizza. Ok so the first time I went I hated it. We made the mistake of ordering the bbq pizza - it was really bad. Too much sauce and the sauce was too tangy (i'm picky about my bbq sauce). We told some people about our bad experience at Art of Pizza and they said to give it another try but to go for a more normal pizza. So we tried the 'special' pizza and it was delicious. I'd recommend this place to anyone except if you're feeling like a bbq pizza.
