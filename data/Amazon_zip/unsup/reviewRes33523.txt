So I made it back (with the help of the rather accommodating management response to my initial experience). I must say, the food is pretty darn good. Went with the prosciutto app plate and the special salad (beets, orange, red onion, pesto), which I split with the SO. The salad was pretty awesome, maybe a touch too much olive oil, but the roasted beets were done right and the mint/orange combo was a nice compliment. The prosciutto was good per my SO, I'm not the biggest fan generally, so I don't feel qualified to judge. I went for the mussels and pasta. There was a lot of mussels in my dish, which rocked. I like when restaurants don't skimp on seafood. I thought the spicy marinara was tasty (though "spicy" perhaps not). But the flavor balanced nicely with the mussels. SO got the sausage ravioli, also tasty, though he thought the pasta was a bit doughy. Both felt like our sauces weren't incorporated into the pasta as well as they could've been. Tasted like the sauce and pasta was cooked separately and then just mixed together last minute. I think that's the primary reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars. Received two complimentary desserts. The flourless chocolate lava cake and an apple turnover/bun/pastry (?), or sorts. I'm not a big dessert eater unless it's ice cream, so I was neither blown away nor underwhelmed. My SO more or less ate both. There was a nice taste of cinnamon to the apply one. And fresh fruit with the chocolate cake (which is mostly what I ate). Our server, (I believe it was Tom), was fantastic. Friendly, but not the interrupting/annoying type. I still think this place crowds in way too many tables. Fortunately, we were next to a window, but I don't think I would go back during Friday dinner with all the noise. Unfortunately instead of making me feel trendy and cool, it makes me feel anti-social and grouchy. I would however order it for take out or go back during the week. Much better.
