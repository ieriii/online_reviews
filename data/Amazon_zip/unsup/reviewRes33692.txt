The food was fair. I think people like it because the servings are huge and the food is palatable. I ordered some omelette with avocado in it because it sounded unique and it was fine. I made the mistake of ordering it with a side of pancakes, not expecting it to come with a whole order of pancakes. Also, I ordered these special strawberry/chocolate pancakes although I worried that might be too sweet. I worried they'd be plain pancakes covered in strawberries and chocolate syrup. Then I noticed they were described as pancakes with bits of chocolate and strawberry in the batter and I thought, that sounds interesting. Unfortunately, what I got is what I was afraid of getting: a plate of pancakes topped with strawberries and Hershey's chocolate syrup. Um, yuck. The food was fine. Not worth the wait. The portions are too large for any human being who isn't involved in some kind of intense physical training. There are some things I liked about the space and it's decent enough but Chicago is full of breakfast places and this one just didn't do it for me.
