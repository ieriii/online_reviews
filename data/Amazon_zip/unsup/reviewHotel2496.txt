I like this hotel. The service is never good enough for me because I stay in the regular rooms. The wait at the front desk can make the stay sour even before you get into the room. But after you get in peace is yours. The rooms are clean and smell nice. The pool is great and you can do the spa thing or work out. There is also a whirl pool, but it is often full of kids on the weekends. I may be foolish to spend money on a hotel when I live in the neigborhood, but I find it essential to get away. For the "Taste Of Chicago" it is a convineience and for guest it is a safe place. The handicapped rooms are great for your parents if they have any available. The food is OK and expensive, but such is life in downtown hotels. I recommend this hotel for families, too.
