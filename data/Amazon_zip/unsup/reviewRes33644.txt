Met some friends at Mia Francesca for dinner a few weeks ago. Parking in the area is challenging since it is Lakeview. Shortly realized how tiny and noisy the restaurant is when we were seated near the kitchen. I had a difficult time hearing my friends down the other end of the table. Instead, I felt like I was the third wheel on the first date that was taking place to my left. (Side note, talking about your EX on the first date is not a great idea). On to the food... well, what food? I filled up quickly on the amazing, steaming hot, flaky bread and olive oil. I must have had 2 loaves by myself! It's not my fault that the busboys keep replenishing our basket! I think it may be the best bread I ever had! Found out later that they have their own bread machine in the back. I ordered the pollo arrosto alla romano (half chicken with garlic and roasted potatoes). The chicken was really juicy and flavorful. Most of friends ordered the lobster stuffed ravioli. Judging from their facial expressions and empty plates, they enjoyed it. Overall, good food but noisy atmosphere. Would be back if I was in the neighborhood and felt like carbo loading.
