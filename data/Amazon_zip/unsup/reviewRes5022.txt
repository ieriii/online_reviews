Two stars exactly - Meh. I've experienced better. Perhaps I'm just different. I live in Miami where these types of places are everywhere. So when I heard about this place and saw all of the reviews, I immediately thought FOR SURE, I'M THERE! We walked in the early afternoon, fresh off the plane to have some fine wine and food. We ordered the following: Jacky Moulin-A-Vent: Very good wine, highly recommend. Delice de Bourgogne: If you like Brie, you'll love this cheese. For food we were told the portions are small. Because we traveled on AA we were starving. So we ordered with our eyes. The Roasted Bone Marrow wasn't all that great, unless you're into very greasy foods. Prosciutto Bread Balls - 6 tiny (and i mean tiny) balls with red sauce. I never tasted the prosciutto. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - For all the hype, I was disappointed. It is a small portion of pork with gravy that tastes like you're having turkey. The mash, ehh, ok. Overall, the place looks awesome ONLY if you're going for WINE AND CHEESE. This is why I give it two stars. Perhaps if I wasn't so hungry and just wanted to chill with some wine and cheese then the rating would be higher. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. If you're hungry and want good tasting food, keep walking.
