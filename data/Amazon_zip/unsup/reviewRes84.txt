Most amazing meal I've ever had. My boyfriend surprised with me dinner at Alinea for my birthday this year and it couldn't have been a better evening. The atmosphere for our 9:30pm reservation on a Wednesday night was perfect: the servers were attentive, the dining room wasn't too loud so we could enjoy our conversation; it was the perfect setting. Our first plate was Char Roe with carrot, coconut and curry. We about fell out of our seats; it was so simple yet amazingly delicious. Other note-worthy plates include: Ice with beet, hibiscus and licorice The black truffle explosion Winter in New Hampshire Hot potato/Cold potato Razor clam with shiso, soy and dalkon Lemongrass with papaya, thai basil and finger lime By the time we got to the awesome dessert presentation we were feeling quite full, but we couldn't pass up the last course. It was so much fun, like being a kid again, eating off the table but in a more sophisticated style! Everything went perfect. For sure the best birthday meal ever.
