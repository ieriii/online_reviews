So I've been to this place twice and planning on going back. The beer list is impressive. Best Snake Bite I've ever had, and I am a fan of my beer cocktails. We also ordered the cheese curd both times we have gone there for an appetizer because they were delicious...oh and did I mention HOME MADE RANCH...oh and they make their own ketchup and that is delicious too!! I ordered the Slow Burn, which was spicy however not overbearing with heat...just enough heat to make it hot, and still taste all the flavor. On my second trip I ordered the Black and Bleu burger, which was also good. I've tried their truffle fries, which I will admit, I've had better. I also tried the chipotle fries and cajun fries.... chipotle fries were a bit overbearing with spice so I was not a fan.  As far as service, I thought it was good. I got my food in a timely and courteous manner. Everyone seems laid back which I like, I liked the music that played in the background. I just think the place is cool. I mean they have a burger collaboration with Sage Francis, it's a cool place. I recommend this place to all my friends.
