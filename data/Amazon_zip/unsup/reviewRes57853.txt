I have to admit, I was timid about trying Ethiopian food. But what's life without trying new things?! I bought a Yelp deal for Demera and finally decided to go with my husband and sister. Our server was pretty quiet and looked confused by some of our questions but we finally decided to order the combo platter, with half veggies and the other half chicken, beef, and lamb. I was pleasantly surprised by all of the different flavors and the huge portions. I especially liked the spinach and the chicken. What I wasn't crazy about was the texture of the bread-I compensated by using as little as possible and using mostly just my fingers to pick up the veggies and meat (kinda gross but also kinda fun at the same time!). We also had a turnover-like spinach appetizer that was amazing! While I really enjoyed the food, I wish the service had been better. Our server wasn't the most helpful or friendly when helping us choose our food and we had to ask her to refill our water. I enjoyed the food and trying something new but I can't say I'll be back.
