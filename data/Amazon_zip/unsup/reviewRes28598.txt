Okay so the popcorn was amazing. That said, I was a little disapointed overall. The tomato, scallops, and carpacchio were all good. The beef wagyu had great flavors, but was sadly overcooked. I almost spit it out. I was pretty shocked, because everyone says the proteins are always cooked perfectly here. Our server was really good and attentive until a couple the waiter knew sat down next to us. Then he pretty much ignored us and only talked to them. I'm not sure I would go back, but if I did, I would defintiely try the tasting menu. I think at a place like Graham, you really want to get a feel for the chef, and try everything.
