We went here on a whim, last minute no reservations. After hearing about this place from friends and family, I was very excited to try the food. The experience overall was very nice especially the service; however, the food was good not amazing! Notables: hot chocolate shot - seriously rich and deep in flavor but not too overpowering coconut macroon - very sweet but not the kind that hurts your teeth.homemade chocolates - also very rich and intense in flavorpretty much anything dessert!The savory dishes although tasty were not very innovative. Of all the savory dishes, my favorite was the beef wrapped in proscuitto and the soy sauce they used for the sashimi (I swear it's different then the one I have at home- and I'm Asian! haha). Overall, a great experience with the ambiance and timely waitstaff but the food itself was definitely not worth the price tag. Can't wait to try Alinea and Trotters to compare :)
