Tentative three stars. Would like to go back and try a few other things on the menu, however it's pretty pricey for what did look really good. Corn mushroom - not worth it Beets with goat cheese - favorite Fried deviled egg -egg was great salad was sour Octopus was good solid, may get again. Cheeses- truffle cheese was great but $6 for one cheese that's not that big of a serving seems like a ripoff Prosciutto on bread with egg - delicious Wine- half bottle of axia for $28???. HALF bottle. Also pricey but perhaps the location is what you're partially paying for.
