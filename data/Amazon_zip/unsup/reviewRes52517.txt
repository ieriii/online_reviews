I haven't been to any other Brazilian steakhouses, so I'm no expert but this place was very good. I took my BF at the time out to eat because I had just landed a new job and it was really a nice place to celebrate. We dressed up fancy and drank expensive wine. The dinner special is $40 per person, which I hear is $10 cheaper than Fogo de Chao (although I've heard that place is better). You definitely get your money's worth. We felt like ralphing when we were done, however the puke would have been really good - everything there was delicious. There is so much food all around you and so much eating going on that I suggest going prepared. Eat a light breakfast and wait until later in the evening so you can truly indulge. Very good. Pretty atmosphere and very attentive wait staff.
