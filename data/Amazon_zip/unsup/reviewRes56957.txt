I've been here, probably 7 times, and it's a great place to bring out-of-towners. Their pizza is pretty great, and the home brewed draft beer selection is quite amazing. I try to go there on an off night as the weekends are just silly. The customer service is ok and the prices are reasonable. Enjoy a night a Piece!
