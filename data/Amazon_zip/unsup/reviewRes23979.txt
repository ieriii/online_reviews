i'm not a huge chinese food fan, so i'm not sure if this is legit sze chuan cuisine or not. there were some really tasty dishes, such as the mayonnaise shrimp (i know, it sounds weird but it's really good) and sze chuan green beans, and some that i would have happily skipped, such as the hot pot. the menu is huge so i very well could have missed out on some highlights. there's not really any atmosphere but the waitstaff was friendly and pretty helpful.
