I love places like this old traditional yet hip and up to date. The food was very good and they know how to make sea food come alive. The service at the Oyster Bar sitting at the bar was the best of the best. Props to Carlos the Bar Tender and the Man from Mexico City originally. This guys make the entire experience worth every dime. Best Clam Chowder ever. I use to thinks that this little place in Pismo Beach CA had the best but it just doesn't compare. The Oyster are wonderful and the Salmon I had was very good. Not as good as Elliott's in Seattle but close. Now the main reason I came to this establishment. To see Morry Sochat & The Special 20's an incredible Blue's / Jazz band. These guys are great and if you're ever in Chi town and these guys are playing some where make the time to see them. If they are playing at the The Oyster Bar or Shaws Crab House one in the same but separated by name and dinning seating don't miss it. It's a double win great food, environment, the heart of Chicago and great live music. Food is 4.5 the feel of the place and service 5 and the live musics is a 6 off the charts. Can you tell I'm a music lover yes sir. No cover charge only enjoyable food and bar tab.
