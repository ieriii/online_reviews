It sucks that it's so hard to get authentic Chinese food on the north side of Chicago. After living in the area for a couple of years, I found Sun Wah recently and couldn't be happier. I've not been there for a full-on feast but typically order some the of Chinese "comfort" food I can't get anywhere else. Roasted duck on rice, roasted pork on rice, pan-fried noodles, wontons and egg noodles ... mmmm ... menu is CHEAP. a lot of stuff for $5 - $6 which probably explains why this place is always packed. I'm glad to have found Sun Wah (thanks Yelp!) ... my only wish is that the service and food handling practices were a little less "chinese". Terrible but true, I feel like more Chinese restaurants than not suck at making their guests feel good about their dining experience. Little things like a cook eating a piece of leftover duck after preparing a plate aren't totally disgusting but enough to make me think about my food a little. All in all, GOOD Chinese food, probably the best I've found in Chicago outside of Chinatown.
