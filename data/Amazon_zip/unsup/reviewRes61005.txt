After reading all the reviews, I felt it necessary to add a little piece of my own! First of all, I noticed the reviews that don't like this place are not very secretive about the fact that "their" neighborhood is changing. I don't understand the disdain for the change this place brings to the neighborhood. So I wanted to offer an equally biased opinion on the restaurant. Sure there are a lot of people in the crowded bar on friday and saturday nights, but that adds to the character of the place. It is a bar after 10 pm on the weekends. But that doesnt take away from every other day when I can bring my dog and sit on the patio for some great food. I eat the same things all the time: wings, skirt steak sandwich, and burgers! You cannot go wrong with any of these choices. I always have a good time here too. The whole staff is happy all the time and a lot of them have been there since the beginning still. That says a lot about what kind of place it is. There's way too much character in this place and I think even the "wicker park hipster" can put a smile on their face once they try the food. If you don't like the crowd, try the weekdays. I played one night and won the PBR round. Who doesn't love free PBR and trivia! Keep up the good work Fifty/50, I will see you soon.
