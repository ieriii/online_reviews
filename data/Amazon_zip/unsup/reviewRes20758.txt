A romantic dinner....for 4 Love love love Coast....and so do a lot of people. By 8 pm on a Tuesday night, the place was poppin' and there were at least 20 others waiting to be seated. Why I love it: BYOB! Easy street parking (rare in Bucktown)! The Tuna Carpaccio special! Why it's not getting 5 stars: Wonk-wonk on the Ceviche Roll and the $16 price for their Yakisoba dish (basically a handful of noodles with a couple pieces of asparagus thrown in). What we ate: Tuna Carpaccio - Tangy, spicy, buttery. Negihamachi, Spider Roll, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Tako, salmon with avo - ALL solid and delicious. Spicy Tuna Crunch - Very flavorful but I felt I lost the buttery tuna texture in all that tempura crunch. Ceviche Roll - Meh. It was weird. A chunk of jalapeno, a chunk of mango, a chunk of scallop. It was listed under their signature dishes, so we decided to try it. It was ok, I would never order it again. Dessert was chocolate mousse with ice cream - perfect end to the meal. We were "Those People" and had our kids with us. In our defense, it was our anniversary, we ate early (7 pm) and even requested a table away from the crowds so as to not disturb our fellow sushi-eaters. My kids (ages 3 and 2) are foodies-in-training so they were awesome.  Anyway, they ate some of the soft shell crab, a bite of the salmon roll, miso soup and the yakisoba noodles. If I'm at a sushi place, the last thing I'm going to order is noodles and that's probably what Coast figured...why else would they charge $16 for this? That's the cost of 2 makis! Either way, the kids gobbled it up so it was all good. We've dined there numerous times without the kids and the host/wait staff was always good. But with the kids, there was no judgment, no weird looks. In fact, they were extra accommodating and sweet. They are the reason why I'm taking the time to write this review.
