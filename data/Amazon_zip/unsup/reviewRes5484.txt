The Purple Pig's dinner menu of small plates to share is a perfect solution for a light meal when you don't want to break the bank. The menu was pretty extensive, with unique items, so we asked the waitress for recommendations. Every item we shared was delicious, flavorful, and just enough bites to share. On a warm summer weekend night, the wait for 2 to sit outside was about 1/2 hour, but we were able to get a glass of wine and sit on the nearby benches while waiting for a table - definitely a plus. I will definitely go back in the summer and try a few other tasty dishes.
