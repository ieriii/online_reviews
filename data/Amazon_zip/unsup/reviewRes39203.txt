First of all I don't like writing reviews for places that are clearly not for vegetarians, but I feel if someone were in my situation (read further) they might want to know? I'll give 3 stars b/c I feel like I can't properly rate this place. It was a birthday party for my very good friend, so I wanted to go and be a part of it. I'm not one of those veggies who will sit there and tell people around me to not order meat. I think, you eat what you want, I really don't care. But if you have a weak stomach (which is partly why I became veg in the first place) maybe you should not come here...because people WILL order raw meat (its what ya do here!) and the meat WILL be bloody and juicy (to me, that's a giant EW factor..just my opinion, just my warning to those who feel the same..) You *will* go home smelling like meat. You will. Nothing on the menu is vegetarian besides edamame. (Some of the side dishes they brought out were probably vegetarian, but I wasn't sure what most of them were..) They were nice enough though to make me some white rice and steamed veggies in one of those stone bowls that stays really hot. There was another vegetarian in the party who ordered the same.... The waitress took a giant bottle of hot sauce and squirted it ALLLLLLLLL over his meal. ALLL oveerrrrrrr. Before he could say anything, no warning, nothing just hot sauce allll up in his food. A LOT of it. Then she attempted to do that to mine also but I saw what was happening and put my hands over the bowl. Jeez! Be prepared to take off your shoes and sit barefoot with your feet hanging below the table in an area that's even hard for Danny Tanner to clean in between visits. Just sayin'. My meat eating friends really enjoyed themselves. I didn't really. If you're veg I say skip it.
