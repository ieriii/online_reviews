I'm bummed we don' t live a few blocks away anymore. NOT because I miss that condo- EW, but because of this cozy, fabulous restaurant. We were very frequent customers here, and always have had a great experience. The place is cute inside. You walk right into a little bar, lounge, area, then the more "hopping" dining area, and if you're feeling anti-social, the back of the restaurant. Hey- sometimes we felt anti-social and wanted to eat in peace. We have had most of the menu but my favorites are: Grilled Calamari- Fan-freaking-tastic Quesadillas- Thinking just quesadillas??? They're way above average. Skirt Steak- Some of the best we've had. Roast Pork- The one with Beans and Rice. My husband is still back and forth between their pork and Landmark's for his favorite. Pistachio Chicken- NOT a fan of pistachio crusted anything, especially when they do it on fish at restaurants. But this works. It's wonderful. Salmon- If they have more than one bc of a special, the one with cous cous. It is definitely one of the best salmon dishes I have had at a restaurant. I am frequently let down by salmon. Not here. Also, get some cocktails. You'd imagine at a Cuban restaurant they should have a good bartender to make their drinks? They don't. They have a great bartender. Imagine that- How many times have you been at an "ethnic" restaurant that can't make drinks from their region? They make them too well here bc we usually have too many.
