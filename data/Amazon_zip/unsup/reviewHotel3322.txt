Solid hotel, if you can get a good price online. It's in a very old building, converted to a modern hotel a few years back. This is evident with some of the structure inside, but they did a great job with decorating, etc. Great sheets/beds and modern feel to the rooms. Ask for a city or river view for some great pics right from your room. Perfect location for MI Ave area. Valet has always been very prompt (especially compared to some other hotels in the area).
