Went there on a Groupon purchase. We were seated in a booth that was nice. I would hate to have been seated next to the guitar player as the table is so small and you are literately almost touching him ! I was a little shocked at the prices when I looked at the menu. The dinners have 3 fondue courses. The first was cheese and also a salad. I loved the cheese, especially with the apples. Next came the main course. I was disappointed as the food had very little flavor (you cook in oil) it was also so dark in there it is hard to tell if your food was cooked thoroughly. Perhaps it's the oil or could be all the different sauces but I did not feel well later. Lastly was the chocolate, and it was really good. For the amount of money $120 (even with a Groupon) we could have had a whole steak and had someone else cook it for us. Sorry would not go back.
