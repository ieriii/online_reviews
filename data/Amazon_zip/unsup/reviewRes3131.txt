For some reason I rather addicted to this place. I find myself going here after work. Food: I usually get the wings Seoul Sassy, and the Burrito. I've tried their bimbimbap and some of their other wings. Environment: The place is small, but unique being that you sit at benches and share a table similar to a picnic style. Overall: I like this place alot, although it isn't exactly a place i'd take a date on, but for someone who is visiting Chicago, definitely good food!
