This was once of the best meals I have ever had in my life. Service was top notch, presentation was incredible and the food was amazing. They really wow you here. One course was a caviar staircase that was delicious and I'm not even a fan of caviar. Loved the beta fish swimming in the glass bowl under the tuna tar tare! Truly a dining event to experience. I can't wait to make a special trip to this city just to dine here again. Tru is one of my favorite restaurants in the country. Keep up the good work!
