Not impressed at all! I have stayed lots of hotels in the city and would NOT return to this one. Customer service was horrible. People could barely be bothered to help you...from the front desk to the bar staff. It was pathetic. While the historic tower was nice, be careful as they are currently doing renovation, and they begin working very early in the morning, everyday of the week. Not at all impressed
