Question timeee Do you like burgers? Do you like really damn good appetizers? Do you like to nice servers who don't give you tude when you have special request? well then if so hit up the Lockdown! While they are known for their burgers I felt their appetizers were the star of the show. The mussels & fried pickles were some of the best I've ever had. The burger was good, but I kept thinking about all their other fried goodness. They also have pretty awesome specials so I think I'll be back for the wings. Also most importantly the service was pretty great and my friend didn't get yelled at for asking for a burger sauce to be on the side (cough kumas cough).
