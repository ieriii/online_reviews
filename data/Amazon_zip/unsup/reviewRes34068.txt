Yolk is my favorite South-Loop breakfast joint. It is always crowded, but me and my girlfriend are early risers, so it's usually not a big deal. They also have bar seating with quicker turnover. Anyways, the location is nice; you can take a stroll through the park afterwards to burn off all the calories you are going to eat. The service is friendly, but sometimes they get bogged down by the sheer number of customers. The food is really good, I haven't had anything I didn't like. One of my favorites is the Zamboni crepes, two huge crepes filled with eggs, ham, and spinach and topped with hollandaise sauce; it is so much food I usually take one crepe home and eat it the next day. The lemon poppyseed french toast is also excellent, and the strawberry orange juice is delicious. The buttermilk pancakes are a little run of the mill but they aren't bad by any means. The menu is giant, so you will want to come back and try some of everything. Not very cheap but not expensive either. --Cole T. http://www.labor-link.com
