In a word? Deliciousness. This is one restaurant that actually lives up to all the hype. This is not a fancy pants, white table linen restaurant, but is wonderful. I had the rigatoni in a cheesy tomato sauce with sausage, and it was wonderful. Sometimes sausage can overwhelm a dish, but it was perfectly balanced. I went for lunch with my mom, so of course I tried her chicken with chili paste, which was OUTSTANDING. It was not extremely spicy, and wass perfectly seasoned. I was almost jealous but mine was so good i couldn't even be upset. They also have a nice wine list, and cocktails made from prosecco and fruit juice. Yes this place is down to earth and is not even faking the funk pretending to be serving champagne cocktails. They keep it real. The only thing that was a bit strange was the music; it was a mix of '80s music, including Michael Jackson, Genesis, and all kinds of other stuff that I love dearly, but were kind of out of place in this cute little Italian restaurant. Definitely worth a visit.
