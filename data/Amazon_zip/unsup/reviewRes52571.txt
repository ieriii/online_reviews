I had a good experience here. Parking was a breeze - they have valet parking for a reasonable rate. I came in, because I had a coupon for "buy 1 get 1" dinner. I was impressed with their salad bar and non-meat options. The meats themselves were tasty and I'm hardly a meat lover. Service was outstanding. Although this restaurant is out of my price range, I will be happy to return if I come across another great coupon or promotion.
