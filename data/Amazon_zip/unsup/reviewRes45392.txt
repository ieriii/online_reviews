One evening, a bunch of friends were looking for a place to eat without a huge wait. So, while walking South Bound on Broadway from Briar, we noticed this Irish Pub.  From the moment we walked it, it was designed quite well. I am a fan of the wood on the walls. Just something about it!! We all sat in a booth. One person ordered beer and enjoyed it. The rest of us had water. Two of our group ordered the chicken curry. I ordered the Ahi tuna on a bed of spinach salad. Awesome!! The last person ordered pulled pork.  There were no complaints from any of us. One friend wanted me to comment that the restaurant is very environment friendly when it comes to take out boxes. He was extremely pleased with that as he loves to recycle.
