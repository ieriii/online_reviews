T plus 14 hours, and I'm still full. Fogo is f-ing amazing. I ate until I damn near ruptured my lower esophagus. What made things even tastier was that it was all on the drug rep company dime. Anyway, about the food! First of all, heed the advice of others: 1) Fast beforehand the day of and 2) Go light on the salad bar. The salad bar is very tempting with fresh salads and vegetables and yummy prosciutto and smoked salmon. I'm warning you, don't do it! Heed Cartman's advice: You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers. Marvin:, Ap-ee-tizer. Cartman:, This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry. On to the main event: The highlights are the Beef Ancho (prime rib eye), the Picahna (impeccably seasoned sirloin), and the Filet Mignon.  Among other sirloins, the Alcatra (top) is better than the Fraldinha (bottom), as you'd expect. The beef ribs and pork ribs are excellent. The pork tenderloin was a bit dry. The Cordeiro (lamb) was pretty good, as far as lamb goes, but I much prefer to load up on beef. The Frango (chicken drumsticks and chicken wrapped in bacon), and Linguica (pork sausage) were pretty good as well. For dessert, loosen your belt and pack in the molten chocolate cake served a la mode, and enjoy it with a cup of decaf. Then go home and pass out.
