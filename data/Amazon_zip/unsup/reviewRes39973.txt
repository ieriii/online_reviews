This place is not worth going to. Had the worst service at any restaurant. We had a party of 20 and tried to order 5 orders of kalbi and 3 bottles of OB. The waitress kept trying to make us order more and ask if anyone was Korean. We said No and she asked us to leave.  The many times I have eaten here, I have coped with their crappy service everytime. There should be no excuse for their lack of service when we were the only one's eating there. If you want real korean bbq try Woori Village.
