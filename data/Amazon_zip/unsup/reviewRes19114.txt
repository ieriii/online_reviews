I wanna try all of rick bayless' places. My gf and I went around 5:00pm on a week day (i think). We had to wait in line only about 30 minutes which was fine because we got to completely memorize the menu and also had a beer in line. I wanted to try each and every torta including the special of the day. I ended up getting the cubana and added an egg. The seating plan was only a little bit confusing and we did have to share a table with people we didn't know. Other than that it was fine. I wanted the churros to be awesomely amazing but they were just ok.
