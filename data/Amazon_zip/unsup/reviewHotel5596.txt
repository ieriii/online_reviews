full disclosure: i did not stay overnight here, i was here as a day visitor for a conference last week. moving on. so i ride my bike any time i need to get around this fine city, commute to work, what have you. i didn't really think twice when i hopped on my bike to get here on monday morning. well, about halfway there, i was like "hmm. where to lock up, where to lock up..." i wandered around the area trying to find a proper rack to no avail. i started to panic because i knew rahm was speaking and i make it a point to be as involved in this crazy political machine as possible. nothing. no racks! so, i rolled up, all sweaty and disheveled, to the bellhop and said, sir, please, i need help, where can i put this stupid thing?! do you have any bike racks!? he kindly responded "are you here for the conference? i can go ahead and take that for you!" and he valeted it. he valeted my bike in a jacket with epaulets. it was the greatest. and i even caught the rahm speech.  also, space was nice, soap in the bathrooms smelled nice, its a nice place, real first class establishment. mm mm mm.
