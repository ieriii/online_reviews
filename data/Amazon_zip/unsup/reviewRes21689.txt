last time i went we were celebrating a friend's birthday. $17 pitchers for top shelf margaritas? yes please. very strong and very delicious. the place was packed even at almost 9pm on a thursday night. without reservations we got a two seater in the back, but the floor was wet and it is a little tent-like back there. a wet floor in a restuarant, especially with rubber floor covering is never a good thing. safety hazard and electrical hazard? deducting one star for that. other than the above mentioned issues everything else was great. have been there a few times before and the food is always great. i can't recall any service issues and they definitely let us linger and finish our pitcher after we were done eating. looks like a good place for groups because there were a few there that night. food is authentic and delicious, priced appropriately, served by pleasant staff.
