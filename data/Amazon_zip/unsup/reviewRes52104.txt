My friend just arrived from Chicago and guess what he gave me? Yep, Gino's East Pizza! It's my 2nd time to try Gino's pizza. I was in Chicago last August and a fellow tourist told us to give it a try - the deep dish pizza. I like New York style pizza so I gave it a shot. First, this place is a tourist trap. Yep... Good thing we went to Hancock Building then gave us a pass to Gino's. So basically we didn't wait. I tell you, this place is pretty crowded - in a good and fun way. Secondly, don't overeat your complimentary bread... otherwise you won't finish your pizza like what happened to us. We had the medium size pizza and we only finished half of it. Interior is crazy. I mean... it looks dirty but not. There's no vandalism here. Bring a correction fluid. Verdict? I still prefer New York style pizza. Chicago style pizza is just too heavy. And yes, we took home the rest of the pizza. Deep dish pizza tastes great when it's sitting overnight ha!
