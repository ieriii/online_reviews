Dear. Mr. Pequod - One of my favorite places to go in the neighborhood over the last 5 years. But why skimp on your toppings lately? I love the outside caramelized part of your crust, but lately the crust seems to have grown while the toppings have slowly disappeared. Splash a little extra cheese on there for me. Give me a few more pieces of sausage, so my wife doesn't eat them all directly out of the pan. I will visit you more often if you do. I will come back and give you the stars you deserve. I promise. Yours in pizza, Scott PS: Your Jalapeno poppers are delicious.
