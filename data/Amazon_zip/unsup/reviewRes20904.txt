this is just a response to angela h. really, i used to work at coast, and i know who your "banned friend" is. you know why she was banned? because she bitched every time she ordered and tried to pull one over on us repeatedly. her final offense was calling and saying we delivered the wrong rolls and and when we said "okay we'll send you the correct rolls just give the driver back the incorrect ones" (which we do to confirm our mistake as opposed to just hand out expensive sushi) she said she'd thrown them in the trash. we told her to just give them back to the driver anyway, we didn't mind. and you know what she said "she threw a used tampon on them." so that is why we banned her because she was gross and a crazy liar. just admit you ate the sushi and you are grubbing for more sushi FOR FREE. glad i don't work there anymore or deal with all the tight-wad yuppie scum bags that treated me like a piece of crap.
