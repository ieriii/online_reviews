I enjoy the food and enjoy the fact that its pretty close to me. I give them 5 stars for their food during Brunch and only 4 stars for their regular menu. They have alot of meat substitues and while its tasty, I'm looking for vegetarian foods that don't rely on using items that pretend to be meats.
