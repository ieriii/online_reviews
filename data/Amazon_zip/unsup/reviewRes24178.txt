This place is fantastic! Brought my family here for dinner on the recommendation of a coworkers mother-in-law, who is Greek. The flaming cheese is both entertaining and delicious. Even my son, who is 13 and runs to the 'cheeseburger' persuasion, loved his meal. You can't miss here if you are a Greek food fan.
