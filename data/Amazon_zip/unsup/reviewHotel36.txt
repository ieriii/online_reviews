Great location for a good price. Book it directly on their website and get the AAA price for the best deal. Hotel has that old Chicago charm. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Bathroom appeared to have been updated in the past few years. 32" flat screen in the lowest cost room. (single queen) Was able to connect my laptop to it and watch videos. Could tell that the woodwork in the rooms was old, probably the original. But it was still in good condition and fit the building. They have some kind of incense/oil going in the lobby and it might be on the strong side for some people, but it didn't bother me. Continental breakfast is available at the Mike Ditkas next door for $5 a person. It isn't anything special but what's there is decent. Overall it's a very nice hotel. I dont need much for amenities above a clean room and comfy bed and this hotel fit that perfect. Free wi-fi is an excellent bonus. For the money, it was the best deal in town if you dont need 5 star accomodations. One quick note, during my stay in March 2011 the building next door was being torn down so the construction crews were working early weekday mornings. I'd expect that a new hotel is being built and would take some time once the demo is complete.
