I had an overall great experience at Geja's! Everything was delicious, the service was wonderful, and the atmosphere was great! The Sangria was awesome and knocked me off my ass. I really don't have anything negative to say about this place. Definitely a date/couple atmopshere, but could be fun with a small group of close friends... if you want to drop a bit of money. I will definitely go back!
