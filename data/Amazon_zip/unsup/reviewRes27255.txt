Mostly Hispanic families here for dinner on the Sunday night I visited, so I take that as a good sign of great food. I didn't notice any one dish that was ordered more than others, except that red meat in general was a popular choice. The menu is extensive - you can get just a few items (tacos, enchiladas, burritos) or a complete meal (meat, rice, and beans). I had the especial cazuela, which is sliced ribeye steak in a sauce with with grilled with onions, poblano peppers, and panela cheese - so good! Breakfasts are $5-7 and lunch/dinner is $8-12. FYI - there's a tight parking lot that's free (get your ticket validated) around the corner, but it only fits 15-20 cars.
