Tonight was my second time at Rev. Brew Co. and this time I was in the upstairs portion of the restuarant, which I have to say I was really impressed with the Millwork (which I understand is relatively new). It's quite beautiful and gives a great atmosphere to the place along with the lighting. I have to say that everything I have had here is fantastic. The Bacon Fat Popcorn is a must have and the Pork Jowl Ragout is phenomonal and probably my favorite thing on the menu (of course who can resist Endive and Pork Cheeks!) I have only two complaints from my visit here tonight. The first is the bar was VERY slow getting our drinks out to us, however our server may have been a bit green and can probably be chalked up to that, the second faux pas was my dish - the Hanger Steak came out of the kitchen cold. I don't mean luke warm, I mean cold like they had kept it in the fridge instead of under the heat lamps after it came off the grill. BUT, I simply voiced my complaint to a server, he took it back to the kitchen and warmed it up and it came back delicious albeit slightly more done than medium-rare as they recommend. Nonetheless, it was fantastic and I ate every last bite. Bonus round for Rev.Brew, they were extremely apologetic about the incident and AFTER they returned with the final bill, without another word or anything, our server apologized once more and told us they bought my last drink for the error and making me wait longer than necessary for my meal. This is the kind of service that is above and beyond for such a error and was such a welcomed gesture that I will be sure to visit their establishment many more times in the future. Kudos Rev. Brew, you did right by me tonight both gastronomically and in customer service! PLEASE keep up the good work. D
