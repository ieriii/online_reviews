Hi Meli! It's me, your biggest fan. I've told your owner I want to copy his business plan, but not to worry...I'll just keep coming back, mainly with out of town guests who want a great brunch. Thank you for the amazing baked oatmeal with berries or other specials of the day... how do you make the brown sugar on top look like the top of a creme brulee desert? I bought a food torch just to figure it out!!! Your frittatas, omelets, skillets also make me cheer! Complete with a juice bar and fantastic coffee and honey butter and fresh jams......I have only had one bad meal here when the taste of my favorite farmland omelette was off....they told me it was because they made the (sun) dried tomatoes themselves....tasted pungent and old... ....all I need is better parking (we always find a spot around the corner on Jackson) and less wait time (I go during the week day at odd hours to get my fix....they are busy busy busy on weekends and weekday lunches).
