My husband and I received a gift card here as a wedding gift. It took a couple of months to get a reservation but the wait was worth it. I think we can both say that it was an amazing experience and the food was phenomenal. Its impossible to describe what the meal was like unless you have experienced it yourself. If you are celebrating something special and you have the cash to do it, I would recommend going to this one of a kind place. The meal was unforgettable!
