My beloved and I are in search of delicious pizza. We have drafted a pizza review spreadsheet with a numerical rating system. We were hungry and Piece was up for review.  We ordered: a white pizza (EVOO, garlic, mozz, parm), topped w/ goat cheese, spinach, roasted red pepper, and tomatoes. The lowdown, from my perspective: Piece sells "design your own pies". This means diners are required to select their own pizza style and toppings. While this method allows for more versatile pizzas, I prefer restaurant-designed pies - ones that have been crafted by in-house professional pizza makers. I find that this is the best method for obtaining the most delicious, well-crafted pizza possible. I think Piece's DIY/a-la-carte method resulted in an overpriced pizza.  Although Piece's pizza was tasty - the chunky goat cheese was a particularly good addition and the other ingredients were fresh - the crust lacked the soft puffiness that I prefer. Also, the middle portion of the pizza was pretty soggy and there was an absence of seasoning and overall flavor. I'd definitely eat Piece's pizza again, but with so many other Chicago pizza options I wouldn't necessarily request a return visit.
