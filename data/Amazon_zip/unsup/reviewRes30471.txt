Most arrogant place, we asked for two, they told us there was a 20 minute wait even though there were at least 3 tables of 2 available. We get their whole deal, make people wait so you create a line outside and creat the illusion of fake demand. Please don't patronize a business that cares more about themselves than their customers. P.S- the wait is not worth the bland food that tries to sell you on the organic angle
