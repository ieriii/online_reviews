We were treated to a "thank you" dinner by some friends for dog sitting. Boy did we get the good end of the deal. We were seated outside in a corner table with padded benches and umbrella covering. The food was excellent. The appetizers, the meats/poultry and the sides.  The Chicago size portions were ample and reasonably priced. The service was spot on from the hostess to our servers, bartender and many wait staff.  I lived in the area when this was Tsunami. It is a good thing they have gutted the place and it is completely fresh and beautiful inside and out. No pressure - just a beautiful experience. I would recommend to anyone who isn't vegan.
