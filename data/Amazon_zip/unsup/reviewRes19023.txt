Showed up at The Gage after confirming that the fb game we wanted to watch was on....only to find out once we got that there, that they didn't carry it. After searching for parking, paying for parking and then walking 3 blocks we were more than disappointed.  What started out bad ended very positive. The hostesses were extremely apologetic and the manager Pat was also very gracious. He asked us to wait while he found other places nearby that were carrying the game. He came back to us with some options (of course, none were as good as The Gage, lol). He also reimbursed us for parking. He obviously went well above and beyond what he could have done or what would have been "acceptable" customer service.  This was not our first time at The Gage, but we were not "regulars" either. We had always had a great time and great meals there and we will for sure go back.
