First of all- this hotel is HUGE! I found a cheap room- $79 on Hotwire, while checking in, they wanted to upgrade me to a city view room for $20- I declined and received one facing the Wrigley Building anyhow. The room itself was great even though there was a slight odor (coming from the fridge- Do Not Open??). The downside is that you have to pay for watching TV- 4.99 a show. You can review news headlines, but that's about all- a little cheesy if you ask me!!
