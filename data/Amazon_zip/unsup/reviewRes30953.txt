Ambience: Very trendy crowd but incredibly LOUD. I'm always a fan of a "happening" restaurant scene, but I could barely hear my date. Food: excellent Asian/American fusion although not as mind-blowing as I had been expecting. Obviously very expensive. Drinks: Creative and interesting. Nutshell: Better for a loud bday crowd who are willing to splurge!
