I wanted to wash away my sorrow with food, so we called up Miller Pizza on a Thursday afternoon for pick up. I ordered a large pizza, half sausage and half green peppers and onions. The person manning the counter was very nice and handed me my pizza twenty minutes after my call. The location itself was nice, but it lent itself more as a take out/delivery place due to size and the type of seating.  I immediately rushed home to try out their pizza. The pizza was extremely thin crust, relatively light (compared with home run inn, rosati's, etc.) The sausage pizza itself was very good. My only criticisms are that it was a little salty and a little expensive for the thinness of the pizza ($16). But, one of the more decent thin crust pizzas I've had, especially in the area. We will definitely return, expecially if we desire a pizza that won't over stuff.
