I am seriously. In love. Tried this place on a groupon with my boyfriend-- we rarely get to dine out for "fine" dining. The salad bar? endless. Cheeses, salads, dressings, sides that never end. My huge plus? Portabello mushrooms!!!! But as for the meat. I love the whole meat men experience. Service was great. Huge fan of bacon wrapped chicken and the different arrays of steak. Tender, juicy, just delicious. I'm a slow eater which is great for me. I was able to eat over a long period of time without my food growing cold, and able to try a different variety of meats.... i just wish i had asked for more plantains!!! they were so delicious. I will definitely be back for more, Texas de Brazil. I loved the ambience. Great for a date and some intimacy.
