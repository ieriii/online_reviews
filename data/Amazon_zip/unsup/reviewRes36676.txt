Lurrrves this place! It's a hidden gem of a restaurant nestled into a block of other little hole-in-the-wall stores in Edgewater...you'll probably miss it if you aren't paying attention when you walk by. [But, I have them deliver way more than we're in the restaurant anyway, so hey.] I LOVE their Crazy Basil Fried Rice. Any of their appetizers are great--tend to do the Golden Triangle (tofu) and the Crab Rangoon most frequently. Their Thai iced tea is to die for! I usually tell them to hold the ice so I can make it last longer. ;-) Their delivery guy is SUCH a hottie!
