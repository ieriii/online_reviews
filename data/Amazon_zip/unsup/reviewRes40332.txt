Wow! This place is awesome! We went there on a Saturday afternoon around 4. It was just beginning to get busy. We sat down at the 2 top right next to the door, and ordered a couple of beers (Leffe and St Ambroise Oatmeal Stout). Their predinner food menu was limited, but we ordered the olives and the rabbit pate with homeade giardinara. Both of these items were very tasty. After another round of beers, there was a shift change, so we closed out with our server. Unfortunately there was some confusion and our new server didn't attend to us, so I had to talk to our previous server. She apologized and had the manager take care of us (she sent over free shots of bourbon). Nice! My girlfriend doesn't drink bourbon, so more for me!   New server was very pleasant and took care of us immediately when she was made aware of our situation. We then ordered the Kobe meatballs with polenta and the fried clam bellies with brioche and a slaw remoulade.  Those clams were some of the tastiest bites I've eaten in a while. You have to try this if you go here. The flavors combined perfectly. And the meatballs were pretty good. They were a little overcooked, but the polenta was some of the creamiest, tastiest I've ever had.  We're definitely going back soon. But I'm guessing this place is going to get hot real quick. So check it out before it gets out of control. Lastly, the prices are very reasonable, especially the food. Most of their appetizers are under $10 and most of the entrees are under $25.
