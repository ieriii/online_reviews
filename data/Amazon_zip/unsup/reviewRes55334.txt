Long wait to get in, usually a good sign.Service wasn't very good.Portions are very large and they are pretty pricey.The food wasn't that good. Pita Inn is FAR better, at a fraction of the cost.I had the Soltani, which is a combination of Barg and Koubideh. I added Chenjeh kabab to the combo. Very disappointed in all three of them. I could have gone to a steakhouse and had much better results than the meal presented to me at Noon O Kabab.Ordered the Dolmeh for my gf, and it was good. She had a vegetarian meal, Adass Polo, with chick peas and rice. It was alright. Kind of bland, but better than the kababs I ordered. If Kabab is in the name of the restaurant, it should be better than a vegetarian option on the menu - it should be the best thing on the menu.Large portions of subpar food isn't going to win me over, especially at the inflated prices.I will not be going to Noon O Kabab again, nor would I ever recommend it to anyone.
