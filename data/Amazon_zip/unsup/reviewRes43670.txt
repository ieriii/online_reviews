So this was another of my MIni-me & I's sunday explorations. So the only thing i didn't like was that i didn't realize you serve your own utensils and your own coffee, water, etc. (that was our first time there) beyond that i thought the food was really good. We had to try the french toast since it had such good reviews & it didn't disappoint. It was warm and toasted just enough to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside- it also had a hint of orange. Mini-me loved her breakfast sandwich.
