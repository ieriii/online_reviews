I was excited to try this restaurant, mostly because it's something a bit different on the Clark strip. We went on a Thursday night, and had no issues getting a table. The pros is that the service was great, I enjoy boiled peanuts that are given to each table, and my food was yummy. However... My boyfriend came up with the idea of plate size meal size. We figure, the food should be almost as big as the plate. And then if you want to charge a lot of money, that's fine, but at least we know what we're in for. I got the bean salad with a side of coleslaw. I didn't want anything too heavy, and I (gasp) don't eat seafood. The salad was so tiny in the very middle of the plate and I ate it in no time at all. It was $8, which is not cheap for a salad that would not even fill up a small bowl. My boyfriend got the jalapeno gator sausage, which was basically served like a hot dog, rolled up in bread. It was good, but nothing to write home about. All in all, my meal was tasty, but I would have been happy if it was double- or triple- the size. We may try big jones again in the future, but not for a while.
