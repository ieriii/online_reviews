Love a great gastropubs, so I finally went to check out this place, based on all of the amazing reviews, and was immensely disappointed.The food was just OK, nothing that I was drooling over or wishing that I could have more of (and the portions are small). We got the:the meatballs and polenta (probably the best of anything)green salad - very salty and boringgoat sausage - tasty, but the flavor combos were strangepretzel and cheese - alright, but just a standard bar dishsweatbread - the meat was weird and fatty/fluffy By far the best part of our dinner was the drinks... good selection of beers and cocktail/whisky. Overall, would not go back for the food or go out of my way for the drinks. Got seated right away on a Saturday at about 5:30 so that was good.. and the tab was about $100 for 2 people for dinner and drinks... just not worth it.
