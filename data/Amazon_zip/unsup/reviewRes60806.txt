My buddy and I stopped in for a couple beers last night. A couple had just gotten up from the bar and we sat down when another guy came over and told us that these were his seats. We said "no, we're sitting here." He states that the bartender was reserving them. She came oer and said "oh, sorry, I was holding those seats for them." What kind of service is this when even the door hostess told us that it was open seating when we came in and she was even bringing us MENUS to these seats as all this transpired! Shame on the bartender. We turned to the bartender and said that they can have their seats and we would be going somewhere else. The worst part was as we were leaving I turned around as we were walking out, the one guy is shouting obscenities, and the female bartender that I then guessed was friends of his was just laughing as she was serving him drinks. We work in the industry and know better. Good service is easy to find in this neighborhood, but definitely not at the LOCKDOWN.
