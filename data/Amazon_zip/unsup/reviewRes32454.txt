I've been here twice now, both times with five or six people. Both times have been fantastic. Ordered apps, and about four or five entrees family style. PLENTY of food this way and you get to try everything! Though eating with my hands and bread took some skill growth it was overall quite enjoyable, gives you even more food experience. We ordered a combo of veggies and meat. Both were delicious! The Spicy lentils and mild lamb were probably the best. Others liked the beef. Those little samosa like appetizers with the spicy sauce were also fantastic. Service was pretty attentive too. I appreciate servers that take my order and then leave me alone, though. And I also appreciate having time to talk to people between appetizers while sipping some wine (though Ethiopian wine is a little too sweet). Overall, this place was highly satisfactory and I will definitely go back.
