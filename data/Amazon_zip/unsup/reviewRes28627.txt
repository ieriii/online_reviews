My girlfriend and I recently went here and had a wonderful experience. We were late for our reservation because our hotel gave away our room earlier that evening and we were left to scramble for a place where we could get ready. We were in a very foul mood after the hotel episode but decided to come to dinner and not let it ruin our evening. The restaurant let us in although they were done with their last seating for the night. We told our waitress that we would rush to get our order in and she (Nancy who was awesome!) immediately put us at ease and told us to relax that they would stay as long as they needed. Our dinner was fantastic, the restaurant was trendy yet comfortable and Nancy recommended a bottle of wine that was perfect with our dinner! The icing on the cake was when we told her we would need to call a cab when we returned from the restroom and when we came out Nancy was literally on the street holding one for us. They took what started out as a horrible night and completely turned it around for us. I look forward to coming here again on my next visit!
