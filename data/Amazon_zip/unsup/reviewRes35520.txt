At $45, the Sunday brunch better be good, right? It is! Shaw's has the best brunch I have ever eaten anywhere, hands down. Besides traditional breakfast fare that includes an omelet and waffle station, Shaw's features its specialties - seafood, especially crab. There is a cold station that includes large shrimps, sushi (both shrimp and spicy tuna), lox (both regular and smoked salmon), oysters on the half shell, and sliced sections of large crab legs. The way they cut the legs makes it very easy to pop out a big, delicious chunk of tasty crab meat. There is also a long hot station that includes snow crab legs and claws (yum yum), french fried jumbo shrimp, and miniature crab cakes with good pieces of meat. Also tried the baked salmon that was perfectly cooked, along with broccoli topped lightly with cheese mixed with lobster bits. Outstanding. There is much more as well that I did not try - au gratin potatoes, roast beef sliced upon request, and soup, to name a few. And, there is a great dessert station that has a mix of breakfast friendly sweets like fruit bowls containing mango, kiwi, and cantalope topped with blueberries and raspberries. But they also have fantastic lunch desserts such as creme brulee (had to have two!) and something in a tall narrow glass that tastes similar to tiramisu, with perfectly textured cream. The atmosphere is classy and the main dining room has a 1940's feel, disconnected from the outside windows and with a soft big band sound playing in the background. Service was top notch, and they were quick to refill dishes on the buffet lines. Shaw's should pay me for writing such a glowing review but this restaurant merits every praise.
