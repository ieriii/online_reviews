My boyfriend and I recently went here for dinner and I must say everything was perfect. He did not tell me that we were going here but when we got there I could not wait to sit down and eat. It was a special occasion and right when the server cam over he said something right away. Which of course made me feel even more happy. The food and service were both amazing. We both had 2 of the specials, which were both amazing. When dessert was brought out they even wrote with chocolate on the plate....I know it's not a hard thing to do but it really make the evening even more perfect. After 2 bottles of wine...a couple apps, dinner, dessert and a wonderful evening on the patio we both left feeling completely happy. I will be back very soon.
