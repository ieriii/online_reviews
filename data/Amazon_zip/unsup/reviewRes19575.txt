I heart The Gage. Actually, I heart British-inspired comfort food in general, so my love for this place isn't really surprising. I'd been to The Gage before quite a while ago (with a good friend who happens to be a fellow Yelper) and this time was just as good as the last. Service was prompt and friendly - though we were left without coffee refills. Which is a shame, because the coffee is actually pretty good. Anyway, I've been feeling under the weather so I was hoping to find something spicy enough to give my misbehaving sinuses a stern talking-to. The Fire-Roasted Chicken sandwich, fortunately, did just that. I also tried the Chicken and Giant Noodle soup - which was delicious, and they certainly weren't lying about the giant noodle. It was, quite literally, one huge flat pappardelle-style noodle. I like that kind of unique little twist on something as seemingly simple as chicken soup. The beer/wine/liquor list is extensive as well. I'm not usually a beer drinker, but I'd make an exception for some of the entries on the list here as many of them sound delicious. So even though The Gage is a bit pricey, in my opinion it's worth it. I'm looking forward to my next visit.
