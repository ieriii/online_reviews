Good food, less than perfect waitstaff. I typically get the chicken which is really, really good. They have great appetizers too! It is great for takeout when you can be bothered to cook and very convenient. I would only hope they would train their waitstaff more on the alcohol serving and knowing what wines are what and what brands they carry.
