I really love the atmosphere here! The menu is fun and the food is great. The rock shrimp appetizer is awesome, and they have great rolls! Service is always great, which is impressive in such a busy restaurant. The kitchen is also extremely accommodating ( I have been several times while pregnant). Love this place!
