I heart La Pasadita!!!! This place is awesome. When I walk through the door, I feel like I've transported to Mexico. Though I admit its strange to feel like a foreigner when I'm a block away from my apartment, but what can I say, I love to travel. Soo...the details: I've been to both the walk-in place and the sit-down across the street numerous times. The only things I've ever had are the steak tacos and chips/salsa....and they are amazing. At first I thought it was because it was 2am and I'd had a few drinks, but I've been for dinner and it is just good. The chips and salsa are especially great, but you have to go to the sit-down to get them. Service is fast and nice. Ambiance is..well...divey and mexican. Who doesn't love that? 5 stars for La Pasadita. Can't wait for my next trip!
