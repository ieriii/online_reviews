I had a slice of sausage pizza here. Thought the deep dish looked very good, though I only had time to get a regular slice of pizza. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it wasn't bad, nor was the best. Very spacious eating area, pretty chill and relaxed right after work on the weekdays. I didn't think there was enough sauce on the pizza slice. It's a personal like, but I tend to go heavy on the pizza sauce. The cheese was very flavorful in that you could actually see the herbs that they sprinkled on top. My only complaint would've been that it wasn't hot enough (temperature wise). Perhaps the warmers should be a bit warmer.... Then again, if you get pizza here made to order, it would probably solve this issue. If you're from New York, this is by no means a new york slice. For what I paid for a small drink and a slice, around 4 something.... it was a bit pricey compared to other places that I've gone to where the slices were much bigger, hotter, and saucier. It's a good piece of pie... not the the best in my opinion. But I recommend to any pizza lover out there.
