First things first... the food was great. At a table of 10, not a-one of us had any complaints about the food. Here's the shady thing though- and it was frustrating, cause we had great food and great service- there was a large MISC charge hidden in the middle of the bill. When i asked about it- it was the gratuity. Of course a restaurant usually adds gratuity for a large table, but be up front. It felt like they assumed most people (who had been drinking wine and in a large group) would not double check the bill.  It left a sour taste. and after a great meal.
