This place took me back to a summer visit in Nicaragua. It is authentic and delicious. Splurge and get the gallo pinto (mix of rice and beans). Love the sugary plantains. My friend had the oatmeal shake and said it was a meal in itself. The shakes are quite large; I recommend sharing. Tables are seated close together. It was cozy with a table for two.
