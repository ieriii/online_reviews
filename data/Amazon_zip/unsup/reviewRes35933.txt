I never heard about this place until someone told me to meet them here for dinner. Everything was delicious!!! I love how they bring out the Peking duck and cut it right at the table. It was delicious. They bring out these rice pancakes that you fold and taste amazing. Definitely have to try the egg rolls and soup. I came with a group of 8, and it was $20 a person.
