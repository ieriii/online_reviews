Came for the margaritas on half price night... stumbled out a few hours later. We started with the lime margaritas on the rocks (my true test of a good margarita) and one sip later I felt drunk and I knew this place was golden. Next was a pitcher of frozen raspberry margs. Those went down nice and easy. They have a ton of flavors of margaritas and the service was very friendly. The menu looked good and I can't wait to come back for a meal (which looking back on the morning after would have been a good idea.) In terms of the atmosphere, the back patio seems more for a fun crowd while the front room is a little more cozy and intimate.
