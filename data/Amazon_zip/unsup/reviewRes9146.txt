This was a pleasant suprise. A friend recommended this place and I'm glad he did. I played it safe by ordering the shrimp and chicken skewers with combo rice. I finished with a dessert that was a small long donut soaked in honey. It was very sweet but, sooo good, I would eat a dozen if I didn't fear a visit from the FAT man. I plan on returning soon.
