Definitely a good little restaurant up in Lakeview. Really cool atmosphere and drink menus. My wife and I ordered the meat platter for two, which was a ton of food for the price. The skirt steak was definitely the best piece of that. Chicken and ribs were also very good. Could have used a little bit more sauce but that is a small complaint. Not the easiest place to get to if you are relying on the L. Definietly look into the Lincoln bus or use the meter spaces.
