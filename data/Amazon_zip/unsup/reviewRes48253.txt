puerco. i love it. went here for brunch one day on recommendation of many people and let me tell ya - we were not disappointed!! the staff is so friendly, the coffee is delicious, and i just can't stop dreaming of the maple.bacon.  WOW!!!! i was literally dreaming of it until the next time we went back. the bloodymarys there are quite delicious as well!  as for food, the wine poached eggs are great as is the lamb dish! i'm not usually a lamb fan but it was really tasty there! i want one of the pig paintings for my apartments. i love htis place. i can't wait to go back for dinner.
