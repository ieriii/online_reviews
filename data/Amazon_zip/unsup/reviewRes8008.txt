I love eating here.... if you are looking for a great pizza... you cant go wrong... its very good. On my last trip we ordered the eggplant as an appetizer and it was fantastic. However, we both found something strange about the dish... they serve a large portion of eggplant with seven small pieces of bread. ??? It did not stop us from eating the rest of the eggplant but the portion of bread did not match the amount of eggplant served. I've had several of the pizzas and the Prosciutto e Rucola would have to be one of my favorites. On my last trip I had the Bianco Nero... while truffle on anything makes a dish amazing.. this was just ok. I am not sure I would order it again. The pizza was still good... just not fantastic.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.... hit this spot for a great pizza.
