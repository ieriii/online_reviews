This grocery store is well worth the expensive prices. Everything I've tried here is great. It's way too pricey for your everyday shopping, but perfect for special occasions. Last summer I picked up some food for my girlfriend and I here and we had a picnic at Ravinia. It was a great evening, thanks to Fox & Obel!
