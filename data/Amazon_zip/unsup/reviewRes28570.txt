I ate a lot last night at Frontera. The food was so delicious that my stomach kept expanding, allowing for maximum intake. Well done Bayless. Things to keep in mind: They don't take reservations except for large groups I believe. I would suggest dining during the week if you don't want to wait for hours on end just to get a table. We went on a Wednesday night around 8:30pm and we only waited for 30 minutes or so. The bar area is a pretty cool spot with Mexican artwork popping out from all over. The margaritas were strong and tasty. Once we were brought to our table we had a pretty good idea of what we wanted (as we spent quite awhile googling at the menu while waiting). Try the Ceviche for sure. We started with the Trio, Trio, Trio which is a sampling of Ceviche Fronterizo, Ceviche Yucateco and Coctel de Atun Tropical. All were full of flavor, and I especially enjoyed the Fronterizo as it was very refreshing and full of Cilantro. Might I add that their Guacamole is rather tasty and bursting with flavor, so order that too. Then we tried Sopes Rancheros and seriously...order this. Just do it and don't ask any questions. I didn't know what the heck a Masa Boat was, but I sure was willing to try it out. The shredded beef just melts in your mouth. For dinner I had this delectable smokey pork with pineapples. Sweet and smokey is the way to go. The duck was also very flavorful and their silky winter mole was amazing! I love the fact that their menu is always changing. Versatility never seemed to appealing.
