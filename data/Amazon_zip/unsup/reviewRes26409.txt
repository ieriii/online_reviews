you always want to see the actual owner at the place that you visit. But the man at the helm of S.I. does you one better: he himself gives you a compliomentary platter of egg rolls and ice tea just to make your wait for the table more enjoyable (and we didn't even have a reservation). then, he promptly checked on us every ten minutes or so just to make sure we were all right. A cinic would say: he smelled a potential new regular customer and tried to hook me up. A romantic would say: that's saigon of the yore in its fullest (even though the owner's family is from Hanoi). I say: whenever waiting for a table becomes part of overall enjoyable experience, it's a gem. Two downers: the Simply It Beef was so frigging good (better than most Kobe or Wigyi in the French restaurants on Chicago), that other items on the menu that I tried kind of sucked at least in comparison. And, what's up with the name. The restaurant's name should be such that a person would be easily able to say: I am at ..., or see you at ...I am at Simply It really blows (and not in a good way).
