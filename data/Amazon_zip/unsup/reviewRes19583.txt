DAMMMNNNN YOUUU RICKKK BAYYYLLLEEEESSSSSSS!!!!! I HATE LINES. I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE EM. Did I mention I hate Lines? ERggghh... how i do.... the first time we went here.... there was barely a line, we waited for about 10 minutes, i can deal with that Mr. Bayless.... I order some of your fantastic goodies and I am hooked for LIFFEEE!! ARRRGGGGG!! Now i have another line to wait in........... Your Wednesday Pork Belly (no two finer words) Torta made me cry when it was over..... Your Hot Chocolate is less hot chocolate and more melted chocolate.... with the perfect amount of spice. Your churros make me never want to go to a carnival again. Damn you Rick Bayless. How I want to hate you. You're not mexican.... Mexican's must hate you for doing their food better than they can. You're an imposter. But you're the real deal. And this place, this is a godsend. Chipotle on the Mario Mushroom.
