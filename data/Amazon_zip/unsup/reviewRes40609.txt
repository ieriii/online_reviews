Okay seriously why are there 3 restaurants with the same name right next to each other. Which one is the best? I don't know, so far I've been to both of the ones on the west side of Ashland. Both are your classic seedy late night burrito joints. I would definitely suggest ordering to go. The burritos at the La Pasadita closest to division on the west side was definitely the best of the two, haven't been to the one on the East side yet. I suppose I should probably be embarrassed if at some point in the next year I can lay claim to having a detailed & passionate opinion about which of the 3 La Pasadita's is the best.
