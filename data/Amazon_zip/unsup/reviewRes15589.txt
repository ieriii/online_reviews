....so where is the entrance to this place? that's right, it's a hidden gem, well not really, but try finding this place and i guarantee, you will be surprised. at least that's how my group and i felt. expecting a pretty door or some sort, we went up and down the block, passing this bright mural, only to realize...that mural-painted wall IS the entrance! we enter, and it's dark and dim, pretty cool atmosphere. we are seated to cozy, high back chairs, where only a candle is lit per table. the drink menu is so full, you won't know where to begin! but i went with the server's choice (which was not on the menu). he described the taste as a "paradise vacation". i fell for it, but unfortunately, my expectations went too high, he persuaded me well, but it was more of a "casual trip". i guess i was expecting more sweetness, this was more like rum mixed with some random fruit juice at any grocery store. sadly disappointed.  the food was not all that great, and i am sad to say that too, i wanted it to taste good. ordered cheese and sausage and a bowl of spiced nuts. sounds fancy, but no where near that level to the tongue.  perhaps i should have chose my own drink, i am sure the others taste up to par with their menu descriptions. would come again for sure, but definitely won't be needing any snacks to pair with my drink. four stars for the unique atmosphere, it felt cozy and intimate to have a sweet and chill conversation with my two friends. and that made the night fun.
