The Allerton is an old hotel with a new look. It was redesigned in 2008. A redesign is great for changing the color palette, putting in a hip new chair, and even adding (not free) wifi. That said, walls can't be moved, and floor plans won't change. The short doorways, and single room with more hallway than bedroom are charming to me. I like when old meets new. Free wine from 4-6 is legit, and the location is ideal for just about anything. I wouldn't consider myself a hotel connoisseur, but I really liked this place. The price was right when we booked ($115 for a Friday), but once I'm in the demographic that The Allerton is marketing to I'll be willing to pay the full price. - Free wifi only in the lobby - 24 hour fitness - not the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in, but certainly not bad.
