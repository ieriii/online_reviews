The trick is to come before 6 pm, folks! I have tried several times to come to the Chicago Diner after 6pm, and I finally got in without a wait. The menu is pretty large--I'd love to come back for breakfast. They also have a decent amount of sides--u'd be surprised. I was debating between the "chorizo" nachos, bean burger, and gyro. I went with the gyro--see pics. I also got the side of sweet potato fries. The pita bread was fantastic and so were the fries and homemade tzaziki sauce. Compared to a "real" gyro, there was way less "meat", but it was still a good imitation. My sweet potato fries were great! Kind of small and thin, but nothing to complain about. My friend got the sweet potato quesadilla which looked amazing and non-greasy. You can either get gluten free cheese or regular dairy cheese-nice that they give you an options. Our server Miles was super nice, and by the time 6:30 rolled around , it was packed! I will come back again and maybe try a shake!
