I thought about giving The Bongo Room 4 stars, but after you eat at Tweet, you will understand. Tweet is hard to beat when it comes to brunch in the city. Back to Bongo Room though, I have to say the staff was really great, the place is really cute, and the menu is quite different than anything I've ever seen. I had the Vegetarian Crossaint Sandwich and while it was ok and I certainly finished it, a similar sandwich at Tweet is 10X better. It kind of lacked flavor. We also tried the Red Velvet Pancakes. Now, as delicious as this was, it was just way too much of a dessert for me to want at breakfast/brunch. I mean, if you're in to that kind of thing, you'll love it. Oh, I did love how they served roasted potatoes rather than your typical hashbrown. Just like the 3 star rating suggests, this place is A-OK. While it was nothing to get overly excited about after my first visit, I look forward to going back and trying something else on the menu. But really, I'm a Tweet Let's Eat snob, so we'll see...
