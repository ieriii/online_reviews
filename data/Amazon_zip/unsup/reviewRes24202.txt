rating: 5/5 date of last visit: 2 months ago Lao Sze Chuan was recommended to me by a family member well over a year ago. After looking it up, I figured it was worth a shot. What has followed is some of the most delicious Chinese food I have ever had the pleasure of having. I have now been there five times and have been thrilled with the food every time. Standouts are the Beef with dried chilies (it is a beef dish--dry with TONS of dried red chilies--no gravy--and fiery hot. :) ) and chicken with 3 chilies (also fiery hot and delicious.) I have been there on both weekdays and weekends and while the service on the weekends is OK (food is generally quick but they don't always check on you that often--with all that spice the water needs to be refilled often!), on the weekdays when the volume is slightly lower, it is always very good. They are very nice, pleasant and quick with recommendations. Decor is pretty functional; this is not about the location (it's in a strip mall, for god's sake) but solely about the food. And good food it is. Do yourself a favor and check this place out.
