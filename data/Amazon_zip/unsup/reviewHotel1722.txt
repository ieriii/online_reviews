I've stayed here twice when visiting Chicago with boyfriends and it's been awesome. Each room is totally different, very stylish and mod, and still inexpensive. They're on the small side, but generally, when I'm at a hotel, I've found that I spend very little time in it so it didn't bother me. I also have to say that I really love Kimpon hotels, and I've stayed at one in Dallas and thought it was quite nice too. I will say that on the downside, the walls are quite thin. I can sleep through anything, but those of you that can't, watch out!
