Holy yumminess. I'm not a vegan or veggie, but I love this place just the same. I've gone so many times now I've tried most everything on the menu. Most amazing items, in order of amazingness are: 1. chocolate chip cookie dough peanut butter shake (dairy free but still oh so much joyous sugar and calories) 2. Quinoa Avacado Tostadas tied with the Pulled Pork tied with the Eggs Ranchero (if going for bfast or brunch) 3. The MASSIVE burrito that you would have no idea has no meat tied with the sweet potato fries. My favorite thing to do is get an order of the teriyake potstickers sauce to dip the fries in. Because ketchup just wont do. 4. Mmmmm grilled cheese and tomato soup 5. Anything else on the menu. It's all really good. I haven't had the Reuben, but I've heard that too is awesome.
