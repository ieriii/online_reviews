The best pizza I have EVER had! Wonderful. I had a recommendation from a friend and the concierge recommended it as the best pizza. I was with 3 pretty good size men. We were full with one medium pizza. Ordering the person at the register told us that is all we would need. Listen to them! It is very filling. So thick and cheesy. Very highly suggested. The wait was a little long. Got there about 5 on a Monday and had to wait about 30-45 minutes. You do preorder your pizza, so once you are seated it does not take long to get to your table. Kind of makes up for the wait time.
