We had some lackluster visits the past couple months. Mainly due to one waitress in particular. the burgers are super good, so i keep coming back on Tuesdays (half-off burger night) and it's really busy, I totally get it. But whatever.. So anyway.. our last visit there was super improved.. due to a new waitress! Ashley! She was attentive and friendly and being a picky vegetarian, i made my own burger, and everything I asked for came on it. It was delightful. If Ashley's working, you're going to have a great experience. I might be a little soft on the name, though. Whatever. You don't know me.
