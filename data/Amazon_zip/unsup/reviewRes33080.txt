Came here the morning/afternoon after a night out. It was recommended to me by a few sources. Let me warn you, do not come here starving because you will have to wait at least 30 minutes for a table unless you know someone. Which lucky for me, I did and only had to wait about 10 minutes before being seating. Our server came over shortly after and said hi and asked if we would like any drinks, and we started to browse through the menu. The place was packed and it took a little time for our server to come back around to grab our order. I ordered the Pancake Combo and my friend ordered Biscuits and Gravy with fruit on the side. Our meals did not take long to come out, I'd say about 15 minutes. My combo came with two pancakes, two sausages, two slices of bacon, and eggs, which I had scrambled. Everything was hot and tasty. The sausages were huge and delicious, the eggs and bacon were tasty too. The pancakes though, were not the best. Don't get me wrong, they were good and I like them, but I'm kind of a pancake snob. They were not fluffy or light, and just left me wanting a little more from them.  I also snagged a bit of my friends Biscuits and gravy which were very good! Overall I would say that Yolk is a good breakfast joint that anyone can enjoy. The service is decent and the food is good, and you can enjoy eating your breakfast and catch up with your pals.
