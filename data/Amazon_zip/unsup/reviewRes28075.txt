OK so I dined in just the other day and the pizza was way better than when I carried out previously. Would I care to go again? Not really but I wouldn't think "gross" if I had to go again. The crust tastes a lot better fresh out of the oven than after it sits for a little while. The pizza still has very little sauce/cheese which leaves mostly bread to eat. That is not my kind of pizza which is why it still only gets a 3.
