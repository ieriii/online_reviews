Although the food was great, the service was mediocre, and the management was disappointing in their responsiveness. I was at Mastro's with a large party for a special occasion. The server spilled oil from a potato dish on my neck and shirt, ruining the shirt. I wiped my neck off at the time but didn't notice that the shirt was so heavily stained until my companions told me so outside the restaurant. When I spoke to the manager on duty (David), he was uniquely rude and condescending. David said that I was hassling him and that the fact that I called him after I left was weird and then he proceeded to hang up the phone on me after attempting to belittle me. As our party had been at Mastro's for a special occasion and had spent a lot of money, I expected a lot more in the way of customer service. David was supremely unhelpful and difficult and I therefore have to rate Masto's very low in spite of their very good steak. If you go, be sure to wear a shirt you don't care about!
