Hi. my name is Tom and I am a food nerd. Quirky location, drank Goose Island - Dominique out of a beaker, ate venison and savory oatmeal. The wife had scallops and they must have been amazing because there was no offer to share. Lackluster dessert options. People Type - Nerdy professor w/ hot coed. (Zero help for Chicago's growing urban cougar population) Food Type - Responsible, yet mind blowing. Ambiance: Muted but raw. Staff: Not gonna lie our female server was 'forget shu' annoying.
