Because I'm a hater, I must first note that there were a few WTF's up in here. First and foremost, one of my pet peeves is walking into a restaurant with 15 ornamental staffers hangin out and still waiting ten minutes for a menu. Get to steppin' folks, I'm here to eat. Second, what up with all the wireless headsets? The restaurant was half empty at 6pm on Sunday but there were still a lot of frantic "emergency" sitchos being handled via walky-talkies, with nary a celebrity in sight. Kinda diva. Plus, earpieces are so Whitney in The Bodyguard. And we all know Whitney is an I-don't-do-crackhead. Because I'm also a lover, let's move onto the good. The specialty drink menu was fantastic; really refreshing, fruity drinks with HEAVY POURS. I was knocked the f*ck out after one, and I'm 6' 2" (with a booty) motherf*ckers!! I had the Shoco Cocktail (peach vodka, fresh sour, OJ, cucumber and sage leaves), and my friend had the Merengue (fresh strawberries, lime and passion fruit puree, grapefruit vodka). Mine was good, hers was insane. We shared a couple tapas because we were just there to sample the goods; specifically, the Higo Con Almendres (bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with almonds) and Alcachotas y Seta flatbread (artichoke and wild mushrooms, black truffles, and manchego). The dates were wonderful, if a little small. Perfectly crisp, salty, chewy bacon wrapped around warm, sweet, soft figs. The flatbread though, HOT DAMN, where you came from?! Hearty, heady flavors; the vibrancy of a strong spanish cheese with truffles, with light hints of lemon to offset the richness. It was make-your-night delicious. Do it.
