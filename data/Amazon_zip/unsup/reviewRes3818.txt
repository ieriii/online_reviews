For some reason, I always thought Crisp was a salad place, and therefore never bothered checking it out. It was only when I found out it served Korean fast food that I decided to give it a try (though oddly I saw no Asians behind the counter). Instead of strict interpretations of Korean cuisine, Crisp serves it with an American twist (Korean burritos anyone?). I tried the Crisp BBQ chicken, the Seoul steak bowl, and the Bad Boy Buddha.  The Buddha bowl was a pretty version of bi bim bop, with well seasoned vegetables. It is a good summer dish, and the best of the 3 dishes. On the other hand, I was less fond of the BBQ chicken and the steak bowl. I found them to be way too sweet. The steak bowl, a bastardized version of bulgogi beef, had too much sauce. I wished they had served me a bigger portion of white rice to balance it out! Decor-wise, it is well-lit, clean and simple. Seating is fairly limited and communal, so hopefully you won't have to sit next to odd strangers! If you crave Korean food, Crisp is a decent and affordable choice. However, from my experience so far, I will stick to the vegetarian Buddha bowl.
