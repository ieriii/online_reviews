This was my second time here. Once before way back when they opened...the menu has...matured a little and this is a good thing. I appreciate the experimentation, but happy that chef elliot has stopped playing with junk food. The food is still playful but it's much more sophisticated now - closer to Schwa. Case in point: Foie on a Log; rhubarb stick with a tubular squirt of foie gras topped with roasted peanuts (side of almond buttermilk sorbet). The pea soup was liquid Spring...so fresh! The lavender marshmallow in the center of the soup was an odd addition but it really worked. Pork chop was great, just great (smoked greens and creamy polenta with an apple/mustard chutney on top of the pork - mmmmm).
