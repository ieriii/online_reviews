Tonight was the 5th time I've been to either brunch / dinner at publican. We had a friend in town from la and brought my 17 mo son who is well versed in dinner outings. Our waitress said they had no highchairs and 'lock' them up after brunch. Our reservtion was for 5:30 pm! You have no seat for our son at 5:30 then I just can't go back sorry, it was beyond rude and ruined our very expensive dinner for 5. Tonight was the last time I go back and will never recommend it to friends and out of town friends.
