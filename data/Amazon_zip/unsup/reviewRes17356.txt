I rate India House as 1 star based on extremely poor service. On Sunday I arrived to eat at India House well before the closing time. The restaurant was busy and clearly not closing anytime soon. However, the staff refused us service. I've never heard of a restaurant turning away customers at 2:30 p.m. on a Sunday when the restaurant is still serving. Very disappointing.
