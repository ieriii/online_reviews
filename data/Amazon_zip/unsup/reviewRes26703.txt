My friend was so excited to take me here and I won't lie, I was a little skeptical. I didn't think it could possibly compare to the Mexican food we had in LA, but it FAR exceeded my expectations. The chips just kept coming. I think in total we each ate the equivalent of an entire basket of chips. The salsas were awesome too - there was one mild and one hot so everyone was happy. They also brought out a mini serving of albondigas for each of us, with one meatball and a piece of potato. So good. I had the Tacos de Sabinas, which had steak, peppers, onions, refried beans, and cheese inside. They seemed almost like a combination of a fajita and a baleada (a honduran dish that's similar to a quesadilla but with refried beans instead of cheese as the base). These were amazing. My friend had the regular tacos and they didn't compare. The soft corn tortillas were doused in grease and the chicken was on the dry side. I had a side of beans and rice which were pretty standard, but the beans were a little dryer than I usually prefer. Not bad but not the best ever. Overall, loved Nuevo Leon. If I end up moving to Chicago in a year, this will definitely be my go to hole-in-the-wall Mexican place! Also, added excitement - after I checked in here, I earned my Mexi-Can Yelp badge!!!
