Went to dinner last night at Calo was surprised at how great it was! This is the type of restaurant I would expect to find in the suburbs... and that's not a bad thing! Everyone was very friendly and accommodating and it was a busy night there. Our food came out fast and was delicious! Everything we had was so good, especially the tiramisu. Can't wait to go back!!!
