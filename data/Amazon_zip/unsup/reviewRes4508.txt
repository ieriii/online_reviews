Love it! What else can I say that hasn't been said before? Pricey to get in, but oh so worth it. Intimate and a great feel. Don't be put off by possibly sitting with strangers. Once the music starts you'll feel like your getting a personal performance for a group of friends. If you haven't been there, check it out!
