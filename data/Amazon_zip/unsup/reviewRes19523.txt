I typically love gastropubs, but the food here didn't wow me. The french onion soup was pretty good. The salmon sandwich was decent, but I didn't even finish it. The fried egg appetizer made me realize I just don't really like hard boiled eggs. Next time I'm getting a sandwich, I'll head over to good ol' Jimmy Johns.
