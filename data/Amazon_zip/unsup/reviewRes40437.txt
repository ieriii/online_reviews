Had some appetizers at the bar. To the reviewer who couldn't put her finger on what was in the kobe meatballs: it was the cheese sauce that they were swimming in. The craft cocktails didn't bowl me over with the eye-droppers of housemade bitters. I guess I'm becoming a hipster-gastropub cynic. Maybe if I lived in the neighborhood I'd stop in for a drink.
