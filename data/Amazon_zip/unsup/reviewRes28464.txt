The bar is nice - old school with movie posters, good TVs, and a shitload of blackhawks gear. Beer selection is great with crafts and mainstream. Came here on a Sunday for the 2nd half of a bears game. Asked for the drink special, which was "$4.50 312 drafts." Sorry, that's not a special. $12 buckets of bud light is a special.  $4 Hacker Pschorr is a special. $4.50 for a pint of a beer brewed down the street is not a special.  Ordered a medium deep dish pie with intentions of leftovers. It was delivered in the iron cast pan and it was delicious - especially the carmelized blackened cheese crust. I wrapped up a couple pieces for the following night and went on my way. Threw 2 pieces in the oven to heat up the next day and was incredibly disappointed. The crust becomes so thick and doughy and dry, it's almost impossible to eat without dipping it in a bowl of sauce. I had to start eating backwards from the delicious crust (still delicious as leftovers) and throwing the rest away once it was gone. I did note a ridiculous M-F lunch special - less than $5 for a 7 inch pan pizza and a soda/pint of Miller Lite. Pizza is good, bar is good, leftovers are NOT. Order a pie that you know will finish, b/c the leftovers will change your opinion. I'll go back, but will order a size smaller.
