This is my second time at Nana with former work peeps. I don't live in Bridgeport, but from what I have seen this is the upscale dining edition in the hood. I hear they change up the menu every once in a while so I couldn't remember what I had the first time and when I came back. The food is pretty good. This time around I did find a favorite. They have this truffle mac and cheese that you can add bacon to and.....it was heavenly. It was so creamy and tasty. The truffle added a different twist to it and one that I welcomed in completely. My actual entree a shrimp and oyster po' boy wasn't as memorable. I almost felt like there was too much going on. The oyster part was almost overwhelmed by the shrimp that had a sauce that went in it. Overall a good place to check out once in a while, but I if they keep the truffle mac and cheese on their menu I will probably be back for sure.
