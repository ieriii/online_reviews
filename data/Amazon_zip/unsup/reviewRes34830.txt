You have to go here! That's not a request - it's an order from all that is right and good in this world. Go here and try something new. Yes, they make the best falafel sandwich and of course you can get an awesome chicken shwarma - but do yourself a favor - order those items when you return. When I go - and that's WHENEVER I'm in Wicker Park - I get the meat combo with both types of salads and make it spicy. Mmmmmm - I wish I was there now!!!
