Superdawg? More like Satisfactorydawg. I happened to visit Chicago during the ONE WEEK Hog Doug's decided to take a vacation (quite possibly the one American who actually celebrates Columbus Day). Being a huge hot dog fanatic (http://www.yelp.com/list), I had to have a Chicago-style dog before heading home, so Superdawg was my only choice between Hot Doug's and the airport. For $5.25, you get a cute packaged box with a Superdawg (pure beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun topped with mustard, onions and peppers) and Superfries. At least that's what the menu tells you. What it tasted like was a Ballpark frank with some reheated frozen crinkle cut fries. I left Superdawg thinking for the same $5.25, I could have gone to the market, bought a pack of hot dogs and frozen fries, and fed a whole family. Not being from Chicago, I was so disappointed that I wasted a meal here. Total skip it.
