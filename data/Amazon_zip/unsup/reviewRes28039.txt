Dined at the bar. Didn't try the tasting menu since I went solo. Had The deconstructed caesar's salad and the empanadas. Both creative, fun and delicious. I paired the meal with a Goose Island Black Pper Saison...perfect! The atmosphere was inviting and relaxed, not pretenious. Didn't see the truffle popcorn on the menu and was bummed I couldn't try the foie gras lollipop. I left hungry, so be prepared, but the bartender was awesome, the staff was friendly, and I even got hooked up with an extra glass of beer!
