i give it three only because our waitress is very attentative and we both think she is very pretty... sort of like the movie EMILY... but..here is the but,, the food is overated, i got the special pancake, it is supposed to be vanille cream sourch topping with roasted walnut... first, there is not much walnut, little bits of it, second, it is absolutely not toasted, the pancake is way to moistured, the texture is a bit wet, the topping is sugary rather than vanilla flavoured... i expected a lot since everyone looks happy inside and the place is total crowded... the decoration and music is just not my style as well.. the music is cheezy and loud, i had to yell at people in order to be heard... the interior decoration is in fact sort of stylish and chic but nothing absorb the sound makes it very uncomfortable.. i dont believe i will give it a second shot.. sorry Bongo..
