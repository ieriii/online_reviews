Great Irish Pub fare. If you like mac & cheese you have to try theirs. It gets better each time I go there. We always share a side of it with our dinner. The Wilde reuben is great and so is the chicken pot pie. Everything I have ordered so far has been pretty good to great. Not too pricey and we always leave happy/full.  The atmosphere is another reason we like it. A good mix of people. Old, young, gay, straight, etc.... It feels like your in a comfortable study/library. Dark woods, stained glass, book cases and fire places create a beautiful back drop to a fun meal. The wait staff have always been very attentive and nice. One of the top Irish Pubs in Chicago.
