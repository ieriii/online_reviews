All the hype for Chicago Q set the bar a little too high. The menu is great, and the meats are delectable. The 'appearance' of country-style cooking is definitely not up to par though. The sides have no taste, very bland. The BBQ potato chips are definitely great though. Everything else could use a makeover. I think the most disappointing part was the fact that they didn't tell us our drinks were not free refills, so we were charged each one after being 'asked/pushed' into having more drinks. That their lemonade left a 'sour' taste in our mouth is pun intended.
