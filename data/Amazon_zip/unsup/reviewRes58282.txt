I have to say that this place charges way to much for a sandwich/torta. I thought this was suppose to be like street food. The torta I had was with pork, bacon and avocado and some over salty sauce which was all to salty, and the bread was 75% of the sandwich. REALLY! Its a simple sandwich and the brick oven is a gimmick. It would taste just the same in an oven or toaster oven. This place is for SUCKERS who fall for this rip off crap. Maybe some people feel better when they pay way too much, and therefore they think it tastes better. There is nothing special about this place. Its all a big HYPE! Do you believe in the hype? I sure hope not.
