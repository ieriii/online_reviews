I have only been once, but it was totally worth the trip! What a lovely little place under the brown line in Lincoln Square. Delicious food, a wonderful atmosphere and attentive service.  I had the pad thai which was fresh and filling. My friend had a curry dish which was just spicy enough to slow him down, but thats what he wanted:) Highly recommend going on a date or just with a friend for something a little different.
