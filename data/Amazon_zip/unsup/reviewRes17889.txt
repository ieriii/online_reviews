Our opinion of this restaurant as an Indian couple is not very favorable. We went there for Dinner. The food was average. The service however was good. My wife is a vegetarian and I am a carnivore, so we tried both. The tandoori platter was good but nothing out of the ordinary. My wife did not think too highly of the vegetarian stuff she got. The prices are typical of what you would expect from a downtown Chicago restaurant. Unfortunately, the taste was not up to par.
