I love this place! The chi-town chicken rice bowl is great! And if you like wings--watch out--best deal in town! They are HUGE. For about 14 dollars, you can get 10 wings (and they usually throw a few extra in the basket) and you will prob be full after 3. Their not just the wing--but the leg, the wing, and other parts. Downside--their closed on mondays.
