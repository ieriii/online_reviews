What a shame. "Authentic" Neapolitan pizza in Chicago so utterly ruined. The pizza is not very bad - just a little bad in that it is runny and just not hitting the mark for this type of pizza. I could eat it and tolerate it though. The room and the service however, are unbearable. I would not go back there even if they had the best pizza in the universe. This is the loudest place I have eaten in since the high school cafeteria. My family and I could not hear each other across the table and my ears were actually ringing after we left. They need to do something to dampen the noise in that space. They could but I guess they prefer the fast table turnover. The service... what can I say. The hostess was grumpy both times I was there. The servers were rude and not helpful at all. The menu is in Italian, the specials are in Italian. I could not get an educated explanation of my options from our server hard as I tried - he even rolled his eyes. I ended up ordering and having no idea what was coming.  Note to owner: Fire your waitstaff and promote your busboys. They were the only friendly or attentive people in the place and the only ones who spoke English to me.
