Got there on time, they've had our reservation, and as I ve had mentioned it was my wife's birthday when I booked the table they actually congratulated her and made us very welcomed. Drink on the rooftop first, great service and views. Downstairs we were then put somewhere in the middle of the room where the tables are too wide to actually share a nice dinner for two. So we asked to sit somewhere else and then moved to what is called "The chefs table" right in front of the grill so get to see all the action. Picked up some food from the harvest tables (nicely decorated veg and other starters (salami, ham, even cheese) - top notch quality. Then chefs with the meat started to arrive at our table after we actually seen them prepare the meat: Excellent quality meats and fish and poultry, perfectly cooked right to the point. They also explained how they marinate the meats, what spices they use and so on. These guys know what they are doing. As it was a special occasion we got a little dessert on the house, including a lit candle. Very special indeed. Conclusion: Def go again. Food and service top in a nice atmosphere.
