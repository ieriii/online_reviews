This has to be one of my favorite places in all of chicago!!! The atmosphere is very romantic and enchanting. With wine bottles decorating the walls and the sweet smell of wine and the flamenco guitarist Geja's is one of my favorite places! Not to mention the food is amazing. The appetizer has one of the best dressings ive ever had in my life (you can also purchase it online). The cheese fondue is my favorite of any fondue place. Not to mention the sweet delcious flaming chocolate fondue for dessert. This place is kinda hidden and parkng is a pain but its totally worth it!!!
