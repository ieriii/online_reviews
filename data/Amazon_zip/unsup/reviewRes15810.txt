I've lived in the neighbourhood for a couple of years, and finally tried the colourful restaurant that I always use as a landmark. "You know where Carnivale is? I live near there." The use of the space hit me in the face as soon as we walked into the main dining room, in an awesome way. I love the crazy-tall ceilings, the colours everywhere, the huge light fixtures. I ate with my mom on a Sunday evening at 6. The room was less than half-full when we sat down, but by the time we left around 7.15, it had filled in pretty well. We both had red sangria, which I thought was excellent, then kicked off our meal with a selection of 3 ceviches--the shrimp, the mixto (featuring octopus), and the salmon. I liked the mixto best, but I think I would skip the ceviches on my next trip. They weren't awful, but they kind of all had the same flavour and reddish sauce, despite having different interesting ingredients on the menu, and I couldn't identify all the chewy bits in the salmon one. The ceviches made me nervous for our entres, but I stopped worrying at first bite. I had the Vegeteriana and my mom had the Pollo. My dish had a butternut squash base, with a medley of vegetables including zucchini, mushrooms, and other delights. The flavour was fantastic, especially the squash. My mom's Pollo was also excellent--a bit simpler, perhaps--but the chicken was super marinated and delicious. I did think that the Vegetariana is a bit on the small side, especially when compared to the Pollo. I didn't have any problems finishing the veggies and even had a portion of my mom's chicken, which she couldn't finish. Overall, solid experience and good service. I'll be back.
