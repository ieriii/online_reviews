Sure it is pricey but your downtown and you don't eat here every week. I have been to most of all the Brazilian steakhouses in the area and even out of state and I have to say that there is no salad bar as great as this one. I am not a big meat eater and having a salad bar that is more then just salad makes the meal. And OH THE PINEAPPLE!Attire is either casual or dressy, you are in the city - dress up!
