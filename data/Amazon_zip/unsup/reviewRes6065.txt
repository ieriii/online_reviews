I think it is funny for people to give 4-5 star rating for a place that labels itself a Steak, Chop, and Seafood place, and all they rave about is the salad??? We had a gift card to burn, and friends in town tonight - so I let myself get talked into Wildfire for the first time in two years... This place makes me think of a well decorated Sizzler or some other crap hole fake steakhouse where they sell you on a steak loaded with junk or "crusted" as they call it, to cover the poor quality of the meat.  The sides are sized ok, but the quality is not what you'd expect from a $30 dinner plate. And for $2 more, you can get a runny pile of noodles they list as "Traditional Mac and Cheese" which maybe means in the sense that it will remind of when you were 8 years old eating Kraft Mac and Cheese from a bowl. And concerning the seafood part, I could not have had more a more foul tasting portion of seafood if I had picked it out of a dumpster @ Lake and Halsted. If you insist on punishing yourself with an overpriced crappy meal here, do yourself a favor and avoid ALL shellfish - trust me on this... food poisoning sucks As it has been said by so many other reviewers, go to a real steakhouse downtown and enjoy the difference. Yeah it may cost more, but its because you are not eating at a place that serves school lunchroom quality meals ~
