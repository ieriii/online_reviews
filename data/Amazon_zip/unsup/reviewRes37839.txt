Holy cheesiness. Had the stuffed deep dish, was pretty good but was not expected so much cheese. Was quickly filled because the size if the pizza. Had the classic stuffed deep dish and a salad it had apples, cranberries, candied walnuts, spring mix and goat cheese with balsamic vinegarette, to die for. The wait for a waitress was a little crappy though. Was originally not very attentive until i made a remark and was quickly changed.
