Amazing, excellent molecular gastronomy at it's best! I read Chef Achatz book titled: "Life on the LIne" and was truly amazed and inspired by his desire for excellence, his passion for food, and his strength and tenacity to overcome cancer. It is food heaven and is truly indescribable. If you are a foody you will know to experience Alinea.  A great once in a lifetime experience!
