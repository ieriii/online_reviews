Love this place. To put it simply, a bar with great beers and really good food! This is what "bar food" SHOULD be. We shared the toasted Neuske Ham on pumpkernickel - SOO GOOD! We also had the frites, which are done just right here! Great dipping aioli too! I really want to try the mussels-for-two here next time - they looked tasty! It can get kind of loud and very crowded in here, but when you get a seat, it's all worth it! It's the kind of bar though where you start talking to the people next to you, to see what beers they are trying, and you talk about the food, and you all make friends. Just that kind of place. The bartenders have been there a long time too - and are so friendly and knowledgeable. Can't wait for my next visit to Hopleaf!
