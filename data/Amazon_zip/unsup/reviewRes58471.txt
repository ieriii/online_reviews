I had the fish and chips for lunch and was not impressed at all. They were OK but not great. I only say this because I had the BEST fish and chips in the city over at Big & little's (Real English Style!). When I got my espresso at the end of my meal it was absolutely gross. They need a lesson on espresso making.Ambiance was nice!
