I finally went to Carnivale, after trying to get a reservation for the past couple of months. The key was to place the reservation a week before one actually wants to be there. I was not disappointed. We went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and we had a great time. The place is massive. The main dining room is a feast for the eyes in its decor and lighting. We were seated in one of the side parlors which was fine due to the noise from the packed main room. The drinks were great (try the RASPBERRY MOJITO--refreshing as well as quite the buzzmaker). The dish to try is definitely Mama Mendez's Arroz con Mariscos (rice with seafood for the linguistically challenged), a savory blend of Spanish Rice, fish, shrimp. calimari, and scallops in a delicious broth...MMM, MMM good. The CEVICHES were also a big hit. Overall, a great place to add to Chicago's best Latin restaurants and one that should not be missed.
