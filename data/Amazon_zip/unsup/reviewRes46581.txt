"Meh. I've experienced better". Yelp says it perfectly. Met a friend here for a quick dinner before heading over to Park West for a show. I don't give RJ Grunts 2 stars because it's bad, but rather because there is really nothing special about it. I had heard great things about the salad bar -- and it was huge -- but not that fresh. Also, the chili apparently won awards years ago, but again, I've had much better. I would try it again because of the huge menu, and because the menu is funny to read and the decor is amusing. But I'd be weary...
