We had a Groupon for this place and decided to use their on-line reservation system. I made a reservation but accidentally hit Monday the 11th and we couldn't make it then. I went back in to the system and found I couldn't change it. So, I made a reservation for Tuesday the 12th. I got a confirmation e-mail from the restaurant for Tuesday the 12th (This will be important to remember later on). I then went and contacted the restaurant through their e-mail and told them about the double booking and could they please cancel the Monday night reservation. I did not hear back from them so assumed all was well. Tonight, we decided to make a nice night of it, got dressed, took a $14 cab ride over there, got out of the cab, paid the driver, he took off, walked over to the door to discover that they are closed on Tuesday nights. Even though their on-line reservation system accepts reservations on a Tuesday night and sends you an e-mail confirmation confirming your reservation on a Tuesday night, they are CLOSED on a Tuesday night. Not a way to run your business. Don't do on-line reservations if you can't do them properly. No point in us ever returning here again. Thank God Chief O'Neils was down the street so we could still have a good dinner.
