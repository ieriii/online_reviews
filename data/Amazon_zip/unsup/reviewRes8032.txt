One half star for the TiraMisu - even thought they dont make it in house One half star for oudoor seating One half star for San Pellagrino Aranciata (1.5 round up to 2) The proccut was horrible, didnt even smell good. The arrugala on the pizza was terrible.  BOOO The fresh mozz was good though, and I even tried one of the green olives in hopes it would turn my hatred of olives around ...it didnt. The meat antipasto was boring. The sausage pizza was good. The Tira Misu was yummy and good-n-fresh. I wont go back. Nope. Not interested. ((Though the waiter, adrian, was wayyyy cuuuuute!)
