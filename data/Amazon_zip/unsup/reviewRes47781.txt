Went here for Sunday brunch (my favorite meal) and IMHO ZED451 has it all! Great food, wonderful vibe, friendly staff and good value. Plus their rooftop (although only on the 2nd floor) offers an unobstructed view of the skyline. Since I come to Chi on business (and have no car), they offer free shuttle service and is also walking distance from the L (between red and brown lines). Be sure to pace yourself so you can try it all! Will definitely come back to try their dinner.
