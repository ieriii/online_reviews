This place is fun and great for a late-night meal after the bars. We went there around midnight, and it was still hopping. The food is just okay though. I had vegetarian tacos, and they were rather uninspired -- just beans, lettuce, and tomatoes. They could have used something like guacamole or sour cream to keep them from being so dry. I ended up stealing guac from my boyfriend's nachos to top them off. His nachos were a little greasy but authentic and tasty. The tortillas were also good -- very fresh. I'd go back here, for sure. It's a fun spot.
