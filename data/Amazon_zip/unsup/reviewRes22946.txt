Definitely my go to place in the neighborhood. The gallo pinto is so good! I usually order the gallo pinto breakfast which is the perfect meal size with eggs, gallo pinto, and plantains. The oatmeal shake is a must have. The veggie burrito is also one of my favs - make it even better by adding plantains. Love this place!
