My special lady took me here for my 30th birthday. Believe the hype- this place is UNBELIEVABLE. The food (to-die-for delicious, inventive, unique), the service (friendly, helpful, attentive), the ambiance (gorgeous, serene, peaceful)... this place has everything, and does everything perfectly. You simply cannot top the experience of a night at Alinea!
