i just drove past on friday and didn't realize that they JUST opened... i kinda had the feeling that it was pretty recently, just because it seemed they didn't quite have their routine down yet... but the place is beautiful... i think i didn't make the best choice but my friend had the savory crepes and really thought they were amazing... i had a grilled cheese with an egg on it and potatoes, which were just okay.. maybe some more seasoning would be cool... i will be back, it's close and i'm really excited about the organic factor. update: i've been back a few more times... hit or miss.. yesterday it was a hit day.. i had their baked chilaquiles, and it was sooo amazing and yummy with a ton of the green poblano sauce on it and the black beans compliment it so well. 1/25/10 lunch 12 dollar salad not worth it could i have some leaves of lettuce in my salad? annnnd maybe more than 4 small peices of chicken nana...see bongo room's salads !
