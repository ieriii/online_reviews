Worth the long wait to get a table. These days it's easier to find a place that serves duck fat fries than beef fat fries so finding that on the menu was a very pleasant surprise. They went perfectly with my wild boar sloppy joe. If I were a whiskey drinker I'd consider giving Longman & Eagle 5 stars.
