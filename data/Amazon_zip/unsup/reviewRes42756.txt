So - decided to buy the groupon and try it out. Went around noon for lunch with a buddy on a Saturday (not crowded, sat down and ordered). Decided to go for the Taco Pizza - on the plus side, Fogo has a wide array of options and they're made-to-order. Medium Pizza was about $20 with tax + two soft drinks. Prep time was supposed to be 25 mins...took a little over 30, but we were in no rush, so not a huge deal. Once ready, we dug in and finished about half of the pizza and it was pretty tasty...had a bit of a taco-bell esque flavor (take it or leave it) but then my buddy discovered a fly...yes, a pretty sizable house fly, wiggle its way out of the pizza we had consumed. I'll spare the details...but it was obvious it has been cooked with the food (most likely the taco meat being the culprit).  I mean, I've seen worse (cockroaches in salads...woof) and we found this slightly funny, but still unacceptable, so we showed it to the staff and received a full-refund (they were understanding and reasonable about it and comp'd us the full value of the pizza, not just the groupon value). Not gonna lie...we weren't entirely grossed out by this, but it was unpleasant enough to not warrant a second visit to the joint. We shimmied on over to the Weiner's Circle for some Chicago dogs, although too early for a shake...
