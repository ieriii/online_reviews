The Hopleaf is one of the best bars in the city-hands down. I love everything about it. I stumbled upon this bar when I was freshly 21 because of the proximity to my house and the beer. The beer selection is the best in the city (something like over 250 beers), the food is fabulous, and the bar itself is beautiful. And if there is a beer not on their list, you can request it, and odds are they will try it out. You will not find any Miller or Bud here so if that is the kind of beer you drink-you are not wanted here.  I have been to Belgium a few times, and the Hopleaf could fit right into a neighborhood in Brussels. They specialize in Belgian food so you can expect to see things like mussels and frites (with amazing garlic aioli), rabbit, and a great steak. You can also find a CB&J which is cashew butter and fig jam served with emmenthaler mac and cheese. Paired with a good Belgian triple and you are set for the night. Seating in the front can be very difficult on busy nights, so pay attention to where certain tables are in their meal/drink. Food is served everywhere but the back part of the bar is the dining room. The hostess will seat you here, but again expect long waits thurs-sat, and they don't take reservations. They just added on a charming back patio with six tables. This is also first come first served, although I hope they will re-think this poor decision.  The only reason I did not give Hopleaf 5 stars is because the management is not the best it could be. They seem to work fine if nothing goes wrong, but they do not know how to handle problems.
