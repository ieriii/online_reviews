I love this place, the atmosphere is great!! The library setting by the fireplace is cozy and comfy! The food is great also! My favorite is the Buffalo Sandwich... amazing! The dill ranch dressing is also one of a kind... made from scratch... delish!! While sometimes it can get loud in there, it is still a lot of fun for a romantic date or just going out with a group of friends (beware though they dont like to split checks, eventhough they will take more than one form of payment. Kinda defeats the purpose huh?!) Overall, I love it!! Whenever people from out of town come to visit Wilde is definately a place we stop by! Everyone likes and there is something for everyone on the menu!
