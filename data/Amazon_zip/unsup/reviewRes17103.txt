Great lunch buffet and probably the best deal you'll find in the area. Awesome selection although I would love it if they had just some plain rice. The naan was fresh and piping hot when they brought it to the table, and the tandoori chicken was just as amazing. The best dish in the place was the sag paneer, don't think I've ever had it better anywhere. And dessert was no slouch either. Gulabjamin that were fresh and springy and a mango ice cream that although I wasn't so hot about, the other 6 people in my party were. Definitely a place I'll be hitting up again next time I'm in chicago.
