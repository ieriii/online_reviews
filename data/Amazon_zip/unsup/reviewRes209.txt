This is my second time to Alinea. On this occasion my wife and I were fortunate enough to be able to bring my parents along with and treat them to everything that Alinea has to offer. This place is nothing short of spectacular. From the first bite to having Grant Achatz come out to prepare the final dessert. It is great how they keep the showstoppers on the menu (truffle explosion, short rib, hot potato cold potato) and constantly change up the rest of the menu based on seasonality of the ingredients. I am seriously dreading the day, as irrational as it may be, when Chef Achatz stops doing whatever it is he does in the kitchen.
