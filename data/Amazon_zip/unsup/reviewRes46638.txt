I'm not here to bash Grunts, but I don't get what all the fuss is about. I agree with the reviewers have said that his place is just average. It's fairly priced and the food is decent, but I would not say to go out of your way to try Grunts. The famous salad bar is definitely smaller than I expected and underwhelming. However, I will praise the milkshakes and desserts - they're fantastic and endulgent. I also agree with other reviewers that the restaurant is too cramped. About 5-6 of the 20 or so tables need to be removed to make this place comfortable.
