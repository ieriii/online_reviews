I don't usually review, but I wanted to express how wonderful this restaurant is. I've been in several times and from time to bottom this menu is unique and really, really good. It's affordable, the atmosphere is great and the food is spot on. Definitely go on Saturday and get the goat--it's DELICIOUS.
