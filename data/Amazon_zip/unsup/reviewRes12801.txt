I am a huge fan of Fogo de Chao but Texas de Brazil is every bit as good as Fogo. You are seated promptly by amazing looking hostess and the serving staff are friendly and efficient. The Mrs. prefers Texas de Brazils salad bar as it has sushi as well as soup and warm starters. I personally think Fogos salad bar is better as they have more dressings and everything seems more fresh but there really isn't a big difference between either salad bar. The lady spinning in the wine cave doesn't do much for me but my nephew loves it so again its whatever you are into yourself. The meat in Texas de Brazil can taste salty however the quality of the meat is very good but I do wish they would use less salt. Their Brazilian sausages are amazing and I always eat 5 or 6 at every visit. The bananas and bread are refreshed frequently and any time I have gone the servers and gauchos have all been very freindly. Pretty much priced the same as Fogo and pretty much the same as Fogo.
