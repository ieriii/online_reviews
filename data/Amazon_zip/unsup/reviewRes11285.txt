Came here for brunch on a Sunday with a few of my girlfriends. We had heard that the wait here is atrocious on the weekends so we braced ourselves for a super long wait but fortunately, we decided to check in half an hour after we got there and a table was ready for us :) My three friends and I decided to split two savory dishes and one sweet dish - eggs florentine, omelette w mushrooms and gruyere cheese and a specialty french toast dish. The eggs florentine were really fresh and tasty and my friends really enjoyed their omelette. However, we were all unimpressed with the french toast. It was good but could have been better. The homemade strawberry lemonade was really good....a little on the tarty side but I guess thats the surprise you get when you make it fresh. Overall, a very enjoyable meal with the ladies! I like this place because 2.5 out of 3 dishes is pretty good and they had a lot of great sounding items on the menu - I wish I could have tried a little bit of everything but I'm sure I'll be back again soon!
