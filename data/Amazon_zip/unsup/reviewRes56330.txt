Simply it is a find!! The food is always consistent and fantastic. I have never eaten inside the restaurant, but I've heard it's really cute. I always order delivery from them and I have loved everything I have ordered without exception. They are always on time and the service is unreal. The food is always steaming hot upon delivery. The gentleman who owns the restaurant is one of the nicest people I've ever dealt with. He remembers me every time and has made me a soup that his not on his menu (but should be!) when I had the flu. Then he sent me two large bowls of it for free along with a special tea he brewed!! I am such a fan of his cooking and his customer service that I hope everyone who reads this review gives this place a try. It is a gem along with the proprietor of this restaurant. Oh, and their prices are great!
