There's something about eating spicy food, having live fire in your face, and drinking beer that brings out an appetite. Relish it here along with a million little plates of unknown condiments and sides. Also helps to love kim chee. The service was ok, but to be fair after our table was served with giant beers, raw meat and a fire , there wasn't much to do except roll us out the door afterwards.
