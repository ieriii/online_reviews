This is the perfect space for a weekend dinner with your friends. The outdoor patio was beautiful! It was by no means the best Italian food I've ever had, but it was tasty and the atmosphere was really laid back. While our server was attentive and knowledgeable he wasn't too pushy which gave us ample time to catch up over a bottle of wine and good food . One of the things I did notice was that their portions from one dish to another were very different. My friend's pasta dish was way too much food for her to finish while mine (the pasta special of the night) was probably less than half the size of hers leaving me still a bit hungry. Overall I would go back again, mainly because of the beautiful patio.
