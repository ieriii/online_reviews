The 45 minute wait was well worth it! We were ready with our selections by checking the website while standing in line. Got the duck sausage, uber garlic, elk sausage and the sonoran. The kids got the corn dogs. I thought eating 4 hotdogs was more than what I and my husband can handle but boy, I was mistaken! The hubby and I shared the hotdogs and they were more than enough! They only accept cash which is better for us. So far, it does not compare to any other hot dog places that we've been to.
