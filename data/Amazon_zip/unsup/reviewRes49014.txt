Pork rinds, need I say more? These delectable pork skins are fried in heaven and come out light and airy. Beer selection is extensive and was surprised by how much I love sardines and anchovies after I had them here. I recommend trying dishes you may not have tried before, such as bone marrow and duck hearts. People who are loving the offal dining trend will love this place.
