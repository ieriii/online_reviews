Holy sex on a plate. The minimalist decor is genius, the music is awesome and so fitting, the service is fabulous, and BYOB is key! Definitely a place to experience - LOVE the laid back environment. No snobs allowed.  Being a vegetarian, I had a *slightly* different experience than many people that have reviewed, but all in all, along the same lines as the regular menu....  It all began with a cherry-covered-chocolate sitting in a boozy vermouth concoction. WOW. (Yes, I stated that correctly - cherry skin stuffed with heavenly deliciousness.) Other dishes included gourmet "trail mix" which was a PARTY for my mouth, baked potato soup, the best tofu I have EVER consumed, handmade pasta with honey, mole risotto with graham cracker and campfire (AWESOME, I love the campfire smell!!), hush puppy with passion fruit and violet foam, quail egg ravioli, and pretzel bread nugget stuffed with cheese (!!!).  They won me over with EVERY damn dish.  And while eating dessert, "Black Betty" by Ram Jam played over the sound system - YES. Bonus points!  --- People seem to be so uptight about the reservation cancellations, not being able to get through on the phone, and the "lax" service (not sure how someone could ever say that their service is lax because they are all over everything...). Lighten up! These men are artists, let them do their thing. They reserve the right to cancel on whomever they please for whatever reason, but you eventually get there, so don't fret!  The one-star ratings are for the birds - if you have experienced, you would NOT be giving them such a number. Shit, even Charlie Trotter said it was one of the best meals he has ever had.... Schwa, me love you long time.
