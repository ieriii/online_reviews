As a frequent business traveler, I am usually very pleased with Westin properties, but my experience at The Westin on Michigan Ave was absolutely horrible. From the unnecessarily long line to check in to the hotel to the uncomfortable beds, my stay was not am enjoyable experience. The conference taking place at the time didn't add to my stay, as there were dozens of people taking over the lobby and the elevators, and led to a very cramped experience. Additionally, valet took forever and I had a hard time retrieving the packages I had been expecting. Never again will I stay at this hotel, especially because there are so many other great hotels downtown where one can actually be treated well.
