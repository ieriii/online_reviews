I went with a group that had been to Alinea previously (I was visiting Chicago) and they described their previous dinner as superior to the one we shared. It was still fun, although I would like to return. I was expecting an experience like Per Se, but Alinea was more playful, and I have mixed feelings about this. I do not necessarily think building a fake beach to eat off is fun or interesting, and eating a turkey meatball of a pine branch is goofy, but does not necessarily improve the food. I think restaurants indulging in this kind of playfulness frequently get a by on their taste level. All that said I would like to go back. As I mentioned, the group I was with said a previous meal had been better, and I think the Alinea could improve my palate and offer interesting culinary experiences. For now, however, it's OK, and I can't firmly recommend it to all those interested.
