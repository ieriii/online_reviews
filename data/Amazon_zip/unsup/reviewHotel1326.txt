I have to say I'm oddly fascinated by hotel bars.  I've never stayed at this hotel but always find a way to visit the Ritz in whatever city I can. My favorite thing to do is sit at the bar and order a Kir royal while I read the New York times and discuss current events with the bartender. The Ritz here in Chicago is not bad- the lobby is large and spacious with a beautiful fountain which nicely drowns out the noise of your neighbor so you can relax. The bar is located in the open atrium portion of the building so you get plenty of natural light which is fantastic. The service, as you may have guessed-this is the Ritz, is exceptional. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because I've been to the Ritz in New York and it is my favorite. Take yourself there on a Sunday afternoon and relax...
