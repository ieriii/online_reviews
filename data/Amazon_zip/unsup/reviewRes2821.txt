This is sad, I ate here about six months ago and cannot remember a thing; nothing great, nothing was terribly bad. Tru will just fall into the land of unmemorable meals and I really do not see a reason to go back. I was really hoping to have an experience like at Masa's in SF or the French Laundry, which were both great meals. The only real thing I remember are the two pastries that were given to me on the way out the door :(
