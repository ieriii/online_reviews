First off this place has legs if for no other reason than my Grandpa recommended it to me. He is extremely stubborn and critical when he goes to new places but he always raves about India House so I figured it had to be good. It was. I went for the all you can eat buffet and I tried everything they offered except the deserts because by the time I was done with two plates of savory entrees I wanted to get wheeled out of the place because hey, at buffets you gotta get your money's worth. Don't judge. I absolutely recommend this place if not only for the tasty food but also for the price. It was roughly $15. Just remember people: With great power comes great responsibility. AKA, don't take years off your life by overeating here, trust me it's easy to do.
