Omg the gourmet hot dogs at this place were delicious. I got the duck sausage with foie gras and truffle aioli and it was really amazing! My friend got the linguica, which I got a small bite of, and it was cooked perfectly and tastes just like the linguica I usually eat for breakfast back at home in Hawaii. Fries were cooked crispier than that of In n Out, though at the same thickness, which I think is pretty tasty. If I were to compare this place to Wurstkuche in LA, though, I would have to downgrade it 4 stars, for both experience and taste for the money spent. I spent $9 at this place in Chicago, but at Wurstkuche, I can get a gourmet hot dog with a house-made bun and a clean dining atmosphere with the long tables and beer on the menu to order, like at Octoberfest in Germany. Here, the buns seem to be the generic grocery store kind, and the really tiny establishment allowed about 8 fast-food style tables worth of people, who are forced to inhale all the smoke that the hot dogs emit when being grilled/fried/etc. Friendly service, though.
