I have to say passing by this place on a weekly basis after work and on the weekends was a huge mistake. I had a half day of work today and stopped in at the wormhole for some coffee in the morning, and decided it was early enough and maybe not too busy to get a seat at the Bongo Room for breakfast. I went in waited for about 20 minutes (not bad at all considering how busy it was) and after looking at the menu (it's not overwhelming which is a good thing) I decided on the Tomatillo Salsa Scramble, and the Thai Chicken Sausage with ginger. However before my server left , who was awesome by the way. I had asked her what were some other tasty items on the menu that she recommended and she said the pretzel crusted pancakes with butter cream sauce etc...now I love pretzels but I've never been a huge fan of pancakes but I decided to try it. The nice part was the fact that I had the option to only order 1 instead of the entire entree. Let me tell you, each one of of the dishes was incredible. The salsa scramble had egg whites, nice chunks of avocado, and chicken. The thai ginger chicken sausage was incredible. Not to be outdone the pretzel crusted pancake. Everything was the perfect temperature , moist and just damn good. I was so impressed with the pancake I ordered one more but the banana heath bar pancake which was equally tasty. I would highly recommend this place, good atmosphere great food and service. I'll probably be back tomorrow morning
