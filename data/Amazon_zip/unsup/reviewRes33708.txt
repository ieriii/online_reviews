Best falafel I've ever had. I love both the falafel and the egg and cheese pie so much, I always order both, even though I can't finish it all.  The guys who work there are all really nice, and they remember you if you go there often enough. I used to live down the street, and went all the time. I've moved and don't make it there as often as I used to, but they still remember me. It's a family owned place, I think. I still can't believe how low their prices are. The salad bar is also really good...they have some more unusual options.
