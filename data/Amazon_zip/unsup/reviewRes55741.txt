I have been to the restaurant several times and it was all good experience. However, I did not enjoy it at all tonight. We had an appetizer and it was not hot. We communicated that to the waiter. Not only the waiter did not apologize but told us that he took the dish out right after it's cooked. Without saying another word, he took the plate and left. The waiter did not handle the customer feedback well and showed us his attitude. It was a really bad experience and ruined the night.
