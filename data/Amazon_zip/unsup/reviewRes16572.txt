I really really like the colonial vibe of this place. My favorite part about it though, even before the finely crafted drinks, is that fact that they don't have TV's, and this allows for fantastic conversation, especially with a date.  The first (and only time) I came here, I was sitting next to a diehard absinthe drinker. He was in for the second night in a row, and offered to buy me a drink. He was pretty nutso. But the absinthe here is prepared in a traditional manner - and I also learned they purify the water they use in their drinks... THREE times!  The bartenders are well trained, and their knowledge concerning the drinks is extensive. I would love to come here often... BUT the price is just a little too high for me.
