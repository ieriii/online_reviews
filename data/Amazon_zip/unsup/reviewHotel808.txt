Stayed for one night and for $260 total compared to sleeping at the Sheraton Chicago. The bed was comfortable and the front desk service was exceptionally courteous and polite. I'd come again for a cheaper rate since all I tend to do in a hotel is sleep so amenities are not on my priority but the location is good for being near a lot of the businesses and some of the northern touristy spots. But a hike from Grant park if you want to hoof it to see the other sets of the tourist hotspots.
