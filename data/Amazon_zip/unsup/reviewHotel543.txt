The hotel is very nice based on my stays at other Hamptons. The location is super convenient to major downtown businesses and attractions. Don't stay in a room near the elevator. You will hear noise from the hallway and elevators. The rooms have modern furniture and televisions but if noise is an issue, you may want to stay elsewhere.
