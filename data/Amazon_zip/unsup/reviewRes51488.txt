Much improved since the renovation. My wife had kept wanting me to give it a second try and friends invited us for margaritas and dinner... so I went. It's typical Americanized-Mexifare, but they do a pretty decent job. Service is a tad spotty. I had the Fajita Combo and there was enough for two on this plate. Nice location in the square and worth a trip. Just don't expect Topolabamba type cuisine.
