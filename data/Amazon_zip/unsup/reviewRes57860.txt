I have eaten at Ras Dashen (hands down my favorite restaurant), Ethiopian Diamond, and now Demera.Demera is a beautiful space with lovely decorations, but more crowded, bustling, brighter, and louder than I prefer. It lacks the cosiness that I enjoy.The food is acceptable, but not nearly as good as the other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to in the city. Their spicing is different, almost sweeter, and I suspect there are regional differences in chefs. The injera is very good, and the Tej is excellent. Their appetizers and desserts are also excellent. Their entrees, however, pale by comparison.
