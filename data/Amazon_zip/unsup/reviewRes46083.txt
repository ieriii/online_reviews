I have to completely rewrite my earlier glowing review to revise how I feel about Grand Lux Cafe. After a few spotty experiences, I can't recommend this restaurant because attention to detail--having clean tableware, clean dishware and not finding food crumbs mixed in with the sugar/sweetener dispensers, etc.--is important to me. The food, which is fine for a tourist chain, is overshadowed by inconsistent service (almost every time I visit, there's a significant lag time between when we're seated and when a waiter actually visits the table. This is one of those places that wants you to look over the menu first for ten minutes, that way the server doesn't have to explain so much of it when they finally arrive. Another thing: I realize Grand Lux is maximizing their economics, but WHY is there a constant wait, even when the place isn't busy!? I mean, every time I walk into the restaurant, I am forced to wait 5 minutes or more. Part of the graciousness of dining in such a nice place SHOULD be the flow of "hello, party of two? Right this way." Instead, it's ALWAYS, "Name please...ok, it'll be just a few minutes." Come on!
