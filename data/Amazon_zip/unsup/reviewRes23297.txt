I am soooooo looking forward to going back.  Good thing is that my office is pretty close.  The first time I was here was in late 2011, and then again last night.  Both times the food was delicious and the service was excellent.  I can't remember what I had the first time, and last night I had saganaki, greek salad with anchovies and feta, cod in a tomato sauce along with rice and veggies, a nice dessert with lemon custard and pastry, and Greek beer. One of the special delights last night was our waiter Patrick....friendly, knowledgeable, attentive....the rest of the staff was excellent as well.  Highly recommended!
