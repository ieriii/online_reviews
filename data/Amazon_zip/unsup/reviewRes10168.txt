We have eaten at this River West gem twice now, and I loved it both times. It is a real restaurant (not a bar pretending to be a restaurant!) with white tablecloths, good service, a large wine list, and great foood. The best part is the fresh "antipasto" choices. They have a daily fresh plate of mixed items (on one visit it was assorted grilled veggies, prosciutto, hunks of parmesan). They regularly offer my favorite appetizer - prosciutto with fresh melon (even in the winter!) I had pastas both times, which were delicious, and the waiter was very helpful in assting us with a less pricey wine choice  (On one visit we got a delicious Barolo for $60, which was a real surprise because they usually run much higher!) They are great about honoring their reservation times, seating us within five minutes of our arrival.  Their two-tops are really cramped, so I would highly recommend going with a party of four.  This place is popular, and gets VERY crowded. Reservations are a MUST for the weekends!
