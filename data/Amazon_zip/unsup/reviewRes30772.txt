Came to Chicago over the summer for my bachelor's party and had a party of 14 out-of-towners for dinner. Excellent food and service! I had the bone-in filet which was amazing and the numerous sides were all top notch - have to call out the lobster mashed potatoes which were amazing. Our waiters were great, very helpful in offering recommendations and had to hand to them b/c by the end of the dinner, one side of the table was getting rowdy but they took it in stride. Highly recommend for a steakhouse in this town.
