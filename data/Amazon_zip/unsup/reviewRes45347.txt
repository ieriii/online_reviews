I am taking a star away for the horrid dirty gin martini I ordered that was a glass of olive juice with a splash of gin and ice particles. Ew...no wonder I was guzzling water the rest of the night from that sodium overload. The fish and chips were also a disappointment. It was heavily breaded and there were only 3 strips for $15.
