This hotel gets a 5 star rating from me because I don't think a downtown Chicago hotel that is affordable for the average joe can get any better than this.  This place is so clean, with a helpful, friendly staff. I have stayed several times now, and have not been disappointed once.  The complimentary breakfast is awesome, and not the run of the mill cereal, fruit and toast. One can enjoy a hearty breakfast before going about the day.  The rooms are not only clean, and new, but are trendy in appearance. The whole facility is clean and modern. For the price paid, the atmosphere is so well worth it.
