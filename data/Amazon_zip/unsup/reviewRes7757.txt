First comes the meat drunk. Then the meat sweats. Then the meat coma. Oh delicious, delicious meats. I'm not going to tell you how to do it. I'm not even going to tell you what's good. I am just going to tell you to go - especially during lunch. Same food, same attention, $20 cheaper and time to get a nap in afterwards.
