My review may be a little biased: 1. Because I know that my cute little Asian grandma can make every single one of those dishes listed on the menu 10x better. 2. It's located in the Viagra Triangle and I've been trying to stay clear of triangular things these days. 3. I'm not a huge advocate for Vietnamese cuisine; I'm not a fan of the flavors and I only like a few "real" dishes from that region of the globe (I know, people tell me all the time- I'm missing out). I did enjoy the food we had here, and that probably means one thing: the food has been Americanized to cater to the general public's taste. We started with the spring rolls, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and the crunchy "spring rolls," which are pretty much just egg rolls. Those were okay-it's got nothing on my grandma's version. We ordered a few entrees to share among the four of us. Nothing was bad, but to me it was like glorified Chinese food. What I really like is the restaurant itself. It's adorable and looks exactly like house in French Indochine I've seen in pictures where my grandpa grew up. Best of all, it's located next door to Privet (formerly Le Passage). And for me, mon frere, this makes people watching oh so fun.
