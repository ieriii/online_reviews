My first time trying sweet potato fries and they were delish. The meatloaf with a side of spinach and mash potatoes was good but the gravy way too salty. It was inedible! Also the calamari has was drenched in a sweet and sour sauce, which was too rich and soggy. 3 stars for their concept, warm atmosphere and sweet waitress. My friend had a drink (that i still daydream about) which consisted of eggnog and apricot. I don't remember what it was called but it was exquisite.  Make sure you have enough money because it's pricey. I highly recommend making reservations on the weekends. We went on a Friday night and it was packed.
