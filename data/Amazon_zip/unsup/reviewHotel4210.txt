the best rooms are in the west tower. We got hooked up with a jr suite in the west tower which is way better than the east tower where we stayed in the beginning of our trip. Huge suite and everyone was super nice. The location is about 2-3 blocks from everything but it's a nice walk along the water on your way back.
