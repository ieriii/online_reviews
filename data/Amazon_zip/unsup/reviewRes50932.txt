The food and beverage are very good. But that's not what this review is about. I give this restaurant 5 stars based on service alone. The staff are the perfect blend of friendly, genuine, attentive, and polite without being over the top. I could gush over Andrew (our usual server) forever. He is the server by which I compare all others. I always have a very pleasant experience at Big Jones.
