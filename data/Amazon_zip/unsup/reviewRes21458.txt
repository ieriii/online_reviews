I don't get it. Regular Dog - and its OK - nothing more. I had such great expectations and it bombed for me. Gene and Jude's is the real thing - see my review on them - awesome. I give it 2 stars for atmosphere - its fun to be there - drive-in style and all - but the dog - as if it was LA - like Pinks ;) Can't just depend on nostalgia - but then again apparently you can - plenty if people out there that will "eat" that up.
