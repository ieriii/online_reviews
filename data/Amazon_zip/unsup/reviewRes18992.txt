Xoco was cool, in fact it was Xocoool. I have wanted to go to a Rick Bayless restaurant forever - when I retired my family told me we had reservations to go to Frontera and that's how they got me all dressed up and over at my daughter's house. Finally today I got to go see Rick Bayless of the famous Mexican cooking shows which I showed to my Jr. High Spanish students...and...it was totally worth it. I was a bit nervous about going because of everything I had read about the wait. I even asked my daughter if there was a Groupon for patience as I hate to wait. Here's the secret - go two days after a 20+ inch snowstorm when everyone else is still trying to catch up at work, find that car, etc. They told us it would be a 25 minute wait but I think it was more like 10. There were 3 of us so we shared a table with another couple which was fun. We all ordered different sandwiches and asked for them to be cut into 3 pieces. They staggered their arrival while we enjoyed the best chips and salsa I have ever had. My favorite sandwich was the Short Ribs with caramelized onions. When my sister ordered it I thought she was out of her mind but it was delicious. The caldos were available after 11 - everything Yelp had made me nervous about was NOT true in our case. When finished the meal with Churros y Chocolate - I prefer them in Espaa but this was a LOT closer. The only way to make this meal better was if Rick had come over to say "Hola" - maybe next time and there will be a next time. XOXO to Xoco!
