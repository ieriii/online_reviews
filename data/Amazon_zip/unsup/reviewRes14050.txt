Found yet another local brewery that i like. My buddy Augie turned my on to this place and i'm glad I tried it.  The unique offering is the bourbon barrel aged Eugene (although i've just heard that goose island has a version of this too). Awesome but very high in alcohol so heads up. Eat a ton of food before taking this bad boy on. I made the mistake of having their Revolution Porter then following it up with the Eugene before my first bite of lunch. Let's just say that I was pretty wasted on a Sunday afternoon after just 2 beers.  Menu selection is also really descent including the Sunday brunch. Kid friendly. Tried their bacon popcorn (just ok and may avoid next time) and one of their Hombre burgers - which felt like i had to have this given that i am an hombre and would be a wussy otherwise - and i was really hungry. Wasn't overly impressed by it but it was certainly spicy and filling. I'd like to try their other burgers like their Working Man or Smokehouse. My wife had their brunch and she was pretty happy about it. My son has some chicken strips and he was also happy. Has nice rustic atmosphere but the layout of the place makes it seem a bit crowded and there could be more TV's for guys like me that like to come and watch a game. Def a must try though and can't wait to go back.
