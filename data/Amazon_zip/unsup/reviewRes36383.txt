I've been to Meli's a number of times in the past year, and have to say its one of my favorite brunch spots. You will wait anywhere from 15 to 39 minutes on the weekend for a table, but its well worth it. The menu is diverse and they offer some unique specials every week. They serve lavazza coffee which is reason enough for me to eat here. The waitresses are very pretty, and offer great service. I've ordered the steak skillet which is really good. I felt the eggs benedict was a bit too tangy for my liking, but still tasty. My girlfriend will order a freshly made fruit smoothie..and a veggie omelet that she just loves. They also offer a jalapeno jam that is fantastic on toast. Your dish will most likely come with a nice fresh piece of fruit. I highly recommend Meli for a weekend brunch.
