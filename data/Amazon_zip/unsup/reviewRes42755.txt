Had the bone marrow and pork belly. Both were done very well. The bone marrow has a very rich and salty taste to it. It was served with toasted bread and a raspberry spread that complimented it perfectly. The pork belly had a nice smokey flavor to it. Great place to take a group of friends and order a whole bunch of different dishes and share. Cool laid back atmosphere.
