Pequod's has so much hype... I held it atop a pedestal which may be the reason it kind of fell flat to me. I really enjoy a good deep dish Za' and had to try Pequod's for myself to compare to my other go to spots. For future diners trying to make up your mind on where to order take out tonight... Here are some useful tips: Pequod's pizza is VERY doughy. I liked this but my friends did not. Lots of bread every bight and not very much cheese and little sauce. Big sausage chunks that lacked flavor compared to the sausage LAYER on Lou Malnati's pizza. Giordano's is much cheesier and saucy. So delicious. Definitely far superior to Pequod's. Gino's East is all about the crust and depends on the eater. I am a fan but I know many are not. Lou Malnati's is just crack. So addictive and delicous. To be honest, it's been so long since I've had it and writing this review has prompted me to order Lou's asap. In addition, I didn't get the "carmelized crust" that everyone was talking about. My crust was charred and black. If by carmelized, they mean burnt, then yes, I got this. It was not appetizing and I cut it off and threw it into the garbage. In the end, Peqoud's fell short when compared to Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and on par with Gino's East.
