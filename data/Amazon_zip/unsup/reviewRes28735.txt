Opart Thai offers the best thai food in the city (at both sites) in my opinion. The few times I've dined in the service has been prompt and accommodating. When I have ordered take-out I'm always a little amazed at how quickly the (typically) two main dishes, and two or three side orders are prepared and ready. Best of all, their prices are notably low for the portion and quality of food you get.  I would recommend Opart Thai to anyone who either already enjoys Thai food or would like to experience it for the first time. I like to try something new from their menu every time I order and I've not been disappointed yet.
