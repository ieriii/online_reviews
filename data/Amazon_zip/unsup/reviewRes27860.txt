I wish I could get a job at Pequods to be the official B*&#% Slapper to all of the people who think it is acceptable to cut around the deliSHOUS caramelized crust; I get it, you think its burnt - but why don't you just fall in love with it like millions of other Americans. You HAVE to try it at least 2 -3 times to truly have a deep appreciation for this place - I will EASILY call it my FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE IN CHICAGO. I order a side salad with ranch (for some reason it is just soooo good!) + diet coke + green pepper/onion deep dish every time since I was 9. I do miss the old days of the 1980's pictures up on the old brick wall :) And, as I am sure you can tell by now, I have had more then one relationship end over an inability to accept the crust = I am still the winner/ more for me.
