I have to give this place a 5 star because they have some damn good food at a damn good price and one of my favorite authentic Mexican dishes.  I got the alambre. They have different versions and I was most interested in the one that closest resembled what I had in Mexico. That one was steak, onions, green peppers, bacon, and cheese (you basically add bacon and cheese to fajitas). At San Luis, they also add ham. That works for me, I happen to love ham. It came out sizzling on the pan and it was enough that I took around half home. It was very good stuff. I will be back soon. I have not heard of any other place in Chicago that serves this. I also got an al pastor taco cause I figured if they have alambre, they may have traditional al pastor tacos too. They give you option of cilantro and onions or lettuce, tomatoes, maybe something else like cheese? I got the onion and cilantro. It was good, but it didn't have pineapple. I have yet to find a restaurant in Chicago that does the pineapple on the al pastor tacos. If any of you out there know a place...send me a message. My wife got a steak sope and huevo con chorizo taco. She liked both, but really loved the sope. I took a bite and can confirm it was very delicious.  Other diners with us got a steak burrito, a milanesa torta, and a taco de lengua. They all liked them and I didn't try them, so not much to say on my part. The burrito looks like the traditional american burrito that I dislike. If I eat a burrito, it should be like a big taco (i.e. steak...cilantro...onions). I just don't like lettuce, tomatoes, and a two pounds of sour cream. I guess thats just my personal preference. The torta looked good. I hear the taco de lengua was delicious, but I don't eat that... That brings me to the drinks. We all had huge horchatas. Everyone liked them. The starter chips weren't good imo, but they are free I guess.
