Our favorite Sushi in Chicago by far! We go there regularly and everyone there is amazingly friendly. As non-fish veggies, we get customized rolls there every time, and they are absolutely amazing! The chef is amazingly inventive making the rolls out of this world! We have brought a lot of friends here, and they have all become regulars.
