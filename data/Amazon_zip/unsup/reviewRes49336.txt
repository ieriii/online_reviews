Alliance Bakery puts "Ace of Cakes and "Cake Boss" to shame. The European fine pastries are to die for like the mini cholotate eclair made with imported chocolate from France and dusted with gold. However, I also love their cupcakes, especially the coconut and chocolate with whip cream filling. The coffee drinks are great. Although, I can't wait for summertime when I can order the amazing Hibiscus drink. This one is a MUST try. The custom designed cakes are super impressive and delicious. Executive pastry chef Peter Rios is very talented. Chicago is lucky to have him. Now I see why he has been featured on Food Network and TLC. The bakery has a cute adjoining dining lounge with FREE wifi. Check out the new refrigerated, exotic and decadent desserts served in glass and topped with handblown colored sugar pieces. Wow!
