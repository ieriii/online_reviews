I normally really enjoy the place, especially the 1/2 priced margaritas on Tuesdays and Thursdays .. however, the food has really taken a turn for the worse recently. I was there with friends last week and the chicken in our burritos was full of gristle, dry and dark. It looked and tasted awful.My friend and I both commented we didn't ever remember it being this bad. Not sure if they've cut back or not, but it definitely isn't as good as it used to be. Too bad.
