Ok, this review is solely on their desserts/baked goods, as I have no interest in vegan food. Haha, alright, I'm lying, buttttttt, their dessert is what I first tried from here and honestly, all I really care to try from here.  When I worked at Whole Foods we tried all sorts of baked goods and the vegan pumpkin pie was one of the worst things to ever enter my mouth (and I've had an incident with super glue, ICKKK). The pumpkin pie wasn't from here. In fact, I believe it was the WF brand. Well, customers always wanted to try the vegan things we offered and seeing as how they're potentially going to spend $6 for a slice of cake, I'm all about sampling it for them. Plus, it's a reason for me to try it too. The Chicago Diner had some amazing cake (maybe a mousse cake?) that I would have never guessed was vegan. I pretty much love every cookie. All but one muffin peaked my interest and the scones were better than I thought.  It's too crowded for me to want to go in and sit down and try and order food, but their baked goods are pretty damn good. I'm someone who can't imagine not eating meat (I LOVE fish) and eliminating dairy from my daily intake is just absurd (I drink a gallon of milk in 2 days)....but I'll be damned if I don't notice a difference in a lot of their sweets compared to something my mom might make!
