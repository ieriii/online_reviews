I went here because of a coupon I found on Foursquare. This place is just around the corner from my house, which helps too. The building looks really cool from the outside. It's located in this weird white castle house. Inside it's very warm and cozy. I had hesitated to try this resto for a long time because I had "heard" that: http://1.it was overpriced and 2. the bbq wasn't great. I tried it for myself recently and... basically... I agree with what I heard. The food wasn't bad, but wasn't great either, and it's definitely over priced. The interior is really nice though so I wouldn't mind taking family here.
