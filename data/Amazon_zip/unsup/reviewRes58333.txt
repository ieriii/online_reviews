We'll I was astounded with this place. I was going to have a mid day brunch with my family and when we walked up to the hostess and another waitress/or other host we were looked at like we meaning latino/s did not belong there! After asking for a table they proceeded to stare us down and laugh. I did not recall asking a funny question. Anyways, I will never go there again and have sent an email to my friends and colleagues to not go there.
