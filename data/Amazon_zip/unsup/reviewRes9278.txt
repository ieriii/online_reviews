By far the best Middle Eastern food I've had to date based solely on the kabobs. This is a nice sit down type place, with the service a little lacking, but in no way unpleasant. The menu was pretty big, offering a few selections I haven't yet seen in a Middle Eastern joint. My friend and I started with the Hummus and the Baba Ganough, both of which were very good. I will give a slight criticism that the pitas didn't taste like they were made in house, but instead brought in, but they were still good. I ordered the dill and white rice combo with my food, preferring the dill slightly, both very good. with that I ordered a skewer of ground beef, which was the best I've had to date. The rib eye skewer was probably the best beef kabob I've ever had as was the lamb kabob. All the kabobs here were just great and a genuine reason to travel to eat here. This place is very close to 5 star goodness, as far as the food is concerned.
