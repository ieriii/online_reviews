Looove Irazu. Get the Milanese (?) or the Pepito sandwich and the oatmeal shake, you'll walk out happy. Go into it knowing that it's a no-frills place and that the service can be spotty, but that you're there to enjoy good and affordable food with good friends. Plus it seems like a nice family-owned place that you just want to support.
