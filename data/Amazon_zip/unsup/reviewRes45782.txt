Meh. Food is OK, overpriced but it kind of fits the atmosphere. Beer list is good, so that would get it 4 points. The service is pretentious. Minus 1 point. Last time we were there for a few drinks, they let us sit on the small patio even though we weren't having dinner. Yeah, positive points. Major negative points, they recommended a beer for my husband that tasted like peachy bud light. I ordered an Affligem, the waiter rudely corrected my pronunciation and was wrong. More negative points. The waiter was obviously irritated that we weren't ordering some of their overpriced food to go with the drinks. I'd go back, but no food and only if we can sit outside. And no more recommendations from the staff.
