I have stayed at this W before and don't remember it being so mediocre. The rooms are nice with great views of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier. Our TV remote didn't have batteries, one telephone didn't work and they tried to charge us $50 for a heating pad from Walgreens. The lounge bar usually has some stiff drinks but we had sangria that was more ice than fruit. The staff is super friendly thankfully otherwise it would have been a bust of a stay.
