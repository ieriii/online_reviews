Amazing from start to finish. Forgot the negative reviews about attitude problems, etc....everyone was cool as shit from start to finish. It is definitely a dining "experience". You don't know whether to continue staring at your plate or dive in.  The quail egg ravioli was the best part of the meal. Insane Flavors. Very rich.  Some items were better than others. Some very unique. You can see a lot of time and energy and pride went into everything that was served. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for "art" on a plate. I am hoping to go again soon if I can finagle reservations again!
