This place has one of the best breakfasts! After having its chocolate tower french toast, which was absolutely delish, I can think of no other french toast plate to compete. The bread was soft and moist and soaked in some milky chocolate sauce. Then topped with more choco and cream. The portion was so big that I couldn't even finish it. My bf had some burrito he said was one of the yummiest. I'd definitely go back and try other breakfast dishes, OR the chocolate tower french toast again.
