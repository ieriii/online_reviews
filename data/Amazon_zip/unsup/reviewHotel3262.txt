I guess the building is cool and the rooms are quite comfortable, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that it wasn't anything special. Especially for the rates they charge. My wake-up call never came - fortunately, I woke up on my own and didn't miss my flight! Plus, when I was checking out, the person behind the desk never once made eye-contact with me.
