R: "Love, stop staring" A: "But she is is just... awful!!! Obnoxious! And her walk... She looks like she just got off a horse! And a large one at that.....gosh....you should look at her!" R: "No I won't. Her boyfriend is just behind you, looking our direction and he doesn't look much better" (Cowgirl speaking loudly on the phone, starts laughing hysterically in a very coarse voice. It's scary) I decide to go to the bathroom to check on the 'boyfriend'. He is quite the sight, sports a tilted cowboy hat and requests a margarita. I so want to yell at him he's not in the right place. The waiter handles the situation very calmly. He is my new hero. I make my way inside, push the "Women" door and see a dude coming out of one of the stalls. He looks at me, smiles, stumbles and says: "All right then". Meanwhile dude outside fell from his chair. Solely based on this experience L&E sounds like an.......interesting place to say the least. They are specialized in whiskey, after all. Makes sense. But the truth is, L&E is a lovely place. Just lovely. And the food........ What about rich bone marrow with candied shallots, sourdough bread and sea salt?!? Can anything be better? Hmmmmm....not sure. I am that close to sacrifice my pets (my husband?!?) to crack their spine and suck it up like there is no tomorrow. Or not. Other winners: pig cheeks, meatballs in creamy polenta, fig and plum salad and the rabbit pt served with home-made giardinara.... The appetizers and small plates are, indeed, pretty small but if you are in a grazing mood and just want a taste of everything, it's definitely the way to go. Try the Logan Palmer with Bourbon, Fresh Lemon, House-made Lavender Infused Simple Syrup, Tea, Lavender Leaves. Bruise the leaves in your hand and enjoy the smell. And don't pass on the $3 shots of whiskey. I am in love with the idea, and just regret not having one (or two) more. But I'll be back, Longman. I'll be back.
