I went here after hearing wonderful reviews, but walked away with saucy leftovers I never ate again. I was excited to try this place because of my friends raving about it. I went with some of these friends and my boyfriend around 8:30PM. The pizza smelled good, but it did not taste very well or look appetizing. The pizza dough was more bread-like, which is OK in my book, but the sauce looked like tomato soup on top of bread. It even sloshed around when the waitress placed it on the table. And where was the cheese? I don't know. My boyfriend and I both were trying to find it under the soupy sauce. The sauce reminded me of watery tomatoes with extra seasoning to compensate for the lack of cheese and thickness of the sauce. One of my coworkers, who had gone before and enjoyed the pizza, stated he had a similar problem close to closing time. Even though 8:30-9:00PM on a weekend is not that close to closing when I went, I just don't know what happened. My boyfriend and I were not impressed and will not go back. Good luck and best wishes for this place and its customers.
