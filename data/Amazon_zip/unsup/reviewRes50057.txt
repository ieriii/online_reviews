I was apprehensive about going here after reading some of the bad reviews, but on the night I went (Tuesday for happy hour), it was your typical bar atmosphere, everyone was well behaved, service was professional, and I didn't have any problems getting drinks at the bar. There are three levels to this place, a more relaxed bar area downstairs where you can mingle, the main level where there is more seating for people who are there to eat dinner, and the upstairs area which I didn't get a chance to check out but looked like it had another bar and some more seating. A bit cramped and loud on the main level though so I'd suggest heading downstairs. Drinks were well-made and not too expensive. This place isn't really my cup of tea since it was a much younger crowd but it wasn't as bad as some of the other reviewers had suggested.
