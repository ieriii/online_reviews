I wish there was a 3.5 option.  Came here for a hearty lunch after running around, starving all day, with my family. We were pleasantly surprised with the huge portions and real, cooked chicken in our quesadillas. The rice was also quite good, lightly seasoned. The only downside is that it was a little pricier than typical Mexican restaurants.
