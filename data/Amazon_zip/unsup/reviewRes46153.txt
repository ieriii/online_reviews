Great place! Try to sit by the window so you can enjoy the view of a second story restaurant. They make everything from scratch which really shows. I had chicken parm, an easy dish, but it was done exactly right! Must try the beignets!! Very much like a Cheesecake Factory but without the 1000 mile menu.
