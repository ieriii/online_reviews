I was really excited to try this place after reading all the reviews on Yelp and Metromix. We went on a Friday night around 8:30 pm. There was no problem finding parking and the line was only about 5 people tall. It was drizzling outside, and luckily, we all got to wait inside the hallway. Once the man with the gentle voice let us through the blue velvet curtain, we were seated in the third room (out of three rooms). There were two bars and the chairs had really high backs. It was very dim and perfect for a romantic night. My boyfriend said, "It feels like Halloween!" Ha, yes there were some freaks there. Unfortunately, we didn't get a table per say, but more like a bench with a cushion for our table. We ordered two Spanish Margaritas because the 43 Liquer brings back memories and I had to have it. When the waitress arrived with the tiny Margarita glasses I was concerned, especially since they are $11/each! But then I saw it came with a separate glass container to refill. After finishing the first drink in its entirety, we realized that the $11 drink was well worth the money! The drink was strong, but while you are drinking it you have no idea how strong it is! We also ordered the waffle fries with blue cheese/onion dip, which were very good. Later, I tried the Juliet and Romeo (backwards, I know), which had cucumber, mint, gin, etc....really good! The atmosphere was really relaxing and great for conversation and people-watching. The waitress was kind of a jerk, but we didn't go to see her, so no harm done. Overall, I will go back to try the other drinks on the menu and, hopefully, sit at a real table with a high-back chair.
