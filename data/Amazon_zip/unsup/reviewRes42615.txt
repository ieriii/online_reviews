I lOOOved Gilt Bar. They have a great menu, awesome cocktails, good service and a fun atmosphere. Our waiter was cute and gave us great recomendations. My favorites were, well everything we ordered.. Peach salad, hamachi, pork meatballs and brownies. Yum! We did have to wait 45 minutes extra past our reservation time and drinks take forever downstairs, but I am still giving it a five.
