I love tasty, affordable, late open restaurants. If your damn hungry at 3am and your with your silly late night friends go here. It bbq at night. First you get bomb barded with little bowls of side dishes. It looks like a party table of "free" samples. Mostly vinegar or sesame tossed vegetables. It goes well with beer and friends. I ordered the Bi BIm Bop on the hot stone. This place heats up the stone hot enough to crisp up the rice on the bottom. Watch your fingers. If you go with the BBQ be prepared. The ventilation is average. On a full night the chard meat made by everyone creates a human smoke pit. I recommend this place for the end of the night. Your cloths will stink. It can get very loud in here with the meat cooking and people talking. I'm not a fan of sharing community long tables with strangers. It seems like many chicago restaurants are doing this to maximize space. I don't approve but I do tolerate it. Another con is the place is so far North. Somebody open an affordable, late night, korean place like this in Wicker Park already. I need to eat more vegetables when I'm up late being tragically hip on Milwaukee and Damen.
