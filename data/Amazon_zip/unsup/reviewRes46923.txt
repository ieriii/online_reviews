I'd heard of Uncommon Ground but had never been there. Went for brunch recently and really enjoyed it. Despite it being a busy time on Sunday we were seated within 5 minutes. My mom had an omlette and I had stuffed French toast. Both were excellent. Mom said the coffee was great and the tea I ordered from their wide selection was also good. Atmosphere was nice, for the most part, with exposed brick and comfy chairs in the bar/waiting area. The only downsides to this place are that the noise level can be deafening, and the tables are placed pretty close together so you can hear your table neighbors' conversation word for word, if you're the eavesdropping sort. Would've given them 5 stars except for these issues.
