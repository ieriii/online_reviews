Epically Disgusting. I finally got around to trying this place, I figured there's always a wait so the food must be good, right? Wrong. I got the veggie burger and I can say without question that ranks up with one of the most disgusting things I've ever tasted, easily the worst veggie burger in Chicago. It was pureed into a paste and over spiced to the point of being almost inedible. I ate half of it, figuring "hey, it's protein, I'm hungry," but my stomach is informing me that eating half of it was a massive mistake, even the smell of it on my breath makes me want to vomit. I can't stress enough how awful the thing was. My also husband tried a small bite and proclaimed, "That's repulsive!" My husband had an omelette with potato pancakes. He said the potato pancakes were good, the omelette was also fine (note, "fine" not "good," fine as in perfectly edible but nothing to go seeking out). My 4 year old son got the chocolate chip pancake sticks. They arrived with melted butter all over the pile of melted chocolate chips on top (it may as well have been poured on chocolate syrup), sprinkled heavily with powdered sugar. You might think it would be a little boy's dream, but my son only ate around the edges because the rest was "yucky." Come on, if you put a plate of chocolate chip pancakes in front of a 4 year old boy and he proclaims them to be "yucky" you've got something seriously wrong. This is the same kid that mixes shredded cheese into his ice water and drinks "cheese water." There are better places to go, and the overall verdict from this family is: "That's $35 and a tummy feeling perfectly fine that I will never get back." Seriously, it's a beautiful day and I'm sitting here wishing I had some pepto because my lunch made me violently ill.
