How do people even give a less than 4 ratings for this delightful restaurant? I first came to crisp on spring 2009, and haven't stopped coming by each month to enjoy the delicious seoul sassy, and BBQ Bowl (or they also have a Buddha bowl for vegetarians). They also have a good selection of foods (ranging from the usual wings, to a mix of spanish-korean appetizers) and drinks (Korean & Asian soft-drink, in particular). But the best part that I like about this place is the service itself. They have plenty of magazines to read and most of the people who work there is always welcoming and laid-back, which give you more incentives to come and hang out at this place.
