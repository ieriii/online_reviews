Good food and friendly service. I went with the pulled pork sandwich with corn bread and a side of beans. Since they are still BYOB (getting their license this week apparently) I decided to do take out. Found out they forgot the corn bread, but I called and they said they would comp. my next meal, which is fantastic customer service.There are a lot of good things on the menu, so I hope to try them all. Definitely a swanky looking place too - I walk by it every morning to get coffee and never ever would have though it was BBQ.My only know is that they need a bit of a bigger bar area with more seating at the actually bar. And the bar itself has a funky design where it's divided in to three sections, so that's a bit odd. But anyway, good place overall.
