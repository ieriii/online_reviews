I found this place since it was close to our hotel, and it was one of the first places on my Yelp app with a ton of good reviews. Not disappointed at all. We went on a Sunday night around 9 and it was pretty full. The food was excellent as was the service. We had most of the items on the fried menu, as well as the whipped feta with cucumbers....which was so creamy and delicious. They also have an extensive wine menu broken down by country. It got a little intimidating, but we were not disappointed with the Croatian red we chose. This was one of my favorite restaurants on my trip to Chicago.
