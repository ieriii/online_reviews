This restaurant is great. The decor is nice and they always have a good crowd there no matter what day of the week. The food and service is excellent. I take my wife there on her birthday every year and several other times during the year as well. I always have fettucine with a meat sauce and my wife usually gets ravioli. Great wine choices too. Definitely recommend this place.
