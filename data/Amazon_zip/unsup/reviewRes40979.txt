Oh baby!! I sure do love noodles and this place delivers a home run! I've only been to this place once for lunch and I couldn't have picked a better place to find noodles in the city. I went for the Beef Noodles Soup with sliced beef, well done flank, soft tendon, & bible tripe and it was great. The soup itself was full of flavor and spicy...just how I like it! It was very affordable for the amount of food that you get. One of the things I liked most about this place was the ambiance...it was very comfortable and they don't really focus on how the place looks, but rather how the food actually tastes, which is what I'm looking for. The wait staff all came around and asked me how everything was and once I started eating that soup, I was in heaven. I also had to have a mango/strawberry smoothie with Tapioca to wash it all down! Two thumbs WAY up! -Papa Bear
