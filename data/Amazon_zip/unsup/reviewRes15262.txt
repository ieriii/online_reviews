I used to drive by this place and think "It's probably one of those places that's weird on the outside but is great on the inside." BINGO! I was right. This place is awesome if you're looking for old school Italian food in an old-school Italian restaurant. Went with the wife and in-laws (her Dad, by the way, is an Italian from Long Island) and they were totally happy. We ate like kings. Soup and salad come with just about everything. The steaks are good, the pastas are good, heck, even the Minestrone was fantastic! It's the kind of place where you would expect to see a lot of the "broken noses" but everyone there is super nice. The prices are very reasonable. Their wine list could use a little work, but you might as well do as the Romans do and get a carafe of the house Chianti. Very decent and very reasonably priced. Fun Piano Bar when you walk in if there's a wait-and there usually is--and it's totally worth it.
