Restaurant week is the way to go with this place!! Definitely pretty expensive, but worth every penny if you are trying to impress someone with an advanced palate! The decor is reminiscent of a big NYC restaurant mixed with the honeycomb patterns and colors you would find right in the heart of Barthelona...I think we accidentally got 10 tapas instead of the standard 8 that would've gone into our Restaurant week menu, but every single dish was off the chain!! Ham and cheese croquettes, spanish omellete with a sprig of saffron, chocolate croquettes on a bed of roasted marshmallows for dessert? Are you kidding? Little tip, if you foursquare here, you can get a glass of the sangria for $1.99. We got a pitcher of the white sangria - some of the best I've ever had - and I definitely got drunk off of it (but then again, i'm a total lightweight). Go, enjoy, and bon appetit!! :)
