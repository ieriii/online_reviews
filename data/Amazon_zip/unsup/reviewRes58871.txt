I love it here, great scene, always poppin'. I love the food. A must is the duck salad, absolute must. Sushi is really fresh too. Over all i must say that the vibe just takes the place over the top. Great fashion and hot people. Food is realyl good too. I wouldnt go there for just the sushi even though it is great, but for an overl all great feel great look great spend great kind of night.
