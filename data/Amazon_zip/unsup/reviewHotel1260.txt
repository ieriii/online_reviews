If you are vacationing near the "Loop" or around the Field Museum/Shedd Aquarium, Best Western is located in the perfect area. BW also offers the least expensive Valet parking which we had to utilize for our rent a car. Check-in is not until 3pm, knowing we where going to be in the area early, I called the day prior and requested early check in which they honored at 11am as well as provided a complimentarily room upgrade to Lake view, Sweet! Our room was small, but who cares, it's vacation so we didn't stay in it much anyway. Attached to BW is a coffee/asian restaurant which they utilize for their room service food. Customer service was awesome, no complaints what-so-ever. We would stay here again anytime **Also, Lou Malnati's is walking distance so if you like deep dish, your set. .
