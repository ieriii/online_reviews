nice view of the lake. lake michigan? i chose the green option which means no room cleaning but extra starwood points (hooray!) restaurant downstairs had good food and lemonade (it was sparkling lemonade!). service was a bit slow. and the blue crab fritters were satisfying beds are comfy and high bathroom has a window that opens up to the room.. strange but fun to peek through?
