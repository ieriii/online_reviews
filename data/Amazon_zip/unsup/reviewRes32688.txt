I read reviews here and some left me concerned. But I had a Groupon expiring, so had to use it. I came for a late lunch quite hungry. Things could not have gone smoother. As soon as I entered, got greeted by a hostess. I let her know that I am very hungry and she took my initial order immediately, recommending me her favorite dishes from the Lunch Special menu. I should tell that Demera's lunch is a steal. You can choose any 4 out of 8 specials for a mere $7.95. What a deal. The choices include both veggies and meat dishes. While I was waiting I look over the amazing menu and got lost in all the choices. Ones again I asked and the friendly hostess helped me with her suggestions. The food was tasty and meat/veggies combinations very nutritious. I will definitely be back!
