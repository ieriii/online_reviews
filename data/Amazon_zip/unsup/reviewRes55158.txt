I ordered the Kobe sliced brisket and was somewhat disapointed. The brisket really lacked the smokey taste of open pit BBQ. It was also somewhat dry. I'm somewhat of a brisket snob having lived in Texas for 3 years. In Texas you can get better brisket at a gas station (Rudy's). This place isn't even in the same league as the Salt Lick.The sides are average, about what you would expect. I thought the service was great contrary to other reviews.
