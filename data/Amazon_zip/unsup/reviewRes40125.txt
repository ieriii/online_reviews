I have always been hesitant to try any Korean food restaurants in Chicago seeing as how I'm a little bit of a Korean food snob with the great choices in Los Angeles (where I'm from). I decided to try San Soo Gab San based on yelp reviews..and I wasn't disappointed! I was very, very impressed by the number of the side dishes, and couldn't believe how many there were and that they were all yummy! The meat is good, not the highest quality but definitely delicious. I was hoping for a little more generous portion on the meat, but overall we left full and happy.  It's so awesome they are open late and after posting my picture of the side dishes on fb, I received dozens of comments from fans and loyal customers alike within the hour! I agree with other reviewers in that you will smell like smoke afterwards. Oh well!
