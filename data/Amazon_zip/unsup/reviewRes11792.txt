the pizza here is really good. i had a red base with pepperoni and mashed potatoes, and holy shit the mashed potatoes were awesome. the service was kinda lacking though, i don't think our waitress cared if we were thirsty and wanted refills. she never asked if the food was alright either, but mine was good enough that i didn't really care. get the mashed potatoes on your pizza you will not regret it. the goat cheese appetizer was really good too.
