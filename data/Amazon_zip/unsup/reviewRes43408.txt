Delicious. My friends and I were having a party at a bar and ordered 6 Pizzas - 3 thin/3 thick various varieties. The pizza was great. People kept telling us how great they thought the pizza was and asking us where we ordered it. I will definitely order it again... But it took a very long time (read 1 hour 45 minutes) to be delivered to a bar no more than 1.5 miles away... They kept saying that the delivery driver was on the way. I wonder if he walked it over?  Regardless, the pizza showed up, was consumed, and loved by all.
