If you're looking for the best Seafood in Chicago, Shaw's Crab House is the place. The timeless decor, friendly attentive service, and unbelievable food will have you coming back. We were greeted by a gentleman named Daryl, who was dressed like Don Draper and equally as charming. When my girlfriend's parents had 'San Francisco native/ Napa Valley wine snob' questions, Daryl had a superfluous amount of knowledge of the wines - their story, and the best dishes to compliment them.  I will definitely be back with more guests because of the amazing experience and top notch food.
