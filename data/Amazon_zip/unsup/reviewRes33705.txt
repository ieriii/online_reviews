The ads on the benches are right - it's the best falafel in Chicago. I've had probably half of the menu, and everything's been great. A spicy falafel with some lentil soup makes a great winter dinner, while an egg and cheese pie makes a great, sweet snack. They have a huge salad bar which includes your typical salad bar fare along with a few exotic items. If you go during lunch hours, there's always a line, but it moves quickly. Just about everything on the menu is ridiculously affordable ($3 or $4), which means I can eat there more often!
