Yeah...not really a fan. I will give it one major perk: authentic - I imagine. But that was also its downfall. The employees spoke little English and didn't even seem to understand the American concept of dining. From the get-go, it was an off beat restaurant experience. First, my boyfriend and I were given considerably different menus. When we tried to ask questions about dishes, the server seemed utterly confused. We ended up ordering a crab and spinach dip (super crabby, not very flavorful or dip like) and a Caesar salad (fine), and two beers to start. It took about 10 minutes to get the beers, and another 25 for the appetizers. And we were 1 of THREE tables! While we were waiting for them to come an accordion player awkwardly played right at our table for a LONG time. Nice idea, but not great execution. For entrees we got the sausage platter (good flavor, wayyyy weird texture) and the rib tip goulash (tender meat, but not served in a stew, like all goulashes I have ever had). Throughout the meal plates weren't cleared, and it took forever to get the check. Overall a very weird and unpleasant dining experience.
