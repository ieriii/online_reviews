the bourbon barrel mad cow has made my list of top ten alcoholic beverages! hints of coffee, nuts, and chocolate... how can you go wrong w/those three ingredients in one glass? our water glasses could've been filled on a more consistent basis, but other than that, i'm a fan of how spacious revolution is, as well as their delicious beer offerings. will definitely be back to have more bourbon barrel mad cow and to try out their food menu.
