Don't get it twisted, I love my Pequods...for Chicago style deep dish that is. When I'm craving thin crust, non-cookie cutter pizza, I run to Piece. What's awesome about the pizza here are the endless combinations. I like that they offer white sauce in addition to red sauce, a plethora of toppings and a crust that is always crispy and delicious. The food here is offered at a great value. You'll walk away feeling full and with an equally full doggy bag. If you love beer, Piece is also a brewery and they offer plenty of varieties suited for any palette and you can also take some home if you like. Beware that you can wait a long time for a table when big sporting events are televised so it's best to arrive early or make a reservation. In general, Piece has a great vibe, awesome service and great food. What more could you want?
