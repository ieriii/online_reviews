My first (and only, so far) churrasco Brazilian steakhouse experience was last year in July of 2009. Amazing place to eat. Awesome service. Awesome food. I'm not going to lie, the meat was on point. I felt drunk after eating all that. We even got to use a coupon so it was pretty cheap for us. The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had reservations but still had to wait 15-20 minutes. Also, I wanted to get seated to see the woman on the rope getting the bottles of wine, but they couldn't fulfill that. Highly recommended!
