I live in Lincoln Square and love most things Lincoln-Square-y. So, when Feed the Beast closed, I was sour about it. To my delight, Bad Apple fell not far after. Atmosphere--great dark red theme. The painted trees and the red globe lights are totally delightful. It falls short in the back room where nothing hangs on the walls and the lights aren't as dim. They forgot to do anything with the bathrooms in this rehab and therefore fall short of any expectation. Food--the menu is thoughtful and interesting and all dishes are reasonably priced around $8-12. I had the Lucky Duck--duck confit on grilled texas toast. It was a little bland and needs some work, which I think they can accomplish after a few more weeks of being open. My friend had the Mahalo burger w/ pineapple which was delicious. Drinks--surprisingly extensive beer list organized by state. Includes international brands and stuff from Half Acre Brewery right across the street!
