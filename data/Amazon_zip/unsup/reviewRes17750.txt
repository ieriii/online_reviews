Violet Hour is top notch. A local friend brought me to VH for a late night cocktail. Great spot, fun speakeasy vibe and extensive menu of new school and old school cocktails. Similar vibe to Bourbon & Branch in SF, without prerequisite reservation and password. The decor made me think I was at the Alice in Wonderland Tea Party. I had the Riviera and would recommend it to anyone checking this place out.
