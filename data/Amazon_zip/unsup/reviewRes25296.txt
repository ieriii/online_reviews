What more can I say that hasn't already been said, Artopolis is great! This was recommended to my fiancee by someone from her work, and boy what a recommendation. I ordered the Artopita, which was something I had never seen before. It is almost like a croissant filled with something. WOW! Was it tasty. The menu is huge, I had a hard time choosing. If you go here for lunch you are able to serve yourself cafeteria style so you are able to be in and out a little quicker. I can't wait to go back and try something else from the almost endless list of tasty treats.
