I think one of my favorite things about this place is the atmosphere. It's really a great place to take someone who is not from the city for some upscale pub type food. All of the portions are GIANT so come hungry. The last time I went I had Lobster Mac & Cheese, which isn't on the normal menu, but is incredibly decadent and filling. Other special favorites were the Guiness Burger on St Patrick's day. And a classic go to is the enormous Buffalo Chicken sandwich on the regular menu. The beer menu is great in that they don't just list a bunch of interesting beers and you are stuck guessing what they taste like. Each beer has a small paragraph description underneath so you can make the right choice.
