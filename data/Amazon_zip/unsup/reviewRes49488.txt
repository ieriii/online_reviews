Bin 36 has a modern atmosphere that works for professionals having happy hour or a girls night out for wine and cheese. I've been to Bin 36 countless times and have never been disappointed. The wine selection great and decently priced especially for the River North location. While I haven't ever ordered a meal, I've enjoyed many a cheese flight and have never been disappointed. Service has always been up to par and I've yet to have a complaint.
