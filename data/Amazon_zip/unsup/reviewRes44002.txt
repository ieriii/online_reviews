My friend and I were seated by the pond.  The waitress gives you a towel to clean your hands, the towel was cold, which was such a good idea since it was 100 degrees outside.  We were given complimentary marinated soybeans with sesame seeds. It was hard and the taste was off-putting. Chili calamari- they give you a bunch whole baby squid with tentacles, I liked it, but I prefer the salt and pepper calamari from their sister restaurant across the street.  Spicy scallop--I did not try this, but my friend said it was very fresh. Spicy tako--this has always been one of my favorite rolls, diced octopus with fish eggs and green onions, not particularly spicy, but oh so good. Gozilla roll--I've never had this one before, it was amazing.  A lot of different flavors, it just worked. Hotel California roll--this was my least favorite, you couldn't taste the crab. Half of the roll was covered in fish eggs which I liked, but the other half was covered in sesame seeds and had too much rice.
