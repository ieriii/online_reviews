Meh. Yes just meh. Was there anything wrong with my meal? Nope. It was just okay. Wednesday night, girls night out for dinner. We started with an app: Their Hummus is good. And the busboy kept the pita coming. We also ordered another app which I don't see on the website menu. It was basically chicken potato salad. It sounded different on the menu compared to what arrived at the table. Entre: I had Chenjeh and Koubideh : One large tender skewer of marinated choice Rib Eye and one skewer of seasoned ground beef, served with white or dill Persian rice and charbroiled tomatoes. Nothing outstanding. Yes. Just adequate. One of my dining companions ordered dill & white rice with her skewers and I followed suit. I now prefer the mix. Now the actual reason for only 3 stars. We ask for and receive check. We settle check and give back to server with cc's. Server then goes MIA. For 5, 10, 15 minutes now. My dining companion has to actually hunt her down. There were only 2 other parties in the restaurant. So, Noon O Kabab is just all-right. If you're looking for great Middle Eastern try Rezas or Andies.
