Last night I went to Bad Apple for the first time, and I loved it. A friend had a going away party in the back room, and even though there were at least 30 people at any given time, the servers were fast, friendly, and kept a ton of separate tabs for us. When we got there I was starving, so I ordered the Earth sandwich (after looking over their insane beer menu- which is about 4 times longer than the food menu!). Let me tell you- it was phenomenal. Portabello mushrooms, truffled (YES, truffled) goat cheese, caramelized onions- all on a rosemary roll. I was a bit leery about the bread when I ordered... I love rosemary but I think it often over powers flavors. This bun was perfect. Any place that has an abundance of options with truffle oil is a winner in my book- add great service and great beer and I'm one happy camper!
