Dear Rick Bayless, As a Rice-Loving Filipino, you make me wanna eat a sandwich. You make me dream of dropping by your restaurant so i can take a xoco sandwich insurance for a transatlantic flight. you make me wanna drink all sorts of hot chocolate in one sitting (like a dutiful adopted daughter, twice removed, I obediently did that) and you made me realize that pork is good in my soup. the last one was a lie. ive always known that pork is good in my soup. until the next time!
