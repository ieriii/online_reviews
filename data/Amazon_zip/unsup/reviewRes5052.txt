Very good meal--we did have to wait an hour and twenty minutes instead of the promised 45, but no big deal with a good wine list like this restaurant has. The neck bone rilletttes were fantastic, as was the butternut squash with fried sage and the pork blade steak. The tempranillo we tried was also excellent. A very nice surprise, especially in this location, where there's a lot of chees and over-the-topness.
