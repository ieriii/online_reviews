The Hopleaf has perhaps the best selection of beer in the city. Great atmosphere with more mature patrons...or at least as mature as one can be while drinking. :) My only complaint is the narrowness of the downstairs bar. I've only been able to sit there one time as it is usually packed. Luckily, there is the upstairs bar where there are many microbrews and imports in bottle. I highly recommend it.
