Great food, great waitress, awesome atmosphere. I can't comment on the wait, I was coming from the far west burbs and got stuck in traffic, so my party (of 15) was already seated before I arrived. I had the skirt steak and the red sangria and both were excellent. The place is huge and packed, so it is quite loud, but it's a very fun atmosphere. Everyone in our party enjoyed their food and drinks.
