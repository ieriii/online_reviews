Geja's is known as one of the "most romantic" restaurants in Chicago...I completely disagree! Just because a restaurant is dark and has candles, doesn't make it romantic. This restaurant is so ridiculously dark that it makes it almost impossible for a person (even with 20/20 vision) to read the menu. The cheese fondues and dessert fondues are what you should go for. Skip the meats...they're nothing special. I hate the fact that you have to fry it in oil because there's no such thing as splatter-free oil. Geja's is very overpriced as well. The Melting Pot has better prices and better food, even though it's a chain.
