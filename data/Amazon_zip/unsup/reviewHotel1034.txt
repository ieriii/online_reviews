This is definitely my favorite hotel! I love all the decor in the lobby and in the rooms. The service is always excellent. The rooms are are really roomy and the bathrooms are huge for a hotel. The cocktail hour is always nice and I love the Amalfitini! Continental breakfast the next day is great since I don't usually eat a large breakfast. The chocolate croissants are my favorite and the coffee is really good! We'll be going back for sure!
