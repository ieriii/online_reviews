Arrived at Doug's on a Saturday morning and we were greeted with a long line out front. We waited for a total of 2 hours to get our food. Sounds crazy right? But I'm telling you it was worth every minute. The anticipation to get your hands on the famous duck fat fries and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. This was the weird part for me, I knew the food was going to be so bad for me, yet I was willing and able to scarf it all down. The great mystery of the universe I suppose. Ok, onto the food, first things first make sure you bring cash, cash is king here, no credit. Good thing my buddy had cash ready to go. Now here comes the hardest part, deciding what to order. There are plenty of choices ready for you and your stomach is limited. I had the duck fat fries, the Uber Garlic Pork Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mustard, and the Mole and Chipotle Smoked Chicken Sausage. I was most intrigued by the duck fat fries, they taste like regular fries but they are heavy and make you full real quick. O by the way, my heart stopped for a second or two eating them. I thought I needed a defibrillator to get my heart going again. The quality of the sausages are top notch, very succulent and plenty of flavors. I really like the garlic pork sausage and I will also try the foie gras next time I'm in town. Doug's is a great outing and the quality and uniqueness can't be beat. Now it's time to run 20 miles to burn off one duck fat fry.
