Shaw's probably deserves a 5 star rating but I have only eaten here once. It is a bit difficult to find and definitely a "local's" spot! They have great live jazz, fantastic oyster bar & great service! "I started with the Chilled Crab King bites and the Lobster Bisque, D'lish! I had the fresh seasoned fish for my entree. Everything was very fresh , good quality. After all of that great food I was full.... but left enough room in my tummy for the creme brulee. girl's gotta have dessert!! I look forward to my next visit to Chicago and will be having another rendezvous at Shaw's!! Enjoy
