From the horribly disgustingly dirty windows to the hair in the re-served hot mustard container and slow service-this place is GROSS! I have been here once before but it's been at least a year....I guess it's gone down since then. First off-it took forever for us to get any service and the servers were making people wait even though there were open tables! 2nd-I could tell the mustard and hot/sour sauce containers had been sitting in the fridge for many hours (probably put back in the fridge after someone else's table didn't use it all) because the top of the mustard sauce had congealed and when I moved the spoon to put some on my plate it broke through the congealed layer of mustard to reveal fresh mustard underneath. 3rd-There was a hair in the mustard sauce! 4th-DO NOT order the Ma Po Tofu unless you enjoy a huge bowl of gloppy goopy sauce with the softest tofu you have ever eaten swimming in it. We did NOT take home leftovers it was awful! Oh, and the spicy cabbage slaw they give you at the beginning of the meal had a slightly rancid flavor to it. Finally-to top everything off-the rice costs $1/per serving and they don't ask you if you want it or tell you it is extra-they just bring it!
