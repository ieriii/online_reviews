So there I was, (along with Rod S.) invited out to an after-civil-union lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant. When we arrived, there was a short wait, but given that there were about 20 of us, the staff busted some serious hump to get us all seated together quickly. (They also did separate checks with nary a murmur.) Now, I've never eaten Vietnamese food before, so despite being very 'under the weather'. (I was kind bummed about this fact, cause I had to be a bit sensitive to my poor tummy and couldn't be as adventurous as I would have liked.)I was really excited before we even sat down. Excitement went to fever pitch when I received the TOME they call a menu. Seriously, I badly neglected the conversation around me as I perused it. There was one small challenge for me. I'm allergic to pork. Yep, and that stinks because I really LIKE pork. In this kind of cooking, there's LOTS of PORK. In nearly everything. But I managed. I ordered some LOVELY iced coffee, which was great and then I started with the shrimp spring rolls, which were yummy, big and pork-free. (I admit, usually when I've seen the basil, it's only the leaves in the spring roll. This time the whole darn plant was stuffed in there. Not that I mind, I LIKE Holy Basil. It just made me grin a bit. I went for the Duck w/ Egg Noodles soup, because unlike most of the stuff on the menu, (and you do need to read it closely) it didn't have pork in it. The soup was HUGE. It came in what looked to be a 5 cup bowl! And it came with a platter of Thai basil, lime wedges, bean sprouts, jalapeno peppers and the side bowl of ginger-garlic fish sauce. (Be warned, the duck in this dish is NOT boneless.) The idea is that you stir it into the soup to cook a bit. Very awesome. I finished off with a mango-pineapple smoothie. It was great. The prices were very reasonable, given the HUGE portion sizes. I cannot WAIT to go back there and try some of the more exotic and spicy dishes!
