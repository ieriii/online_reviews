Liked it a lot. Strong entrees (filete al nuevo leon and pollo mole ... I think that's what the wife had, anyway). Had chips, a decent appetizer (queso panelas) two entrees, an horchata and a soda for $32 before tip. And we both have lunch for tomorrow. Good value. Crowded at 6pm on a Saturday, so be ready for that. Also, there are two rooms. Back room is brighter, maybe quieter.
