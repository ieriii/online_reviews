I went to Demera last night (on a Friday) with a friend after hearing about it on my favorite Chicago dining show, "Check Please." It is only a block from the Lawrence stop on the red line, which was very convenient. I had tried Ethiopian food before, but my friend had not. Luckily she was up for an adventure. I got there around 7:30 and was happy to have made a reservation since the place was full and they seemed to be turning people away.  Our food selection was easy, the vegetarian variety plate that gives you a sampling of all the vegetable items. I would highly recommend the combo plate to anyone, since I think it would be pretty boring just to choose one selection. We didn't opt for any appetizers, since I knew that our platter would be more than enough. The food came out incredibly quickly- almost too quickly since we were looking forward to having time to chat before our feast. Oh well, I shouldn't complain about fast service. I'm guessing they have all of the dishes premade and just scoop a portion onto the large platter.  As I'm sure others have noted, you don't use utensils, but rather a spongy bread to pick up the different dishes. I enjoyed the beets, spinach, and a few others that I wasn't exactly sure what they were (I think chickpeas in one). There was more than enough food for the 2 of us and it was a great deal at $30 total.  Though the interior isn't much to rave about, they did have live music (I didn't even notice until my friend said something). A guy was playing a keyboard which was nice background music in a somewhat noisy setting. I would recommend this place to anyone who is up for a non-traditional meal and enjoys sharing food, as it is much more fun to try a variety of things.
