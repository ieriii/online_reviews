This was another winner in Chinatown. They have gotten a few awards, and they proudly letting you know about it in their menu. But I'm not one who cares about awards and trophies. Feed me some good stuff, and I'm happy.  Lao Sze Chuan has a huge menu. It is ranging from the typical-Americanized-so-called-Chinese food such as Mongolian Beef and Mayo Prawns, to the real deal, such as pork intestines, frog legs, spicy rabbit, and so on. Last weekend was my first visit to LSC, but I'm already planning my second. And third and forth. It'll be good if you come with a large group so you can try different dishes. I strongly recommend to leave the weak-stomach and close-minded friends of yours at home.
