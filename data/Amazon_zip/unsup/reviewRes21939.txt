First off I want to say "I loved that Churro story from an earlier rater.....!!" I felt bad for you guys being denied your Churros although you would think since Cali is full of more Mexicanos than Chicago they would have the best Churros in the US! Ok, straight to the point.... this is the worst pozole I have ever tried! Absolutely no flavor besides it being too spicy! I even complimented (in my head) my Tia Lulu's pozole, (and which I thought was hideous) but after one sip of this one I knew hers was yummy... I went with a friend who ordered a torta (or something closely related, can't quite remember) and after he let me take a bite ( and this torta was ok I must say) was definitely not worth the $8 or more it cost. I could have gotten two big $4 tortas at Nuevo Leon for that price and saved my $13 spent on pozole by asking my Tia to make me some of hers! (At least after some chile Valentina y unos limones y sal al menos le da sabor!) Anyways, I guess that's what happens when you leave a gringo to do a Mexican's job. Come on, how would Italians feel if culinary media appreciation was given to someone who is not even Italian at all?
