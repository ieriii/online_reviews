My husband and I have decided this is our restaurant to "celebrate" good things in life. So, we recently ate here for my 30th birthday, yes 30th. Being a major seafood lover and coming from an east coast family where seafood is a way of life, I am usually not always happy with seafood until I met Shaw's! We start with Oysters, every time, and they are fresh and delicious. You can order them from a few different regions, but I happen to think Cotuit Bay were the best, again, maybe the east coast thing. I should also mention their wine list is good and I especially enjoyed the Pinot Noir, as usual. So, since it was the big 3-0, I got to treat myself to the Surf and Surf! My husband decided to have surf and turf so it worked out perfect since I got to have a taste of his steak (which was cooked a perfect Medium and we all know how many places can't get that right) and he got a taste of my lobster. Really a delicious meal! The funniest part of the whole night was when the waiter brought me a piece of cake with a candle on it and my husband asked him to sing with him! You should have seen the look on the waiter's face, it was priceless! The couple next to us cracked up!
