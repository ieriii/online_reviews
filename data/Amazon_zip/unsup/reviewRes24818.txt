I tried to eat here on January 3. There were boards on the window and the sign was dark. I thought it had closed! Perhaps it was being renovated? Anyway, I was disappointed because I really wanted to try the oatmeal milkshakes everyone has been raving about... (I gave it a 3 star, so as not to affect the overall rating that much...)
