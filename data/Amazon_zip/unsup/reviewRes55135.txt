Went on Thursday night. Great atmosphere; however, that was about it. We (group of 3) ordered an appetizer (hushpuppies- decent). When appetizer arrived, we ordered main course. Literally three minutes later, while we hadn't even made it through two of the four appetizers, our main courses showed up (two brisket sandwiches and a pulled pork sandwhich). All three entrees were cold, including fries. It felt like we were eating fast-food. Very disappointing experience.
