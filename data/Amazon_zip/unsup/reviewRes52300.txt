Amazing. The best stuffed pizza in Chicago hands down!!! I never get peporoni pizza, the the peperoni supreme pizza is what I live for. This is a chicago legend and always will hold a special place in my heart. My best friend who now lives in Boston as claims that this is her favorite too. I know in Chicago pizza is a battle and this is definitely a strong contender.
