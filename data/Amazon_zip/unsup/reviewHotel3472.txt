Don't be swayed by the less-than-modern exterior of the hotel, or the 1920s Tip-Tap sign at the top. The interior is very modern and comfortable. Here is my pro/con list: Pro - Large rooms - Sheets that don't move around - Comfortable beds - Decent Internet, although it is tethered - Excellent location - Very nice gym with windows and TVs on each machine Con - Older TVs - Small-ish bathrooms - In-room refridge was just on the ground by itself All in all, Allerton is now my go-to hotel in Chicago.
