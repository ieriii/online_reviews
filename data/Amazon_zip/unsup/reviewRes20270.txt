This is absolutely my favorite sushi in the city and I have a really hard time going anywhere else. New BYOB policy brings it down to 4 stars I'm afraid though... You really shouldnt make rules for people coming to your restaurant. It's patronizing and just not polite. I hope this isnt a trend among Chicago's BYOB's!
