Had a really great time here. The food was tip top, well flavored, and of course so bad for you. I had the kobe beef brisket with a side of fries and shared some mac and cheese with the boyfriend. Everything was excellent. The restaurant itself is amazing. The service was above and beyond, we were well taken care of. The serves, managers, and bus boys came by the table very often to ask us if all things were going well. It happened often but not often enough where I was annoyed. Good job! My only complaint was out of their control, the f*cking 14 year old boy on a date with his girlfriend and her dad (who was paying obvi) couldn't shut up.He said some things out loud that could have been mistakenly taken as offensive or maybe they were and I'm just giving him the benefit of the doubt. It kinda annoyed me all night. So if you get stuck at a table next to some 14 year old dark haired kid who talks really fast, ask to be moved immediately!
