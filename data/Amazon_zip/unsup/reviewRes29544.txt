Alright, so this restaurant may not truly deserve a full 4 stars, but they are quick and they are good! I had their Pad Thai which was truly one of the best that I've tasted. The noodles were buttery and they didn't overdo it with the nuts. It took literally 2 minutes to make...faster than some of the "fast food" joints these days. I would say my only drawback was their stinginess with their plastic forks and knives! I jumped on the train and wanted to start eating, but alas..no tools with which to shovel the food into my mouth. I debated using my hands, but I hadn't reached that point of hunger yet. Maybe next time!
