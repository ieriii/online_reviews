I had the jalapeno scramble with poached eggs and my fiance had the eggs, toast, and chicken sausage. Everything was great! Orange juice was fresh squeezed...definitely go with a large and the coffee was good. Overall, great place. Service was not anything worth going back for and the wait was a little longer than quoted. Although we enjoyed the food the price is just a tad high and you can get more bang for your buck down the street at Yolk (if you're at the Wells location). Still, fantastic brunch and nice atmosphere. Truly torn between 3 and 4 stars.
