Hey, where's Tony Montana? Greek Island is really amazing. It's got somewhat of a mob feel to it, okay, so maybe I'm over exaggerating a bit, but the inside's a nice setting; it's moody and quiet, people chit chatting at their table, having laughs. The food was good stuff also. I had the artichoke lamb and it was nothing short of delicious. The artichoke heart was soft and full of flavor and the lamb was soft and tender, it simply fell off the bone. It's was beautiful, beautiful to my lips, mouth and taste bud =). YUMM! The saganaki was ok...I feel like Tony Montana's throwing a fire bomb at me everytime they light that thing on...all you hear is POOF! *starting to feel the heat* then you hear people saying...OOOO, AHHHHH.  Yeahhhh, it's a spectacle, crazy show, I have to admit, but the taste? It tastes like the cheese that you pick off the side of a pizza box. Good, yes, but not worthy of the fire spectacle. Overall, I would totally recommend this place, it's a nice place to sit down to conversate with friends and also have great food.
