xoco? or frontera. xoco? or frontera. whatever, pick frontera. i said good morning to rick bayless at 10:30AM and proceeded to order myself a bottle of hard cider. too bad the bottle was humongous and i'm ashamed to say i got red, buzzed, and hungover before i could finish. all before noon. anyway, we were lucky to get some seats at the bar to enjoy our saturday brunch. instead of having to wait for the quoted 2 hours. we ordered the appetizer sopa and it was pretty good. the shredded beef paired well with the avocado and cheese on top. not a bad start. I opted for the pineapple pork tacos and my friend got the maple braised pork. I think I ended up mistakenly saying I got the maple braised pork when the server was asking who got what and I think I also ate most of it. Best food snatching move EVER. I mean the pineapple pork tacos were well made but I think the maple braised pork was much more tender and succulent and I couldn't stop shoveling it in my face. The pork in the pineapple pork was a little too jerky and rough for me and I didn't enjoy that one as much. Not as much as everyone raves.  Anyway, maybe I'm just stuck up and have too much good mexican food in LA. Rick Bayless doesn't disappoint but it also didn't blow me away.
