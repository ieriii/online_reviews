THIS PLACE IS BALLER STATUS! A+++ Employees So i ordered a pizza, a salad and a root beer. The pizza was average tasting but the salad was bomb! and the root beer was root beer. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE ARE PIMPS! In the special instructions (I ordered on grub hub) i wrote a silly story as to why i was buying each item and emphasized on themes such as being fat and ugly. To my surprise the pizza man or whoever made the pizza drew a picture of a turtle wearing a snuggie and several compliments on the pizza box. the delivery guy delivered the pizza laughing and said that he liked the "details" i left when i ordered the pizza. I will definitely be ordering from this place again.
