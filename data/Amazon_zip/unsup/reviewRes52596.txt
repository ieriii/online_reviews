Great service. Great selection of meats. Thought I died and went to heaven with all the steak and shrimp and the aforementioned wrapped in bacon! Keep that little circle card on green and make sure the food keeps coming!! The "salad bar" was gourmet with plenty of upscale pasta options and a good variety for salads and side dishes like risotto and seafood! A little pricey but the atmosphere, food and service is well worth it for an all you can eat/stuff place!
