I have probably been to Piece at least 5 times. I know when to go, and when to avoid the incredibly huge crowds. Though I do really like their pizza, I wish it weren't so floppy...more crispy please! However, the thing that I really love about Piece, aside from their Worryin' Ale, is their mixed greens salad. Yes, I know...salad at a brewery/pizza joint? Did you know that the large salad, which claims to feed 2-3 people, will really feed 4 or 5? I shit you not. Mom, Dad and I got a small pizza and a large salad; we barely made a dent. It is one hell of a salad, too. Candied walnuts, pears, baby greens...yum. You will probably feel better about yourself if you get this fabulous salad alongside your pizza and multiple beers;)
