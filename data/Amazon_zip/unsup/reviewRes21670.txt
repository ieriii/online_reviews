It seems as if I am stuck on giving 4 stars to the places I have been to, but The Mayan Palace really deserves. Granted, we went on a Tuesday, so HOO-RAY for half priced margaritas! They are quite strong without actually cringing of the taste of tequila. They are made with real fruit juice which made them not too sweet. Fantastic. I ordered the veggie quesadilla. It came loaded with veggies and took up half of the plate. They were fantastic. My friend had the veggie enchiladas with ranchero. He also said they were fantastic. I thought the rice was cooked perfectly and had a great taste; not dry at all. We went early in the evening before a movie so it wasn't busy. Service was quick and the staff was very friendly. By the time we were getting ready to leave, it was quickly filling up so you might want to get here early to horde yourself with awesome half-price margaritas and really good food.
