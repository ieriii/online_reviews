For my boyfriend's birthday we decided to come to Chicago on a hot dog pilgrimage. Of course, Hot Doug's was the feature stop. We got there at about 10:00 AM on Saturday, the line wasn't too long. But we waited, and it was cold. We inched closer and closer, and before we knew it, we were in. Boy ordered the Duck & Foie Gras, plus a Chicago Dog, and I ordered the Black & Blue. I really didn't like mine at all. His on the other hand was fantastic. The duck fat fries were inexplicably delicious and addictive. Overall, it was a fun experience, but I think the hype is a little out of control. My local hot dog favorite back in Minneapolis has dogs that are just as good, if not better, without the inflated prices and long line. But those fries...now those I could go back for.
