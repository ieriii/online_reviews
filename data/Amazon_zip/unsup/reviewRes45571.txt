This place looks great on the inside and offers and awesome curb appeal to the neighborhood. The prices are a bit high, but the atmosphere is nothing short of cozy. I ordered a Denver omelet, to which I asked for the ham to be replaced with bacon. I was told by our waitress, that they could not do this, as all of the omelette's mixtures are pre-made. All I could imagine was Denver omelet mix being made the night before, to lay in a plastic bag overnight. This did not seem sanitary to me, nor pleasing to even know.  Lest to say, I ordered something else instead. The food is adequate, but there are many other restaurants that will make your food fresh and cooked to order.
