Awesome. What a great restaurant. It's owned by the Cheesecake Factory and has the same style as that. The menu is large and the portions are huge- the food is delicious. They have great salads and sandwiches and my favorite is the cedar planked salmon or the Portobello Burger- that is amazing! They also have this chocolate souffl dessert that is so worth it- but you need to order it with your meal because it takes so long to make. Worth it!
