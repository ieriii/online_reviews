I ventured out of Hyde Park with some nerdy friends of mine on Friday. Yes, nerdy friends and we were a little hesitant to come to this place, because there were lots of pretty and trendy folks that you could tell probably had money to throw around.Us poor grad students walked in anyways, because we heard the food was really good and were greeted by the hostess. She was smiley and got us to a table after about a 5 minutes wait at the bar.We started with the goat cheese pitas and we all had French Onion soups. The cheese was melted perfectly for the soup and the server told us that they make everything from scratch. You could tell.Based on our servers suggestions, I had the Triple Secret Burger, my friend had the skirt steak sandwhich, and my other friends split the ribs. Everybody was in heaven. Portions were huge and the food quality itself was just special. I don't think I can explain every little detail but there were definite food highs when we left.They bought us a cookie bowl dessert and a manager came by to see how dinner was. Everyone was pleasant and gracious, and I'm glad we made the trip over here.
