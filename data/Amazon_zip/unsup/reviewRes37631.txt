Very hit or miss. Their inventory is excellent in terms of gourmet cheeses, chocolates, etc. - but it was an extraordinarily poor service at the deli counter. We waited looking hungrily at our future selections, as (literally) 4 people walked by and busily unpacked boxes, sliced meats, and other items - and they looked at us and pointedly ignored us. Another woman standing nearby finally snapped and said, "HEY! Is anyone here going to help us?!" One guy put down a box and (without a smile or apology) took her requests, then mine. Kind of ruined my expectations that the prices should match the sevice.
