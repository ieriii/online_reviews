Nice ambiance that is a throwback to the old school steak and seafood chophouse. The service was super attentive and the food was fresh and well proportioned. The cold oyster platter was delicious, as were the oysters Rockefeller, lobster bisque, and mini dessert tray that came with a mini key lime pie, mini chocolate cake, mini berry pie, and a mini creme brulee! I love all mini food items as long as there are plenty of them! Wine list is decent and the beer list is a bit lacking, but all in all a great place for a romantic seafood dinner with your favorite partner in crime.
