Probably my favorite mexican food restaurant in the city. The waiters are fast, the food is delicious -- love me a good chimichanga -- and the price is right. The environment is extremely casual and the crowd is mixed. The front room is cozy. Yesterday I went with my girlfriend at 7pm and we didn't have to wait. We had a show to see at 8 and we were in and out by 7:40. This isn't always the case though -- I've had to wait before. The beauty is that you can put your name in and walk a few steps to a bar to have a drink and then come back. Best thing about this place is that you can go to http://Restaurant.com and get a $10 gift certificate for $3 that works for a minimum $25 purchase. If you look for promotions, you can get them for at least half off... so you save $8.50. Thank god being frugal became popular; I don't have to be embarrassed to admit my ways. The meter increases can be seen as a blessing in disguise because it is way easier to find open ones nearby now.
