Eating at Wildfire is more like an event than just a dinner. It's also an event for my checkbook, but well worth it.  If you're a fan of rare steak, Wildfire will not let you down. They not only have the "rare" option, but "blue"! And you don't even have to sign a disclaimer! They offer several crusts to top your meat, my favorite being the bearnaise. The peppercorn crust is also very good, but a little too overboard on the pepper for my taste.  Their chopped salad is awesome - comparable to the one offered at Maggianos, and meant to serve at least two people. I've tried all of their potato sides and all have been perfectly cooked and delicious.  They have several good martinis, but I have to plug the Key Lime, which is the best I've had in this city. They also offer martini flights, nice if you can't pick just one. I'd recommend reservations, especially on weekends because the place does get packed. Also, some tables are in high traffic areas. Don't be afraid to ask for a different table if you think your experience will be ruined by people frequently stumbling past.
