For a hot bowl of pho on a cold day, this is the place to go. I always opt for vegetarian fare, and they have an entire veggie page which makes ordering easy. I tend to stick to the same thing each time and it doesn't disappoint. Appetizer: vegetarian rice paper rolls (which I could eat 10 of but limit myself to one order of 2) that come with a delicious peanut sauce that I hoard and hold on to eat with my meal. Entree: the vegetable soup - which is super healthy and contains tofu & about 10 types of veggies (and comes with a heaping serving of white rice). Dessert: I finish off the meal (if I can fit any more in my stomach) with a coconut - which is a coconut with the top cut off where you drink the coconut water with a straw. All this for around $20 or less.  One caveat, you'll likely be sitting at a shared table with people that aren't speaking your language in a cafeteria type setting.
