This place pays attention to its customers. A few years back when I lived over this way, they took over a small nameless convenience store. They started selling falafel as a little side thing. The people liked the falafel. I came back this March for the first time in years, and now everything about the place is expanded but the prices. The falafel sandwich is $3.95, plenty filling, and about the best I've had; the meat options are affordable as well. The space is larger and full of hardwood booth seating; any trace of the convenience store is gone, and there're a few more people on staff just to keep up with the steady crowd that streams through this place even on a weekday afternoon. Despite the rush, the server took the time to ask how I was and it sounded like he meant it.
