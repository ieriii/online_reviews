The Congress Hotel is more than adequate. My wife and I stayed here for 3 weeks, and whilst no one will confuse it with their actual home, we found it to be comfortable. We did not suffer the plumbing problems other people have mentioned. The mattresses do need updating.The bar downstairs is a great place to have a drink. Mike, the bar tender, is friendly and always has an interesting story or two. My wife really enjoys chatting with him, as do I. The whole hospitality staff is friendly and we make a point of stopping in to say hello when I am in town.The strikers are obnoxious, even moreso when one finds out they are actually paid to be there, and most of them have never been employees of the Congress at all. Their "outrage" is well compensated.The Congress is an old hotel, full of charm and ghosts. If you want sleek and new, head to the 'W'. If you want to experience of bit of Chicago history, the Congress will fit the bill nicely.
