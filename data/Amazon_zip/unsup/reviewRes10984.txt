I don't get why people cream their pants over Piece.  The pizza isn't that amazing and the appetizers are overpriced and not even good. I think people are just used to this place because it is the only real sport bar in the area. THE SALADS are amazing, beer is not bad (slightly generic--their beer tastes very similar to other big label beers) and live Kareoke is cool.  I think Boundary is bigger and better.
