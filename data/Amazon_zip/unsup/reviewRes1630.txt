Everything I have to say has been said by the 1073 previous reviews. Just want to say kudos to Doug for giving a sincere "Hello how are you?" to every single customer. Since there is always a line, he is always busy but he takes the time to say hi and gives individual attention to everyone. One more thing- yum.
