Yesterday,my three friends and I had a late lunch at Irazu. Although the food was fine the service was miserable. Upon leaving the restaurant, my dear friend spoke frankly with the waiter and told him that the service was poor. He became defensive and a bit loud. He said, No one has ever complained about my service in the six years that I've been working here. Finally, he apologized. I don't know the waiter's name because he wasn't wearing a name tag, nor did he introduce himself. The poor service was all we talked about on the way home. I'm sure none of us will be returning to Irazu anytime soon. And that's fine because I can make my own delicious oatmeal and pinolillo shakes at home!
