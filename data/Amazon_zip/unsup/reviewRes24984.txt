Artopolis is just about the CUTEST thing you'll find in Greektown. More importantly it serves up greek style coffee (frappes, nescafs, greek coffee) and they will ask you to indicate the level of sweetness, metrio (medium), glyko (sweet), and whether or not you want gala (milk) with that. Even more important, or impressive, is their pasty case, which includes greek and non-greek sweets. As far as their food goes, its good quality, tastes decent, but costs a little more than what I would pay for ($10 salad???). That being said, as a cafe, it's cheaper to get some greek food here than the restaurants in the vicinity. Also, the sandwiches are pretty good, they charge you more than a $5 footlong, but will slap a big spoonful of potato salad on the side for ya. Things I would recommend: Avgo-lemono soup: Chicken, lemon, rice soup. Nommy Artopitas: Pies with variety of fillings like meat, cheese, vegetarian. Mediteranneo Lamb sandwich: TO-Die. For. GALAKTOBOURIKO: the less-famous distant cousin of the Baklava, that is my favorite Greek food ever, creamy custard, in phyllo pastry with honey and orange syrup..... will take you to heaven (or Athens) and back. Loukomades: Fresh donuts, drizzled with honey and almonds. Pluses: Tasty bread comes with lunch is their own bread They open pretty late (but beware, if you drink greek coffee that late, you will be up for the next 5-6 hours) I have no bad thing to say about Artopolis, it is a chic european cafe with a great variety of greek taste. Service can be a little slow and seemingly inattentive, but thats just how the greeks roll. The hot greek bartender makes it all okay. For really amazing pastries ONLY go to the Pan-Hellenic bakery a few doors down (unfortunately closed at the moment due to fire).
