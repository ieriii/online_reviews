I came here for breakfast with some friends who were showing us around town. They recommended this place for brunch and it was a good choice! Good food, good prices, and good coffee :) We got a seat by the window and our waiter immediately poured us our coffee. He wasn't the most.. enthusiastic waiter I've ever met but service was fast so I can't really complain. To start, the four of us ordered a cinnamon roll to share which was heavenly. Perfect amount of cinnamon sugar and cream cheese frosting! After prepping our palates, I ordered the irish benny which was eggs benedict with corned beef hash instead of canadian bacon. Mmmmm it was sooo good! The corn beef hash was delicious and the eggs were cooked perfectly. It came with a side of potatoes (that I barely touched because I was working on the corned beef hash) and fruit. The bf got the regular eggs benedict which he finished (potatoes and fruit and all). Friends got the huevos rancheros and eggs florentine. Everything looked good, no one complained, and the bill was reasonable.
