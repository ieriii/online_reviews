1st dinner date with my now (was then future) husband. WOW....how do you out do this place? Oh, go again. :)  It was very very good, but I thought it was overpriced. Was I supposed to notice?  We had the scallops as an appetizer, a first for him. Unbelievably delicious. He had crab and I had tuna. Both were wonderful and I believe I can easily say that neither of us thought we had enough.  He ordered raspberry pie for dessert. I ate the vanilla ice cream off the top as I don't enjoy the seeds from the berries, but he said it was very good.
