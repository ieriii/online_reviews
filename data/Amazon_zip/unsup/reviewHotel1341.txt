Many hotels and restaurants receive five stars, but how many live up to expectations. The Ritz lived up to expectations and ratings in every way. My wife and had planned on going to the Ritz to spend a romantic evening out to celebrate our fifth anniversary. When the overnight babysitter fell through we brought our two year old with us. Who knew the Ritz was so kid friendly? In every way possible they did what they could to make us and our son comfortable. When we walked in, a Radio Flyer wagon of toys was brought out to us for him to choose one. Later that night a friend came to babysit for us while we went out to dinner. She needed the stroller to take our son for a walk and the staff graciously retrieved the stroller from our car and brought it to our room. The next morning, his plate for breakfast was a kid friendly one. In every way imaginable, the Ritz made our stay as comfortable as possibly. I wish we could afford to stay here more often. The only criticism I would have it to be careful when ordering room service. Its definitely beyond expensive.
