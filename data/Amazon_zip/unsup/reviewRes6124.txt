I love this place! It's a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant and it draws a tourist crowd, but the food is always good, consistent and the service is great!  I have been here on several occassions and you always know what you are going to get. I usually get the filet trio, well priced and always cooked to order. I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time. If you arrive early, there is a little bar area to grab a drink.  It's a great place to take friends or out of town guests!
