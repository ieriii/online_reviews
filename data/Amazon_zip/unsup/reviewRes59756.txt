Worst Pizza in Chicago, but #1 for personal abuse!I saw the sign - "Best Pan Pizza in Chicago." I've been seeing that sign for a couple of years. I saw some good reviews online, and then I heard (2nd hand) that it was great. So I pack up my daughter, and off we go.What we find is no table service - just a cafeteria-type counter and a lot of slices we can order. There's a nice variety and we order a few different slices to try. We find a table, sit down, go find some silverware (there is no waitstaff here at all), and start to eat.We discover that all the pizza we are eating is undercooked - the dough is raw, and the meats are still pink inside - totally disgusting! We take them up to the counter, and the manager refuses to even look at the pizza slices we're complaining about. "That's the way we serve our pizza, and if you don't like it, that's too bad." He shouted it so loud, the whole restaurant heard it.They didn't even refund my money. My daughter and I walked out with the whole place staring at us - I have never been so horrified by dining experience.
