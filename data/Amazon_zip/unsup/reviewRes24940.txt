I don't have any complaints. That's what people like to do here right? My artopita, stuffed with emantel and mushrooms was flaky and savory. The toasted sesame seeds on top really evened out the flavors adding some nuttiness. I had a bowl of the chicken and rice soup, which in classic Greek fashion, tasted of lemon. It too was good. These two items and a bottle of Evian for less than 10 bucks.
