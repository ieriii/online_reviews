It literally does not take a lot to please people these days. Although quite tasty at times and the service was decent and pleasant, the place is ultimately forgettable and simply not worth the $$$ price level. We did the $50 5-course prix fixe menu. The mussels were fairly good, with a decent thai curry sauce, however the portions were rather small. The duck breast appetizer was delicious and probably the most satisfying of all the items. The sea scallop appetizer was very good, but we got ONE scallop each. Just one. These aren't crab cakes, folks. The main entree of skate wing was tasty and the mushrooms were good, but the corn cakes were so-so and again, the portions were ridiculously small.  Throughout the meal, we kept thinking, "Is this it?" We don't need to take another meal home or eat Maggiano's-size entrees, but even after our 3-dessert plate and coffee (not even offered a refill), we got home and my wife pulled out the box of Cheez-Its because she was still not full. Neither was I.  I'm all for dropping some serious cash on a memorable and filling dinner, but $150 for two people at a BYOB restaurant and we're not even remotely full? Although the food here was quite good, we've eaten like royalty at Chez Joel, Le Sardine, Kiki's Bistro and Le Bouchon, with wine/cocktails for less money, and the food at all these places was as good or better.  Add to this the fact that the restaurant sits in our own rather low-rent Logan Square neighborhood and it's inexcusable. There are way too many other great places to go in this city. I'm almost tempted to give 2 stars, but I'm in a good mood tonight.
