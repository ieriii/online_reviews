Coast is one of my favorite go-to sushi restaraunts, and here's why. It's nicer (and pricier) than your mom and pop joint, but not a place that will break the bank either. You can come with a small group of friends, or make it an intimate date destination. Either way you play it, the great ambience + awesome fish + good service + BYOB = a truly stellar evening. What I don't like is the typical hour long wait to get a table. So imagine my absolute surpise and delight when I recently showed up on a weekend night, to a nearly empty waiting area (good for me, not so much for them, I realize). Either way we were sat within 10 minutes, and our server, a friendly redheaded guy took great care of us. Well-versed in the menu and the specials, he made great recommendations and let us continue to order as the rolls came out so we could judge our hunger on a roll-by-roll basis. Very nice. Some of my favorites are the spicy scallop maki, volcano roll, and the toro, kani, and hamachi nigiri. I also really enjoy the gyoza, and the hamachi carpaccio appetizer with the jalepeno and sweet sauce is pure yum. To be honest, I don't think I've ever had a roll or piece of fish here that I didn't enjoy. The real test? I recently brought my dearest sushi-lovin' companion, and Coast made him a believer as well. Sold!
