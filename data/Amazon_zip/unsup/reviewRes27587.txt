I called ahead on my way home from work to speed up the process (I was hungry!). I picked up my pizza to go and it's a cute, cozy place inside (Lincoln Park location) - busy on a Friday night. This was my first time ordering from Pequod's and my review is mixed: - LOVED the baked cheese at the crust - delish! - WONDERFUL tomato sauce on top, but could use more. - I was expecting more cheese - a very, very thin layer - WAY TOO MUCH BREAD (I ordered a deep dish, pepperoni). I'd say it was about 1" high of just bread/dough with 1/16" of toppings on top. The ratio was not what I expected at all. Guess I was thinking it would be more like Giordano's. Anyways, it was tasty and I needed to get used to it. Not sure if I would go there again, simply for the fact that it is a LOT of bread...
