I just wanted to take what Elise and Samantha said and run with it for a minute. Wilde isn't avant garde gastronomy. It is nice, cozy, and full of professional Lakeview types. that's great for the restaurant but not for people that listen to background conversations. I've never been disappointed in the food or beer but i've never wanted to call up the "Hungry Hound" either. If you live in the area than great for you...if not...no reason to travel.
