Mmm. The most romantic place on the planet, hands down. I love Gejas. The only complaint I have is that the small 2-person tables can be a bit cramped (that and hearing the d-baggy jerk failing to impress his date sitting at the table behind us), but if that's the only complaint, I'd say they're doing everything right! The cheese fondue is... so... good. The meats are amazing (and a lot, so be hungry), and holy cow- that chocolate fondue at the end. Mmm. The service is always stellar, ambience is amazing, and I always leave very full and happy. :) I love you, Gejas!
