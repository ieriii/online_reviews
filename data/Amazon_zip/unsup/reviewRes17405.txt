Amazing over the top decor ,great food ,wasnt too impressed with the drinks though ...kinda weak for my liking .BUt overall my experience here was good .Friendly service ,nice size portions ,good flavorful food .Try there arrachera shich is skirt steak served with beans and rice and smothered in chimichurri sauce .
