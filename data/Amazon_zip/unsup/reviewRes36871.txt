Love this place. Food is always amazingly good. Great vegan options. Swanky cute interior (although they're good with take-out and delivery too). Really, it's all just very good. It's a for-sure deal whenever anyone comes into town because I know they won't be disappointed. As a Vegan, watch out for not-mentioned-on-menu fish eggs hiding in things that sound legit (like the seaweed salad), but they're always more than willing to take it off, just need to be told :)
