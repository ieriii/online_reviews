Typically, when Italian cuisine comes to mind, I think of heaping plates of noodles, a side of meatballs, maybe that bottle of Chianti in the jug with the raffia wrapped around it. Well let Davanti take things to the next level. This food will knock your socks off. Small plate, big taste, lots of tasty wine. So many options on their very well thought out menu. I have yet to be disappointed by an experience here. A few of my favorites so far have been the Uovo in Raviolo and Polpo con Rafano. The wine selection features many unique and unusual wine that I don't see on my regular (often) trips to the liquor store. I'm guaranteed a great food coma and wine buzz by the time we leave.
