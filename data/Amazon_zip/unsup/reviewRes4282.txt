I thought this place was pretty cool but there were a few things that kind of annoyed me. Let's see...I think Kimberly Gordon has a pretty good voice (she sings on Sundays). The place is kind of small but I can deal with that now that its not so smoke-filled! I DO NOT like the constant shushing by the staff! I have personally never been shushed but they do it to others quite often. I understand that it's a small place and the stage is close but it's jut plain rude. Who ever heard of not talking at all in a bar? Oh...don't ever get the wine. NOT GOOD AT ALL! but the mixed drinks are OK. I say go for the music at least once.
