About a week ago, I really wanted some pizza. Sadly, the new Papa John's at Irving Park and Lincoln doesn't deliver to me. After reading the glowing reviews on Yelp about Fogo 2 Go, I decided to give it a try. I ordered a large Margherita #2 (yep, they have multiple margherita options) for delivery. The delivery time was quoted at 45 minutes to an hour. After nearly AN HOUR AND A HALF, the pizza showed up...cold and soggy. Maybe I'd try the pizza again for carryout, but with all the great pizza options around, I'll probably just go somewhere else.
