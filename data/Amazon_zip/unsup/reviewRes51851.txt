we knew we had to have deep dish pizza while visiting chicago, and we chose this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation. since it was still early, around 11ish, there was no wait, and we were able to score a table outside where we could people watch and take in the sounds of the city. the inside was quite big and had two floors. we chose a small deep dish pie, half vegetarian and half meat lovers. we were advised that it would be a 45 minute wait, to allow proper cooking time for such a thick crust. even though we were starving, we figured this was standard wait time and would be worth the wait. sadly, we were very disappointed when our pizza arrived. the pie was cut into four large slices, two of them veggie, two of them meat. the crust was made from cornbread, which appeared to be weak and nearly sank as soon as i picked up a slice. it was also soggy, probably from the weight of the veggies, but this generally isn't a problem, even with thin crust. tastewise, i was not impressed with the cornbread crust as it had a bland taste and the thick part of the crust was hard and very difficult to bite/chew (perhaps overcooked?) my hubby tried the meat slice and wished there was more sausage on this slice. he felt they made the pie entirely vegetarian, then sprinkled some chunks of sausage at the end, so it didn't seem quite as meaty/hearty. the only highlight of our meal was the minestrone soup (our appetizer while we waited for the pie to arrive), which was delicious, chock full of beans and veggies and seasoned well. but i'm sad to say that i came to gino's in hopes of having a delicious slice of deep dish, and left having a tasty bowl of soup with soggy pizza. i wouldn't recommend this place, as i'm sure there are much better deep dish restaurants in chicago (and other cities).
