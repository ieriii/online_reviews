After hearing a number of my friends extol the virtues of this place, I finally checked it out on Sunday night.  While the atmosphere was not at all what I expected, it's actually very large, a bit over-lit, and the seating is packed so close together one might feel a bit like a sardine, the food was excellent.  I've heard great things about the duck, though I'm saving that for another trip. This time I had the Peking Style Ribs and the Pork and Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Soup. Both were wonderful. Also noteworthy are the portion sizes, which are very large. I left having spent about $16 (excluding tip) and have now made 3 additional meals out of the leftovers, which have remained very good over the last couple of days. Major bonus points for that! While this is not a place I would recommend going on a nice date, the food is great. I will definitely be back soon.
