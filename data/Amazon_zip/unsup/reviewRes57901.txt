I can't wait writing this review. I just got back home after spending the 4th of July weekend at Chicago for the annual Ethiopian soccer tournament. Since I am from the DC area which is a 'home away from home' with the largest Ethiopian population in North America, I can confidently say I am in the best position to rate Demera. I visited Ethiopian Diamond for dinner a day before having lunch at Demera. In my opinion Demera is by far better than Ethiopian Diamond in terms of taste, food freshness, and service. It is really worth waiting to get a fresh order made food than eating an already cooked one like the one we had at Ethiopian Diamond.
