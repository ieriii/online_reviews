I have been to Tank a couple of times now and each time the food has been wonderful. The only downfall to this place is that each time I asked for no MSG and I am pretty sure they didn't listen...massive headache inducer for me and I was out for 2 days after the fact I can't say that any food is worth a headache BUT I will say it is very tasty.
