This is probably one of my favorite restaurants. I love love love the raspberry mojitoes and the guacamole. I could just fill up on that and call it a day; however, no I always get the pernil (pork dish with plantanes) which I also like (but not a huge meat eater). I am giving this 4 stars because I find their desserts to be lacking. Love the ambiance. This is a great place to take out-of-towners. If you haven't been, I highly recommend going, at least once.
