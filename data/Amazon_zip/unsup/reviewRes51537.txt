My family and I really like Garcias. The chicken fajitas are very good as are the al pastor tacos. The food is yummy and the lemonade is very good as well. My daughter has taken a liking to Shirley Temple drinks. We ordered one for her and the waitress didn't know what I was talking about (despite having a full bar). I told her to ask the bartender and he'd know what it was. And sure enough, she brought one back.  That's not really a complaint, but just an observation! I think I'm in the mood for Garcia's now.
