What a classy, classy hole in the wall. Ha! There's no other way to describe this little gem. We bought something like 5 dogs and a humongous bag of crispy fries with cheese for around $12. The steamed dogs were delicious and the fries... mmm. I really kind of wish they had "specials" more like your typical hot dog joint but otherwise it's an amazing experience. They serve the sort of hot dog that Chicago should be famous for.
