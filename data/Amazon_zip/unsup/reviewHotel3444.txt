My mom and I always stay downtown around X-mas to go shopping and have a fun time.We usually stay at the Omni and I have many a time stared out the window at the Allerton and wanted to stay there.I once saw a wedding or something going on on the top floor and it looked really pretty. To start our stay, the lady didnt have our res. but still gave us a room and assured it would get straighted up no problem. We didnt care so we headed up to the room in a teeny weeny elevator.Opened the door and tripped and fell onto the bed. It was about 2 feet from the door and the room was super tiny.I know its an old hotel and everything was smaller back then but damn it was tiny.Everything from the walking space around the bed to the closet to the shower. After I got over the ential tiny shock I saw the room was really clean and well decorated. The staff was really friendly the cleaning lady would pretty much jog down the hall just to press the elevator button for us everytime we were leaving the room,I loved that so sweet! So when we went to check out they still had no record of us even staying with them.? Weird but kind of scary I didnt get a chance to eat in the restaurant but it looks really swanky.I bet they have good food.
