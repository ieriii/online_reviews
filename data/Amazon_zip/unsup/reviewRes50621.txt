*sigh* As a southern gal living in Chicago for 9 years I was super excited when I got my daily candy about this place. The first thing I did was gather my Ladies Who Launch gal pals and made a brunch date. As a southerner I know what southern food should taste like. I was hoping the menu would be more authentic southern food, not GOURMET southern food that it's trying to be. We are going to try and give Big Joes another run for the money. Hopefully very soon. Still worth checking out.
