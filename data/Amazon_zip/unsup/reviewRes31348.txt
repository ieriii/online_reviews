Look I love meat......seriously........but this places does have fantastic food and when my friends are in from out of town that are vegans I have no reservations about bringing them here for the food. I have to say though the best part of this gem? THE PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE DOUGH SHAKES......................holy mother of Theresa! I dont know her name but she was talking trash about how she made the best one's and by god if she wasnt correct. I walked home in a state of bliss and I cant wait to go back and see what else this talented staff has to brag about.
