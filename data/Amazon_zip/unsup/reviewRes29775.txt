I crave you Chicago Diner from very very far away. I was gifted the cookbook and I was hoping I could replicate your awesomeness. It just isn't the same. One of the best veggy diners ever! The place is adorable and I love that you have to go through the kitchen to get to the outdoor patio.  They make the best seitan I have ever had and their bloody mary is amazing. Just go and enjoy!
