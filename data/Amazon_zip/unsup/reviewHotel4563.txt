This review is for Potters, the bar/lounge at Palmer. On balance this place is not bad, however; the service has been inconsistent on the last couple of visits. I came here with a friend on Saturday a couple months ago and found the place to be a perfect sanctuary: dark with plentiful bar snacks, non-hovering service, and an inventive cocktail menu. On my most recent visit, a rainy Friday after catching a preview exhibition at the Art Institute, the female server apparently couldn't be bothered. After ordering, it took a long time to get my drink (given that the crowd was moving more into dinner hour than happy hour), then again to get another round, and finally, the check, which another server, male this time, finally took care of. I would like to think that this lapse in service was not due to the fact that I was flying solo on this visit. There were also no snacks in evidence. Not certain if this is a new cost-cutting measure here or a sign of things to come. That day, the space also seemed to be filled with several young kids (think 9-13 year olds) as part of a family or other traveling group. Now, I am not anti-kid by any means, but these ankle-biters and their parents apparently didn't get the memo that children are to be seen and not heard.
