What a great find. I had 2 days in Chicago but it was so good that I went back again. The Ahogada is an absolute must. Mmmmm it makes me hungry just thinking about it. So tasty! The soft serve and churros were a great way to end the meal!  Service is ok - slow at times (on a side note you need to tip when you order the food which I find a little weird) but the food and cheap prices make this a must! Thanks Rick
