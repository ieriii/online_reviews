My roommate first introduced me to this place when we moved to LP. We were a little broke, but this place did not break the bank, even with a bottle of wine- that may have been cheap but definitely did not taste that way. I had the tortellini with alfredo sauce and it was great. Im really picky about my alfredo sauce, but they seemed to have it down! If you're looking for a place that's not too epensive but doesn't show- you must try them!
