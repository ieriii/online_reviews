Very disappointing stay compared to the Omni in San Antonio. Very inconsistent maid services, sometimes we had new towels, sometimes our bed was made. The concierge knew very little about tours, blues and how best to get around. We ordered a cheese platter, $18, so small it would starve a mouse. A bottle of our own wine went missing out of the room. We got it back, but were then very late for a reservation and there was very little apology and NO compensation for something that should not have happened.
