Very solid spot. Trendy + upscale without the typical pretense. We went family-style and had plenty of food with two apps, five entrees, and a few sides (for seven people). Pork belly is awesome as are the fries, green beans, & ricotta gnocchi. Excellent cocktails as well. Make a reservation & enjoy. We'll be back.
