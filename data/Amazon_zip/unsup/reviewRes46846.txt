I had dinner on Monday evening with 3 other colleagues/friends. This was my first visit and I absolutely loved it. The food is very good. We had roasted red pepper soup, trout, risotto, and gnocchi. Every person had great things to say about every dish. The service was also outstanding. Prices are not inexpensive but reasonable. Just love the concept.
