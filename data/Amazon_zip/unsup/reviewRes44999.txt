For a chain pizza joint, I guess it was OK. Unfortunately, the crust had very little flavor. The mozzarella was good as well as the sauce. We had a small cheese and a medium combination (can't remember the name), and it was more food than four of us could eat. I think I would try another pizza place in Chicago before I would go back to Giordano's.
