I won't support an establishment that treats its staff so poorly. I heard harsher words than those quoted by Hela V, but which aren't fit to post here. The owner seemed to treat his staff like imbeciles or disobedient children, not like adults he has hired to work for him. And this is what could be overheard from the front, I can only imagine what goes on in the back. The food is wonderful. The service left nothing to complain about. But I won't be back and would only recommend others take their business elsewhere as well.
