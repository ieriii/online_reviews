Let the tourists go get the generic, mostly-crust, flavorless stuff on Mich Ave. Head the Pequod's if you want the wait to be worth it. Every time someone came to Chicago, we took them here and they loved it. Great carmelized crust. Great toppings (but don't get more than 2 or 3, trust me). Great atmosphere - more like a sports bar than the faux Italian you'll get from Gino's, etc. The service is quick. Quality Chicago brews on tap. Expensive, and most likely you'll have to wait. But it is completely worth both.
