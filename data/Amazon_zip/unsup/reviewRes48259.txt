I finally made it to The Publican.  Beer selection made this sour lover happy! The oysters were the best I have had in Chicago. The raw ahi app with dill cream sauce and smoked roe was amazing. The ham sampler and a few of the vegetable sides were ok. For my entree I had the blood sausage, which was to die for! Apparently there was some confusion over who was serving us, as we waited for quite a long time after sitting and had to ask a busser for our servers attention. After that service was good. I will admit I am not a fan of the standing bar area, but the food was worth the uncomfortable wait. I will be back for more pig and more oysters!
