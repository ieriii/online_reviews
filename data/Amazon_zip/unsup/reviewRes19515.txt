Trip to the Gage was great on each end and a little soft in the middle. The service bordered on terrible, yet the reason I would return is one of two words: SCOTCH EGG. Does anyone remember the SNL skit for "Taco Town"? You know the one with the taco -Wrapped in a corn tortilla filled with cheese, then -Wrapped in a deep friend gordita shell slathered with green goo, then -Baked in a corn husk, then -Wrapped in a French style crepe filled with egg, ham, and other assorted savories, then -Wrapped in Chicago pizza, then... Ah, just forget it. Imagine all of that ridiculousness in fiction, now make it real. The Scotch Egg is a seasoned hard cooked egg encased in breakfast sausage, slathered with panko bread crumbs and deep fried. It basically is a whole breakfast made into an appetizer. It was pretty spectacular served on a salad of dandelion greens with a quenelle of spicy mustard. The soft middle was the Lamb Vindaloo. The stew had the standard vindaloo spice, but not the richness that I associate with the dish. The reason, I am guessing is the lack of bone used when making the stew. I wouldn't order it again. I'd just slap another scotch egg in the fryer and take the plunge. The other high point of the meal was the dessert. The Gage Smore was a lovely marshmallow, peanut butter puff on a chocolate graham cracker covered in chocolate with a marshmallow foam surrounding. It was incredibly rich and could have been shared. The service was abrupt and gave incorrect descriptions of the dishes ordered by my co-diner. I would expect more from a place that charges the prices on the menu.
