I went here for lunch with my friend a few weeks ago for the first time since he moved into the neighborhood. Upon entering, I immediately felt rushed to order. If you are not familiar with the menu, there is really no where good to stand and make a decision. (its on a giant chalk board by the counter) I also felt kind of rushed because the woman working the counter looked frustrated that I took more than a minute to make a decision. Once you do place your order at the counter, you find yourself a seat and wait for your food to come. The food was good. Nothing special, but not bad. I would say it is a mediocre dining experience. I would like to note that I was a huge fan of the Flavored Iced Tea. Another thing that I noticed was that the staff seemed agitated on more than one occasion. A woman behind me accidentally broke a glass during her lunch. She profusely apologized to the employee that came to clean it up, however the employee seemed extremely annoyed and didn't acknowledge the apology, or even say anything back to the customer. It was clearly an accident, and a simple "its ok, or no worries" would have been warranted in my opinion.  I would probably go here again for the location convenience, but would never go out of my way as as destination for a meal.
