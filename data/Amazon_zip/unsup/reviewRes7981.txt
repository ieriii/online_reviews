We were looking for a new pizza place to try out and through yelp found Spacca Napoli. Since the food reviews were good, we figured we could suffer through some bad service based on previous reviews.  We didn't make reservations but tried to arrive a little earlier and was seated right away. Our server was extremely outgoing and helpful and provided helpful suggestions. He was very attentive throughout the meal and was great in general. The atmosphere was very relaxed and comfortable. The menu was very simple with just appetizers and pizza. The pizza was delish and I loved the dough/crust. As newbies here, we were a little confused as to how to eat our pizza since it wasn't pre-cut and they didn't provide a pizza cutter so we just used our forks and knives. Later on we saw another table with a pizza cutter but not sure how they got it... probably just have to ask.  For some reason, I was really reminded of Italy. Not really sure why ... maybe it was the limonata! (which I absolutely loved btw). Now I want to go back to Italy! In the meantime, I will definitely be back to Spacca Napoli.
