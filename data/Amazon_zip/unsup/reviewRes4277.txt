One of my favorite places in Chicago. A beautiful old jazz club. I've only been early in the evening a couple times to hear jazz. What I really like about this place is the late night drinking-open till 5am it's a perfect mellow atmosphere. With live music playing and a big but not too rowdy crowd (I love you, mean bouncer man for keeping the riff-raff out). The drinks are CRAZY-expensive...but you're paying for the atmosphere and it's worth it.
