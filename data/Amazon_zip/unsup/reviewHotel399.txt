Just like coming HOME! We stay at the HGI when we are in GA to visit the grand kids and also stayed during a road trip in VA over the summer. Why oh why did I start this trip at the Allerton Hotel? I was MISERABLE! I guess I am just not an old hotel kind of gal so I gave "notice" and bailed on the reservation heading straight to HGI Chi-Town. Everyone here was wonderful (as is the case whenever I am at HGI) and the room is comfortable, roomy (the other place was so small my partner and I had to take turns moving from one area of the room to another) and I am now a happy HGI Camper!
