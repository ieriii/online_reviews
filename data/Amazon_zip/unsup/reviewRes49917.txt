The empanadas are delicious. The Combination Meat platter is enough to feed 4. Overall, the food is tasty but nothing spectacular. If you're a carnivore, you'll love this place. The vegetarian options are limited. The service could be better. We were informed that sparkling wine is not permitted for the BYOB, which isn't that big of a deal because we live next door and could easily run home and get a different bottle -- but if that's all we brought, I might have been peeved. The service is polite but slow. Prices are decent because the portions are huge -- definitely shareable.
