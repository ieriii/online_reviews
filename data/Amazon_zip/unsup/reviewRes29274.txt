I'd heard about this place through a friend. Seeing as I exhausted the whole veg/vegan scene in Seattle, I thought I'd give this place a try. What a knock out. Their vegan Reuben goes neck and neck with the best of the best (That's still Darby's in Olympia, Wa.) but it had one greater thing. An unholy thing. A vegan milkshake. A milkshake without milk that is BETTER THAN A REAL ONE. I wanted another after I had the chocolate chip cookie dough. The sweet potato fries were tasty as well. And they use that Level Up app. It seems like that's really taking off in Chicago. So that makes this place just a little more fun. GO HERE.
