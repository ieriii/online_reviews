Love this place..it has such a good vibrant feel !! The service is good and the food is excellent. They no longer make mojitos for you, but it is byob and you can make your own if you wish. I've been here a couple of times and one time it was packed , we were seated under the speakers and it became impossible to hear each other. the waitress actually sensed this and turned the music down a bit ! El awesome o !
