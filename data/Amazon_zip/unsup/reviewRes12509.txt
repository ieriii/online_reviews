Great Pizza all kinds of choices. They had a live band on Saturday night which made it alot of fun. My only complaint is we had to wait over 1 hour to get in. I have to say it was worth it. The server was a lot of fun and suggested great pizzas to try. I would definitly go back probably a little earlier so I don't have to wait as long.
