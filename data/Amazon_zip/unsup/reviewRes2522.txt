What can I say? It's Hot Doug's. True, you're going to wait a million years in line... but you know what? It's never not going to be worth it. I like to watch the few people who give up, grumble, and go off to find some other, less AWESOME place to eat. I say few because most of the line knows the rules of the line, and knows how worth it this place is. It's pretty sad what those few are missing out on. The special sausages I've had here are some of the best things I've ever had in my mouth.
