As a update, every time I sat at the bar, it has been a fabulous time interacting with the bartenders. Yesterday, I was speaking with one and asking about the Hibiscus syrup and method it was made. One other time, I was speaking with them about ice and the feature in the Atlantic about VH and we were able to try some different liquors to understand tasting differences. 4 stars = sitting at tables 5 stars = sitting at the bar If you are nice, friendly and and seem genuinely interested in enjoying cocktails, they will be more than happy to come up with their own drinks if you give them a few ingredients. Its a fun challenge for them with very good results for you. Just make sure its a time when there is some downtime.
