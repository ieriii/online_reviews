I get the Pequod's love. It's not just the pie, which has plenty to recommend it; it's the whole experience. You walk in the door and you know you're in a pizza joint. It's kinda dark, it's kinda noisy, the tables are kinda jammed together. And it *smells* like pizza. Walking in the door takes me back to the places I used to frequent in the 70s, like the old My Pie in Rogers Park. Back before pizza became respectable. Then there's the crust. Is it caramelized or is it burnt? They call it caramelized, and I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Because whatever it is, it's freakin' delicious. You get the same thing in an upscale restaurant, and they call it "parmesan lace." It's baked cheese, and it's terrific. The crust is pretty thick, as you would expect from pan pizza, and the toppings are plentiful, if a little erratic. Which is to say, slice one, where's the pepperoni?; slice two, loaded with it. The sauce was nothing special, but everything worked together to create a fine pie. Service was quick and friendly. The best part: they asked if we wanted to put in our order right away, before they had a table for us, so the pizza could get started. Nice touch. But they didn't rush us out at the end. I'm still at 4 stars, but I get why people give it 5.
