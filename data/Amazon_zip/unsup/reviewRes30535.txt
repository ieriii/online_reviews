Simply outstanding. While it was similar to some of the chain steak places, they changed it up enough to make a great experience! Service from the hostess to the server and manager was fantastic. No complaints, no issues. Great people. My filet was beyond perfect, and thankfully they serve it in sizzling butter on a plate a degrees shy of the surface of the sun. The sides were perfect too. If you are spending $100 plus per person, choose this over the high end chain places.
