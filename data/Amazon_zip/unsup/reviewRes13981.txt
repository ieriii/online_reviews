Have been here a few times and don't love the place like others do. Great selection of beers and friendly staff but food is very mediocre/below average. I have high hopes for the food based on the description in the menu but when it comes out, it just isn't exciting. Prime example is the popcorn topped with bacon. I generally love all things bacon but this dish is nothing to write home about. Fish and chips too soggy, mango pound cake really doesn't have much mango flavoring (you get the picture). Its not a bad place to go to but not a place I reccomend for folks.
