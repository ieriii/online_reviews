What's to say about this place? The food is good and it has a nice open feel to the restaurant. The interior is beautiful, making the dining experience that much more special.  Rainbow, Dragon and Golden Child are the best rolls.  Lemongrass beef lollipops sounds horrible - actually not as dangerous as it sounds- quite good. Actually like this place for drinks even more...recommend the Divine lychee, Blushing Geisha & the Sakatini. Nice line up. Lunches are more low key and the service is probably better for it, but don't often get the chance. Dinner can be hectic and you may not see the server or your food for some time. The kitchen is the Bermuda Triangle on the weekends.
