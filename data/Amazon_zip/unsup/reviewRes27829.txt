This unconventional restaurant run by it's eponymous chef is a must dining experience when in Chicago. I particularly liked the fig and cheese plate starter. The short ribs were my overall favorite dish. Two Paola Bella wines were a terrific compliment to the meal. The wine director and manager Michael was exceptionally attentive and helpful. This is not the place for a business dinner. It is a lot of food fun.
