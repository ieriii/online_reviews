I came here to watch the blackhawks game the other day just to check out a new place and I am glad I came. The place has plenty of tables to sit at unless you are picky and want to specifically sit on the patio. Upon opening the menu I saw a bold statement saying that this place was voted as having the best wings in Chicago by several media outlets.. So of course I ordered the wings, i believe the 16 piece, before the waiter cautioned me saying that these arent your average "buffalo wild wings" wings, these are pretty big chunks of delicious meat youre about to order and that he has never seen anyone finish a whole 16 piece by themselves. So i stuck with the 8 and a couple beers later my wings arrived and yes the waiter was right these were great big chunks of chicken glazed in delicious buffalo sauce. Definitely the best wings i have had so far in Chicago. Great experience overall, great wings, good beer selection. A sportsmans type of place as they will blast the sounds of the game while the game is on t.v. and will cut to music during commercials.. perfect!!
