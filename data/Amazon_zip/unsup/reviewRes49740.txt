This restaurant encourages the diner to think and consider their wine and cheese pairings carefully. Our selections arrived with information cards, which while nerdy, were surprisingly helpful. However the food is the real reason to visit Bin 36 - their mussels and agnolotti were spectacular and full of subtle flavors. Skip the creme brulee - the chef was overly enthusiastic with the blowtorch. Service is average but the ambiance is pleasant enough.
