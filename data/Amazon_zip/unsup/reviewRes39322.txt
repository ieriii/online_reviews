::Sigh:: I've been going to San Soo for quite awhile now. I was introduced to the place about nine years ago, and always found its niche-d appeal charming. The experience itself is unique and with enough OB and soju, quite a riot of a time. Being with someone who is going for the first time is also great. I love to watch their eyes light up when the huge tray of panchan comes and small dishes of unindentifable items are thrown their way. The unmistakable stink you leave with never really bothered me. But, I'm unable to give SSGS the review I probably would have in years past. The thing is, there are probably good, if not better, Korean BBQ places in the city that I've never gone to because this place is "THE" place to go. Honestly though, service can be borderline atrocious and the other night the bulgolgi was sub-par. I guess what I'm trying to say is, they have finally pushed me to the point of considering another place to grill my own meat. First-timers, by all means, get your feet wet at San Soo. But if you're a seasoned Korean bbq-er, perhaps you'll find greener pastures elsewhere.
