Maybe I'm out of date, but I love the look of Tru. The separate room for cocktails leads to a bit of drama when you are brought into the main room to be seated. The room is just pure class, very impressive.Service was outstanding, as we expected. The wine list was really interesting here, too.My only complaint was...the food! My meal was outstanding, but my three companions had mediocre to disappointing entrees. Maybe the mistake was not going with the tasting menu. We normally would, but were reluctant because we didn't want to spend 3 hours eating dinner (we had a late seating). Everything looked really pretty, but my companions dishes were just kind of blah. Not what you want from a restaurant like this.I still give Tru four stars, because the experience was great (and my meal was really good, even if my friends' meals weren't).
