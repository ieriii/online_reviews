When you're sick of your hole-in-the-wall Mexican standby and you want something slightly fancier than Chipotle, Garcia's is a good choice. We arrived on a Friday evening and the place was packed. It's fairly spacious, but all the seats were full. Even the bar was full. There's not really a good place to wait for a table, so we stood in the entranceway, getting jostled as people came and went. After maybe 20 minutes, enough seats had opened at the bar and we sat down for a bit. Quickly, our table was open and we rolled over to sit down. The ceramic tiles on the floor and the high ceilings make for a very noisy environment. This is not a good place for a date, but it's pretty good for a hang-out with friends. I had the carne asada burrito. For just $6, it was very large and very filling. The steak inside was good. I ate until I was full and kept eating until my plate was clean. As far as the complimentary chips and salsa, I prefer a much chunkier salsa than the watery variety that seems to pop up at so many Mexican joints. But the chips were good. At one point, I dropped some salsa off my chip and onto my arm. Without thinking, I scraped the salsa off my arm with a chip and ate it. Ridiculous, but I guess that's a sign that I liked it. Service was adequate. One server was dripping something from one of the plates when he brought it over, but it didn't drip on us. (Do I give him props for not dripping on us or dock points because one of our plates was dripping some kind of liquid on its way to the table?) Good value, festive atmosphere and good food bring Garcia's tres estrellas.
