My friend was raving about this place on New Year's Eve Day, after we had gone out on New Year's Eve Eve as if it were New Year's Eve. Follow? Irrelevant. Anyways, I can't officially judge their pizza just yet for two reasons: I may or may not have still been drunk which means my sense of taste was impaired along with everything else, and I got it by the slice so it wasn't fresh out of the oven. But I will say it was damn good. (There's no way I'm going anywhere near claiming it "the best" under these circumstances.) What really sells Art of Pizza for me is the prices. Subs for $4.95? Stuffed pizza for $2.75 a slice? I don't think they're even marking that up over a whole-pizza price. Ask me whether I'd rather have a "Five Dolla Foot Long" from Subway, a $96 sub from Qu**no's, or a $4.95 sub from an Italian pizza joint. No contest. The setup is kind of fast-foodish - order from the window, bright colors all over, not the most impressive decor. In other words, don't bring a date here. But do go there.
