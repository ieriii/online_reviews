Okay, let's just go ahead and put this out there. The best part about pizza is eating the leftovers the next day. Especially deep dish, because its had time to settle and become somewhat manageable with just my hands, which is another important part of my pizza eating. I have to admit, Pequods is my favorite deep dish in the city when I have time to go there and sit down to eat it fresh! The sauce is delicious, and everything just tastes like its had a little more care put into it than some of those over-touristy locations downtown. However, they tend to have a much thicker crust on the bottom than most places, and I just dont like Pequods as much the next day. It ends up tasting too much like a loaf of bread, with a bit of sauce and cheese on top. If I'm going to put in double time at the gym just to enjoy a slice or two, then I want toppings! Lots of sauce and cheese! I mean...if you're going to indulge, we may as well go all out, and bread just doesnt do it for me. They were quick to deliver for deep dish(45 min) but I prefer dining in. Also, something about all of the salads I have tasted has been a little off. Maybe its the fat-free italian that I dont care for. Who needs salad when you have pizza, though? Definitely give it a try though, maybe its just me and my weird feelings on deep dish.
