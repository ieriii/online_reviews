I've been coming to Wishbone for brunch for years. My favorites on the menu are the corn cakes which have a great sauce, the crab cake benedict and the red eggs. Ham is salty and yummy, I think the best side meat you can order. All large portions. I tried the shrimp and grits for the first time my last weekend. It is sinful. Cheesy and creamy and oh so good. Try it.
