Room was alright. A little overpriced but the view was great. The room had a musty smell like it hadn't been stayed in for quite sometime. Air conditioning was really weak and could barely keep the room cool. Valet parking is a joke, the line Sunday morning in front of the hotel was so long they recommended that we go directly to the parking garage ourselves. When we got there we had to wait in a 45 minute line to pickup the car. Overall horribly disorganized.
