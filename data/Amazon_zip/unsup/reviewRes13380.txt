The place is dynamite. I've never had a bad or even average time here. I usually go for food and a couple beers, but getting loaded in here is pretty good, too. The menu is very good, altho certain items will be a little adventurous for some. The vegan tempah reuben is really, really good. I don't know if you've heard, but they make their own beers. I tend toward their darker ones, like the Eugene Porter. The servers are on point, and not overly douchy. It is a little loud in there, so if you're going for food or a date, pick off hours. Otherwise, it's a good venue for many different affairs.
