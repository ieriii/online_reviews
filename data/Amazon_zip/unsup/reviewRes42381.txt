Gilt is good. And like guilt, It's not likely to be mind-blowing or life-changing. In fact, it would be a better bar if it had less hype. Then we could just drop in after work without having to make reservations days in advance, and enjoy a cozy neighborhood joint. The Gunthorp chicken breast was tender and served with skin on and whole cloves of roasted garlic (so I wouldn't recommend it on date nights). The pot roast was exceptional, although my hubby thought that the brussel sprouts he ordered with it were loaded with salt. The brownies a la mode came in 3 pieces with an option of 3 different scoops of ice cream, and the pistachio was especially good.  The crowd seemed to be in their 30s and 40s so a bit more subdued. Service was warm and attentive, and I liked the $4 table wine option. I did laugh at the signs on the way to the bathroom, they're especially helpful after you've had a few drinks.
