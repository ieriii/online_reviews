Never I my life have a been to such a pretentious restaurant with a wait staff to match. The waiter (who said he was the assistant manager) was rude and even though they took the reservation knowing that members of the party had food allergies, he refused to make the dishes according to those needs. In fact he told us quite obnoxiously "he would be happy to make us a reservation at another restaurant". To everyone who will listen....DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!
