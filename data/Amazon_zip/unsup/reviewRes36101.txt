I know this place can get quite busy on the weekends so I tend to only go at certain times. I have gone during the week at 1pm with no line and no wait- the best day is a Friday. I absolutely love the marmalade! I usually order the breakfast items. They have delicious egg scramblers, turkey sausage etc. The potatoes are awesome as well. When I have lunch here, I am so full the rest of the day. The other perk is that the service is quick! I once got my order within less than ten minutes.  One pet peeve: I went there on a "not so busy" day for a lunch meeting. My colleague and I were clearly still eating and the waitress kept trying to take our plates away. It got pretty annoying after being asked several times within a short period of time-- we got the hint that they wanted us out.
