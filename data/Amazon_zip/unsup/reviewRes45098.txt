It was a cold Friday night and I felt like drowning myself in a big ass bowl of warm, tasty pasta. We tried two of the pastas the first time we came and they were delicious, so I was pretty excited to get the full sized version of them. We ordered the braised veal cheek app to start off with. Good, but I had to dig through my memory banks for that one so I can't say it was memorable. We decided on doing 4 half orders of pastas, so we could have a mini pasta buffet at our table. We got the pappardelle with the braised wild boar (delicious), some kinda gnocchi (just meh, overcooked, mushy and bland), some kinda tuna infused spaghetti with capers and olives (the worst dish... it tasted weird and it was our least favorite by far), and dammit I can't remember the last pasta dish. Whatever it was it was just ok though. Soooooooo disappointed. Oh well, still a 4-star because of the prix-fixe.
