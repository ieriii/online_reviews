Alliance is a bakery that doubles as a decent coffee shop. The coffee shop part is a bit strange, because it's not attached to the bakery part. I don't know why they couldn't figure out a way to put a hallway connecting the two, but all right. You buy your coffee and walk down two doors to the 'Alliance lounge', a living room full of a mixture of vintage furniture, cafeteria tables, and absolutely dead silent people with their faces buried in laptops. There's a serious "college library on finals week" vibe to the place, which can be great if you're like me and you go to coffee shops to escape the numerous distractions in your apartment. Also, the 'lounge' is curiously lacking in outlets, considering how many students hang out here, and some are even dead. You guys couldn't spring for an electrician? The coffee was decent, but nothing to write home about. I also got an overpriced albeit delicious croissant. I'll be back.
