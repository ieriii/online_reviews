i used to LOVE Glens Diner until a particular experience. I went to celebrate my birthday here in February with my Mother and Father and was absolutely delicious! ( why we gave it three stars) We were paying our check when all of a sudden, one of the cooks spills barbeque sauce all over my mothers coat, shirt, and pants. It was my birthday, so my mom had her best clothes on. The cook along with Glen came to apologize and even asked to pick up the dry cleaning bill from my mom. We thought this was great! My mother went ahead and took her clothes to the dry cleaners and the bill came out to $75.00 because it was a heavy leather coat, her Ralph Lauren shirt and pants had to get a special treatment in order to take the barbeque sauce out of the pants. Well, we returned to Glens diner the following week and we personally gave Glen the dry cleaning bill that he agreed to pay for. He looked at it and was a little outraged when he saw the bill was $75.00 however he said he would send us a check in the mail. Its been 4 months and we have yet to recieve a check in the mail and is the reason why we will never dine there again.
