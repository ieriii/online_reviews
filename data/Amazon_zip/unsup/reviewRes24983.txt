Anyone who has been to the Melting Pot would know that this place is bad news to Fondue! Problems: 1-Our table for two was WAY too small for Fondue, we could barley function. 2-Decor = 1972 old, crowded and dirty looking 3-Service, basically nonexistent and I don't even think our waiter could speaking English... 4-Unlike the Melting Pot, you get NO options. There is a set menu 5-With one bottle of wine it was $100+ per person....pretty much for a pot of cheese (that you didn't get to pick), a very small crowded table and some meat...oh and bad service. Fondue is awesome and totally worth the experience & money! Just not here. My recommendation, go to the Melting Pot.
