*first Indian food experience ever* Restaurant is nicely decorated and upscalce feel to it. Lots of groups/couples dining on a Friday evening, we had reservations and were seated right away. Experience started off nicely with a serving ofcomplimentary bread and dipping sauce. Our friends had eaten Indian several times and let them order a variety for us to try. We were also with their toddler and we specifically asked that dishes NOT be spicy. We had a lentil dish, shrimp, chicken, lamb and a combination chicken/shrimp plate. We could not eat anything! I expected the dishes to have seasonings and spices to it but there is a big difference between spice and spicy. The toddler's mouth was burning and he was not able to eat anything even after we returned a dish to the kitchen to have it remade. The server kept passing our table watching us take big gulps of water and he even acknowledged that the food was prepared too spicy for us because our faces were red. We requested some cucumber yogurt to neutralize the spice (which in essence was equivilent to pouring dressing on a salad) The guys were good sports about the whole experience because they kept eating although I could see their hairline was damp from spicyness of the food. *did you notice i mentioned spicy 6 times?* The service was attentive and it looked like all the parties around us were enjoying their meals but for us, $200 for a meal we did not enjoy is a bit excessive.
