I moved from Los Angeles, expecting NOT to find any good asian food joint near my place in lakeview.....WRONG! Quote, Kat Williams, "This is my shit!!!" I didn't think I'd find a korean fried chicken joint! I ordered their wings, 1/2 dry and 1/2 garlic sauce and it reminded me of my mom's cooking. It is THAT good! Then I took a whole chicken home, 1/2 korean sassy and 1/2 garlic and it did not disappoint, even when eaten cold. I will however recommend you eat at the place your first time. Taking food to go will always lower its quality, since it will lose its heat and initial texture from frying. The owner was very friendly too. This is my new weekly spot!
