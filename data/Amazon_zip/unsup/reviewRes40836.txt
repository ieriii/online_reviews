An old standby for when you need late night tacos or anytime really. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about how great the food is. I think there's plenty of places that have equally great cheap Mexican. Especially on the West side. But if I'm pressed to name a good taco, this definitely makes the list. I have to say, I always liked the tacos at Big Horse before it closed down. It's really hard to give an objective review on places like this when you almost always eat there inebriated.
