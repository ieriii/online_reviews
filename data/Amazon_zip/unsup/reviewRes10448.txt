I read through some of the other reviews and agreed with the guy who wondered why there weren't any one star reviews. This place is simply not good for so many reasons. My boyfriend and I took his father here for dinner and were so embarrassed about our choice.  The host tried to push us off to the bar even though the tables were not all full. The food was all uninspired and it was not cheap! It was our first time and definitely don't need to go back.
