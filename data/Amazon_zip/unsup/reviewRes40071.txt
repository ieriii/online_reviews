Sure it was an hour wait on a Tuesday night......but the food was yum, yum, yum.  My wife is a vegetarian so she was a little concerned after looking at the menu online, but when we arrived they had a separate vegetarian menu for her.....which was fantastic. They even cooked the Welsh rarebit vegetarian, especially for her, which we thought was very nice. I started with the small plate scallops with oxtail. Fantastic. Then I had the venison leg......perfect.  The service was REALLY friendly from the moment we walked in and I thought the waitstaff was great.  If you're okay waiting around a crowded bar for a table, this place will live up to the hype. At least it did for me. Finally........great beers on tap!
