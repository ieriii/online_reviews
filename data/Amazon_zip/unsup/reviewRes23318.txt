Time out and Zagat put this place high on their list. I went there this September and would give it less than average review. The food is over cooked and underspiced. definitely not szechuan style or even close. the food over all is very sweet. I don't know what country this comes from. they didn't get the egg roll or the fried rice right that's all what i am gonna say. My wife and I ordered 6 dishes non of them was special. would not recommend this place. average chinese and not worth the trip to chinatown.
