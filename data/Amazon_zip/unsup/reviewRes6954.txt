We came here for my daddy's birthday last night. Made reservations for 4 at 7:30pm. Thank goodness we did because the restaurant was pretty packed for a week night! We arrived about 20 minutes early and they sat us right away. As soon as we settled in, we were served homemade bbq potato chips and a bowl of pickles! LOVED them both! The pickles remind me of how bread and butter pickles taste (my favorite pickle flavor!). We skipped appetizers, went straight for the main course. Our waiter (forgot his name) was patient and very informative with all the items on the menu. My mom had kobe beef rib with vegetables. The kobe beef rib was ok. Vegetables were a bit weird to my taste. Ick.. My dad, boyfriend and I shared an order of "competition" st louis full slab with fries (super tender, meat fell right off the bone!) and Q3- half slab of baby back ribs (not as tender as the full slab but still good), pulled pork (super yummy! esp when you use the sauces on the side) and kobe sliced brisket (mmm.. with sauces on the side!). We also ordered a few sides cornbread, coleslaw, kobe brisket baked beans and mac n cheese. I liked the coleslaw, the light flavor of coleslaw evened out the bold flavors of all the meat we ate, and kobe brisket baked beans, this is prob the best baked beans I've ever had!! It has so many chunks of meat and the right amount of beans. Mac and cheese was very cheeeeeezy, just the way I like it BUT it wasn't too warm.. it probably got cold during dinner because i eat super slow and i wanted to eat everything! I would definitely come back and order a LOT less. The restaurant is very spacious, nice atmosphere, prices are reasonable and service was excellent!
