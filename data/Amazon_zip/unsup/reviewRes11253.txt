I actually ate here twice this week.. First time I got the lemon toasted coconut pancakes with lemon cream sauce. They were tasty alright but pretty dry, and thick and heavy. I would of liked there to be a sauce that took away the dryness. oh well. three stars for those. very good hot tea- african nectar. good clean flavor. Second time- I found heaven in pancakes. Pancakes with toffee bits in them served with a buttery, warm toffee sauce and fresh bananas sliced thin piled all over the top. Perfection. Five stars. I will dream about them. Best I've ever had. p.s. I felt sorry for the girl next to me who ordered the strawberry lemonade and paid 4.75 to get a little juice glass. Yikes. For that price it better come served in a very tall tall glass.
