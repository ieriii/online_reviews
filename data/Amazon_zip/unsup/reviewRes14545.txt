The food is incredible. I have become addicted and have been here about six times in the past two weeks. The Cubano, Lechon, and Ropa Vieja sandwiches are excellent. I have no doubt that everything on the menu is terrific.  The only complaint I have is that they sometimes don't give me the wonderful goat cheese Empanada that I order, and I get beef or chorizo instead. It's far from the end of the world because everything is delicious and I'll eat what they give me, but it's a bit annoying.
