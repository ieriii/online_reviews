We had some friends in town this weekend and decided (split-second, mid-hangover) to go out for Sunday breakfast. I've driven past this place like forever and it's always packed, so we decided, hey, let's try it out. It couldn't be any worse than the 7 Bud Lights I had the previous evening. Luckily we got there around 9:30am, which was right before the crowds descended. We were able to get a table right away - which was great, because it took us about 20 minutes to decide what to order. So many yummy choices!  I ended up with a ham, mushroom, and cheese omelet with quite possibly the best cinnamon raisin toast ever.  And the potato pancake? I have no idea what they put in these things, but I could eat about 50 of them.  Everyone else's food looked awesome too - the table was literally silent for like 25 minutes. Of course, that could've been because we all kinda felt like shit, but I prefer to think it's because the food was so unbelievable.
