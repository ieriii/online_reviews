The roasted duck is AWESOME. They also have a range of fairly authentic dishes. The new location is spacious and clean. There is something inherently fabulous about poking your head in to see a bunch of roasted ducks (and a pig) hanging on a rack and being carved to order. They lose one star for sometimes being a bit disorganized, though that may be due to the fact that they just moved from their previous location on Argyle. Highly recommended.
