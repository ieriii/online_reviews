I have not been much of a yelper lately, and that's ok. Hence why the review of Sapori Trattoria came so much later. I was here with my parents for a nice dinner with some good wine. The service was great, and the wine was delicious. My food was pretty tasty, but it was nothing out of this world or exceptional for Italian food in Chicago. I may go back, but I would be more inclined to try someplace new first.
