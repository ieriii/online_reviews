I've been to this place twice and each time has been lackluster. While the waiters acted aimless and confused, the bus boys refilling my water seemed to be running the place. I had a very awkward waitress the second time around that never spoke loud enough. Though there were ample free tables she seemed keen on getting us out of there even after we had paid up but wanted to finish our drinks.  On that note, the mojitos are excellent; strong, flavorful, and authentic. My friend and I decided to split 2 appetizers thinking that at almost $10 each we would equal a meal, but not so. The coconut shrimp and the floutas were delicious but come on! We may as well have split an entre for all the food those 2 appetizers contained. If I get dragged to this place again I'm staying at the bar.
