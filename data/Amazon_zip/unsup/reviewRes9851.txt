Le Colonial is a five star date place restaurant. If someone asks where you want to be taken on dates 1-5, go here, as they are trying to impress you and cannot be visibly upset that it is pricey. I never go here on any sort of a dutch-based interaction. Once I took a guy here as a promotion celebration dinner, it ran me $150, we ceased hanging out a week later, and I vowed never to do anything like that again. Anyways, Appetizers: 1. cha gio, 4. chao tom, and 5. suon nuong (ribs) are awesome. Entrees 29. mi xao do bien (Stir-fried shrimp, scallops, calamari, & mixed vegetables over pan-fried egg noodles with a light oyster sauce) and 30. bo sate (sauted diced filet mignon with sate spice, yams, & string beans) are the only things I have ever gotten because they blow my mind. Additionally, order vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce (which tastes exactly like Hershey's syrup). Do not bother asking the waiter if it is Hershey's because 1) it is not and 2) he will be offended. I grew up with that choco sauce and I will stand by it.
