This review is for a delivery order - while I have eaten in this location, I haven't been there since the fire. My husband and I were happy to see LSC pop up on our choices on Grub Hub tonight; previously they hadn't been listed as a delivery option in our area (Bridgeport). Our delivery was estimated at taking about 1hr10min, but we didn't mind the wait because we were doing some work around the house. Amazingly the order came to the minute estimated - 10 points right there! My Ma Po Tofu (medium hot) was outstanding. My husband got the Tony's chicken with three chilies - we both thought the dish was kind of bland on it's own, but when mixed in with some of mine it was great. This is a nice addition to our delivery options, for those nights when we just don't feel like going out, or cooking. The added bonus of being able to use grub hub makes the whole experience totally painless (other than the massive food coma I am fighting off right now).
