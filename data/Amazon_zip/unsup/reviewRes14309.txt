I really enjoyed Glenns both times I have been there. I originally heard about the restaurant through a coworker who lives nearby. The first time I went I was super impressed by the quality of food, quick and knowledgeable service, and atmosphere in general. I am still craving the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail...they were out of it both times. But I have heard rumors that its BACK!!!! And my boyfriend and I will be there SOON to have more delicious food from this nice little place!
