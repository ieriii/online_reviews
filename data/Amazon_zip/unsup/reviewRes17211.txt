This place has really unique martinis. I didn't LOVE the one I got, but I know it's a popular one, so I assume I would probably be happy with other ones they make. The ambiance is just great... very mellow, pretty setting, and a great place to chill with just one or two other people and chat. I would like to check this place out again.
