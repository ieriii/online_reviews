As always, Simply It knocked it out of the park!! While the chicken pho is usually my go to, I decided to try the vegetable and dumpling soup. Their dumplings and soups are both amazing, so how could I go wrong? Total home run! The vegetables were fresh and crisp and the dumplings were delightful! I also love the tofu spring rolls, mostly bc they are 3 of my favorite foods all rolled up together: veggies, noodles, tofu. Yes, I'm weird I really do love tofu. I had the opportunity to actually travel to Vietnam this past fall, and let me tell you, this place is legit! Simply It is definitely not your typical Americanized Vietnamese food! Another reason that I felt compelled to write a second review is that I have never patronized a restaurant that values its customers as much as Simply It does. From the complimentary fruit to the carefully wrapped delivery packages, you know that each order is truly appreciated. What moved me the most was the little flier they included offering free delivery to people at Lurie's Children's Hospital:You may be more than a few steps away, but you'll always remain close in our hearts. So, to make your transition easier, we would love to offer you free delivery service to your new locationsSince they were neighbors with the old hospital, I would assume they got some regular customers and what a way to make them feel closer to home. It truly is the small things that count! I have unfortunately never dined in, but you better believe I will be eating at Simply It before summer's end!!
