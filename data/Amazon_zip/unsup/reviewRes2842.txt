Probably one of THE BEST RUN restaurants in existence. Minimalistic interior decoration, which for a restaurant, is perfectly fine. Some Andy Warhol art nonchalantly adorns the walls, I appreciated it. There's also a really interesting infiniti type of light/wall hanging in the sitting area before the dining room. The bathrooms, simply put, are gorgeous. So the menu. You can choose from a few different options; they have smaller two or three course options as well as larger tasting menus. Decided to go for their larger tasting menu which included seafood. I do not eat seafood so I was very impressed when told that the chef would re-create a menu without the inclusion of seafood. The staff will basically do anything for you here, from what I've experienced at least. We had a modified 13 course tasting menu; my standout favorites were the Frog Leg, the Liquid Parmesan Gnocchi, the Beef Cheek Ravioli, and the Roasted Squab. Supposedly Gale Gand's homemade rootbeer floats are supposed to be absolutely delicious, but I missed out on having one :( Definitely going back for that, and I believe that they offer a 'just dessert' dining experience as well. I believe the truffles and chocolates are also available for purchase if you want to take some home, and there's also a chef's table if you want to entertain a small group in exquisite fashion. Anyway, if you're looking for a restaurant that will give you the absolute best service imaginable paired with some of the most creative dishes possible, definitely make your booking asap and bring your credit card because Tru is absolutely phenomenal.
