I loved the Essex. We came into Chicago for only one night, and this was the cheapest, best located place we could find (right on Grant Park!). I thought for sure it would be some dirty, creepy hole in the wall, but it turned out to be very clean, friendly, and modern. The room itself was beautifully decorated, spacious, and clean, and the hotel had a great Art Deco vibe. The staff was super friendly and really helpful with recommendations for restaurants and directions to different areas of town.My only regret is that I didn't get to swim in that beautiful pool they have. We were too busy exploring the city to properly enjoy the amenities, but next time I'm in town I'll be sure to make time.
