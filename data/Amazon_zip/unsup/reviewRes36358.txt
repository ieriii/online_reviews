So, I have this reputation for being a little bit set in my ways when it comes to food. And I have this friend who's a vegetarian. And this other friend who loves us in spite of our dietary restrictions. We like to eat together. Guess where we all just had an excellent time?  We started with two orders of gomae-ae, which always strikes me as a combination I would have never created, though spinach and peanut sauce are delightful on their own. They are also delightful together, as it turns out. We scanned the sushi options (a mere part of the large pan-Asian menu) but couldn't come to a consensus, so we skipped it. However, there are several rolls I want to try in round 2.  Everyone chose Thai dishes: mixed vegetables with an especially flavorful broth for moi. The Adventurous One (as opposed to The Picky One and The Vegetarian One) had the foresight to ask about the level of heat in the drunken noodles. The waitress said that for her, it was mild. The Adventurous One said that sounded fine. Fast forward. It wasn't mild and it wasn't fine. My friend politely explained that it was too spicy to eat, and asked for milder replacement, saying she would pay for both. The waitress was very accommodating and brought the new version in a matter of minutes, which was just right.  We returned to our plates and conversation, periodically noticing the music (a lounge version of Radiohead's "Creep" and a remake of "Fur Elise" among others). The dining room was busy and carryout seems to be a strong draw as well. We were pretty sure the man siting next to us by himself was amused by our girl talk, but we were really enjoying ourselves so it didn't matter. Oh, did I mention it's BYOB? Finally, the bill came and our waitress had only charged for one of The Adventurous One's drunken noodles. This is one way to promote return visits, sure, but the food itself and overall attentiveness would have earned those anyway. I'm very glad to have made this acquaintance and will be back.
