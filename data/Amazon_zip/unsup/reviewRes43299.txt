Best. Pizza. In. Chicago. Period. There is an ongoing debate among my friends as to the premier Chicago deep dish experience, and I am steadfast in my support of Art of Pizza. The overall pizza experience is unparalleled in the city. What's that? Is it 6:45pm and you are craving a glorious slice of heaven filled with spinach and mushrooms and topped with sauce and mozzarella cheese? Are you really going to call My Pi and wait for an hour? Are you going to suffer whilst some lackey at Pequod's lazes toward your cold empty crust arranging your toppings? If you are me, the only question you are answering in the affirmative regards your craving for pizza. The fact that all of the best varieties of deep-dish bliss await you, piping hot on the corner of Nelson and Ashland is reason enough to worship at the alter of Art of Pizza, but the pizza itself is better than any other I have tried in the city. The sauce is slightly sweet, but perfectly blended. The crust is crisp, substantial, and flaky, but don't trust me; go find out for your self. The next time you are pondering whether it is worth the wait to order in from whatever deep dish spot you think you are in love with; find true love. Come to Art of Pizza.
