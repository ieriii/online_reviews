Probably my favorite restaurant in the city, but I am biased toward seafood. This past time around, we wanted to get a bottle of wine so they sent over their wine guy to make recommendations. The sauvignon blanc that we ended up choosing was very good. Started out with east coast oysters and a spicy tuna sushi roll. Both were great. After that, we ordered a crab cake and lobster bisque. For the main course, I had the sword fish, and my date had the surf and turf (Crab legs and 6oz steak). Everything was just simply fantastic.  Desert? SURE. Key lime pie was killer. Get it. This was one of my favorite experiences at Shaws, but its always a 5 star. Every once in a while, I like to stop in and just hang out at the oyster bar, get a half dozen and a drink and the service is always what should be expected at a restaurant of this caliber.  I will always recommend Shaws first when people ask me about seafood.
