I absolutely love this place. I work nearby and have been to Greek Islands both for lunch and dinner and it has always been fantastic. I highly recommend for apps the Saganaki (flaming cheese - does life get better?!?) and the Tzasiki with pita. Their greek salad is also completely classic and wonderful and goes well with any of their entrees, of which the Seafood Kabob is definitely my favorite thus far.  I've always been completely stuffed (usually bringing home plenty of left overs) and haven't had room for dessert but one of these days I will have to indulge. If you are looking for traditional greek food in a wonderfully authentic setting Greek Islands can't be beat.
