My boyfriend took me here the other night and absolutely everything about this restaurant was perfect from the moment we walking in. We were a bit nervous about how much it had been hyped up by fellow Yelpers and our friends and family, but it was the PERFECT evening! Food, cocktails, sake, service, everything was absolutely on spot. Other reviewers aren't kidding when they say it gets loud in there, but I think it really adds to the ambiance of the entire place. Will most definitely be back many, many times!
