This is a regular place for me. I am somewhat of a sushi snob but I really like the sushi they serve -- incredibly fresh and they offer a wide range of interesing rolls. It's also BYOB, so bring your favorite beer or bottle of wine with you (though I think there is a small corking fee). My only complaint echoes others' posts and that's that they really are overly attentive with the water. Nearly every time you take a sip from your glass they are filling it up and it is very disruptive to the dining experience.
