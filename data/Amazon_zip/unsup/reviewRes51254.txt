Oh Garcia's! I remember when you were just a narrow stretch of a restaurant between Western and Lincoln. Now you've flourished into a beautiful cantina style place for gathering and dining ( and your amazing food of course). The only problem I have with this place is the fact that the acoustics of the building don't absorb the noise. Naturally, with this restaurant being so good it's always busy. That's the problem. The noise. If only they had some kind of insulation in the celling that would absorb that noise. Something! That won't stop me from dropping in at least twice a month to get a big a$$ burrito. Or maybe their amazing soup? How bout the rice? No one can top their amazing rice. How do they get it so fluffy?!!??! My Vegan girlfriend loves the avocado tacos and veggie fajitas. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Horchata and Lime-ade. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE AMAZING AND BOUNTIFUL CHIPS AND SALSA! That's it. I can't finish this review. I'm going to Garcia's....See you there!
