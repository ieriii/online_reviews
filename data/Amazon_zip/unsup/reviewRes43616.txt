Kinzie Chop House is a solid choice for steak, slightly off the tourist path. I went here for a business dinner the other day and was basically pleased with my meal. Since it's a steakhouse, let's start with the steak. The server came out after taking our drink order, carrying a huge platter with shrink-wrapped cuts of each of their available steaks. I know this is part of the tradition at some places, but his explanation started out well, then veered into a remedial class for the steak-impaired. Keep it sweet and to the point! Anyway, I tried the dry-aged delmonico, and it was excellent. Well prepared and well seasoned, so no complaints there. The non-steak part of the meal, however, didn't live up to the standard set by the steak. We started with the blackened scallops which were cooked well but too salty. For sides we had Brussels sprouts and mushroom risotto. The sprouts were tasty, but the risotto was really sub-par. Salty and sticky and everything risotto is not meant to be. Perhaps it serves me right for ordering risotto at a steakhouse instead of a trattoria, but it really bummed me out. So, a 5 for the steak and a 3 for the sides--averages out to a 4-star meal. Very good, but not perfect.
