Just went here for the first time and can't believe I'd never been there before. I went for a party and was not in charge of ordering, so I can't speak of the menu, but I am a really picky eater and everything the hostess ordered was yummy!!! What a shock. It's not going to replace your favorite pizza, but it's a nice change of pace! We had a small party area, but the rest of the place was packed, so I'm not sure what the deal is with getting a table.
