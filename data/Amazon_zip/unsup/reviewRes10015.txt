Four of us went to the resturant on last Sunday night with reservation. Food quality was excellent. Service with some recomendation was A plus. We order 3 appetizers, 2 pastas, 2 main courses to be shared by four people. That was just enough for us. This is one of very few Italian restaurant we like. Kenji
