This is the first time I've been back since they moved to the HUUUGE location. I was hoping and praying that bigger doesn't mean crappy food. And no worries were ever needed! Although they definitely need to get a better feel for the larger spot, get more servers and create more order, the food is as good as ever and that's all I can ask for.  In all it's delicious juicy glory. My bf and I had half the roast duck, which I haven't had in a long time cuz I always ordered the pei par duck and I have to say, no more pei par duck for me! The green onion & ginger blue crabs. This is definitely hard to eat-the table next to us stared in horror for at least 15 minutes after they finished eating cuz we probably looked savages eating with our hands and too busy stuffing our faces to talk. The green beans and pork is one of the best I've had, super flavorful and they don't skimp on the pork. And the beef & veggie chow fun is good but definitely got neglected due to the massive amount of everything else, but no worries, that just means I have lunch for tomorrow! AND of course a large bottle of asahi to help everything go down smooth! I always say, you know the food is good when conversation completely stops. TOO BUSY EATING! Conversation can wait but the delicious duck is getting cold! This place is gluttony heaven. Thank god they got a larger place and more people can experience the amazingness of sun wah! p.s. if all that isn't awesome enough...they used to have $5 bottles of Matilda which usually go for $15 at other restaurants. Now it's $6.5 and still the best deal in town! shhh don't tell too many people! p.p.s. I once came here 5 times in 4 weeks. I think me and Sun Wah are besties 4 life.
