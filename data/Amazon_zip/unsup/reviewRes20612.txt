XOCO was my first Rick Bayless experience and I must say it lived up to the hype (and believe me, there was a lot of hype). We had a couple tortas, a soup and guac and it was all amazingly delicious. Especially the guac...my tummy is growling as I write this. Can't say much more about the yummy food, so thought I would address two of the complaints I've heard a lot: the portion size and the wait. First, I had heard that the tortas were small and that you had to order two. Not true at all. I was stuffed and couldn't even finish mine. I wanted to take half home, but unfortunately its not quite made for carry-out. Three of us shared the guac and I must admit that I felt the portion there was small for the price. Definitely not enough for 3 people considering I could have had it all to myself. Second, the wait. Now, I've only been here once and it was a little cold and snowy, but it was a friday night around 7p and there was no wait at all when we got there. I don't know if it was luck of the draw or the weather, but I feel pretty lucky to not have had to wait. That being said, it's worth at least a half hour wait, maybe more. I would definitely go back. Though I think I might have to try out Frontera next.
