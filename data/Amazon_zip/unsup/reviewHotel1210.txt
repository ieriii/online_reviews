One word: "eh".  Having stayed closer to the center of town, this place seemed really really really far away from everything. Oh, did i mention it's like, really far away?? Ok, to be fair, they shuttle you into downtown, but ha! guess what? NO shuttle back! [sucka!]  Negatives: The room was average, we had a two bed room. I didn't like that the bathroom was open, (ie: no door to the sink area) b/c then that means if you get up earlier or in the middle of the night, the other person can hear you.  The deco was ok, very modern feel, but lacked since there wasn't a microwave.  Positives: Did like that the shower was separate, had decent toiletries. The floors were updated with granite, but average counter tops. Next door to some sort of rail system but is not the "el" as Chicagoans call the subway. FIVE STAR aspect: GREAT GYM. Really new and updated equipment. Free water, towels and headsets.  hmm, i just basically said that "if you are a work out fanatic and plan on staying indoors during your whole stay, then THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU my friend!"  Overall, i don't think i would stay here again unless i had to; and had an expense account for the taxi rides...
