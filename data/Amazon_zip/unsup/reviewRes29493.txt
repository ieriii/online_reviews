It seems that everyone's always raving about how great Frontera Grill is. So me and me dear old mum decided to head there for lunch to see what the big deal was. So does it live up to the hype? Yes, indeed! I had the black bean tostadas, which were exquisite. My mom (and almost everyone else at the restaurant it seemed) had this lamb dish. It was okay, but this is coming from a person who despises lamb. We got there about 15 before it opened and there was already a good amount of people waiting to get in. But it's worth the wait. Definitely planning on coming back.
