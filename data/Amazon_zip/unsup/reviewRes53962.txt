The empandas were so delicious (creamy goat cheese, and goat cheese/guava served with an oil/cilantro concoction). And the veggie dinner plate was solid, with surprisingly flavorful grilled veggies. But maybe I wasn't in the mood that night for a veggie dinner plate; I can't help but feel like maybe i missed the boat and should have gotten a sandwich instead.
