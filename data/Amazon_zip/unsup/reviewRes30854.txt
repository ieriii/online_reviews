Great steakhouse, with wonderful atmosphere, and excellent service. I ordered the Bone-in Ribeye, which was perfectly done, served up on a steamed hot plate. The side dishes were okay, but the meat more than made up for it. Be prepared to pay for such an experience. The meal averaged $175 per person for our party of eight.
