I used to work across the street from here, so we would go for lunch from time to time. I have been here over a dozen times, and it never fails to disappoint. The food, service, and atmosphere is unrivaled. People with dietary needs are easily accommodated (gluten free and dairy free) I've never had a bad server-ever. Josh was our server last night and another time before, and he's great. When people ask me what Chicago restaurants stand out in this town, I invariably take them here to experience this place. If you live here and haven't been here, leave the cave you've been hiding in and give it a shot!
