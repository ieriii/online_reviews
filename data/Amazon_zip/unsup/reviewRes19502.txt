I've heard good things about Coast and it was extremely busy when I went which should be a good sign... I'm not one to complain too much about restaurants but I was extremely disappointed. Soft shell crab app was oil logged so much so that there was a puddle of oil on the plate. The ceviche was fine but everything in it was pre cooked and the sesame cracker was noticeably stale. Sushi was mediocre, extremely thin sashimi for the price.... Service was good at least. I understand hot food being mediocre at sushi restaurants but the sushi should make up for it. If the food was not so pedestrian the lack of execution maybe wouldn't have been so bad. I just don't understand how busy it is. Just for scenesters who don't like food I guess.
