I've always kind of liked this place but felt that more often than not I was ordering "the wrong thing." I think what I decided last night is that the food is probably pretty good as long as you steer clear from anything that has black beans in it. Last night a friend and I had some buffalo wings (better than they should have been), a salad, the titanic seitan burger, and two slices of cake. Everything was really good except the mac and cheese that came with the sandwich didn't really do it for me. Often when I've been there I've had these hipster male servers that just seem really annoyed all the time. Last night though we had this amazing server that seemed to be made out of lesbian pixie dynamite. I'm not sure if she's actually a lesbian but there are some kind of superpowers going on inside that girl and in a perfect world, she'd be cloned so she could be everybody's server at the Chicago Diner. Also, I got to sit on the patio for the first time. I imagined it being uncovered, which it wasn't, but I still found it much more pleasant than the dining room, which can seem a little uncozy and cramped. I could eat out there once a week. There's always some anxiety about the place being unexpectedly packed though. Is there a down time in this place?
