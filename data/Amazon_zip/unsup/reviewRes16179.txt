On the outside an unassuming warehouse; on the inside a burst of color and panache. It really felt like my friend and I were at a Carnivale celebration. My friend who had just visited Chicago and recommended this place. I am glad we followed her advice! We started with the Ropa Vieja. It was amazing. The meat was incredibly tender and the plantains were the perfect complement. We also had the ceviche as an appetizer. I thought it was okay-- the chips were my favorite part, although the fish did taste fresh. I also had a strawberry mojito and it was delicious! The perfect pairing for a Latin fiesta! For dinner, I had the chuleta. The pork chop was pretty tasty, not dry. However, I didn't like the sauce very much, so that dish was okay in my book. Finally, we ended with the blueberry tres leche cake. I have never had a tres leche cake before, but the the moistness was a nice unexpected surprise. The blueberry flavor wasn't overpowering, so that was nice. Overall, the dinner was pretty pricey ~$100 for the two of us. But, we had a great time and we were on vacation!
