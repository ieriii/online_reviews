I'm going with three stars because it really seems to depend on what kind of day Caro Mio is having when you are there... The first time I went I would say it was a solid FIVE star experience. Best. Gnocchi. Ever. The second time was with a large group that I brought there and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal, plus being BYOB is always wonderful... the wine flows freely! However, the last time my husband and I went, it was a pretty "meh" experience. The Olive Garden is better than this last experience.... I'm VERY sad - I thought I had found my new go-to spot for homemade pasta and was really looking forward to frequenting this adorable little neighborhood spot with the exotic staff. I'll be back to try again because everyone has an "off" night... but this is Chicago and there is far too much wonderful Italian comfort food competition for an inconsistent restaurant to survive.
