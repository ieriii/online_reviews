this was my second time having ethiopian. it was delicious! the injera wasn't too vinegary but still very filling. my favorites were the beets and yellow chickpeas (i think that's what they were...). the meats were good, too. we also had the vegetarian sambussa. it was delicious but oh so spicy! i wasn't prepared for the heat! make sure you have some injera or water handy. all the servers were attentive, stopping by to chat. our serve that took our order was SO ADORABLE! she had this awesome hairdo...she was so cute like a polly pocket! overall, great atmosphere, great food, good service, and good times!
