I would have given this place better marks if the service had been up to par. That aside, the room was gorgeous and some of the dishes were very good. The Kobe beef was divine as was the firecracker roll. The garlic noodles with blue crab were a bit bland and lacked presentation. I know this is the "be seen" place these days, however, I received very little attitude. The staff was warm and genuine. I would return but I am not sure what all of the fuss is about. Red Light did it better but, alas, it is gone for now.
