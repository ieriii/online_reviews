Doh! Why didn't I come here before?! This place was fantabulous (yeah, I used that word, so what). We thought it would be good to try some new food over Memorial Day weekend. There were four of us and not one person had anything negative to say about the food. Here's what we ordered and shared: *Avocado Wonton - like a crab rangoon, but with avocado. 3 stars *Chef's Hung Choice - vegetarian rolls; must like veggies. 5 stars *Catfish in a Clay Pot - delicioso!. 5 stars *Pineapple Calamari - wish it had been served in the pineapple, but it wasn't in season :( Still. 5 stars *Crispy Tofu with Pineapple - not big on tofu, but the others loved it. 4 stars *Tofu and Eggplant - it's cooked the same way as the catfish and tasted just as good. 5 stars Not only was the food great, but love that's it is a BYOB with no corkage fee. It made our meal so much more inexpensive. And, there's a CVS on the way to buy something if you're walking from the train. Also, unlike some BYOBs with no corkage fee, this one did cork the wine for us and chilled it on ice for us. We made reservations, but came 15 minutes early and didn't mind waiting. However, the owner was so sweet and kept reassuring us that our table would be clean soon and it was. All in all, this was a great experience and will definitely be coming back!!
