Three people walked into a bar, and one ducked...... (Crickets) I wanted to start my Sun Wah review with a Duck reference, since the best way to enjoy Sun Wah is through their Peking Duck.....Could you come up with a better one? No you couldn't.... Sun Wah has some of the tastiest Chinese fare outside of China Town, but the highlight of this Mecca of Magnificent is the Peking Duck. It is crispy, and smokey, and delicious. The waiter will come by, and butcher the duck tableside, making it manageable, and fun.  The crispy skin, and succulently decadent meat now await your next move, which is to put together your lil' buns. The Duck is served with fresh steam buns, some pickled veggies, and sweet duck sauce. You build them like you would a taco, and enjoy. The smile that overtakes your mouth at this point is normal, don't feel shy. In addition to the duck, the egg rolls, and wonton soup were wonderful. Neither were too greasy or oily, and both were very flavorful.  This place gets PACKED on the weekends, so be sure to come in at an off time, or come in with a little bit of patience, it is well worth the wait.
