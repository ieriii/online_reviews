Did Piece for the first time on a Tuesday at lunch time. Therefore, no parking problems, wait for a table, or slow service. The beer is very good. We tried the Belgian white, the weizen, and were blown away by both. The pizza is also very good. I'm sick of Chicago style and how heavy it is to eat. We had the white style with meatballs, bacon, black olives and goat cheese. It was the best pizza I've had in a long time. I hope a suburban location is in the future cards for these guys.
