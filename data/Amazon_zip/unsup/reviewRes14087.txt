This place is beyond delicious. I've been wanting a good cuban sandwich, plantains, and yucca. I ordered the Bistec sandwich (phenomenal) and tried my boyfriends Media Noche sandwich which was also out of this world. We also ordered a side of malduros (plantains) and yuca con mojo (yuca with garlic). The Bistec sandwich was juicy, simple, and everything someone could ever want in a sandwich. The Media Noche was as savory as it gets. The Malduros were perfect and the yuca con mojo was like nothing I have ever had before. The garlic sauce on this was really something I cannot even explain. I also had a can of ironbeer, DELICIOUS! This place is EVERYTHING I could ever want in a place.
