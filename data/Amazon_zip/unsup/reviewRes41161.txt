I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE. Value, service, food and free street parking-what else can you ask for? I love the 7 plate Sunday night dinner-flavors exploded off the plate. Waiter, who was also the general manager was attentive, but not overbearing. The BYOB helps keep the tab down. Resos are a MUST and you are welcomed by name when you walk in to this 25 person restaurant in a nondescript section of Logan Square. I can hardly wait to go back!
