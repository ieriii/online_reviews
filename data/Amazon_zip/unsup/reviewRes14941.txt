i really really hate the type of crowd this establishment brings but i was so impressed with our meal (bruschetta, smoked pulled pork sandwich, lentils and vegetables, cherry bourbon cake) that i know i'll be coming back here on a regular basis. p.s. get the cheddar beer soup if you want a mouth orgasm.
