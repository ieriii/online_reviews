We went on Saturday, arrived at 5:30pm. The line was long but was expected. The hostess told us when we arrived that it was a 30 minute wait. She served the larger groups, and she kept telling my husband and I it was a few more minutes. This lead to waiting an hr and 15mins!!! I can't believe that it took this long to seat 2 ppl. I ordered the Seafood caldos, it was ok, nothing special, there good amounts of shrimp. My husband had the Ahogada, the meat was good but the spicy chile sauce was awful, had a bad after taste. The side salad was ok but the churro was the best thing we had, but it was slightly too sweet. Overall, it's definitely not worth the wait, had better. We love Rick Bayless so we wanted to see what Xoco was about. I rather have waited to eat at Frontera grill.
