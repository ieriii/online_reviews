This place is a gem! Southern food on a slighty higher scale. Good date spot, with a decently priced prix fixed menu. They brought us some homeade crackers with a pepper jelly to start (no charge), and they were a nice touch. I enjoyed the Creole Duck Confit Salad - defintely an entree and not a before meal salad.The drink to try is the Carolina Julep. It is deadly, and I mean deadly as in you can't taste the alcohol at all, which means downing two or three could put you out if you aren't careful. Our server was quite attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, and strangley all the servers there tonight were tall, thin dark headed males. Very interesting. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was the noise level and lack of acoustics made it difficult to hear my friends across the table. Otherwise a great experience!
