I would give Hot Doug's five stars for sure for being the only place in this city that not only has great veggie hotdogs but veggie corndogs as well. I'd even give six because everyone that works there, including Doug, seems so damn nice and on top of things. Unfortunately, the wait is so prohibitively long and just infuriating that there is no way I can continue to promote it. It literally makes me furious to see a line that long, and I give everyone the bird when I drive by. I am officially boycotting Hot Doug's.
