Comfort food TO THE MAX! I came here to visit with some friends and it was delicious. Just the way Korean fried chicken should be. We got the $19.99 deal with the whole Sassy fried chicken and 2 sides (fried mushrooms and something else that's supposed to be healthy. I think we got the greens.) A note on the sides: fried mushrooms -- little pockets of fried deliciousness. The chicken was perfectly crispy and I could probably eat this forever. I hear really good things about the bibimbap and the buddha bowls, so don't discount those! Great neighborhood joint and crave-alicious place to go when you just want to eat til you fall asleep.
