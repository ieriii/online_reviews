I had 10 strips (not wings); half with Seoul sassy sauce and half with the crisp BBQ sauce. The Seoul sassy is authentic. Honestly just like my mom used to make. It's that soy/brown sugar marinade that many are familiar with. The crisp BBQ sauce was also very good, seemingly made with the traditional pepper paste used in much of Korean cooking. My girlfriend had the bad boy Buddha bowl which is basically just bi bim bop but smartly renamed for American diners. I've had plenty of bi bim bop and this was right up there. It's kinda hard to screw that up though. My only complaint is that the place is kinda cramped but any restaurant on that section of Broadway is pretty much the same. Also, kinda steep. The bill was almost $30 for the both of us. Will def go back!
