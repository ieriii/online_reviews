Wow. This place is a destination. Huge restaurant, decorated in the style of Greek islands. Very interesting decor. Food was good, I had the lamb sandwich, which was extremely tender and flavorful. My friends were less thrilled with their selections, but we still enjoyed ourselves. If you like flaming cheese and singing waiters, check it out.
