If there is one thing I miss about America... this is it.My friend started taking me here this summer and... oh man. I don't even know where to begin with how delicious and wonderful this place is. We always get there pretty early to avoid an incredibly long line, but I'd even go there if I had to wait two hours. It's so worth it! Doug is amazing and is so friendly that your wait seems like it never happened. The specialty menu is divine, along with their everyday dog and sausage offerings! I've had so many things now I can't even remember, but I always love getting a boring ol' dog with celery salt, tomatoes, and onions. Yum!I'll go back there any time I'm home. Love it, love it. The music is always good, too!
