Enjoyed brunch on 2/12/2012. FANTASTIC! The cold seafood bar is worth the price alone! Enjoyed items that you usually do not get at an upper scale brunch. Were talking oysters on the half shelf, crab leg bites, Maki, duck trap salmon pastromi, seafood ceviche, the list goes on. Definite special occassion restaurant, great place for a date night/romantic evening. Dinner also hightly recommend.
