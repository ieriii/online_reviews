I went here for my birthday based on a friend's recommendation. I have had my share of restaurant meals in Chicago, but this place absolutely stands out plus won't break the bank for a top-notch meal. My friend and I shared the sweetbreads with buffalo sauce snack, the foie gras appetizer, the duck meat loaf, an agnolotti special, the wild boar sloppy joe, the sundae, and the corn churros dessert. While I liked everything we ate, the heroes of the night were the sweetbreads, foie gras, and churros. Foie gras - prepared with an unreal pear puree and other fruits and served on a piece of waffle. This dish is in the category of best things I have ever eaten. The foie was incredibly smooth, I never knew pear puree could be such an exciting accompaniment, and the texture and taste of the waffle were perfect complements. Sweetbreads - tender, tasty, and served with a little spice in the sauce, a refreshing sour cream-type side, and some matching carrots. Corn churros - served with corn pudding and dulce the leche sauce. Not too sweet, creamy, and quite unique. My friend very much enjoyed his whiskey that the waiter recommended as well. I think Chicago can be very hit or miss when it comes to nice restaurants, and this place is a total gem. These guys entirely deserve their Michelin star and more.
