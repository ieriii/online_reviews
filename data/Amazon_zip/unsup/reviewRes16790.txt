What a refreshing alternative to the typical Indian Restaurant.  I went to India House for dinner on a Sunday evening around 6:30 PM and the restaurant was surprisingly full. The staff was so incredibly friendly and kind I was in awe by the professionalism - from my server to the bus boy and the owner/manager (not sure whether she was the owner or the manager). The restaurant is very clean, they make great use of the space (privacy for large parties that are separated by curtains) and I also really liked the open kitchen.  Now for the food... We both had a non-alcoholic drink, I had the lemon soda with salt and it was very tasty. My dinner companion had the yogurt drink, I was not too crazy about the spices used in the Yogurt drink but otherwise thought it was good. We had an appetizer and each had an entree. I had the vegetarian chef's selection and my dinner companion the chicken vindaloo. My vegetarian items were not mushy like I have had other times, my garbanzo beans were very large and the sauce was flavorful. The Palaak Spinach was pretty much standard but the Lentils had great flavor. The Chicken Vindaloo was also quite enjoyable. I really thought the portions were adequate and food was not typical at all. I can't wait to go back and try the buffet! I am very glad that I finally made it over to India House.
