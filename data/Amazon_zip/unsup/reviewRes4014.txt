Rule 1: Do not rate restaurants at which you've never eaten. You have no insight, and your review skews the curve and messes things up for the rest of us. It is hard to get a reservation at Schwa. Or at least so I've heard. I got an answer and a seat the first time I called. Guess I'm just lucky. I could describe this restaurant in great detail (it is the most unique fine dining restaurant at which I've ever eaten), but this article from GQ will do a far better job describing it. Check it out it's a great read. http://www.gq.com/food-t My dinner at Schwa was the best meal of my life. I went alone on a whim. Just me, a book and 2 bottles of wine. Highlights of the meal were the Chicken liver pate with tamarind crust, peanut brittle, mustard greens and root beer consomm, and the dessert of candied sweetbreads. Both are unlike anything you've ever tasted, and both are transcendent. Another very strong entry was a course of a single ravioli stuffed with a truffle infused egg yolk. Encouraged to eat it all in one bite, it was a molten explosion of truffle flavor that was somehow more intensely truffle-y than truffles. That I still remember these courses in such detail is a testament to the quality as it has been almost 2 years since my meal at Schwa, and I remember it more vividly than my dinner at Daniel last Tuesday. The place is BYO, which defies all logic and reason. It also rocks. The chefs will take your wine into the back and serve you throughout the meal not only your own wine, but "donations" that other customers have left behind. I can just see them back there listening to Van Halen, drinking peoples booze to figure out what is going to go best with what. It has this really informal communal feel to it that is really fun and special. So go to Schwa. Or at least try to. And if at first you don't succeed, try some more. And if you get frustrated and want to quit, don't. It would truly be your loss.
