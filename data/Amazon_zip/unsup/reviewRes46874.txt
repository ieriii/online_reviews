Let Edgewater claim Uninvited Ground. The Lincoln Park Wanna-beanies were there in gaggles and flocks. This is not a RP kinda place.  Food: decent, pricey, nothing special Staff: fine, attentive Patrons: see 4 lines up Bar: ' A- ', creative and growing selection Space: I realize I have some bias going on, but I much prefer the Glenway Inn of years past. As an Irish, (bad) Catholic girl born and bred here, I miss the Glenway for it's great Reuben, homemade soups and shots. . . Shots and more shots after a good cry across the street at Maloney's.
