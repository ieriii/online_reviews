Cozy but totally packed bar meets brasserie up in uptown, but is it worth the loooong wait? 2 of us came on a Friday night, passed through the totally crammed upfront bar area to the dining area in the back, to find the wait for dining seating to be 1.5 hours. We were directed to the seated bar upstairs (more like a waiting room for those waiting for food), and had several beers - specifically, we tried the Camay Red, Goose Island Matilda, and some other "Indian" beer in a can. Ambiance is dark and candle-lit, but can't say its as romantic as I had expected. Not sure it's deserving of the hype or far drive up to north, unless you really are a beer connoisseur and can appreciate some of their more rare selections.
