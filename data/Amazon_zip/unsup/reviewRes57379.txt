A total yuppie spot, which means you should expect to dine amid obnoxious drunk frat guys and snobby holier-than-thou Paris Hilton look-alikes. The bland yuppie-like atmosphere isn't the only bad thing about this place. I agree with the reviewer below about how the place was SO DARK. Our waitress was really rude, too. She refused to directly address my friend, who has Down Syndrome, and she was too busy chatting with her friends at the next table to serve our food on time. The food was horrible, too. How the hell did this place get the reputation for having the best sushi in town? WHAT A JOKE! Their seaweed salad tasted like it was sitting out all day, and the sushi wasn't fresh at all.  Like Molly (reviewer below), I've had WAY better sushi at cheaper (and classier) restaurants. Don't waste your time here if you're looking for quality food and service.
