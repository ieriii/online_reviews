The Green Mill. Sitting in the booth Al Capone sat in watching 45's spin on the old jukebox by the side door. What is better then that. What a historic vibe this place has. I don't drink, but if i did i would hang here from time to time. I had a good time just chilling here with a couple of friends. i can not comment on the venue's, i have only been here once.
