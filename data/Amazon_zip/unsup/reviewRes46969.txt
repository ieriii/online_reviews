Second time's a charm, I guess. I had a much better experience this weekend and I'm glad I gave Uncommon Ground another chance. There was no wait (Saturday brunch probably not as popular as Sunday brunch), and the hostess and wait staff were friendly and attentive. I had a breakfast melt and it was yummy and satisfying. My dining companion had the enchiladas skillet and loved it too. And I discovered there is a handicapped-accessible restroom at the entrance of the restaurant. Probably was there when I visited last, but just didn't notice. Good job UG - I will be going back.
