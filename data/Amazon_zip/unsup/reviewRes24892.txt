I had heard great things about this place from a friend - which was why I was doubly disappointed when Mercat fell WAY short of expectations. Portions were minuscule, the food was mediocre, the drinks were interesting... but too heavy on the mixers, and the bill was more than it ought have been. I left still hungry, not vaguely buzzed, and feeling robbed. With all of the incredible tapas places in Chicago, do yourself a favor and skip Mercat.
