Ahhh, Marriott chain, I have come to really appreciate you! * Firm mattresses * Great pillows * An awesome city view from our 31st floor room * Super early check-in availability, which we were not expecting at all * Flavored ice water in the lobby * Yummy Bath & Body Works products in the bathroom (they smell like Fresh Sugar) * Full Starbucks location in the lobby * FedEx location on the second floor * Bar in the lobby Even though your bedside outlets are only accessible by moving the bedside drawers, we had no fridge in the room, and the water pressure in the shower is pretty low, I'm still a fan!
