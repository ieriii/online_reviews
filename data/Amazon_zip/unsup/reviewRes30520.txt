The following review is courtesy of a traveling San Francisco yelper: This trip was defined by good friends, excellent music (Tiesto @ Congress Theater!) and amazing food. This is the third of our spots I tried that warrant five stars. We just don't have anything this extensively vegetarian back home. It's amazing. Vegetarian philly cheesesteak? Got it. Vegetarian chicken wings? Done. The whole menu is like that, non-traditional vegetarian dishes done up healthy, and delicious. Perfect before going dancing, and awesome for anyone with an appreciation for eating right.
