I first went there because I had a gift certificate from North Community Bank, and I keep going back because they serve decent Italian food in my  neighborhood. Their menu changes frequently, so don't make a mistake of going back there for a specific dish without checking with them first like I did. I have tried 7-8 different dishes, and I think your best bets are pizzas, pork chops, and flourless chocolate cake(or whatever they call it there) I tried a couple of seafood dishes. They were pretty good, but not the best I've had in the city. The best pizza in the city is served at Spacca Napoli (if you like Italian style pizza). For two, you will easily spend 70 or more. There is room for improvement when it comes to service.
