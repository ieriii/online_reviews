I LOVE this place! My boyfriend and I live nearby and we order out the chicken noodle soup (pho) at least once a week. It's not too salty or too greasy and it really fills you up. It ends up being a lot of bang for the buck for $6.50 plus free fruit for dessert too. Also, the people who work at the restaurant are the nicest I've ever encountered. They remember us and they often throw in a free smoothie or appetizer to show their appreciation for our continued loyalty. Even better if you want to eat at the restaurant it's BYOB.
