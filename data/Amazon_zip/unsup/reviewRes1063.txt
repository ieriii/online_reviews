What kind of word do you want? Fantastic? Incredible? Outstanding? Intense? Place is the fire and worth every second of the wait. I had he Salma Hayek (Andouille) and the crayfish with smoked pork sausage. Duck fat fries. Every bite had me wanting more. So much flavor in both of them you can only understand through experience. Anytime I am in the area and have time to wait, I will come back. I waited about 3 hours before I ate the crayfish/smoked pork sausage and even room temperature with the cheese at it's plastic-most, it was still amazing. I can't wait to go back, I even sent the menu to my buddy in jail so he knows he has a special treat upon his return!
