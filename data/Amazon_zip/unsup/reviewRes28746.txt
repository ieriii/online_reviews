I ended up here on accident, when classmates randomly asked me to dinner. I said yes, as I had no other plans and they mentioned pasta. Being one of my favorite foods, I was game! And excited. We got there, and I knew I wanted red sauce. Very rarely do I not order red sauce. On the suggestion of a classmate, I got the conchigle gorgonzola, as it combined something I love(red sauce) with someone else I love (CHEESE). I was not disappointed. It was delicious-a fresh flavor that was accented with the strong bite of gorgonzola. I would definitely get it again. Or something else off of this delicious menu. Service was friendly and quick (but not too quick), and I never felt pressured to finish my food early. I finished it on my time, in the most delicious will. I will be back to stuff my face with more pastas. :)
