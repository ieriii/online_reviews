Went here for dinner last night and absolutely loved it. We wanted to try something a little different than our usual thai, mexican, or irish/american comfort food. Although English was out waitress' second language, if you're from a diverse city like Chicago you shouldn't have a problem understanding her. We certainly didn't. The ambiance was great and the food really hit the spot on a cold winter night. I had the veal paprikash and my husband had the sausage stuffed chicken thigh - both were unbelievable. I felt like I took a mini trip to Europe last night!
