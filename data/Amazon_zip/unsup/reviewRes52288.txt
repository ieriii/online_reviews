We ate upstairs and our server was terrible! Plates were delivered that had not been washed - large pieces of someone else's green pepper and onion on it...our server mumbled oops with no apology and 10 minutes later brought new dishes. Our deep dish took 1:30 minutes and came out mushy. It was not a busy night as we were seated immediately. I think he forgot to put our order in. After an hour of waiting, I asked about our pizza and 15 minutes later it came out mushy. I will not go back. Due's gets my business from now on
