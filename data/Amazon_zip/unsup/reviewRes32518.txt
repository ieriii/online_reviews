I'm just a little too upsessed with this place...the milkshakes are to die for and many of my non-vegan friends love it. This past holiday season was my first holiday being vegan and i was quite worried about how i would be able to get vegan "holiday" food. I got their special Thanksgiving dinner carry-out and ate it along with the rest of my family that night and it was delicious. They had it in a cute little bag with chocolates, coupons, a little vegetarian magazine and flyers, it was soo cute! I went back to eat in the restaurant, and the atmosphere is really chill and "diner-like". The waiters are so nice and welcoming and they really are helpful about the menu. The desserts are delicious and i love going to a place where i dont have to worry about the ingredients!
