I really didn't want to write this review, especially because I truly admire chef Achatz, but I decided to share my experience, I think I earned the right at $400 a pop. I was beyond excited to try Alinea, dreaming about it for the last three years, so when I had the chance to fly to Chicago I immediately called to make a reservation. They only had an opening on Sunday at 9:30pm - no problem, I'll take it! One of the servers had a problem though - he seemed to be having a bad day, especially when we chose NOT to get the wine pairing (at $150 extra). When you go to a 3 Michelin star restaurant you expect a magnificent and impeccable service, even if you get the 9:30pm Sunday slot - such service exists - I experienced it at Manresa (a 2 star restaurant). This guy seemed to have gotten offended that we didn't get the pairing, he then went on to give us a "glass of champagne for us to try and to see if we changed our minds about the tasting - on the house". We didn't, and he ended up charging for them! Hence the 4 star rating for misleading patrons and for the bad mood. Besides that, the presentation was simply magnificent, well thought out, just incredible. I just wish I could re-experience it again with a great service, I'm sure that it would've tasted much better.
