PubliCAAANNN!!! Oh yes you can!! Went here for brunch after reading good reviews about it and after a very strong recommendation from our hotel concierge. Upon arrival, and by first looks, it reminded me of NYC's meatpacking district before it became the "IT" place to be, when restaurants and shops first started opening there and the seediness of it started fading. It was large, open, trendy, cool and fun. The decor (I was told) was modeled after a Bavarian? (not so sure on that) old-school beer hall. The tables were long and communal (in the center), w/ the expanse of the tables wrapping around the corners of the restaurants and high back chairs as the seat. Along one wall had these super cool booths w/ doors that closed, reminding me of a freight train that was about to pull off. As for the brunch menu, it was definitely different from the norm. The dishes ranged from fried french toast to sausages and a pretzel to a red wine poached egg. We opted for the sausages and pretzel. It was strange and way different from our normal breakfast, but since nothing on the menu looked "normal", we figured we'd just go along for the ride. (Word of caution though, the sausages or "weiswurst" was served in a silver pot filled w/ hot water. At first look, it was alarmingly simple and somewhat unappetizing. Don't let that offput you.) As for the drinks, we were told that it was customary in Chicago to get a beer w/ your Bloody Mary for brunch. The boyfriend and I both thought that was weird but hey... so is a sausage and pretzel for brunch. That said, he decided to try it while I had their $6 french pressed coffee. Both were yummy. Overall verdict, definitely worth another visit and so happy we went there. Next time, though, we'll have to try dinner. :)
