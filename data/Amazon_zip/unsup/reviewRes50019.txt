Picture this. A perfect Summer evening, the Cubs are winning, the beer is cold and I am outside watching the game. Where am I at? Wrigley Field? Nah. Fifty/50. One of the new additions to this stretch of Division. Great outdoor patio. Large screen TV mounted outside (I wonder how they keep that from getting stolen) great sound system and attentive staff. While it is definitely a sports bar- there are tons of TV's inside as well, you won't feel out of place if you just want to stop by for a drink and a bite to eat and not watch the game. The beer is cold, the menu looks great (everything from burgers to fried chicken to nachos) prices are reasonable, and they even let us sit outside a bit longer than the city allows. Way to go!  We were there on a Monday night so the crowd was manageable. Our server said that the place gets pretty crazy (and young!) on the weekends so if you don't want to deal with all of that- pick a slower night to check this place out.  Want to get let in on a secret? If you drive- check out the loading zone out front. If the valet is not working- you can park right there. But since the secret was mine to share- I'll need you to move your car when I show up!
