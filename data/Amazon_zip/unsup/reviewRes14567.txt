We met up with some friends at 5pm on a Saturday at Revolution. It was my fiance and my first time, the other couple had been there many times and raved about the food and drink. I'm not a beer drinker, so this review is based on food, service, and decor only. Food: It was good, not amazing. We split the bacon popcorn, wings, and mussels for apps. Popcorn and wings were delicious, mussels were just ok. I much prefer Hopleaf's. For dinner I ordered a burger. It was cooked nicely an the fries were pretty good, but it was one of the pre-formed perfectly round patties. Ugh, I hate those. The fiance had pizza, which was just ok. Service was spotty. As I mentioned, I don't drink beer. Which means I stuck with water. And my water glass got empty fast. And no one refilled it. I drank my fiance's water. No one refilled his either. The waitress came over to out table many times, to take drink and food orders, but never once refilled my glass. Decor: it is great! Fun and hip without being scene-y. All in all, I would go back for apps and drinks, but not for dinner.
