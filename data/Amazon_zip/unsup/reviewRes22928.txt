Valet park for a couple of bucks. Relax and enjoy the Greek experience. Great decor. Service can be a little cold but that's kind of how it's done in Greektown. Food great. Wine great. I always get the chicken riginati or the shrimp with red sauce and feta cheese. I forgot the name.  We love the Taramosalata and the grilled octopus appetizers.
