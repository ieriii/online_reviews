I came to Wishbone recently for brunch and thought it was so-so. Some thing were great but some were lacking.  The shrimp and grits - amazing. The weird neon green champagne cocktail - not so awesome... The atmosphere is kind of diner-esque, which can be a good thing sometimes but I didn't think it really worked for some reason. Maybe it was because of all the kids running around. The menu is really interesting though, so I'll probably come back again at some point and give it another shot.
