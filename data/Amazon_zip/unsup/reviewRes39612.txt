Practically 24-hour DIY Korean BBQ? It'd be really hard to not get 5 stars with such an operation. Starting with the bad, it can be crowded at times with not much in the way of a waiting area, but I can deal with that. The service can be a little less than nice, but I can deal with that too. Then out come the coals, the soju, and the banchan (a spread so massive it barely fits on the table along with everything else). Everything they put in front of you is either tasty, interesting, or both. The meats are seasoned well. Just don't get so caught up in the banchan that you overcook it! Prepare to sweat; there are red hot coals just 18 inches or so from your face. A delicious and very fun experience at a reasonable cost, and you can't possibly leave hungry.
