As a Chinese American liviing in San Francisco, I was looking for a place for a wedding reception. They advertise banquet room in the yellow pages and on their awning and they had decent reviews. I had my African American grand kids with me for dinner and their mother. I requested to talk with someone about their banquet room repeatedly. The waitress pretended not to understand English. So I used Mandarin. Finally they claimed they did not have a banquet room. When I used Mandarin to order she pretended not to understand me until I used English. It was strikingly odd that she had not understood my English earlier but needed my English for me to order. She scowled at us throughout the time there. I have never been treated so badly.
