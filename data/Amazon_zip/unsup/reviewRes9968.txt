This is excellent pizza, and I don't need the latest issue of Chicago magazine to remind me. Wicker Park Hep Cats mix with the sports bar crowd finding the perfect mix on a weekday night. The microbrews on tap will keep a beer lover coming back again and again. The open space was designed to be loud but Id like the music turned down just a bit. Parking in this area sucks, cab it or be prepared to valet. Enjoy yer pie. ~ Danno
