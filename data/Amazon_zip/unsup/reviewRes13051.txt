I've been to a few Texas de Brazil restaurants but this location is special...Its huge and creates an amazing atmosphere. They have their wine cellar encased in glass for everyone to see (its maybe three/four stories tall) but what is awesome is they have a trapeze professional that gets every bottle of wine and when she isn't getting a bottle of wine is performing for everyone to see. This is the only location that has this experience and it makes this location far better than your run of the mill Texas de Brazil chain location. As far as the meat, its the same...very good! Just don't fill up in their salad bar (which isn't a salad bar at all, its more of an antipasti buffet) because you'll want to eat as much of their meat selections as possible. Ohhhh and I almost forgot hopefully you're lucky enough to go when their soup of the day is lobster bisque...so good!
