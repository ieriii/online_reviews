My boyfriend and I went to Sapori and the food was great. My pasta dish was fantastic, my boyfriend loved his linguini and clams, and the avocado bruschetta was so delicious. My only beef is that I made a reservation a day or two before and when we showed up the hostess was incredibly rude to us, giving us the third degree about the reservation and eventually sitting us down at a table shoved against the wall in the back by the kitchen. That kinda ruined things a bit. Our waiter was great, however, but the start of the experience sorta sullied the rest of it for us. I'd be willing to give it another shot, but there are so many other great Italian joints in Chicago, I wouldn't miss Sapori.
