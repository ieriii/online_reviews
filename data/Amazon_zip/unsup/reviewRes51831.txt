Just as the 3 star rating say, A-Ok. DW and had lunch here on July 4. we were excited to try the CHicago style deep dish and ordered a small with pepperoni and sausage. We were very hungry having come almost straight from the airport and added mozzerella stickks to nibble on since the pizza takes a while to cook.  The mozz stix hit the spot and left room for the pizza, which was very good. The sauce is not too sweet or spicey. The crust was Ok, thus holding back that 4th star. hey all in all a very good experience.
