My wife and I were staying on Michigan Avenue for our first anniversary, so when we got a hankering for deep dish pizza, it was Giordano's or Ginos. Ginos won because it was thirty steps closer. And I would've walked thirty steps more - it was that good! We got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table - we must've hit the place right after they opened for lunch on Sunday. When we left 90 minutes later, there was a line out the door. Dodged that bullet. But what about the food, you ask? I haven't had a deep dish pizza in Chicago for probably twenty years, so I was starting with a clean slate. And Ginos was, I'm happy to say, a great experience. We ordered a small pepperoni, which was perfectly done. The tomato sauce was just the right side of salty, and the crust was crispy and delicious. One slice each plus the house salad with the home-made vinagrette was all we needed. Service was attentive and friendly, and the booths were comfortable. Yeah, there's graffiti everywhere, but contrary to what you may have read, the place was clean-clean-clean. Next time I'm in town I'll have to stop by Giordano's to compare, but I have no problem recommending Ginos.
