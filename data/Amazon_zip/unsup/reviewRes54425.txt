This is my favorite for vegan/vegetarian. Great menu. Love the reuben and sweet potato fries. I ordered the sangria which I was told was not vegan. This is where I learned that not all wine is vegan. Who knew. Tried a little of my date's gyros and it was pretty darn good too. Maybe next time.   Never had dessert there since I couldn't even finish all my dinner but it looked pretty good. Next time I'll save some room.
