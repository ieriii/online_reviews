The in-laws had me and my husband curious about this place since they visit it monthly, so we grabbed the kids and off we went. I made my husband wait in line while I walked up and down the block with the kids. There was no way they were going to stand still for the 30 minute line. My daughter's first order of business was to visit the bathroom, of course. It was a bit hard to maneuver through the sea of patrons but we made it with no accidents. The ladies bathroom had a cute mural of American "Hot Dog" Gothic but it kinda freaked my daughter out. She didn't understand why they didn't have any eyes. Finally our turn came. Doug was there to take our order and make suggestions (like ordering a small soda since it came with free refills) so I got one of the ever changing sausage specials of Blue Cheese Pork with Pear Pure and Smoked Almonds . My husband got something with Foie Gras and a second sausage of ber Garlic Pork with Roasted Garlic Dijonnaise and Widmer Brick Cheese . The kids weren't willing to go gourmet so they got a regular Hot Dog and Corn Dog. Luckily we visited Hot Doug's on a Friday so we were able to order the Duck Fat Fries. The best thing was that they brought the food to us so I didn't have to wrangle the children while balancing the tray on my head like I usually do. Our lunch was a wonderful change from the ordinary and surprisingly I enjoyed the Foie Gras sausage the best. Now, I liked our visit but with the long lines and short attention span of the children I don't think I'll be visiting Doug's as much as I'd like to. Perhaps I'll drop them off at grandma's next time.
