This place really is terrific and if you want the best items on the menu you need to get the skirt steak, empanadas, and a pitcher of sangria. Believe me after that you'll be set for the makings of a fabulous dinner. Try it out and let me know what you think. I forgot to mention that this place is also BYOB, we love this place!
