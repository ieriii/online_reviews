So I decided to spend my hard earned money last night at Spacca. I have heard mostly great things about their pizza and My fiance and I were really excited. We even went with another couple who had been there before and loved it. So we each ordered a pizza so we could share. The pizzas were done in four minutes. SOGGY! And the crust was super char coaled. Why is a pizzeria that is city famous for their awesome Italian Style DOC pizza gonna mess up my pizza like that? The oven is too hot, this is what we tell our server, she just says ok and goes about her business. Why wouldn't she tell someone? Don't they have a reputation to uphold? Something they should know about me, I dont like to waste my money on food that is mediocre! I will, however, go back and give them a second chance. If they mess up again, no more wasted money from my pocket! I can make better pizza at home with my pizza stone and my awesome dough recipe.
