I have eaten here a million times. I used to like it a LOT, but recently my feelings have changed. One of the main drivers for my opinion changing is I went to Paris and ate at L'As du Fallafel which made me finally understand what an awesome falafel sandwich should taste like. There is nothing in the Chicagoland area as good as that sandwich. Sultans Market has never tasted good to me since. The falafel itself is crisp, but too large. The hot sauce is OK, but too thick. My sandwiches (and hubbies) have been poorly made and fall apart after taking the first bite. The pita is frequently ripping apart which adds to the total mess it creates while eating. Not enjoyable. Their hummus is pretty good, but the baba ghanoush is not good. I like the dolmas from the salad bar a lot and I almost always love their lentil soup. If this place were not so convenient I would probably not go here as frequently. It is also very affordable, but so are most falafel places.   For a better falafel sandwich go to Pita Inn up in Skokie (order the platter and make your own) OR go to Falafil in Lakeview (they have a toppings bar and serve french fries).
