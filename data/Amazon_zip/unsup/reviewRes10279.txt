Went here for my birthday and had a great time. Very nice setting and decor, plus they even have a patio area to dine al fresco. Our server was this sweet old Italian guy that helped us pick our wine, which was very good and paired well with the meal. Sorry guys, most of the dishes were not that memorable except the braised short rib...mmmm!!! It was so flavorful and tender that it melts in your mouth. It was accompanied by some sauteed veggies and soft polenta that matched well with the short rib. We also had the mista salad and ravioli which were good, but pailed in comparison to the short rib. Their menu has so many dishes that sound tasty that I'll have to go back....roman style roasted pork, cod wrapped in pancetta, ribbon noodles with veal ragu, etc. Will go back, and will definitely update my review.
