Oompa! This place has it all: Authentic greek dishes, great Roditis, impeccable service. I had a Gyros platter that was the best I have ever had, for-gedd-about the crap you get at those fast food joints cause this Gyros Platter was kickin...My friend had lamb ribs with artichoke sauce that was creamy and ohhhh so good...The bottle of Roditis was smooth as silk going down...the Waiters were all attentive ...The Greek Coffee is thick and jolting and the regular coffee for the lighterweights does the ticket too....
