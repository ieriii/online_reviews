This place has so much potential to be awesome, but the elitist attitude of ALL of the staff every single time I have been in there has killed it for me.  Come on Patrick Bateman! THIS isn't Dorsia and you're NOT serving sea urchin seviche or lobster ravioli in a lemon grass broth! Cut the 'tude! It's a neighborhood bar with a Belgian theme, get over yourself!
