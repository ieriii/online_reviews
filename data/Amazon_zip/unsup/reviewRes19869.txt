Coast's sushi is actually pretty good. of the 7-8 rolls we ordered, all were yummie. my favorite was the shitake mushroom tempura roll. i never had sushi with only mushrooms before but the combination of textures and flavors worked really well together.  also interesting about Coast: BYOB, imported wasabi from japan, and they don't serve tea unless you order it. i kinda wished for the green tea that's usually freely served like agua, but oh well.
