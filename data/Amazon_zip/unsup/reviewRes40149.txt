ive changed my mind review 2 5 stars cuz i really really love the food here! i always get the kalbi & of course, it was delicious this time again! but i got the mini rib eye steaks this time instead of bulkoki & what a great surprise! I LOVED IT!!!! these 2 things r gonna b my usual order every time i come here! its such good food & so flavorful! it does get very crowded & sometimes the waitresses forget about u but the food is so worth it!
