Generally speaking, the pasteries are amazing. The coffee's alright, but nothing special. And it's a little pricy. As a bakery, though, I'd have to say it's one of my favorites.Wireless internet makes the adjoining cafe a great place to get some work done. There's nothing special about the ambiance, but it's generally pretty chill without the distracting hipster madness you'd see at Filter.
