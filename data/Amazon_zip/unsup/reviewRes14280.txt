This place can be dangerous...especially since I live just around the corner =P !! But my sister was in town from the 'burbs on a early afternoon Saturday and we actually had a taste for some good salad. There were a few new spots that just opened and then I kept thinking that I haven't tried Glenn's diner, yet. So I decided to have a nice brunch w/ my Mom and sister. We asked my mom's neighbor about a couple places. He said that he and his mom like to eat @ Glenn's. I always notice there was always a line waiting outside every time I pass by walking my dog. So I'm guessing this place must be good!! So we were seated right away..Surprisingly because it was a Saturday afternoon and it was a nice day out. My mom was happy to have both her girls with her and she also heard from friends about this place. So the menu comes-Breakfast or Sandwiches/salads? It was around 1-2pm so seafood was not served until after 3pm. We all decided on breakfast. I ordered Bananas Foster Pancakes..My mom eggs, pancakes and baked ham..my sister ordered the Corn beef hash...Everything they said about their pancakes is true... Talk about "melt in your mouth YUMM!!" Trust me my mom is usually finicky about restaurant foods and even she loved her pancakes. As for my sisters plate-"DE-LI-CIOUS!!" I've never had "Fresh" corn beef, not the cubed kind, hash. When we usually go out we always share our plates..This corn beef hash was Super-Duper Good!!! My Bananas Foster pancakes were "Huge"!! The bananas-Yumm, the Cream cheese frosting- Double Yum mix it on top of their Fluffy Pancakes-Fall off the chair Yummy-ness!!! ok I may have exaggerated just a little. But-Yeah this place is just that good!! We ended having a nice brunch and great conversations. It just nice to have "the girls" just hang out together. Especially my mom-She was happy just to be w/her Girls =^)
