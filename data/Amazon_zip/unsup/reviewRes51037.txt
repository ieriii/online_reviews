We decided not to wait 30 minutes at our usual brunch spot and ventured down the street to find a new place. I hesitated to write a review only because I don't want anyone to find out about this place. This spot is cute and roomy, didn't hesitate when I mentioned we have a stroller, big mugs of good coffee, and when I wrapped my lips around that warm, powdered......beignet, I knew this was our "new place." Everything was delicious.
