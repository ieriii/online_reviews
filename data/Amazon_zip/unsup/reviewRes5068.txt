gourmet, melt-in-yo-mouf, delicious. on our menu for that snowy evening in january (after waiting for ~45 minutes)- castelfranco+sunchokes+hazelnuts+apple cider vinaigrette salad, skate wing, chorizo-stuffed olives, bone marrow, camembert, pork sweetbreads, and affogato and bread pudding for dessert. oh, and wine (Mas de Gourgonnier "Les Baux de Provence"). and beer. lots of it. highlights from the pig's tiny kitchen: bone marrow-textured kind of like pate. flavored mostly by the spices and seasoning. definitely worth trying; it's kind of what this place is famous for. affogato-delicious peanut butter ice cream with espresso poured over it. soooooo good. as it was snowing and freezing, we expected no one to be out (us Californians assuming everyone didn't leave their houses when it snowed). On the contrary; this place was packed with a crowd mostly older than we were. I can't imagine how crowded it would be during pleasant weather! Would definitely go back.
