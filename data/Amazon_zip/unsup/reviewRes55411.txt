I went to dine at Sprout with my wife and another couple. my wife and i both like food and know of dale from the top chef show, and wanted to give it a try. we went in on a thursday and dined in this really beautiful stone and wood room. Our server came over immediately and asked if we had been here before, we hadn't, so he easily and simply explained that it is a $65 three course prie fix or order a la carte. With the three course meal you also get a small soup and cheese course too. We went with the prie fix, and what a deal. large portions, great combonations of flavors, and the cheese course was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches i have every had. The staff was knowledgeable and pleasant. and the cocktails were absolutely delicious. we'll be going back really soon!
