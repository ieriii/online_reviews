I'm a pretty picky eater. I really enjoyed the meal I had here. I didn't have high expectations because I felt like an upscale tapas was going to just be overpriced and mediocre. I WAS WRONG!The food was so good :) The cheeses are paired with really yummy sauces. The Cadi Urgelia cheese with the sherry-bacon caramel sauce was my favorite. The Arroz a la Cazuela soup was pretty good too. The Wagyu Zabuton steak was absolutely delicious. The Conill Amb Castanyes (braised rabbit) was very good. It wasn't gamey at all and very flavorful. I was so full by the end of the meal! I would definitely return for another meal.
