This place is just what Bridgeport needs! The breakfast and lunch menus are awesome. It has been open nearly a year and it still has a short wait on the weekends - always a good sign. The food is a bit pricey but the ingredients are so fresh. I respect their organic stance, but I would love to get a Diet Coke with my lunch sandwich :)
