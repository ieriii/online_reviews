I don't think I've ever had a worse first impression of an establishment. As soon as we walk in the hostess tells us they are about to be full with reservations. We say we just want to drink at the bar and they say we can, but we're just drinking, not eating right? After this barrage of rules, and seeing how crap the lighting is inside, my friend and agree that we hate this place and turn around and walk out.
