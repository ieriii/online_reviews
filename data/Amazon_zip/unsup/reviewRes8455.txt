Hidden away in Ravenswood/ Lincoln Sq this place is a jewel! I once was not a fan of thin crispy pizza but this place has changed my mind. I've had a handful of pizzas here and they are really delicious! You really can't go wrong with a group of 4 and a few pizzas and antipastis. I usually go for the Buffalo Mozzarella with Prosciutto (because whats better then ham and cheese!) and the Salsiccia and the Bianca con Bufala e Rucola. I have also usually gone with whatever specials are offered and never been disappointed! Great for a group- but get a reservation or be prepared to wait! Spacca Napoli is popular with the folks in the neighborhood and is usually packed in the summer. Also great for al fresco dining in the warmer months with nice twinkle lights overhead to set the mood. After dinner take walk a block over to Margie's Candies for ice cream or a have a cocktail at Scots.
