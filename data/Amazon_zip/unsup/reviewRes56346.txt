This place is wonderful and delicious. I was totally WOWed. Everything was great and the service was incredible. I've never been to a place where there was such nice nice people. They are truly sweet.I had came in with some friends and it was my first time there and we brought wine. They gave us wine glasses and even offered to open the bottle for us.My friends having been there already ordered for me. The food came out in courses which they had great timing. We ordered some fried rice, curry chicken, a beef soup, some fresh rolls, and a beef dish that came in an actual coconut! Everything was great. I will come back next time and order for myself and try some other things out.
