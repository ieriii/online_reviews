This place rocks! The food is awesome! You can do casual or fancy. Fries with elk ragout (it's very good) and a beer, or a lovely piece of fish with an intersting high/end preparation and a glass of wine.We've been here several times, and it's always a winner.It's popular, so it can get noisy - but the food is worth it.
