I always come here with the intention of getting sushi, and can never resist the call of yummy curry. I cannot get over the Indie Curry - this dish of yummy squash and cashews and potatoes and meat in flavorful coconut milk curry sauce is absolutely delish.  Also, having been to Shinobu the night before and having had a not so great experience there, it was refreshing to see how attentive the staff was, how great the presentation of the meal was (in addition to the taste).  Next time I *really* want to try the Metallica roll, or the hawaiian duck curry (which they seem to have as a special every time I go there) but will probably succumb to yummy Indie Curry once again.
