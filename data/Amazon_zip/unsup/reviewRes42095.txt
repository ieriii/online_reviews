Thank you Gilt Bar for allowing me to write a 5 star review, it's been a while. The inside is dark, intimate but fresh. Great for a dinner with friends or a date.  The drink menu is small but sufficient. You don't need a huge list of concoctions when you have a solid 10 - 15 drinks that will please almost anyone.  However, the bar is stacked so you can get whatever liquor you want. I had a few of the vodka drinks whereas my fellow diner had gin drinks. We both loved them. They are similar to what Violet Hour has to offer..complicated, $12 each and they use creative ingredients like elder flower, violet, etc. They are delish. Now to food...OFF the chain! The bone marrow app is a must. I will preface this by saying I've had bone marrow before and I thought it was sick. However, Gilt Bar seasons the marrow well and offers a lovely compliment of marinated onion jam. The bread was toasted and had the perfect balance of chewy-ness. Mmmmmmm Second course was the truffle pasta. Holy goodness. This pasta is rich and creamy. It isn't too rich though. The type of balance achieved in this pasta dish was impressive. I haven't seen too many other places do this good of a job with such a strong ingredient.  The pork belly rounded out the night and did not disappoint. There was not a bite left on the plate. It was the perfect amount for sharing and a top a lovely sauce.  Now at this point, we were full, but felt b/c we had indulged in such great food that dessert was a must. Unfortunately, they had just run out of the carrot cake. Oh well! Looks like I'll have to come back to try it. I would also like to give a special shout-out to our waiter, Manny. Service adds a lot to a diner's experience and I really enjoyed Manny's calm and informative demeanor. He gave great recommendations and didn't give the classic but lame , "I like everything" line even though I'm sure he does.  I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.
