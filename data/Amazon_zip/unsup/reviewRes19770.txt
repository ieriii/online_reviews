One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Chicago, especially since it's BYOB. I've never had anything bad here, and I totally recommend the white dragon roll. Definitely the best piece of sushi I've ever put in my mouth - it melted and crunched all at once. So good I had dreams about it that night.  During the week it isn't too busy and you might not need to make reservations.
