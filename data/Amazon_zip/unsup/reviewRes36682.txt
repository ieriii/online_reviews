I feel a little bad writing this review for what may have been a unique experience, but I hope to forewarn others just in case. I went to Indie Cafe with a friend on her recommendation. The maki sushi I had there (Quebec and Spider) was the worst I have ever eaten. I don't know exactly why that was, but it tasted off and felt strange in my mouth. The fish kind of glistened and looked puffy. Secondary to the awful maki, the staff was awkward, like they didn't know how to serve around guests at a table. They kept refilling my water glass, though, which I really appreciate. Not a big deal, but it bothered me. I thought it was kind of pricey and "a lot of cute" with little substance. The crab rangoon, however, was absolutely delicious.
