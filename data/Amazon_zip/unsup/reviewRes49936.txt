We had a great time here celebrating one of my friends birthdays. At first they had us seated and wanted us to move over and for our slight inconvience they gave us pitches of sangria. The place was beautifully decorated and had a wonderful cultural feel to it. When you go downstairs to the bathroom you can see more art and decorations in their private seating area. It's also BYOB if you want but I think there is a cork fee, not sure what it is. The space is warm and inviting and so you have a great time at dinner with the variety of drinks (all good) and the great sangrias. The steak skirt was great and no matter what version everyone at our table ordered, we were stuffed full and enjoyed the food coming out on the cast iron. I'm not really a steak person but the meat had a great texture and wasn't over cooked. If you are a fan of empanadas or calamari those are also appeitizers worth checking out.
