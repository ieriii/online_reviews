Irazu was my first exposure to Costa Rican cuisine 7 years ago and I swear by this place. The quality of food there is amazing for the price! They have the best Ceviche that I've had in Chicago and when I dine out and Ceviche is on the menu, I'm ordering it. Needless to say, I've eaten a lot of Ceviche. I highly recommend the Casado, which can easily feed two and you'll still be bringing food home. You can choose between the steak or chicken (both are great). The dish is also accompanied by platanos maduros, rice, and salad. If you're by yourself go for the steak sandwich, Lazano sauce has forever changed my life. The cabage salad, although very simple is very good. The tacos are tasty. Everything on the menu is amazing. The Oatmeal shake is great for hangovers and should be patented, trademarked or whatever it is you have to do to make sure no one steals the idea! Otherwise I like the Mamey shake...I wonder what the fruit looks like, but who cares I heart it!
