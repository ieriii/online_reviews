Eh... its ok. The highlights were the affordable wine menu and the appetizers (wasabe noodle & artisenal tofu dishes were tasty). Service was decent, and the ambiance is nice. This was the third time we have dined at Wakamono over the past few years, and in typical fashion I sought out one of the chef sashimi specials while my wife adhered to her battery of rolls. In a word, forgettable. Nothing really deterred from the experience, but nothing really made the culinary experience either. The fish didnt seem that fresh, and the rolls were rather ordinary. We spent $100 between the two of us, which included a bottle of decent wine, so the pricing is to be expected. Its not a bad place to be if you need sushi and in the area, however there are far too many other options that would negate the need to dine here.
