Had to update my prior review. Went there on a Saturday night and thanks to awful pregnancy brain (that's my story and I'm sticking to it), I thought our reservation was 6:15 when in fact it was 7. They graciously sat us anyways even after I explained the rest of our party wouldn't be there for 45 minutes, we had phenomenal service, and after our meal when we wanted to have a few more drinks after we'd paid our check but there were no seats in the bar, they let us keep the table yet again and a new waitress took care of us while our waiter was busy. Really went above and beyond. And the food was still great.
