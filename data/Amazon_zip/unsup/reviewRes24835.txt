I absolutely love this place! My boyfriend introduced me to the wonderful Irazu and I am addicted. The food is outstanding, we always get the casado with chicken or steak. Recently, my boyfriend got the tilapia tacos which were light and delicious. I am big on sweet treats and the shakes are some of the best in the city. Overall, I highly recommend this place and will keep coming back for more!
