my favorite pho in the city. the menu is so huge that its a bit overwhelming and the place is so packed that you sometimes get sat at tables with other people. these are the only two faults but you really cant help that your food is so good and your menu is so big that you are packed pretty much all day. just found out they now deliver. thumbs up
