Last week was my second time at Zed. This time it was not only for drinks, but for a work dinner. The roof top patio is a nice place to just kick back and have a drink in beautiful surroundings. We were served some sort of a pear martini with a touch of cinnamon at the top.  And then the feast began. First off, the salad bar. I can't even remember all the items that were served but some of them included different types of cheeses, salamis, mushrooms, olives, and many many other quality items.  For dinner we were served several cuts of steak, maroccan chicken, venison, duck, pork belly, with sides of spinach, mashed potatoes. The meats just keep coming so make sure to take small pieces if you want to try every cut. This was followed by a whole variety of desserts such as different flavored cupcakes, chocolate covered cheesecake and brownie smores and more! Way too much food! The staff is super nice too. The waiter explained to us were the name Zed 451 comes from. The Zed is for the last letter of the alphabet as the English call it and 451 degrees Farenheit is the temperature they cook their meats at.
