I just don't know how to write a fair review for a place that is famous for it's chicken wings while I am vegetarian. I guess this review will just be just as a reference for other vegetarians, because clearly, their specialty dishes do seem to live up to their expectations, given the number and quality of their other reviews. I am happy that they had the vegetarian bi bim bop options for those of us who are not about to try their best dish. The quantities here are huge and even the Baby Buddha Bowl can be shared by two! The music was sort of loud and the conversation was hard to make. The guys behind the counter were friendly but overwhelmed. And we went in the time between lunch and dinner, so not particularly their busiest in the day. I would highly recommend everyone to do take-out instead of dine-in because it can get a little chaotic, loud and hard to keep up with in a sane fashion!
