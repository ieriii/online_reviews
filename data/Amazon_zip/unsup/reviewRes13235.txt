The seafood here is fresh and varied, and tastes amazing! The staff is very friendly as well. My wife has an onion allergy, and wasn't expecting there to be onions in the hamburger mix itself. Once she discovered them, the servers were extremely gracious, taking the burger off our bill and even offering her a Sprite to sooth her stomach. We've run into issues with allergies in various restaurants, and I can't say it's ever been handled better than it was at Glenn's.
