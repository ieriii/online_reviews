Matt E is right (and not just because we share an E). I have learned that anything Anthony makes is delicious and should be eaten, regardless if you normally like said dish or not. The crostini di avocado and the bruschetta are perfect examples - being finicky about tomatoes and avocado, normally I'd avoid these items like the plague, but not only are they both AMAZING, friends and family are shocked to find that Anthony's gotten me to eat these items. Now everyone wants to feed me tomatoes and avocados, and I tell them "I only eat Anthony's." Same for the bread pudding - I don't care if you hate bread pudding, ORDER THIS ONE! Other perennial faves include the Cappellacci all'Arogosta (lobster ravioli), the Rigatoni Caprese (another shockingly tomatoey dish of Sapori's that I adore), and yes, those amazing Milk and Honey Baby Back Ribs.
