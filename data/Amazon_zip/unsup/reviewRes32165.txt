This place is awesome! It's open until 2 AM, serves delicious, fresh, unique sushi, and is cheaper than Japonais and Mirai Sushi! The interior decor is hot and the drinks are strong tho expensive. Even so, if you're looking for an edgy night on the town, this is the place. They also have $12 valet, so parking isn't a hassle.
