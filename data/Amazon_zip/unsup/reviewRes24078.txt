Drove by this restaurant numerous times without stopping in, and I was definitely missing out. The atmosphere is very relaxed inside. The servers were all very friendly and professional. We were told there was a 25 minute wait, so we walked down the block to get some beer, came back and they had already called us, but when we talked to the host he was very helpful and got us seated right away. The food was delicious, and came out fairly quickly. All in all it was a pleasant experience dining there. I will be back and a recommend others to try it out.
