Came for lunch, and while I was at first thinking the prices were definitely in the dinner range, the waitress was wonderful, and suggested that my companions and I share a Kabob plate, and then gave us some hummos on the house, and plenty of warm pita. The chicken was so tender, and the rice and veggies were delicious as well. The gals I came with were new to Persian food, but we were all equally pleased with the food, friendly waitress, and beautiful decor. I will definitely be returning soon for dinner, as they seemed to have an excellent selection of fish and more authentic dishes. One caveat--even though the waitress asked us if we were on a lunch break and were in a hurry, and tried to be very accomodating, she tended to disappear for way too long when we were ready to order and then ready for our check. I'm probably being way too picky, but isn't that the point?
