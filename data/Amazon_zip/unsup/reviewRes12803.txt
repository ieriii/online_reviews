I know that the churrascarias are all the same to most, and the salad bar is the only difference, so I didn't really expect anything out of the ordinary. So, here are the highlights that set Texas de Brazil apart: 1. Leah, our server, was great. She was attentive, nice, not annoying and helpful. 2. Their special, the top sirloin is really good. 3. If the meat is too salty for you, you can request meat with less salt. 4. They had sushi (not the best in the world, but still a nice different taste to have) 5. They had great potatoes au gratin. 6. TdB also has a good salad bar with hot and cold food Also, if you sign up to receive their emails, you can get a 25% off your dinner S-F and also a get one dinner free coupon (with the purchase of one) for your birthday.
