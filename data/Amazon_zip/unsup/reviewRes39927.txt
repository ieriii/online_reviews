I love the Korean bbq here. I'm Korean and make plenty of food at home, but sometimes I just don't feel like cooking so I head over to San Soo Gab San for their delicious food. I recommend going for grilled meats such as galbi, bulgogi and samgyupsal, but their other dishes and stews are good too. Be warned the place is really Korean so if you're non-Korean you may be confused. Also, the place is smokey from all the grilling so you WILL leave smelling like meat. My non-Asian friends got a huge kick out of sitting on the ground and grilling meat on the table, but for some people they might dislike having to do all the work themselves.
