I love the decor of this hotel. It is very edgy and attractive to look at. The wine bar has a great selection and the food there is great for a quick snack or dessert. The Aria Bar and Sushi is great for a snack and a drink before going out for a bit. I stayed there with my friend this weekend for her bachelorette party and the only thing I will say is at other hotels I have been to they give a discount or upgrade or a special treat for the guest. Our room was fantastic and classy, but the only issue I had was the beds are TOO soft, not comfortable when you have been drinking all night because your head sinks back towards the bottom while your feet feel raised up in the air. I woke up multiple times during the night because I was uncomfortable. The tvs are huge and the view was amazing from our room. Love the proximity to Millenium and Grant Park for the Taste of Chicago as well as the Art Museum. Only a 5 dollar cab ride to get to the busier parts of the city and the red line train is a 2 block walk.
