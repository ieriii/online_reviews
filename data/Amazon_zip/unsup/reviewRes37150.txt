Bottom Line Up Front: Excellent Seasonal Beers Paired With Fantastic Pub Fare. I had a good time at Hopleaf. This is saying something considering the circumstances. Over the course of my accident prone evening... 1) I lost my contact because I got poked in the eye by a patron who was having a very animated conversation with his friend. The bartender gave me a free beer and got the sympathy/digits of a pretty girl at the bar. 2) My buddy who came with me to the bar noticed that his glass was chipped. When he told the first person who walked by our table (he happened to be the manager or something) about it our meal of mussles and frittes (amazing) and sausage plate were on the house. 3) I got blind drunk and lost my phone. The super accomodating bouncer used the "flashlight app" on his iPhone to look under the tables until we found it. Moral of the story: While it's probably not a good idea to go out with me unless you like to see someone just fumble his way through life... it is an excellent idea to go to hopleaf.
