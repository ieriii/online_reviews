By far the best Mexican street food I've had to date! I love the concept of XOCO, pronounced ChoKo and translates to 'little sister' in Aztec. You place your order at the counter then a host seats you, It's a good mix of to-go and casual dining. Following an employee's recommendation, I tried the ahogada, a golden pork cartnita torta with tomato broth and pickled onions. The dish was a great mix of savory, from the marinated pork and tomato sauce, and sweet from the onions. Take a look at my pic of it! The entire menu looked wonderful and will most likely be back for more. On my way out I had to grab some of their famous hot chocolate. I tried the Mexico City Think, which was ground fresh cocoa with 2% milk... it was a little rich for me but the serving size was perfect.
