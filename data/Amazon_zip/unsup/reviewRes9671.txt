I drank the Kool-Aid and ate at Sprout. It was great. I had the veggie option on the Prix Fixer menu. I started with a salad that was perfectly delicate and flavorful and then had fettuccine in a pepper and something-else sauce. It had a very strong, hearty flavor without being overwhelming or too heavy.  They gave us grilled cheese and cider before dessert which was super-fun. Then, wait for it...Dessert. Dessert was amazing. I had the coffee, chocolate and hazelnut deal that was great. My friend had the corny thingy. Both were so fun.  I really liked that the atmosphere managed to be classy and romantic without being cheesy or overdone.
