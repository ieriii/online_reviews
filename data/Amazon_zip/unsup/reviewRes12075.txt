I just ate at Cafe 28, after my weekly dance class in the neighborhood, and rather than going to the bar down the block to eat bar food and drink beer, we decided to sit down and have a real meal at this beautiful Cuban restaurant that looks so good from outside. I'll cut straight to the point: I just ate one of the best meals of my life. Duck is such a risky choice, because it's so easy to get wrong, but when it's done right, it's indescribable... and Cafe 28 does it right. Sooooo right. The mojitos tasted good but lacked a bite... but where that might be enough to knock another place down by half a star, this meals was just too good. A delicious drink with one of the best meals I've ever eaten can't be faulted for not getting me tipsy. Go to Cafe 28. Get the duck. Love, even if only for a moment. :)
