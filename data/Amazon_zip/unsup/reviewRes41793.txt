Cool interior, a little dark, though. Went with a group of coworkers while in town for a tradeshow. We decided to do family style & ordered most of the items on the menu!  I had bone marrow for the first time, and it was interesting. Not sure if I will be craving it anytime soon, but glad I tried it. The fava bean salad was one of my favorite items- I am sad I am 6 hours away becuase I could eat it every day. The ricotta gnocchi, I thought would be my favorite, but it was ok. You can't go wrong with the pork belly or pot roast. Our server was fantastic & the atmosphere was great!
