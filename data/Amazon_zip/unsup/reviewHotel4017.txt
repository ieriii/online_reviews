This hotel has a great location across from the river, just off Michigan Avenue (Magnificent Mile), and walking distance to other attractions like Millennium Park and the Navy Pier. The people were frantic, which is kind of annoying when trying to relax on vacation. A big negative was the hotel hosting a LOUD party in the lobby that impacted every paying customer. I thought this was a Hyatt, not a spring break hotel.
