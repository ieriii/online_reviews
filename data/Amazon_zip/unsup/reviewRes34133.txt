Oh how I miss this place. When I lived in Chicago about a decade ago, I ate here about once a week. I know it seems silly to write a review ten years later, but this place will always hold a special place in my heart. The food was always reliably yummy and copious, and the atmosphere was always lively and unpretentious. Oddly, Mia Francesca was also the scene of several celebrity sightings back in the day -- I sat next to bald Billy Corgan, dorky David Schwimmer, and about half of the totally fabulous US Olympic figure skating team.
