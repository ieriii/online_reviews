831 reviews, does The Gage really need my review? Damn straight it does! Because you can never give enough praise when a restaurant gets it right. My daughter and I came here after the Lichtenstein exhibit at the Art Institute. How do you follow a WHAM display of art like that? With a WHAM meal here. We had a reservation and were immediately seated at a great table. The server was extremely patient while we read and debated what to get/share. We decided on splitting the fried pickles and summer squash appetizer which was delightful. We then ordered the Turkey and the Vegetable sandwiches, each of us partaking of a half. I adored the Turkey and she adored the Vegetable so neither sammie felt neglected. The fries were superb and my Mother would have so approved of the tiny ketchup dishes! What really impressed me was the service and care. Not only were we treated royally by our server but had two different managers come by and seem to really care if we were liking our experience.  We were too full to try dessert but I did have a great cup of coffee before we strolled across the street to bask in the sunlight at Millennium Park. What a glorious day in a magnificent city with a delicious meal. Well done, Gage, review 832 (the most important, duh!) approves!
