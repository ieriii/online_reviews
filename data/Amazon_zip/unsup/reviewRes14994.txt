Sabatino's is a charming little Italian restaurant with great service. I think the old school "Godfather" effect comes from the lack of natural light (no windows), but the staff is friendly and the portions are huge. If you go on weeknights (Monday - Thurs) there are two elderly gentlement who play fiddle and violin and sing.
