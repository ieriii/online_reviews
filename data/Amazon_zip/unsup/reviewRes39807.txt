My first experience at Longman & Eagle was not so pleasant. Just a mix up with the hostesses on our reservation, resulting in an additional 45 minutes to our 1.5 hour wait. I threw a temper tantrum and the hostesses gave us drink chips for our next visit. Anyway, I am thrilled I threw my grudge out because this place is amazing! Yes, the wait is awful, but you have to play it like you would at Kuma's. I had some awesome friends put down their names and I just met them in time to be seated. Despite being crowded, service was good and quick. My friends and I all took bites from each other's dishes so we could try a little bit of everything. I was a fan of the duck rillettes and the lobster bisque our server had us all sample. Very rich and flavorful! I wasn't voraciously hungry so I went with a small plate of scallops, oxtail, gnocchi etc. My scallops were super fresh and perfectly seared. All the ingredients in this small plate complimented each other amazingly. It was a great execution of surf and turf. Other highlights were my friend's pork belly (fine I admit it, L&E's rivals my mother's recipe for pork belly. HMPH) and the beef fat fries. Okay, so this place isn't the best for group dining and its definitely not cheap. However, if you're looking for a one of a kind experience that is definitely worth the $ and the time, you need to come to Longman & Eagle.
