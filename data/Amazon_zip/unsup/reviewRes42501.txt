My girlfriend's mom is a Chicago tour guide, so I've had all the standard Chicago-style "art" that is Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Uno's, etc. When my buddy ordered some Art of Pizza, I was skeptical to say the least... Best deep dish in the city! Everything you love about Chicago-style deep dish/stuffed pizza done slightly better than everywhere else. Only one location I believe, but whenever you're down Lakeview/Lincoln Park way, make your move! This pizza is fantastic and although I'm a New York style guy to the core, when I crave Chicago, I only think of The Art of Pizza.
