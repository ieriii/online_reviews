Two words: NACHO NIRVANA. That alone will keep me coming back here. A gigantic pile of nachos with cheese, pico de gallo, beans, guacamole, lettuce, and probably some other stuff.  I don't even want to think about how absolutely unhealthy that thing is, but it's so delicious that it doesn't matter. The rest of the food is pretty good, too. I love the chicken fingers -- they've got a real homemade quality that you don't really see in most restaurants. And the cottage fries are great. The burgers I've had have been really good, too. And portion sizes are huge -- even without devouring the nacho appetizer, I'm pretty sure I'd have leftovers anyway. I've never gotten the salad bar or brunch buffet, but both look pretty fabulous. And someday I'll save room for dessert... Prices are average, service has always been pretty good for me. The place is a little crowded/cramped, but not enough for me to care about it.
