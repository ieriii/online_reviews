When you want to enter the old world, this is the place to go. Kinda like a cross between goodfellas and goodfellas in here. Private booths available for the romantic or the image conscious. Food is excellent. Is this the best italian restaurant?  Probably not. Is this the best italian restaurant experience, could be. I've been treated like royalty and I'm a huge nobody so I enjoy coming here. FREE VALET PARKING for you winter dining skidish. I've had the chops and the pasta and was very satisfied. Not as good of a "welcome to family" experience as Greek Islands, but these are italians, not greeks, so you actually need to be "in the family". Menu doesn't change too often but there is always a special and the seafood is rumored to be excellent also. All in all, if you really don't want to schlep all the way to taylor street, this is your diamond in the rough.
