There are so many reasons why I love Coast. First and foremost, the sushi is delicious! But I also love how it is BYOB so you can save at least some money on what will be a pretty big tab at the end of the night. Coast is definitely a high end sushi place, so be prepared for an expensive meal. But the ambience, the friendly wait staff and the food is worth it. And it is open late night so its a great option when most other kitchens are closed.
