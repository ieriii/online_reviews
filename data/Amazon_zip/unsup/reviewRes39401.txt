Holy smokes, Batman! Seriously, I saw the pictures of flames in the pictures of San Soo Gab San and instantly recalled the brisk December evening that I spent starving for air.. What was it like? Eating in a restaurant that was on fire. I don't know if the chimney thingy on the table next to us was not operational or what, but smoke was BILLOWING all over the place. Everyone at my table was coughing, and I could hardly see my friend across the table. Breathing was difficult. When we left the restaurant for a night on the town, strangers kept approaching us and asking us if we had been at a bonfire- the smell was overwhelming. That being said, the food has been consistently good both times I've been to San Soo Gab San. Although I think that its accurate to say that the waitstaff are the antithesis of attentive and helpful, it has always struck me as (as has Korean food in general) as a great place to take a leap of faith. I would agree with other reviewers that its a mistake to make the meat the focal point of the meal- the thin slices tend to come out alternately burnt or raw and are never sufficient to feed the hoards. The chicken, however, is well marinated and tasty. Other stand outs on the menu the (scallion?) pancake and the various soups. And 40-60% of the little dishes are always solid. So take a leap of faith, pack your wallet (this place ain't cheap) and, of course, bring an oxygen tank down to San Soo Gab San.
