I really, really like Coast. I don't pretend to a sushi expert-basically I'll try anything and if I like it, great. Coast, to me, though, has better than average sushi. My favorite thing is the sweet potato tempura. I can't get enough! The miso soup, and esp. the spicy miso, is delish as well. BYOB is awesome too.  It can get verrry crowded, even on weeknights. Save yourself the headache and make a reservation. I also agree that it can get loud, esp. since the tables are so close together, but I get it-this place is always hopping and they need the space! My cousin turned me onto Coast and she is a regular, popping by about once a week. I love this place-reasonably priced, BYOB, good food.
