I really liked the bed and pillows. I slept like a baby last night which is unusual because I generally cannot sleep much on the first night in a strange bed. I wonder if all of Crowne Plaza's properties get their bedding from the same vendor. If so, I'm going to make it a point to book their properties henceforth.  Kudos to the housekeeping staff as well. My only complaint is that the hotel gym was really sub-par.
