Ok I'll be honest, at first I loved this place because the menu items reminded me so much of my favorite sushi places in LA....however, I've found that the more I eat here the more it's inconsistent.  What originally drew me to the restaurant is that they have one of my FAVE dishes from LA that you can't find here which is the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice Cake. I think because I know what the original tastes like I'm spoiled. The rice was there, but the tuna was extremely spicy. I was very disappointed. I have learned though that lunch is definitely the best time to go (try their chicken salad), but it's a condensed menu and some of my favorite rolls aren't listed.  Long story short, good food depending on some dishes, but not my fave.
