Been here 5 times. Shortest wait: 45min with chilly, drizzly weather. Longest wait: 1hr 45min. But only have been here after 2p each time. If you want a quick hot dog, this is not your place. BUT if you are willing to make the wait and wait 2+ dogs, it is so worth it. First off, this is a hot dog emporium, so if you're not a hot dog fan, you'll probably think an hour-long wait is absurd. For the hot dog lovers, however, this is heaven. Chicago style is always great, I love the fois gras sausage, it is one tasty work! yums My favorite, however, is the fire dog. Not really spicy at all, but has a nice zing. Duck fat fries are indeed good, i mean not as "amazing" as I would have thought, but pretty worth it!! I just love the fact that when you are ordering, the owner (the guy who takes your order) doesn't rush you to order even though there's like 50 people waiting behind you. You get the full treatment I would say. He always seems to be in a super good mood like the owner of The Max in "Saved by the Bell."
