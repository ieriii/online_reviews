Great lunch spot. Never been here for dinner. Excellent service, fresh food. An upscale buffet with an ever-changing menu, endless naan, and a fresh roasted chicken for every table? :) I don't think the chicken is necessary but I'm not a huge carnivore. The only con is the post-lunch food coma. Be sure to stay caffeinated.
