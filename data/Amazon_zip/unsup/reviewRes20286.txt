Another Rick Bayless Masterpiece :) BONUS: They serve Matilda (so automatically one of my favorite places :) We went shortly after Xoco opened last Fall, and also went during the week, so the wait wasn't as bad as it can be on the weekend. Nonetheless, you should expect at least a 30 minute wait! We had the guacamole, pepito and pork belly tortas-- all of which were amazing. We finished with churros and vanilla ice cream (to cut the heat).  Inexpensive, amazingly delicious food (and don't forget Matilda) made this one of my go to spots :) Highly recommended!!
