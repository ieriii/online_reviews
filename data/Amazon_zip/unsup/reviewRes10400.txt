Imagine having the chance to get together with a long-lost girlfriend for just one evening. You pick what is supposed to be the fun, funky neighborhood and gather a list of potential dinner spots. Then imagine struggling with Wicker Park parking and venturing up and down the streets, searching for a place to rest your weary feet, enjoy a brew and a casual, but fab dinner. Well, that last part didn't happen. We wandered into Piece and grabbed the first seats we saw, only to be briskly removed, as they were reserved for another group. We ventured further in and found a lovely spot along the wall, happy to find a place where we wouldn't be trampled. Well, we weren't trampled. And, apparently, we weren't visible. After twenty minutes of watching server after server stride past us, purposefully avoiding our pleading eyes, I actually waved my arms and shouted "Over 40! With disposable income!" Still nothing. I told my friend I'd count to ten, and if we weren't approached, we were going to make use of their lovely bathrooms and find somewhere else to spend our money. Which we did. With abandon. In both cases.
