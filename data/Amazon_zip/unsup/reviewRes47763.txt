I came here last night for (one in a string of many dates) and once again Zed does not disappoint. Walking through heavy wooden front doors, you are met by an expansive hardwood entryway and smiling hostess. To your left is a large dining room, and to your right an expansive lounge/bar area and stairway up to the heated rooftop.Comfortable bar stools surround an expensive looking bar backlit by a fire. Downstairs feels cozy in the winter. Upstairs is great in summer. Zed never fails to halfway full with typical River North YP types. This means you never feel like you are the only ones at the bar, dispelling that awkward um should we leave or strike out for greener pastures feeling.. In addition to lots of comfortable bar seats, and ability to hear your date, Zed boast a a comprehensive drink menu, including yummy signature cocktails, and local beers. (Recommend: asking bartender to get creative with extensive selection of fresh fruit and herbs at their disposal.) In short, Zed is always a good time, no matter how the date turns out.
