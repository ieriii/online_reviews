I finally got to try Carnivale, and can you belive it, it was all free! I went for customer appreciation night/Casino Night, yea i said it. Walk in, there were those girls dressed like they were about to be in a parade or do a kick line in vagas! Super HoT! As we went upstairs there was an oxygen bar waiting for us to indulge. Drinks Free - I had a mojito(s) and a Sagria(s). Both were to die for. There was a raw bar that was pretty good and waiters walking around with appetizers. Played some black jack, then of course had to stick around for more apps and a tequila fligt - not free. I had so much fun! I will be back! The live music was great!
