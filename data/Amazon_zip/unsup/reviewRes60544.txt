Great place for visitors to eat while vacationing with toddlers in the city! Food choice was massive and I ended up getting a delicious Polynesian salad and my husband got the best mushroom burger ever. It came with a very tasty basil aioli sauce. Our toddler got some home made chicken fingers of which she actually ate!
