I'll say it again and again - the food can only take a restaurant so far...the service is truly half the battle - the make or break often of any evening out. I had passed by this restaurant several weeks ago while visiting one of my andersonville favorites - jin ju and thought that it looked absolutely charming and quaint. When friends and fellow foodies of mine had invited me to join them for dinner here, I was absolutely thrilled to tag along and try somewhere new that had already caught my eye. On the way there - before we ever even got to the restaurant - Anteprima put a bad taste in my mouth. One of my friends had been there previously and they had been out of the entree he had wanted to try and so had called ahead to see if he could preorder (and prepay) so that he would be able to try it on this visit. They refused! (and of course they were out of it again when we arrived). We were 2 minutes away from the restaurant, when the host called to find out where we were - at a point when we were actually not yet late. While I can appreciate a host being on top of things - let it be said that his questions regarding our whereabouts were not without an attitude that extended to when we actually arrived at the restaurant and as he sat us without hiding his obvious unneccessary annoyance. BEYOND THAT POINT though - our food was phenomenal - the grilled octupus appetizer was delectable and tender - the polenta was so light and fluffy that it literally melted in my mouth and my monkfish was superb. Our server was wonderful and made excellent suggestions for both beverage and food. I will go back and hopefully make it past the host stand with a smile still on my face so that I can give this restaurant a review that matches the excellence of the meal itself.
