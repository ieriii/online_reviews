I never realized that this little joint was SO incredibly good. Being in Chicago pizza is like having lake michigan water its everywhere you go. However, this has now made it in to my top 5 picks for Chicago. Chicago pizza tours add this to the list YO! The pan pizza is kind of amazing. I am a huge fan of the freshness of the pizza and ingredients they use. Specifically with the spinach, often times it can be frozen and not fresh but it is just freshly wilted on to that pizza and with their sauce truly satisfying. They have a limited selection of beers but they are seasonal and they have your standards for a divey pizza joint. Don't expect much from the atmosphere and I am definitely bending this review from a 4 and a half start to 5 because I want to give it the full credit, but sometimes service can be a little lacking.  I have also called to have it delivered and although they get quite busy they stay with in the time frame they project, always tastes hot and fresh even though I live fairly far north. WHICH is another plus that they deliver that far... But yeah I'm hungry just writing this.  AND get the sampler appetizer. You won't be disappointed with fried goodness of all sorts.
