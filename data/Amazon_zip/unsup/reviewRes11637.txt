This place can be a big crowded mess if you go in on any given evening, but show up for lunch and it is a total dream boat. Brilliant thin crust pizza and about about seven house brewed beers on tap (plus a decent selection of bottled craft beers). This place is very reasonably priced for the quality. You can order 3 oz. beer samples for one dollar. I recommend the "top heavy" hefeweizen and the baron von awesome, but I avoid the golden arm. Expect a wait if you go anytime after 5 PM.  Overall a terrific pizza pub.
