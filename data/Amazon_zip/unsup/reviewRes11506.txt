I came here for brunch with my girlfriends on a Saturday. We had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, but it wasn't too bad because there are shops nearby that you browse in while you wait for your table. We were seated in a comfy booth and everything on the menu looked great. One of my friends is a vegetarian and there were plenty of options for her as well. I got the special omelette which had chorizo and avocados. It was huge and totally delicious. It also came with some nice house potatoes. I would like to come back and try their sweet breakfast offerings like the french toast, but based on my chorizo omelette, this place deserves 4 stars!
