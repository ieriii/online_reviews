I thought this was a really cool and different concept. I went here on my bday but i wasn't exactly sure how the bar worked. Not sure if going with a group was such a good idea. I think this is a great spot if you want to go on a one and one evening that is mellow with some fun cocktails. As a group that is out to celebrate your bday not so much. After standing in line for about 30 min my nice buzz from dinner was disappearing, and by the time we sat down I was so tired i had a hard time bringing back that birthday energy. (it was the standing in line that did it) We did show up later around 10pm as well. It was a fun evening regardless, and a great place to enjoy the night perhaps under different circumstances.
