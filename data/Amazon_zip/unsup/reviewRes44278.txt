Wakamono is just around the corner from me, so we tend to wind up there quite often. I will have to disagree with the reviewer who said this place was pretentious. It's a pretty casual place and I've been treated the same whether I am dressed up or in a hoodie on my way home from running errands. My experience with the food has always been consistent. We try to order a new maki roll each time in addition to the Yo la mango roll and the sweet potato roll. These rolls are nothing short of fantastic. This is not the best sushi place in the city, but the Yo la mango roll is now something we crave and keeps us coming back. The sashimi is always, always very fresh. The nigiri & sashimi are 2 per order and you can mix (one sashimi, one with rice). The BYOB $8 corkage fee is steep if you are bringing in more budget wine, but it is nice to have the option. The restaurant is dark and the tables next to the door suck. The dcor is heavy on the wood and the 2 person tables are small. With that said, it has a great atmosphere and the attached bar is a great place to grab a pre-dinner drink. The drink menu have some fun choices, including a carbonated sake. I've always had great service here (I have never ordered take out). Occasionally there is something lost in translation (i.e. getting Pinot Noir instead for Grigio), but we've always had great service. The price is listed as Moderate here, but I've never had a bill that was under $30 per person. It's very easy to spend around $100 for 2. All in all, I am really happy to have this place in the neighborhood.
