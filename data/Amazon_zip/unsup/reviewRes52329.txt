I am new to Chicago, and hence I have not been to a ton of deep dish pizza places, but of those that I have been to, Gino's is my fave! I have taken all my visiting friends here over the last couple of weeks. And though I must say that I am ready to take a break from deep dish, I did truly enjoy every bite. Coming from nyc, I was not used to this type of pizza but it has really grown on me. And though I don't think I will be able to eat it that often because of how filling it is, Gino's does it right! I love sauce and they have a good sauce to cheese to crust ratio. There is a wait if you go at a normal lunch hour, but I would say it's worth the wait. And remember, it takes at least 30 minuets to make a small deep dish, so maybe have a little snack before deciding to come over to Gino's. I would stick to the pizza though. I have ordered both a salad and the bruschetta and was not pleased with either.
