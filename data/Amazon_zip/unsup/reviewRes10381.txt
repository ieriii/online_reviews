Piccolo Sogno is bellisimo! To begin our server, Pietro, was fabulous. He checked on us regularly and made sure we were fat and happy. We ventured to this delight for restaurant week. Their menu was quite large and for my veggie folks, they had plenty of veggie options from which to choose. I started with the celery root flan. It was surprisingly delectable. For the main, I had the spinach and potato gnocchi with mushrooms, oven dried tomatoes and garlic. It was large in portion and very tasty. I concluded with the panna cotta with saffron and berries. Who knew saffron would taste good on a dessert. My boyfriend had the pasta with boar ragu and he "wolfed" it own like a wolf taking down a boar. Despite it being crowded, the ambience was lovely and we were able to enjoy our conversation. If you want an upscale Italian Nuevo experience that maintains the charm of the restaurants in Europe, definitely put this restaurant on your list. Note: it is located across from the Blue line's Grand stop, so take the train if you want to avoid valet parking for a fee or difficult to find street parking on a Friday night. Chitown Veg Gal
