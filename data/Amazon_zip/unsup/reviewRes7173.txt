Okay Sapori, what gives? The food is still great but.... I've been eating here for 5-6 years now, and during that time there has been a SIGNIFICANT increase in Sapori's prices. Entrees that used to be $13.99 are now $19.99. For a VEGETARIAN dish. Excuse me? Every entree has increased $6-$7. This is not fine dining folks, so you shouldn't have to pay fine dining prices. Do not go unless you have one of the $15 off coupons--it's really not worth it, and they send 10 coupons/year so there's no excuse for paying full price here.
