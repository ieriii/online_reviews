This is my go to Chinese spot. I am so happy I live in the South Loop to be able to indulge whenever my heart desires. Every time I order out or for delivery, its scalding hot, super big portions, and to fresh and tasty. Orange Chicken, King Pao (so spicy) anything, Sesame Chicken, Egg Rolls and the Crab Rangoon, ohhhhh the Crab Rangoon. so freaking awesome. The inside of the restaurant is clean, and welcoming, and the staff is so awesome. The menu also has a bunch of eclectic dishes too if you want to walk on the wild side. You will not be disappointed. I promise! Signed, Customer for life
