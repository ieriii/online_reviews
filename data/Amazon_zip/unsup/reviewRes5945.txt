Wow - I am still dazed by our experience at Davanti last night. It really is as good as it gets. The decor is really cool, and seems very cosy and quaint. It is always crowded for obvious reasons. I am glad we went on a weekday as we got to the table right away. The service is impeccable. Not once did we have an empty glass of water. And our server was very helpful, attentive and charming. She made some good recommendations too. The food - is simply great. This is the kind of Italian food I love. Light, fresh and simple. I am not a very big fan of platefuls of greasy pasta swimming in uber creamy sauce. For me Italian cooking is about letting the fresh produce and ingredients to shine through. We started with their summer special - heirloom tomatoes, avocado and watermelon with balsamic reduction - it was super. Then we had the corn, walnut, arugula, aged goat cheese and wild mushroom. When I tasted a forkful of this, I was in heaven. It was the perfect bite!! Then we ordered the mushroom pizza with the truffle oil - omg delicious!! Washed all the chow down with delicious Chianti. Finished the dinner with Torta Bacci, which is chocolate hazelnut mousse and my husband also had the capuccino. I cannot find a single negative thing to say about the food. This is a great restaurant with great food and at very reasonable prices. It is a rare find!!
