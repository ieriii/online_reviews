Visited for lunch on a special occasion with friends. We had a fantastic experience. The fried calamari is hands down the best I've had in the City. I've had it all the Italian joints on Taylor Street and at all of the Rosebud restaurants and Piccolo Sogno was by far the best. It's fried to perfection, delicately battered, tender and yes, it melts in your mouth. Also had the osso bucco risotto which was flawlessly prepared (which is a pet peeve of mine as I've had the unfortunate experience of having gummy risotto in a number of otherwise good places) and absolutely yummy. This place gets a lot of love from fellow yelpers and I can clearly see why.
