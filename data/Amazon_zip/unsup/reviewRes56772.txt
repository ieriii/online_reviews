This is my FAVORITE place for pizza. Hands down, the most delicious pizza you will find in Chicago. I'm a big fan of the salsiccia - Italian sausage, mozzarella, basil. If you have had true Italian pizza (as in, the pizza you would find in Italy), then you know that Spacca is the only place that can re-create that authentic experience. Brava!
