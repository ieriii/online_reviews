maki maki maki! If you're a roll fan, this is the place to go. They have many unique rolls, and each we had tonight were quite good. They do not, however, have sashimi. The closest you can get is the sashimi roll which has no rice but still is wrapped in seaweed. It's a smaller establishment, a little dark and cozy inside, would be a nice place for a date.
