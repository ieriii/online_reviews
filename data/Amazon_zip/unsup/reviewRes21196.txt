Rick does it again! What else would you expect. This is the way a sandwich should taste- filled with flavor, all natural, and super FRESH! This is no Subway, not even your typical Mexican restaurant torta. The pork and the vegetarian are my favorites (how ironic). Even the drinks are natural juices with combinations that only Rick can come up with. I went back 3 times in 2 weeks after my first experience at Xoco. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
