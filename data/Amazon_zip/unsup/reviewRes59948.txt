I wish I had the option to give this place NO stars, but alas, it isn't an option. While the cookies are great, the service is horrible. I stood around while no one even looked at me and when someone finally was able to help me, they were rude, did not welcome me or thank me. As a matter of fact, I wasn't even asked if I wanted anything else. The wood was dirty and coming up and there was the biggest leak in the ceiling. I would never waste my time to go into this place again. I mean if they keep the front (where everyone can see) dirty then who knows what the inside looks like!
