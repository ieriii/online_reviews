I was visiting friends in Chicago so we hit up this new brewery. I love breweries and was excited to see that there was a new one in town. I liked the physical place - big open space, big bar, brewing vats in sight. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. The beer was delicious and the food was good. Not great, but a good price.  I ate the tempeh rueben sandwich (she made sure I new what tempeh was) and it was exactly what I expect from a good tempeh sandwich. Also happy when places are veggie friendly!
