Having not been to Kinzie Chop House for over a year, we went back. Probably shouldn't have. Nothing was wrong, but we sat there eating steaks that we both knew were not as good as Ruth Chris' or Mortons or Ditka's.  There's no reason to avoid Kinzie Chop House. Just not enough reason to pick it over better choices in Chicago.
