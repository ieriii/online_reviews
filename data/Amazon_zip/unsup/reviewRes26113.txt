I remember reading about Simply It in Time Out Chicago. So... I decided to check the place out. At a reasonable price, Simply It offers yummy, delicious, and authentic Vietnamese food. The atmosphere of the restaurant screams traditional, even though the setting screams modernity. The decor of the table were nicely set up with flickering little candles in the evening. Paintings and photos of the homeland country on the wall added comfortability. The people working there were all so lovely and extremely friendly; especially the owner, Mr. Tuan. So far I've tried about four different dishes and I have nothing but good words . Suggestions for newcomers: try the crepes, pasta beef, spring rolls, simply beef, and for desert, go for the fried banana with ice-cream. Also, the bubble smoothies- preferably mango or strawberry. I went on a date here and the ambiance was cute and adorable. It's also BYOB. So bring some classy wine and enjoy.
