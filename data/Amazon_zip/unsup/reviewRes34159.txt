I have little to add to the reviews here. The portions are ginormous, but the service is severely lacking. It took longer to get our check than to receive our breakfast. There's quite a bit of vegetarian options (Eggs Florentine, Cajun 'Shroom Scramble, and Garden Veggie Omelet, etc) on their menu though. I do recommend Yolk before spending hours at the Field Museum.
