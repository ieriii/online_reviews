Well we made it to the Green Mill on the 12th September. we really came to see Patrica Barber. the Green Mill is an Excellent place for music. close to the Red Line as well. The Be Quiet during the show was great.Had no problem with that at all. Patrica Barber was fantastic and I can recommend to see her and her band on Monday Nights. only other thing about the green mill maybe the booths in the middle could be turned around because they face away from the stage. but other than that great place and great night.
