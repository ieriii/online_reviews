Went here for dinner a few weeks ago with a party of six. Make sure you are hungry when you get here because the food is literally never ending. The formal buffet style of this restaurant allows you to try a little bit of everything, while still allowing you to choose the pace of the meal. The food was very good, although the wait staff was a little too attentive, often interrupting conversations to ask questions and offer more. The drinks were good as well. The biggest hiccup came at the end of the night when the bill came, and the waitstaff found it very difficult to split the bill up among the multiple couples. Overall a good place that I would go again.
