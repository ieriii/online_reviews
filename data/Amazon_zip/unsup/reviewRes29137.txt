I know everyone raves about Opart- maybe the meat dishes are great (I'm a vegetarian) but everything I've had there was either not so great or average. I've eaten in there a few times as well as gotten delivery from them, so I doubt my experiences have been limited to "off days". If I'm in Lincoln Square and getting Thai I'd much rather go to Rosded, less than a block away.
