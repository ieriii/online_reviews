This is my new "Go-To" spot! I have been here 2 times now and have not been disappointed with a single thing ordered. Both times we ordered Spanish red wine and love that when they bring it to your table you get a little background/info on the wine. The pork neck/ricotta "smear" is our FAVORITE thing on the menu and keeps bringing us back. The clams rosemarina is also VERY fresh and a flavor explosion in your mouth. It didn't go at all with our wine but we wanted to try it and weren't let down a bit. On our last trip we had the Butternut Squash with Pumpkin seeds and my husband and I fought over who got the last bite (he won).  We have been here on a Friday and a Saturday and both times it has been crowded but never more then a 5 min wait for two people. I'm sure we'll be back soon and hope to be "regulars" by the end of the winter!
