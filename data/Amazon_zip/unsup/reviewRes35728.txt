Yep - as good as it gets! Went there on 12/26/11. Great atmo. No wait. Excellent, friendly service. Wonderful beer, wine, and drink choices. Oysters! Oysters! and more Oysters! They were amazing. Food was simply delicious. This will be a repeat next time I'm in Chicago. Fresh seafood in an old school setting. Just the best!!!!
