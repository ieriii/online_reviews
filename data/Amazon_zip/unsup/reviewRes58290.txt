All I have to say is: Milanesa Sandwich (the sauce is so amazing and what definitely differentiates the sandwich from a typical torta), Chips & Guacamole (both fresh!), and Oatmeal Shake (need I say more?). The only three things you need to be happy in life! Their Horchatas are really good, too.This place is super casual and very, very inexpensive - two people can eat for under $25, for sure. It's basically a fast food restaurant, except with a waiter. Their entire seating area is technically outdoors, too. It's one of those things you'd have to see yourself to figure it out... I'm really not sure how it works in the winter.....Overall, I really love the food, the atmosphere is pretty weird, and I'm not at all a fan of their Cash Only policy, even if they have an ATM on hand.
