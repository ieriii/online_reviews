Pour the wine Luis! This was one of those nights where you say, "Hey baby, you still have that gift certificate?" And off we went! We chose Wildfire; I recommend reservations on Friday nights, and drove on down. Great valets and when you factor the parking sitch. Good deal. We head in without reservations and expected a wait...but an hour and half was a bit long.... again, my fault for being spontaneous in Chicago on a Friday night. We put our names on the list and head to the bar.... At the bar we meet Luis, great bartender, and a few local folks that tell us all about Wildfire as they wait for their to-go order. We have a few Martini's and then order the special for something like 30 bucks per person and 14 for the wine pairing. We enjoy the amazing steaks..Now when we received them I will say they were mixed up and she got the medium rare with bleu cheese and I got the medium with horseradish. We simply switched steaks and enjoyed a couple more glasses of wine and some awesome dessert ...more wine and then headed out.  I can understand the mix-up because they were super busy and it was loud...no points lost as we had a great date night and Luis was awesome. We never got to the dining room...we enjoyed a great meal at the bar. Better for people watching! There was this couple that sat down next to us that was soooo uppity and rude to the bartenders. Come on just be polite! I was about to say something for them... Amazing food, Great people, and Nice Ambiance!
