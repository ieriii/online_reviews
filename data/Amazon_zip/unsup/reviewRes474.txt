this is by far the most creative, original and elaborate meal that i have ever attended. the ingredients were pristinely perfect, the courses impossibly complex and overall highly impressive. the decor reminded me of a super trendy, high-class hotel when we walked in, setting the tone for the impeccable service that followed. so why didn't i give it a 4 and not a 5 with such high praise? simply because although everything was cleanly executed, i didn't feel a personal connection with the food. to me, they never became greater than a sum of its parts. i found the courses cold, sometimes austere, and never encountered anything that made me go yum, i could eat bowls of this stuff. so while i am glad i had the dining experience that was alinea, i'm not sure when or if i would return.
