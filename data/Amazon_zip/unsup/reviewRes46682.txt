Best burgers in the city in my opinion. They have a huge selection of menu items, including several variations on your standard burger. The food is fantastic, the burgers are cooked to order, and use real hamburger, no frozen patties or anything. I give it a 5 star even though they don't have fries, which is a minor disappointment for me, but the burgers are worth it.  They have Take out as well, but I don't live near enough to make it worth it. Decor is interesting as the walls are covered in pictures of current and former waitresses. It can be a bit cramped actually, but I've never had that much issue with it actually.
