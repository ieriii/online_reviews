Uh! Yum! I have had breakfast and seafood here, and they were both very taste-a-licious. The scrambled eggs were done perfectly and the Mimosas were fantastic. The lobster roll....uh, get in my belly! Also, the crab legs were great! My waiter was cute and on top of it! I do try to go at off times, like breakfast around 11:00, dinner around 9:00 because it does get way busy. The patio is nice in the summer and the crowd here has been lovely every time, always friendly and fun.
