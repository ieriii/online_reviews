The day had finally come for our dinner at Alinea! I have never tried as hard as I did to get a reservation at ANY restaurant as I did with Alinea. Since they announced they were switching to a Next-like ticketing system, it became an obsession of mine for over a month to check their website and Facebook page every half an hour, eagerly waiting their release of August tickets. Being from out of town, I only had 3 nights that would have worked for my schedule so that made it even harder to secure a reservation. On that fateful afternoon that the tickets were released, I only found out about 15 minutes after they went on sale and they were almost all sold out. I was extremely lucky to snatch up the last available table for 2 for the day that would work for me. Tickets to this restaurant were tougher to get than Justin Bieber concert tickets! (ok bad analogy) The many hours of my life spent religiously checking their website was worth it. It was by far the best dining experience ever. What all the other Yelpers have already said is true. Simply amazing.
