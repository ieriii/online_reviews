def not my favorite pizza place in the city... by far! i brought my 'central illinois' family here for our summer visit- and really wanted to like it! they love the chicago deep dish- but none of us were impressed with ginos. the pizza was just ok- nothing special about it. we also got garlic breadsticks....COVERED in oil. service... eh. the waitor brought us i dont know HOW many plates- even if they werent dirty hed pick them up and bring new ones. price- a little overpriced for what we got. only plus- the interior is kinda neat- with graffiti all over the place. final word: pass on gino's east.
