"Good things come to those who wait." We've all heard this too many times to count. Hot Doug's seems to take it to heart. There is no doubt in my mind that they could make the neccessary adjustments/additions (add another cashier, extend their hours, etc.) to compensate for the traffic overflow. But I think in doing so, it would take away from the experience Doug has created. Yes, waiting is generally not a good thing, but for some strange reason I think it works here. I personally did not mind the wait, which was approximately 30 mintues from end of line to ordering time. You just need to be sure to plan for it. I don't think much needs to be said about the food, it was spectacular. Just be sure to eat it immediately. I think a lot of the flavor is lost and the buns tend to get a bit soggy, if you wait even just a few minutes. The dog toppings are absolutely perfect. Prices are very reasonable for the standard menu, and they don't charge extra for most of the add on toppings. Prices for some of the more unique dogs can add up, but definitely still are worth it; cheaper and much more filling than sushi. (No I am not comparing hot dogs to sushi in terms of types of product, but more in terms of cost of experimentation. Most of us sushi fans have no problem paying $15 for a couple pieces or roll of fish that we've never had. So why not do it on a unique hot dog?) Doug took our order, and I must say, I don't think I have ever had a more polite and eager employee take my order at a restaurant. Overall a very tasty and fun experience.
