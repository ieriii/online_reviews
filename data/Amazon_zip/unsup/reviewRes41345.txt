This is my favorite place in the city. Our server, Matt, is always great (be sure to ask to be seated in his section...tell him Paul sent ya). The food is terrific, Lobster Bisque is to die for, perhaps the best in the city, even better than Riva which has a great one. Try the bone in filet if on special, you'll love it and the barbecue shrimp and smoked salmon. Chris the GM does a great job running this place. The food is great, but the service is better! After a hard week there is nothing like going to a place where they are extremely attentive and just relaxing...you can do that at Ruth's Chris and that puts it at the very top of my list.
