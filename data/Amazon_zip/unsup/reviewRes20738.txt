Couldn't resist all the rave, so had to go- Went for Saturday early evening around 5:45pm, the wait was as anticipated for we sat at our table at 6:30. But be reminded that we were a party of 5... it seemed that smaller parties got seated a few minutes earlier. My friend and I shared two tortas as they are cut in half. Ahodaga - the carnitas torta was DELISH! The sauce/broth that it's served with defintiely made the dish. We ordered medium hot and definitely still had a kick. Yes, the bread might have gotten soggy had it sit in the sauce longer but we picked those babies up right away and chowed down. The bread was crispy yet soft enought to fit right into my mouth for the ultimate satisfaction. SCORE. Milanesa - the chicken milanesa torta was also great but just not as good as the Ahodaga. It was served with a salsa verde, but I kept going back to the red sauce from our Ahodaga plate to pour on top of the Milanesa. I would probably like to see a little less cheese, but that's just how I like my sammys. Churros - 3 for $3! They were so yummy, rolled in sugar and housemade ground chocolate. Since it was a humid day I shied away from the hot chocolate and went for the homemade soft serve vanilla icecream to dip the churros in. YUMMMMY! But I found my self dusting off the sugar as I thought there was a bit much. Overall, something I'd do all over again regardless of the line or the weather. I'm not sure if I'd still find the experience totally awesome if I wasn't as hungry as I was when I went. Rick Bayless, you don't disappoint!
