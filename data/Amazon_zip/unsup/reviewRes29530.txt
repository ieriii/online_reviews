Before they jacked up the prices to cover the cost of the expansion, i would've given this place a 4 star. however, the last time i went there i was a little disappointed in the portion size, especially after the prices went up! however, they do have my favorite basil chicken. they use ground chicken and can really make it spicy! someone once said they have the best crab rangoon.... i don't think that is true. only stand out item i've had here is the basil chicken.
