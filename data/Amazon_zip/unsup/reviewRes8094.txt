Wow! This place is amazing! Everything is so fresh and delicious. The service is absolutely the best I have ever received at any restaurant. They replenish the side dishes immediately. The sides include flavorful mashed potatoes, rice, beans, and a plantain dessert. I've never seen a salad bar with so many choices! You will want to fill up on everything there, but don't, you must save A LOT of room for all the meat! My favorites were the filet mignon, and pork.  When the bussers come to your table, be sure to watch how they pick up crumbs. It's quite fascinating. They have special instruments that do the job efficiently. Free entertainment!
