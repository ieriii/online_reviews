Love love love love love. Love. Love. (That was the last one) Anytime I can drink a Kir Royale for breakfast I will be pleased, but when it is paired with near-perfect home fries and totally amazing (and creative) pancakes or french toast or egg anything, I will be... in love. Yes, there's a wait (unless you go on weekday mornings... didn't think of that, did you? Work can do without you for an extra hour!). Yes, it's crowded. But these seem to be standard aspects of many of the best places in Chicago, *especially* during brunch time, so take it as a sign that you have good taste (like alllll those other people waiting in line with you) and go browse some nearby shops after you get your name on the list.
