One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I love the fish! I've had several fish dishes. I also love the homemade pasta. You can't go wrong with anything here. Service is great. Food is wonderful. I've even gotten several of my friends and family into this place and they all love it too. You won't be disappointed. Check it out!
