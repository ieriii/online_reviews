After all of the hype, I finally had Pequod's for the first time last night. (Thanks to grub hub, I discovered they deliver to my place!) The pizza was absolutely amazing. We got plain cheese and I wish I was still eating it right now! That caramelized cheese is to die for! I love cheese on anything and everything and the crust is no exception. The pizza was ready and delivered in an hour which is better than other local places I've tried. If you're looking for delicious pan pizza, Pequod's has to be one of the best in Chicago!
