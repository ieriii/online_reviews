Dude I was in Chicago for only like 5 days. I went to a couple pizza joints and this place was the illest!  We had the most rad righteous pizza here, all you haters, come on now, just cause you had to wait long don't got nothin' on the pizza!  The feelin' was there, the vibe was fun and crowded and the pizza was on point for sure. The deep dish....oh their deep dish, I guess I could go on and on about how it saved my life but you are just gonna have to check in. I spec the locals know a thing or two aboot pizza, but for us out-of-townies Giordano's is like finding a suit case full of money in a ditch near your house.
