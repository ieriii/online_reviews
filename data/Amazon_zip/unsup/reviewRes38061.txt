Before I moved to Chicago close to four years ago, two different people here told me that Hopleaf was right up my alley. After randomly moving to Andersonville (walking distance!), I discovered that they were completely correct. Wow. I've been to Belgium and loved it. Whenever I get a hankering to go back I hit Hopleaf and enjoy fries in a cone, complete with garlic mayo--much cheaper than schlepping all the way back to Europe! A good friend and I go here and pair beer with food courses--seriously! We'll share each beer and food course so as to get a complete palate journey (without getting snockered..good beer has a higher alcohol content!). I love Hopleaf, but beware: this ain't a singles bar. Don't go expecting to find a mate for the evening. Go with someone whose company you enjoy and sit back for amazing beer and ambiance. It's also great for blind/first dates. Trust me on this. Get a booth in the front and even if s/he is a dud, you still get to enjoy amazing beer. (Note: no table service in the front room.) They're also nice about those times you leave your credit card behind the bar and have to come back for it... What can I say? I always like to open a tab while waiting for a table...
