Bottom line: NOT RECOMMENDED. The amount of salt used in this place kills any positive feeling you want to have for this restaurant. Came here expecting to use a groupon. Found out that you have to make reservations ahead of time in order to use groupon. Irksome... but would not have minded if the food was even half decent... We orded the Entrana and Bandeja Paisa: - Entrana (get in medium): although the better of the two, it was very salty (saved by the fact that service was good and water was refilled frequently) - Bandeja Paisa (stay away from this one): No difference between this and a $5.99 rib-eye dinner at a vegas diner; actually this is worse because it is too salty Pros: - Good service - Great ambiance Cons: - Steak is nothing special (at best) - All the sides are over fried; leaves your throat feeling like it has been coated in reused oil - All the meats are way too salty; aggravated by (1) the sides are so fried you have nothing to pare down the saltiness of the meat and (2) the salsa are even saltier than the meat
