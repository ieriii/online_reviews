I got food here for the first time the other day, and I'm literally still thinking about it. In fact, my mouth waters when I think about it. I ordered the CB&J: cashew butter, fig preserve, and morbier cheese on sourdough, grilled to perfection (in butter, or in the Form of the Good, I'm not sure which). The combination of flavors was pretty near revelatory. Nutty, sweet but not too sweet, and rich, it was the kind of sandwich that I would like to have as a life partner. It came with a side of Stilton. mac. and. cheese. If you are a fan of fancy mac and cheeses, you have to try it. I'd say it's better than a certain smoked gouda mac on North Ave. (sorry, Handlebar, but we'll always have the Radler) and equally as good, though utterly different than, Harmony Grill's amazing mac and cheese (that's saying a lot). The homemade potato chips are pretty good too. The whole thing isn't cheap -- $10 -- but the portion is very generous. And if you can restrain yourself from ordering an incredibly exotic beer ($45 Belgian, anyone?) they have Point's pale ale on tap for $3/pint and it pairs nicely! I love you, Hopleaf.
