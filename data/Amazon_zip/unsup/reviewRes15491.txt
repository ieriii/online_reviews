I had no idea what the inside looked like, with such dark tinted windows and dark awning, Calo just seeming to disappear into the colorful Clark St. atmosphere. I guess the exterior speaks for it's food, as the dishes here were bland and forgettable. We came here on a Monday night. Our server did not want to be there, which left US feeling like.. well, like we didn't want to be there. I asked our waitress what was good on the menu, or if there was anything in particular that crowds/regulars really enjoyed. Her response? "Well, like here, look at the specials list. All this stuff is good. Yea, our entire menu.. the food is good." "uhh.. ok thanks?" So I ordered a baked pasta dish (rotolo di pesce?) and.... it looked gross. It looked like a rolled up linguine that had a slice of white processed cheese melted on top. It looked like something my 10 year old cousin could whip up for me. The dish was warm, but not flavorful at all, and the presentation was just so.. off-putting. The only thing good about this place was the attentive service from the bus boy who was more contentious to our needs than our waitress.
