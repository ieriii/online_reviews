I went to The Chicago Diner while on vacation with my Husband in May 2009, we went with my dear and fabulous girlfriend who lives in Chicago. The wait was a pain, but well worth it. We tried the mac and cheese (vegan), chili (vegan) and the enchiladas. I know we tried other dishes that were specials at the time. I enjoyed the food, it is always awesome to be able to eat somewhere without hesitation or questions about the menu. The service felt a bit rushed, but they were still on a wait even as we finished our meals - so we moved on somewhere else to relax and have a few drinks.
