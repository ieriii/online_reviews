OK, first, I don't like national chains. Second, I don't like dropping fifty bux a head on dinner. Third, I gotta tell you, these people are frigging geniuses. Here's their game.You walk in the door. It's 50 bux a head for dinner, so, naturally, you're expecting to be wowed. You grab a plate and dive into the best salad bar on earth. Your stomach starts working.You get to your table and there's a never ending supply of carbs. Bread, potatos, bananas, polenta. You dive in.Then the meat comes. A parade of meat. An orgy of meat. But your belly is already half-full. They slice the meats real thin so you can try lots of different kinds of meat. But the fact is that you're already pretty full, and there's only so much you're going to put on your plate at once that you can enjot the experience. So, you don't even notice that you've had three or four thin slices of meat, some potatoes and a bit of salad for 50 bux plus all the add-ons.My bet is that the average patron eats somewhere around 6-8ounces of meat, and has one-mebbe-two trips to the salad bar (again, the best on earth!). I figure that the actual cost of food has to be somewhere in the $6-8 range. And they charge you $50, plus plus plus. Look, I figure, if you pay 2x or 2.5x, that's fair... you get a good deal, and the restaurant gets to make some money... but 6+x... that's highway robbery.So. If you want to go, here's what I suggest:1) Go for lunch, when the same experience is 20 bux, plus-or-minus. Eat as much and as many meats as you wanna... just chill on the carbs so you don't fill your belly too quickly2) For dinner sometime, go just for the salad bar. Again, 20 bux, plus-or-minus.Both ways, you get a fair deal on terrific food. Then this place gets 5 stars. The way they do it, that game of theirs, I don't like it. 1 star. Averaging out, they get 3.
