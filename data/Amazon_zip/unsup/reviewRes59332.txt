I joined Yelp just so I could give a glowing review of this place!I made a reservation for the Red Room (as suggested by the fellow reviewers on this site) and was seated promptly. My date and I brought a bottle of wine and a bottle of saki, and the waitress brought us saki glasses as soon as she saw we had it with us.The atmosphere was very cool and hip. Dimly lit, pretty artwork, nice music. The menu is extensive. We ordered crab rangoon and it was amazing! My main dish was the Indie Signature Curry and it was fantastic, so rich and aromatic with so many different flavors. Definitely ranks up there with one of the best massuman curries I've ever had. The plate presentation was also gorgeous. I felt like I was at a 5 star restaurant, not a small hidden joint in Edgewater! My date ordered the Summer Passion Sushi and he said it was wonderful, so even though I don't eat sushi, I tried it and I thought it was great!We also ordered green tea ice cream and red bean paste mochi ice cream. Both were wonderful. As soon as I got home, I raved to my roommate and told her we were going there as soon as possible. It was swank, delicious, cheap, and lovely. Looks great for groups and it was definitely great for a romantic date :) I WILL BE BACK, INDIE CAFE!
