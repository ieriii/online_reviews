Ricotta Gnuddi-I need 10 more on my plate please. The marble size gnuddi make me yearn for more.  The prok belly entree-crispy skin, melt in my mouth belly fat, meat that falls apart tender. The gruyere donut dessert-Sweet and savory, maple syrup, whipped goat cheese to dip. And the yuzu toody-great winter drink!
