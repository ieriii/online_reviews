Yum yum yum. This place was super cute and super tasty. I went on a weekday by me lonesome (another stop on business), wanting to take in some of the local flavor. The Bongo Room is a must stop and must chomp. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes. I am not really a pancake lover, but thought the combo sounded refreshing. 2 pancakes the size of my face came out and the best part I think was that brown sugar butter on the side.. HOT DAMN!! you must try it.
