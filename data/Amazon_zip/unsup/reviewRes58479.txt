OK hot dog and very good cheeseburgers but they are completely out of line with their prices. As is the case with most places that receive alot of publicity and get turned into tourist traps (there were literally people taking pictures of themselves in front of the place when I visited Super Dawg), the prices skyrocket. If you enjoy dropping over $20 for a couple of cheeseburgers and two drinks--then Super Dawg is the place for you. Yes, the pickled green tomatoes are a nice touch but the food just doesn't equal the prices and all of the baseless hysteria about the place. My guess is thirty years ago, Super Dawg was a pretty good deal--before the Food Network and everything that is wrong with pop culture inflated the owner's ego and the food prices. Let's face it--fast food can provide a very savory meal--but no one in their right mind heads to a hot dog stand as a destination restaurant or to satisfy an epicurean desire! Consequently, I don't get all of the hyperbole and gushing about Super Dawg--it's a drive-in -(big deal) with decent food (so?) and completely outrageous prices--need I say more?I have had better hot dogs for ALOT less money, many times in and around Chicago--Janson's (Beverly neighborhood), Gene and Jude's, Tasty Dog (Oak Park) and Byron's on Irving Pk--near crumbling Wrigley Field--are the real deal , in connection with Chicago-style hot dogs. Super Dawg is more hype than value--overall I was rather disappointed.
