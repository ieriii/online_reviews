Amazing dinner. Definitely for special occasions and when guests come to town. Dress is formal, for the most part. I went here on a Saturday night, made reservations for three about two hours before wanting to go in. Very accommodating staff. My girlfriends and I were craving something noodly, but asian and we didn't know what to expect when we came here. Definitely our first time trying Vietnamese-French food! All three of us ordered number 49 on the menu, which was basically flat noodles, chili sauce, scallions. It was amazing. It definitely hit the spot in a very balanced way. Every flavor was just perfectly mixed. Not too spicy, not bland at all. Noodles were not overcooked, and the sauce was just enough, but not a soup. Balance on the tongue that few Asian-influenced restaurants have achieved, IMO. We were definitely full off of our entrees, but then decided to round off our meal with a shared dessert (the Creme Brulee...so creamy, so crunchy, it was the best creme brulee I've had in a very long time), the Mint Green tea and Vietnamese Coffee. The waitstaff were so pleasant and easy to talk to. Very patient with questions and they made sure our glasses were full of water at all times. Very attentive. I have no complaints about this place. It deserves all five stars in my book. I will definitely go here again!
