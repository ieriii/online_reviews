To borrow a phrase from a song you might hear at The Green Mill, I "don't get around much anymore." But of the few nightspots I still continue to visit, The Green Mill would have to be my favorite. Some nights when I've been here listening to an 18-piece Big Band or an intimate combo, I can almost literally feel the sound wash over me; it really feels liquid. And nothing can beat Blatz beer on tap, or the feeling that you've just walked off of a 2010 street into a 1954 nightclub. The Green Mill isn't just a club, it's an essential part of Chicago. Can you even IMAGINE living in this town without catching a glimpse of that classic sign lit up every once in a while?
