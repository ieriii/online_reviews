This is one of my favorite places for brunch. Obviously the wait does suck, but I can't seem to find anywhere worthwhile for Sunday brunch that doesn't have a wait. It just kind of goes with the territory. The food is great, I love the fresh juices, the southern benedict, the corn muffins, yes this is carb heaven! Delicious Bloody Mary's too. The decor is adorable!
