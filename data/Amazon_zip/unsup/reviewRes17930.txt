Wonderful bartenders and possibly the best cocktails in Chicago but if you're from San Francisco, New York or Los Angeles...remember you are in Chicago. The Violet Hour is definitely one of the best Chicago has to offer as far as fresh, artisanal, well-crafted cocktails and I am glad they are paving the way for the cocktail scene in the midwest, but Chicago is still catching up with some of the aforementioned cities. I recommend the Riviera if you like sweet and the As You Wish if you like tart, or just tell the bartender your poison and let him or her surprise you with something amazing.
