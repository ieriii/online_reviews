I may not be the best reviewer for the Art of Pizza, as I don't really like stuffed Chicago pizza (sorry)...but I at least I am open to it. But $2.75 for a gigantic STUFFED pizza slice?! You will not find a better deal than this on a huge slice of stuffed pizza pie. I got a triple-topping (mushrooms, spinach and green peppers) slice and barely made it through half of it. But apart from the joy of paying mere pennies and waiting no more than 10 seconds for a slice of stuffed pizza (as opposed to the typically anticipated 45-60 minutes), the dangers of already-sitting-out pizza-by-the-slice still stood: hot, but not fresh-out-of-the-oven-hot and a slightly soggy crust. I prefer the cheese melted and oozing, which was not the case with this slice.  I'm willing to try this place again and order a fresh-made pizza as the reviews for it are too great to pass up...and I'm really not that turned away from the slices as the $2.75 deal still outweighs all the shortcomings of getting pizza-by-the-slice...so I'm sure I'll be back. Really only 3 stars because I don't like stuffed pizza that much in general...but I'm willing to let it TRY to please me. I'll keep you updated.
