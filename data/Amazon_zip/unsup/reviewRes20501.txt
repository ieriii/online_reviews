This is just for the varieties of hot chocolate and the churros as I haven't had the tortas yet. Experiencing the churros a hot chocolate was probably the purest and simplest joy I felt all year.  Yeah, it was a hard year I guess. Just pure bliss for like the 8 minutes it took for me to consume. Line is not bad for those items and I go a little bit earlier than lunchtime on a weekday. Thank you Rick and all at Xoco!
