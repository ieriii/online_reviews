The pumpkin ravioli here is quite possibly my favorite food in the world. I always intend to try something new when we go, but I always end up getting the pumpkin ravioli because I love it THAT much! My husband does actually vary his menu selections and he is always very very pleased with his meal as well. The wine selection here is good, the ambiance is cute, & the service I've had has ranged from average to excellent. Sapori is definitely my favorite Italian place in the city, and I will continue to go back time & time again.
