Ewwy, there are sooo many better places in Pilsen than this. The best part of my meal was the hot chocolate... that in itself was 5 star and the only reason this place got the 2 stars I'm giving the overall rating. My BF and I went on a Sunday late afternoon and it was friggin packed! They took us into the second room that was chock full of SCREAMING children and everyone packed in so close that they don't even take you to your table, they point to it and let you find your own way to get to it. You'll be an expert at sucking your gut in and apologizing to people you've knocked into by the time you make it there. The service is some of the slowest I've ever seen. For messy tacos, we were there for 2 hours. We had tiny water glasses that were never refilled and our food was dried out and old tasting at best. I could have licked a sidewalk and felt better about my day. My work had gotten food and margaritas delivered from here for a company event and it was absolutely awful. Most people felt sick afterwards, there was not enough food for what we had ordered, and the margaritas had to be nothing more that sour mix and sunny d... they weren't even a normal color and tasted disgusting. Everyone there left hungry and with a sour, turned stomach. Skip it unless you're looking for a grade A cup of Hot Chocolate.
