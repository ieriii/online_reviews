So I went to Hot Doug's twice and so far the second time has gotten better. If you going to wait 45 plus minutes in line, make sure you have cash since they don't accept credit cards.  Also, you have to get the specialty dogs like the foie gras or alligator dog or the other 6 dollar plus because the 3 dollar dogs taste like most other Chicago dog's which are good but not worth waiting 45 minutes. The alligator dog with bleu cheese was pretty awesome. 5 dogs with fries and 2 drinks cost about $40US.
