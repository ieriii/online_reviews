The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars- the service is like that of a pissed off cabbie. They won't win any awards for service, but if you treat this as like some sort of an awesome high school cafeteria setting but with awesome food then you won't be let down. Everyone here concurs: GET THE FALAFEL! Its the best I have ever had- beats mine too. The soup was delicious and the price will not make you even bat an eye. Vegan, Vegetarian, or Omnivore alike will find this place awesome to swing in, grab the cliche plastic red tray and enjoy.
