We wanted something in right in downtown Chicago that was luxurious. Well Hyatt proved that. On top of that we got the room for a steal of a price. The hotel lobby is soaring and has a large bar and restaurants with lots of windows. Check was a breeze and the staff friendly. The room had been renovated recently with a comfy bed, flat panel TV, nice big bathroom and had a great view of the Times building. The fitness center is open 24 hours and is well equipped. There is a Starbucks in the lobby along with a nice restaurant for breakfast. The bar serves some good food too. Concierge was very helpful in arranging a tour on the river run by the Architect's society. The boat is right across the street.  All in all it has everything you would want and if you use the right website to book the room you will pay a third of what the room typically goes for. Book it and enjoy!
