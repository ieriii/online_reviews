I returned to Violet Hour after a loooong sabbatical. Because the place is so nondescript from the outside, I always forget it's there. I was here on a date- and I must say, he chose a great spot for a date. Even he was impressed with his choice! We got there early enough on a weeknight to be able to sit at one of the cool tables (with the giant tall-backed chairs). And this is one of the few bars in the city that play music at a low enough volume that you can actually carry on a conversation. Which he and I actually both took note of and commented on. And the drink menu really doesn't dissapoint. We both got the Moscow Mule- I don't even like Oprah but I know it's one of her favorite cocktails. It was really good! Had a nice tart flavor which I enjoyed! Something different! The ambience, of course, is dark and cozy and romantic (all candlelit)- again, great for a date! I had a fantastic time- sorry I forgot about you Violet Hour!!
