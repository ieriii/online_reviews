I was invited here the first time with a very large group. And we got a very large amount of food and beer! Cooking was shared and merriment ensued. It was a great time. I went back with my boyfriend. It's not as exciting with just two... not so boisterous and merriment making, but still delicious! They gave us a table with a grill which we feared we may not get from other yelp reviews. The boyfriend has simple tastes and doesn't care for the exotic Asian sides (of which there are perhaps exactly 28... seriously a lot for two people even if you like them). I recommend the miso soup. It's just perfectly spiced with jalapenos- something the Japanese wouldn't dream of doing to their miso in my experience living there. Yes, it's smokey. Yes, you cook your own food. Yes, the waitresses don't speak too much for English. That's what a good Korean grill restaurant is all about to me! And I just come to eat... and the order always comes out timely and delicious. Keep the service expectations low, I suppose. It's not THAT bad. If you've eaten in a country where you didn't speak the language before then this place will be a breeze! San Soo Gab San has quite a reputation and every reason to. I never heard a bad thing about it until yelp...
