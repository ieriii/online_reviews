We went on a weekday evening after work. The restaurant is narrow and dark. The music in the background was loud, but intelligent. The bar area is at the front of the restaurant and is smallish. The food is well prepared.  Recommended are one of the  "Toasts" (toasted bread with different spreads). The pasta was (surprisingly) very good. The apple cake is also recommended. Smallish wine list.
