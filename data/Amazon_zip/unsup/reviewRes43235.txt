My wife and I had a great time here the other night. The food was outstanding as we loved everything we ordered (and all dishes were reasonably priced for a place of this quality). A very nice place and the people hostess/servers were extremely nice and unpretentious (unlike some other, similar, establishments). The brownie sundae makes me salivate as I think of it right now. We will be back often I think.
