Went here again last weekend. Party of four...there was a $16 service charge on our bill. Ordered 3 cokes and were charged $4.50. The menu clearly said cokes were $1.00 each. When I brought these problems up to the server, she frantically searched through SIX different menus to try and find one that said $1.50...but she was unable to do so. She seemed to be pissed [that she was caught]. Their food cannot be beat...just make sure you take a careful look at the final bill. I hate (and love) this sneaky place.
