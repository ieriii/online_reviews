If your wanting to try a Brazilian steakhouse Texas de Brazil is my choice in Chicago. The decor is really cool. My bf and I went here one night just because and spent a whopping $145.00!!!! Pretty steep! Now they have 50% off deal up to 6 people which we are trying to find time to go!!! In comparison to Fogo, Texas trumps them across the board. 1. They have a sushi bar 2. The best cheesy potatoes I have ever had 3. Salad bar= Fantastic 4. The meat is seasoned to perfection! My only suggestion is to go starving...maybe even fast for a day so you get the most out of everything they have to offer!!!
