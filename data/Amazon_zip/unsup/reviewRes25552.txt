Went here last night with some friends before we went to Webster place for a movie. Their deep dish pizza is really good. One of my favs that I have had in Chicago. We also tried a small thin crust cheese pizza and it wasn't nearly as good as the deep dish. I recommend trying this place out. You should definitely have a reservation though. We did have a reservation and so did not have to wait long. There was definitely a long line of people waiting for tables though.
