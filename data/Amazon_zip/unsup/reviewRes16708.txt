I love this place! I went twice around the holidays, and loved it both times! The atmosphere is incredibly with great decorations, though it has the potential to get loud on the weekends. It's totally unpretentious and anyone would feel comfortable here. Valet is really cheap as well ($5!). The food is delicious and the ceviche is still the best I've ever had. I can't wait to go back and have more delicious drinks (raspberry mojito!) and food! Try the ceviche and the "tattered clothes" appetizer. They are amazing.
