BEST BELGIAN BAR EVER!!! My friends and I chose Hopleaf in attempts to recapture our study abroad days in Brussels and what a great choice it was. It seemed like we were back in Belgium instantly with every Belgian beer you can think of available (even the bartenders didn't know some of the more obscure beers we ordered off their multiple page beer menu). With an active bar area in the front and an alive restaurant seating area in the back, we put our names on the list for dinner and passed the hour to two hour wait for dinner having frites with aioli sauce, an unbelievable sausage platter, and of course beer...all of which made the wait seem insignificant. Moving to the dining area, I feasted on the likes of mussels and more frites followed up by great conversation with friends in the lively atmosphere. Think it stops here...OH NO! You've got to have one more beer in the bar area to close out your trip to Hopleaf where the staff is friendly, the food is great, and the beer selection brings you right into Belgian's back door.
