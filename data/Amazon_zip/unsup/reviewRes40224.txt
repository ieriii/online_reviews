Young, middle- class white kids with upper class aspirations all milling around- enjoying flights of Bourbon, and well- presented delectable food. Great location- as all the humans that consider themselves a precious gift to the world live within a mile radius of the logan square blue line stop. The problem is that it's as crowded with shoulder to shoulder tables and stools as a Thai restaurant during lunch special. Which I don't mind, if I don't have to spend the entire time concerned that a stray beard hair will be carried through the blustery conversations of those plaid -shirted fellows that dot the place, and into my drink. Perhaps a solution to this would be having all the men wear those beard nets that they wear in restaurant kitchens?
