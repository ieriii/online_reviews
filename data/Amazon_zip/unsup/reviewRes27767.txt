I KNOW THIS IS BLASPHEMOUS, BUT... I wasn't that impressed. The food was good, but not great. Sure, there were high points: local ingredients, excellent salsas, great guac, and fresh tortillas. But there were also a lot of low points: -Slow service -Small portions -Very skimpy with the mole sauce (which wasn't as good as Guelaguetza or Real Tenochtitlan) -Tiny, expensive margaritas Don't get me wrong. I am a Rick Bayless fan and appreciate how he's elevated the perception of Mexican food from chimichanga-type bullshit to its rightful place as one of the world's great cuisines, but I have to call it like I see (or taste) it.
