I read about some great reviews on this restaurant, so thought I'd check it out with some friends. The atmosphere was Hippester like, very contemporary. Food took a long time to come to our table, our waitress was very sweet. When the food did come-out I thought it wasn't bad. However, the portions were small, and the sushi although, presented very well, wasn't outstanding to us. We had the Pad See Ew with beef, panang currie with Chicken, one spider roll, and one Chicago roll. The food wasn't bad but it could've been better in my opinion. It is not a place I would brag about to my friends, however I wouldn't cross if off my list as a hot spot to dine out and have a good time. I did like their Thai Ice Tea. I felt their prices were about right.
