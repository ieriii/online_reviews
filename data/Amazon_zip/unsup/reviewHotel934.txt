This was place was alright. I recently booked a room last minute. The rooms were somewhat small but had a safe, extra storage, and the hotel is dog friendly which is a rarity for a downtown "cheap" room. I would have given more stars if it was cleaner. The bathroom floors, walls and door were pretty ragged. Valet was $40, which I was sort of bummed about when we ended up waiting 20 mins to get our car even though we called ahead and explained we were in a hurry. $40 is standard for the location. Also there is no street parking at all. Other than that, the staff was really friendly, and the location is pretty cool. I highly reccomend this place if you are traveling with a dog and need a last minute place to chill in the city.
