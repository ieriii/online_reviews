What can I say? Hot Doug's is fantastic. The specialty dogs are always an amazing blend in your mouth, as owner Doug Sohn knows *exactly* what he's doing. The chief downside is the location, as it's a bit out of the way from the Rogers Park - Near North Side corridor I typically haunt. There's also bound to be a line, but this is one case where the wait is worth your time. Finally, keep in mind that they only take cash, so hit that ATM before heading over.
