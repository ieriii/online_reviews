I have to say I was really disappointed with this place. we had been wanting to go for a while given all the buzz. Perhaps that plays into the rating it is getting 1. we ordered the special on a sat. night (scallop dish) and we received scallops that had already gone bad! I mean they tasted and smelled fishy. Very bad first impression. I sent them back and they were apologetic, but not as much as I think a restaurant should be that was about to potential sicken their clientele. 2. I really liked the risotto carbonara. very tasty. 3. The giant ravioli was okay, but drenched in clarified butter. I feel like they could have done something a bit less bland (perhaps some sage). 3. the pizza was good. Not excellent, but tasty. overall for the wait and the price, I doubt this place is worth it. and if a chef can't tell that his scallops have gone bad, I'm not sure he is paying enough attention. the service was not great...but I would have forgiven that for good food.
