Kum Gang San in Flushing this aint, but it's a close second. Since the grills are charcoal, this is a bbq in the true sense of the word. It's also smokey. And small. But, the meat is tasty & the panchan are plentiful. I didn't even know the thousand or so little side dishes had a name, so yay for me!
