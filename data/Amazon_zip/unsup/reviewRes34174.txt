Hefty servings. Served fruit with my omelette to ease heartburn. Nice, open kitchen in a cheery, colorfully decorated brunch/lunch spot. Self(?) proclaimed "best Eggs Benedict in Chicago"...duno about the best, but they were definitely good. Waitress did seem like she was in a rush to clear our table even though we showed up for a late breakfast/lunch on a weekday. I can definitely see this place get crazy and unpleasant on the weekends, but on this day, it was dandy.
