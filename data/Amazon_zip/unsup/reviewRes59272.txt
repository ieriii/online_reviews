I have been going to Indie for many years now. I am not a sushi fan but I eat everything else. Rangoons, Thai samosas, Satay, Veggie Egg Rolls, Cucumber Salad, Basil Beef, Classic Fried Rice w/beef, Crazy Basil w/beef, Drunken Noodles with Chicken and on and on and on. Oh and if eating at the restaurant the Fish dishes ROCK!! Wouldn't do fish for delivery, it needs to be enjoyed on site. The delivery is always prompt, food hot and GENEROUS portions. Love Love Love Indie and have tried other places in the neighborhood but none compare. Keep Up the great job Indie!!!
