Doug's has great sausages and a wide selection of exotic meats. The very friendly Doug himself takes the orders and works the register every day. The workers are always very good and courteous. My tips: If you want a hot dog, get it "steamed" and not "charred". If you want something more exotic and they have it available, I can't recommend the Alligator enough; it's my favorite. The Andouille sausage is great, it's one of the more underrated sausages they have. Expect to wait in line for a while. The line is regularly stretched outside and down the block.
