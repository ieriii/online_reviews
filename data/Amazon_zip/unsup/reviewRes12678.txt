This was some of the best food we have encountered since moving to Chicago. I had a very authentic mojito (almost too authentic). Everyone at our table was raving about the food. The portions looked big so my wife and I did an appetizer/entree split. We had the pistachio encrusted chicken. The service was good. This would be a great date place and/or place to bring out of town guests.
