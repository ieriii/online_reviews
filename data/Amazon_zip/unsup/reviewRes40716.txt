Pho 777 down the street has much better Pho. For Bun Bo Hue try Cafe Hoang a little further down the street opposite of Pho 777. There's a story about tank noodle in the Vietnamese community. They say, every year the owners of tank noodle closes the restaurant for a month and goes back to the motherland to celebrate the Vietnamese New Year. They say the owners return with various items of voodoo and witch craft to woo in more customers. I mean, how else do you explain how this place stays busy? it can't be b/c of the food, it's terrible! I ordered the Bun Bo Hue. Being a bachleor it's not economical or easy for me to make my own. Also, being how this place has "noodle" in the name, Spicy Beef Noodle soup, should be right up their alley.  The broth was made with water, you can tell b/c the ingredients to the broth and the water would separate after you left it alone for a few minutes. The noodles were three days old. I come from a poor upbringing, i know what three day old noodles taste like. I haven't had them since my childhood, but thanks to tank, that childhood flavor was back in full force.  They gave me condiments for pho for my bowl of bun bo hue, wtf. no authentic Vietnamese restaurant would do that. They had fish sauce already on the table and didn't bring a bowl with thai chili's in it with my order. Take it from a Vietnamese person, Tank noodle is not authentic Vietnamese.  if you look at the review count on yelp, they have over 600+ while the other restaurants in the neighborhood have, in and about, 50. this place is frequented by ppl who "saw it on tv" or "read it in a column." They were "told" the food is good. Don't take asian food recommendations from a white person, you'll be in for one rude ass surprise.
