Far too pricey considering the alternatives in the neighborhood. Beer selection, however, is excellent. The food is certainly superb, but once again, really pricey for what you get. The cashew butter and jam sandwich with a DFH Raison d'etre is the perfect combo, IMHO. It is quite crowded, but it's to be expected.
