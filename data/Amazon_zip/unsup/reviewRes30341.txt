We've been here multiple times, and each time has been great! The staff is always friendly and accommodating. The last time we went was my bf's bday. I pulled the waiter aside to order something off menu (the sisig) and he also recommended a dessert. He made it really special, playing it up with he presented the off-menu dish to my bf's surpise. They all signed a card for him and gave us 2 gift certificates for the next time we came in! Favorites to try: 1. Beef lollipops 2. Sisig (minus the tripe!) 3. lobster and waygu sushi 4. shaking beef 5. some molten chocolate dessert mmmm! 6. chinese new year drink special, LOVE! i wish it was chinese new year all the time for this drink!! i've basically had almost everything on the menu at this point and you really can NOT go wrong! atmosphere can get really loud. the first time we went we were basically shouting over the table at each other. Second time, we were placed in a private back dining area for a big party, and for my bf's bday we were in a corner further away from the noise so we were able to converse normally. It's a lively place, loud place, but it's great like that. Great place to bring family and friends for any occasion!
