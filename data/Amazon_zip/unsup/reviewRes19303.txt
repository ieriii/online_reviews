Square root of 9 stars!!! The cochinita pibil sandwich was interesting with the addition of the pickled onions, but it was far too small for a gentleman of my stature and it lacked much meat. It also wasn't very spicy, even though I ordered it as such while mentally preparing my bowels to go to war. Mom got the "Jamon" sandwich, which is mostly prosciutto, cheese, and avocado spread. Obviously, this tasted good. And obviously, I ate most of it. It was a much more generous portion than my cochinita pibil. We also shared guac and chips. The chips weren't fresh, which was disappointing. The guac was good, but had a strange undertone of lavender or vanilla or something. Or maybe someone sprayed perfume in it. I don't know. To drink, I had a Mexican hot chocolate, which was tasty, but not really unique if you've had it before. Total cost for all this: About $32. That's not terribly expensive for two people for lunch... But considering my mom only ate about 3 bites of food and I consumed the rest, it came out to more like $27/person, which is steep, even for people that eat 9200 calories a day like Michael Phelps and myself. No fat comments needed, thank you. Overall, despite a slightly higher rate of hipster infestation, I'd say Cemitas Puebla retains the crown for best Mexican sandwiches in Chicago.
