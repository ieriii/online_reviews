As someone who grew up eating amazing Chinese food (thanks grandma and mom), I am absolutely certain that Lao Sze Chuan is as good as it gets in Chicago. If you crave authentic Chinese food, then do as I say. Go there on a week night, and order the string beans with spicy black sauce, ma-po tofu, and sole fish with chili sauce. Or if you're feeling really brave, bring some friends and get the hot & spicy hot pot. It's more work, but I don't mind getting a little dirty for good food. Should you decide to venture into the menu on your own, here is one last piece of advice: Don't be that guy/girl who orders the Americanized dishes (sweet & sour shrimp, kung pao chicken) because I'll be the girl sitting near you, laughing.
