Dear San Soo Gab San: Do you remember when we first fall in love back in 2005? I almost see you daily, sometimes we see each other more often than my family members? Well, that day is over, I sadly announce that. What happens to you San Soo Gab San? Your portion were big and your check always left a big smile on my face? I really do not care about the stinky smell you left on me after every visit but you gonna have to keep up with your portion and service. Throwing me serving plate on an already full table without considering how we are placing it really make me lost some love to you. The price has although stay almost the same but the food portion has shrank substantially. There are many Korean BBQ place in chicago, I hate to ban you from my list. Please help us up here, keep up with your portion and service.
