I've been here twice in the last 30 days and loved it both times. For each visit my boyfriend and I had the same server, Aerial (I hope I spelled his name right). The decor is very much unlike any typical BBQ joint. In fact I hesitate to even tag them with the word joint. It looks like a large country home. Nice neutral colors, clean and crowded. There's an upstairs with a private party room and a couch/flat screen tv lounge area as well as a large downstairs with a private party room, bar area and general restaurant seating area.  On our first visit we went up the grand staircase to the upstairs lounge area which was great as we got to watch March Madness and snuggle up on the couch. I got the combo platter- pulled pork and chicken with a GIANT CHUNK of corn bread. The fried pickles are fabulous and the pickled onions out of this world. My boyfriend despises onions but he loved these. The second time we came here we brought my boyfriends sister and her hubby. We ate our way through that restaurant, I tell you. The GM came by to say hi. And our server managed to get us a tour of the kitchen, complete with a tour of the big beautiful smoker. We even briefly met the lead chef and pitmaster star, Lee Ann Whippen. When we returned to our table after the tour they brought us a platter of cookies (with bacon baked into them!!!) and cookies! I loved this restaurant and I loved the experience! I will absolutely return and I would absolutely recommend Chicago Q.
