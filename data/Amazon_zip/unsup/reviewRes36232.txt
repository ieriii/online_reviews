I really liked this place before. It was my weekly staple but the last six months something has been wonky. I think it coincided with me seeing that the young man who walks around Loyola's Campus with no shoes on works there. And he give this place a bad vibe. Anytime I have an interaction with him I knock a star off this place. If you've seen the sole's of his feet you'd feel the same about him being any where near your food.  First experience with him I ordered before I left work but the red line was having issues so when I got there I had been on a train for an extended amount of time after a long day.  He told me "I looked bad" WHO SAYS THIS TO A PAYING CUSTOMER. And when I told him that was not appropriate he went in for an arm pat. ::side eye:: Boy I do not know you, and from what I do know, says do not touch me. I snatched my food and left.  I stopped ordering for a while but went back because the food is usually good. I ordered on a Wednesday night and waited TWO HOURS for my food. When I called an hour in I could tell they had misplaced my order because a manager got on the phone to apologize but didn't admit their error. I'm assuming my food got lost because when it arrived it was cold. My sushi though... ::le sigh:: the salmon smelled funny and still had skin on it. At this point I am moving at the end of the week, outside of their delivery range. I think this is a good thing because I think the service is going down and I want to remember this place in its glory and not as the place with the boy with nasty feet and no home training's place of employment.
