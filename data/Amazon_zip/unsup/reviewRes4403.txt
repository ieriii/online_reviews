My friend and I came just in time to check out Patricia Barber Quartet.  $7 for a melodic jazz show that goes from 9 to 12, not so bad if I say so myself. The intermission was like half an hour, but who's counting! We came late so ended up seating at the tail end of the bar which provided a miniscule view of the stage. No worries, it's Jazz, not some burlesque show. Definitely check out this joint if you can, especially with this line up. Patricia's voice is like velvet on smooth cocoa butter crack. Aretha got nothing on you girlllll!
