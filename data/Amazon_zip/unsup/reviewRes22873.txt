I've been driving past Superdawg on the way to my Uncle's house for as long as I can remember. I've seen it on tv, and I saw the reviews on yelp. Tonight, I finally decided to try it. Meh. The fries were the best part of the meal here. The hot dog was so-so. It may have been bigger than a Gene & Judes dog, but it wasn't the same. My biggest complaint here would have to be the price. When I can get two hot dogs and fries at G&J for the price of one Superdawg, there's something wrong. This place is good for the novelty, but go somewhere else for better food.
