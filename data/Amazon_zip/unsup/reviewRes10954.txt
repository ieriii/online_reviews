Went there the other night for the first time, and I really liked it. It was a Saturday, so there was about a 45 minute wait (note: they only take reservations for parties of 10+), but the wait was worth it. And it wasn't that bad because they have a bar you can get drinks at, and apparently they have some good beers. I tried the plain pizza, because I'd never actually ordered a pizza without cheese. It was very tasty and slightly guilt-free. They have a wide range of toppings to choose from as well. I plan on going back soon and trying the white pizza. And then possibly the red.
