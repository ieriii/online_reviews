this place is "kinda" a hidden gem. although its located on Milwaukee ave its not near the hub of Bucktown/Wickerpark, so many people never know! Food is great! simple and authentic. They are pretty good about delivery times and service is A-OK as well. For the $ this is defiantly a bang for your buck! I would highly recommend for a quick bite!
