The first and only time I went here we had to wait to go to the rooftop, so we were given a buzzer. That was totally fine. What was unacceptable was the 20 min. we had to wait to try to order a drink from an incompetent bartender who was manning a not that busy bar. We just walked out because we were not going to bend over backwards to try to give our money to people who clearly have no respect for their job.
