I saw this place on Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels. I ordered the same thing she had; the green tamales and eggs as well as the asparagus and pancetta benedict which had a spicy hollandaise that tasted like sin. My fellow diner and I shared both. The Benedict was incredible and the Tomales were delicious as well. The ambience is great here. An eclectic Spanish ambience with Latin and jazz music playing. GREAT FOOD - mediocre service. I would definitely like to try other menu items such as the honey jalapeo pork chops!
