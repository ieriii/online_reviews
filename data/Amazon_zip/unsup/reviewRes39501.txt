A pub that serves really really sophisticated food at pub prices? BRILLIANT. Longman & Eagle rocks the Gastro Pub concept the way Jay-Z rocks beats. the kitchen turns out food with flare and attitude. It's "punk-metal" cuisine deeply rooted in Franco-British-Italian American dishes. This watering hole has a few tables jammed packed with food connoisseurs. I would suggest going early to avoid long waits. I ordered Roasted Bone Marrow with red onion jam and sourdough crostini - Pretty standard but never disappoints Seared Maine Scallops, Braised Oxtail, Black Truffle Gnocchi, Celery Root, Butternut Squash, Fontina Fonduta- Two JUMBO plump fresh scallops perched on top of rich oxtail and soft gnocchi. I couldn't really taste the black truffles but the dish was still very good. Maple Braised Pork Shank, Collard Greens, Anson Mills Grits, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Braising Jus - Fork tender meat that fell off the bone. The flavor had a pleasant sweet note to complement the pork flavor. I loved the tie in with grits and collard greens. The servers are very young, but friendly and possess high Food IQ. 2010 really added some terrific names to the Chicago dining scene: Gilt Bar, The Girl & the Goat, and now Longman & Eagle. I strongly recommend you pay this pub a visit.
