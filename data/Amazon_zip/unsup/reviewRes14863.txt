This place is hurting for customers because the economy stinkeths. I have been wanting to go to Sabatinos for ages. I finally made it there with a friend for a birthday dinner. The house wine was good. The server was obviously very serious about his job, which was fine - he was a bit cold though. The food was standard fare and I'd say just above average when you think old world Italian. The decor was right out of an episode of the Sopranos. Not trying too hard. Just enough to make you look around for a made man or two.  Lots of couples. Musical serenades -- violinist and guitarists taking requests. Could be quite romantical if that's what you are after. And, they made a HUGE and embarrassing deal over my pal's birthday. Which was exactamundo what I was hoping for that night. Dinner for two, with a bottle of wine, and birthday dessert on the house, including tip was just 70 smakeroos. A bargain!
