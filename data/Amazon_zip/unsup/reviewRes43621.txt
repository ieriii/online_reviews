This is one of those places you can go to and stare at the menu for 10 mins and then just pick whatever you're staring at when it's your turn to order. But, never fear, because unless your tastebuds are dead, you won't be disappointed. The sandwiches are the perfect size and you always get a side of homemade chips.. which are an explosion of chip goodness... in your mouth.. not on your plate. If great food doesn't do it for you how about trendy music and hipster waitresses? NO?... just the food huh. They also have the best cappuccino I have EVER HAD! Get it. In closing, try it.
