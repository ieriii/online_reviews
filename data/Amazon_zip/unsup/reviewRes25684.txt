I've eaten here three times in a span of 3 months and would probably eat here every week if it was closer. Bu Loc Lac (grilled beef on rice) amazing. The chicken salad is great as well. vegetarian delight also good. flavoring and spices are all too wonderful. Prices are modest and portions are generous. I'll come back many many times
