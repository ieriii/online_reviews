Let me start out by saying I am a bit of a food snob but I was in the mood for Cuban. I went here on the suggestion of my fellow yelpers. Keep in mind i didn't look at the pictures or really read to much of what was said about this place other than it was good Cuban and cheap. When i finally arrived there, i was a little put off at how this place looked like a revamped tastee freeze of my younger years. Then i realized there were no tables or space for it. Instead there is a circular bar-like counter with stools. No waiters, no bus boys, no host. I then began to realize that i needed to be in the mood for a place like this and although i was sure the food might be great, this wasn't what i was looking for. The people i was with insisted that i snap out of it, and sat my ass down. THe owner was EXTREMELY friendly and kind, and may have noticed my hesitation and said he would order for me and brought me over a complimentary cuban coffee sample while i waited on my stool. VERY kind, but i was still processing that the expresso in front of me was not a mojito. Finally the food came and i was just stunned and amazed at how good the food was. Very soon after my first bite, i began to forget that i wasnt in a sit down restaurant yet i still felt the hospitality i sometimes rarely recieve at some of the best steak houses. Its not what i expected, but guess what...I AM A BELIEVER!!!!!
