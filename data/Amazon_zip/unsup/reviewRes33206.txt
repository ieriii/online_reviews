I have no idea how the food here is so delicious and cheap. Excellent falafel, ample portions, and ready and seconds. Also, probably the best lunch in Wicker park for $5. They have a decent amount of seating for how small it is, and there's a pretty good turnover-- I've never not been able to find a table. They also have a small outside seating area, although it isn't covered, and is kind of just on the sidewalk. Just make sure to bring cash, as they don't take credit cards.
