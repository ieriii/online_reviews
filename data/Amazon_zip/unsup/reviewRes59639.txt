OMG! Talk about the best authentic taco's in Chicago! I am a big fan of Check Please which comes on Channel 11. I have found out about a lot of GREAT reastaurants watching that channel and LaPasadita is on of them! It's a drive but WORTH THE TRIP!!! I love SPANISH food period...MiTierra is a really nice place as well they an extenive menu and great live music!!!
