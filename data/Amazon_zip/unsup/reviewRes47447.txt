the food is solid. location is solid. bar is solid. what really gets me is how inexpensive it is. i'm not even really gonna talk about how similar the menu is to a certain different burger place just because i didn't have to wait. there's tons of parking & it's really close to the best bars in the neighborhood. we ordered 3 burgers & 4 draft beers between 3 people & it was only $30. i personally found it easy to ignore the UFC theme & have a really good time.
