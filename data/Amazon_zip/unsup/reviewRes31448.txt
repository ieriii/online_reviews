Peanut Butter Doughnuts!!!!! So delicious!! We mainly came here because it was in our neighborhood and so close to us and we just needed something convenient but also yummy of course. I gotta say I'm more a fan of their sides than the actual dish. I got the huevos rancheros and it was good, but I'm not sure I would get it again. My cousin had the pancake and I can say I don't think I've had a better PLAIN pancake than that. I eat at yolk alot and I like their pancakes too but that is no where close to Nana's. Also their mac and cheese had just the right amount of cheese. I'm not a usual fan of mac and cheese as I'm slightly lactose but there was just the right amount of cheese in this dish, not over whelming at all. So delicious. Overall I gotta say the side/appetizers were much better than my main course. Next time I go I'll be getting sides for my main course. Note we arrived around 9:15 on Saturday and after sitting down for 10 minutes ish, there was a line. By the time we left 10:25a.m there were at least 20 people waiting for tables scattered around the area. So go early get those doughnuts and don't miss out on that pancake!
