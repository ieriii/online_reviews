My boo is convinced she hates Italian food. I am convinced that she's only had Italian food at Olive Garden and Buca di Beppo. Sure, I can see hating the flavorless mush served at tourist traps and suburban chains, but hating all Italian food? Fuggedaboutit. So in efforts to win my boo over to Italian food, we decided to hit up Piccolo Sogno. Upon being sat I instantly regretted sitting inside instead of outside. The outdoor eating area at Piccolo Sogno looked beautiful. Inside things were still hopping as evidenced by the woman at the table next to us who was so drunk she not only managed to break the steam on her wine glass, she also almost knocked over a table on the way to the restroom. In the restaurants defense, she looked like one of those Gold Coast cougars who had probably been drinking steadily since 4:30. I really enjoyed my Caprese salad. It tasted very fresh. I also had the black spaghetti which came with clams, mussels, and shrimp. I don't think I can go back to regular spaghetti. My boo ordered another pasta dish that was also quite tasty. Service was pretty good and the wine list was extensive enough for two non-wine drinkers to find a good bottle that was also reasonably priced. My only real critique of Piccolo Sogno was that the menu seems somewhat limited. I felt like there were maybe only one or two dishes that I would want to try. What I did try was excellent, and it's always better to have a small menu that you do really well. I guess I just wished there were a few more choices. Did I convince my boo that she likes Italian food? Well, it looks like the jury is still out. I'm still searching for that knockout Italian place that will blow my boo away. But if you're looking for some tasty, fresh Italian food with a casual, neighborhoody feel, you won't be disappointed at Piccolo Sogno. A solid four stars.
