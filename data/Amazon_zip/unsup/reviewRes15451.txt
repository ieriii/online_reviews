One of Chicago's 'hidden' gems. Without sounding cliche, I can't help but say Violet Hour is one of the coolest bars in the Chicago. Designed almost as a modern day speakeasy, the windowless, signless facade is almost easy to miss when walking by. Most people don't even know there's a bar there. Once you walk in throw dark drapes you find yourself in a beautifully kept thoroughly private space to enjoy a few cocktails. Once you get over the theater of the space, kick back, relax, and enjoy some of the best drinks in town. The Old Fashioned is probably my favorite, but just about everything is pretty solid. They make the drinks stiff (as they should be) and they're worth every penny. Perfect spot for a quiet conversation or catching up with friends. If you haven't been, you must go!!!!
