I heart this location being right on Broadway and in Lakeview too boot !! just mere blocks from Intelligentsia Coffee, usually I have to get on the redline to get my fix or go down to Jackson, and being almost right next to Treasure Island, have a jewel just 2 blocks up and Walgreen's 3 blocks down at Belmont why do I list all these other places you wonder ? well here it is the place has a fridge, and a microwave, also there is a single serve coffee pot so save some cash and get some water, soda and snacks and use the fridge ok the down side for me as I quit smoking just about 6 months ago we got a smoking room, we didn't ask for it but Greg has stayed here before so maybe it was in the computer that he smokes ):, but I will deal with it now the bathroom is nice and big as is the room also, but the TV is against a wall were you can't watch it from in Bed ): and there is no couch just 2 chairs and I would rather lay in bed and watch it, and the cabinet they have it in doesn't swivel also the hallway on the second floor smells like they had a fire in the past it is really faint but still there I would stay here again just because its on Broadway and easy to get around from this location
