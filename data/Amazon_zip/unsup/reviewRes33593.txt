Okay, so some of my reviews are duplicates of my Zagat reviews, but I'm only here to help out my fellow sisters and brothers in the world...and many of you don't have a Zagat account. So here it is: "With Orange and Bongo Room within walking distance, I really didn't have a reason to try Yolk for breakfast. However, I was presently surprised by the extensive breakfast menu, helpful wait staff, and refreshing ambiance. My wife had the Taste of Venice omellette and I had the corned beef hash. The omellete was delicious, and the corned beef hash was more than edible. The point is that if you want a more traditional breakfast, try Yolk. It is a less expensive, friendlier, and has a more traditional breakfast than Orange and Bongo Room." What I didn't say in Zagat is that I love corned beef hash...but I was afraid to say it because they may kick me out of the website!  AND...I like the cheap corned beef hash, the stuff that looks like dog meat! It was tasty at Yolk!
