As others have said, this is not a diner-goer's diner. And as far as I'm concerned, that's fine. They do their food right, at a relatively reasonable price for its quality, and the staff is extremely friendly, too. The best part of Glenn's is that when the food here is really spot-on, it makes your knees shake and your body quiver. For me, all it takes is their Reuben Sandwich. Oh, all things holy, how I love this sandwich. It's like a taste explosion in your mouth where flavors ride like happy little surfers on waves, one after the other into your body. It's an experience. Also--don't neglect those potato pancakes. Before Glenn's, I'd never had them. Now I'm addicted. I'm knocking off one star for the time I had chocolate chip pancakes and found them pretty dry. 'Course, I'm a choc. chip pancake snob (you should try my family's recipe), so I'm riddled with high expectations.
