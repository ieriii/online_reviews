best experience in Chicago out of 5 places in a 24 hour period, mostly for the ambiance. the dog is really quite average, but it a fun joint and the toppings are different, so it would be cool to try it out. DONT expect a culinary accomplishment, though, it is just a good dog with new toppings. So much for the tv shows.
