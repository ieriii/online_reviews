This is the best meal I've ever had in my life. No kidding. And not by just a little. This is a special occasion place...it's pretty much as pricey as it gets. My wife and I had the 14 course option, and around five of them exceeded anything we've ever eaten before. They offer the 14 course "tasting" and a 24 course "tour." The tasting is three hours and the tour is around five. The food was amazing and beautiful, but that's to be expected at these prices. What blew us away was how many flavors and textures chef Grant Achatz was able to put in the more elaborate dishes (several were one-bite tastings...and complex in their own right). It was a nice balance of molecular gastronomy showoffiness and pure, solid, delicious food. This place deserves every bit of praise it's gotten (for example, #1 restaurant in the U.S. by Gourmet Magazine). Everything about it was perfect, and it's better than Thomas Keller's Per Se in NYC in my opinion.
