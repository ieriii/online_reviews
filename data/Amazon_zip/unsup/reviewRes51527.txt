I've been a fan of this place for YEARS.  Their burritos are HUGE, full of really good ingredients. I've tried nearly everything on the menu and I've never been let down. The enchiladas are deliscious and you can get them with mole or red sauce. I really like the tacos, and the queso fundido. The mixed drinks are really great too. Big fan of the tequilla sunrise. Garcia's is open late and is super inexpensive. Two thumbs up!
