To start- their avgolemmeno surpasses any other in Greektown and possibly the Chicagoland area. You actually get chunks of chicken in there, and what do you know- it's lemmony! Their pizzas are good and fresh. Anything baked fresh gets a 5 star from me. Their salads are delicious. I usually get a soup and salad combo with a coke ( the little glass bottle) love them. Or a frappe. They also give you some fresh baked bread with your meal. Bread is a necessity for my meals. Their desserts tease you and the array of items to purchase are great. From seasalt and honey to decorations. They also sell free-trade, organic tea if you are looking for some. The atmosphere in general is really nice and cafe-style. They have window seats a step down or several steps up for a partial upstairs area. I LOVE ARTOPOLIS!
