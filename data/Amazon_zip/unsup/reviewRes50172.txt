This review strictly applies to Sunday football. I can't imagine how crowded this place gets on a Friday or Saturday night but for Sunday football it is OK in my book. It did take them awhile to get the tv's adjusted to multiple games but once they got that figured out everything else was great. We ordered the cheese curds which were good, but not sure why they were served with ketchup. I find that a weird dipping sauce, but the other sauce (ranch) worked out just fine. I had the fifty burger which I must say was excellent and then add on the sweet potato fries with bbq dipping sauce and you got more than a meal you got a reason to come back. The burger was cooked perfectly and the pretzel roll just added to the enjoyment of the burger. I may never go on a Friday or Saturday night but I will sure to be back for brunch or lunch. Sorry should have mentioned the service which was good but they must have a shortage of glassware since the minute you finished a glass it disappeared before you even knew it was gone.
