In summary: Highway Robbery. 4-stars for food / 0-stars for value. My wife and I were excited to try out the 10-course Collection tasting menu, but by the end of the meal, we were just wishing GE would bring back their old menu format. I was here 6-7 months ago, spent half as much and left twice as satisfied. As others have said before, the portions are ridiculously small. Many courses were only 1-2 bites, including the "amuse bouche" that ended up being the first course of the meal, as opposed to an unexpected bonus. The courses were very good, but certainly not worth a $400+ tab (pre-tax and gratuity). If you're looking to drop that kind of money in Chicago, you'll be much happier at Moto, or even more traditional places like Spiaggia or Everest. Having said that, Rob, the sommelier was great. The service was generally good, but some of the servers need to speak-up for god sake. It's hard to hear the ingredients when you're whispering!
