I have to stay, Caro Mio is back in my good graces. The staff is no longer rushing dinner as I had previously complained about in my first review. The food here is outstanding. I have never had a bad (or even average) meal at Caro Mio. The BYOB is a big help. The pasta prices are a little high, but with the BYOB the prices are fine. This is a great date place.
