We just got back from our dinner at Nana's. It's Fantastic!!! we love it. Food was amazing, we had the special appetizers which was fried cheese curds with banana peppers and french fries fried in duck fat ( HEAVEN on EARTH ). For dinner, I had the almighty Po'Boy sandwich it was just divine. My husband had the fried quails, I had a taste of it and it was amazing!!!. Bartender was great and so was our server. Totally recommend it to anyone who just adores good home cooking food! Can't wait to go back again.
