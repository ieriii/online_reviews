Dont get me wrong... I'm not a complete hater. But I think the rating description fits RJ Grunts well (Meh. I've experienced better). If you have a Lettuce Entertain You gift card and you would like some comfort food instead of heading to one of their many swanky restaurants.... this is good option. We went for an early lunch as a group of 8. We experienced no wait (we had a reservation) but by the time we left there was a long line. The salad bar was good (as expected from the creator's of it!). Everyone at our table enjoyed their food but I think it's safe to say that none of us are dying to get back there.
