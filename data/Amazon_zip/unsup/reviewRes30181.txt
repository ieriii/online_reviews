This was my second visit to Frontera and I have to say, I have officially crossed it off my list. The food is average and the wait is absurd. The margaritas are the best thing this place has going that said I've had better. I am not sure what the mystique about this place is about. I find the food to be average and the chips served with the salsa and guac taste bagged. Not what you would expect for such an acclaimed restaurant.
