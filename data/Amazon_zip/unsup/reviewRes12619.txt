OH so worth the money, if you have it. This was probably one of the tastiest Brazilian restaurants that I've ever been to. The service is also by far one of the best! Normally when my boyfriend and I go to fancier restaurants, we don't get the greatest customer service, because well... we look young (I probably look like I'm 16-17, even though I'm 21) and fancier restaurants don't take us seriously, but this place...boy oh boy, I have rarely experienced quality service higher than this restaurant. I literally could not get enough of this place and was sad when my meal finally ended because I wanted to just eat more and more. I was a bit concerned about the food being too salty when our waiter originally was telling us about the preparation of the meats, but they do special orders with less salt. Even with all the salt, it was still BOMB dot com. I had this drink that reminded me of tequila, but it was some kind of Brazilian liqueur. Oh my goodness, I died and went to heaven. Seriously, come here if you have a chance and you will not be disappointed.
