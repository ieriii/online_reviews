another concert at congress theater, which means another excuse to visit revolution! me & my date were happy to find upon our arrival that not only the food, but several of the beers, are seasonal. having sampled a good portion of the menu on our last visit, we knew exactly where to head. we ordered the bacon fat popcorn (duh,) the calamari & the pretzel to start (fat kids in the houuuuuuse.) the calamari was very flavorful (lightly fried with parmesan, asparagus, spinach & some type of hot sauce on the bottom) & disappeared quickly. my date's only complaint was that the calamari pieces weren't very "meaty." i remembered not thinking the pretzel was that great last time, and i was technically right -- the pretzel is nothing to brag about, but the cheese. THE CHEESE. the pretzel is simply the vehicle for the delicious beer cheese concoction. we both actually thought about drinking it, but knew it would probably be frowned upon in public. my advice to you: skip the pretzel and order a side of cheese to dip anything you can get your hands on. for our "entree" we split a (large) smokehouse burger -- a burger with pulled pork & pepper jack cheese on top -- which arrived perfectly split for us on two plates. unexpected and a nice touch. the burger was pretty good -- and i probably would have eaten more of it, had it not been for the healthy portion of crack-laced fries served on the side. yes, crack. laced. fries. that's the only viable explanation as to why i could not stop eating them (many dunked in cheese sauce.) fresh cut, crispy & perfectly seasoned. beer-wise, i had an el heffe loco, which was good - but tasted like any standard heffewizen (sorry!) & a bottom up wit (still as delicious as the last time,) while my date had the german oktoberfest ("good",) a hoppe princess ("fruity.") our waitress was very attentive & super nice. 2/2 revolution, well done.
