Ws are a little bit hilarious and a lot awesome. Some of the hilarity is purposeful (the extra roll of toilet paper in the room came in a tidy little bag labeled "backup plan"), but other things are hilariously unintentional, like the SNL-worthy ribbed black turtlenecks all the lounge staff was wearing. Sometimes I wonder if the W takes itself a little too seriously while trying to be the "anti-hotel". While my suite was more than roomy enough and felt clean, spacious, and modern, I did notice that I could hear hall noises so clearly they felt like they were happening in my own room. I didn't hear any neighbor noises (maybe I didn't have neighbors?) but whenever someone was walking down the hall it sounded like my door was just standing open. Fitted black turtlenecks or not, the service was flawless. The W staff came through for me in two major ways. (1) I bought too many pairs of shoes and couldn't fit them into my suitcase, so they sent up a FedEx box and form, and took it away from me once I packed. That was huge! Saved me either extra baggage fees or having to tromp through Chicago crowds to find a post office. (2) My flight got cancelled and I was able to scoot back my checkout time until 1 pm, no questions asked, no additional charges. Speaking of charges, this place is a tad expensive (WiFi was outrageous... don't they know the young, hip crowd likes their internets?), but it was definitely on par with other hotels in the area. When you get to a major downtown location, I notice there isn't much variance in the room prices anyway. I figure you have every other opportunity to stay at a "normal" hotel, so stay at a W when you can. It's fun, and the usual gripes can be found at any hotel. At least make it your "Backup Plan."
