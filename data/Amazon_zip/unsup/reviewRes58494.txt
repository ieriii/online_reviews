The food here is amazing, there is no questioning that. The reason I am giving it 1 star is the terrible service. I went here around Thanksgiving and the owner always greets with a smile and is happy to have you. The waiters are underwhelmed and seem like they could care less if you dine their or not. As soon as we finished eating they plopped our check on the table making us feel pressured to leave. It was very busy so we assumed it was a one time thing and decided to go back for Valentines dinner. Our reservation was for 2 at 7:30 and we were sat at a table attached to another party as if we were all dining together. Very awkward. After 2 appetizers, and dinner we had been there for just under an hour when our bill was plopped on the table and they began clearing and busing the tables to the right and left of us. We were trying to finish our glasses of wine when a party of ten people came in and the restaurant owner sat the table to the right and left of us (four to the right and four to the left) and the last two people in their party stood by our table waiting for us to finish. I have never been felt so pressured to leave and thought this was so rude and unacceptable. They didn't even have the decency to ask us to leave and just passively aggressively sandwiched us between a party that was waiting for our seats! We quickly got up and the manager acted like nothing was wrong and said Happy Valentines Day! I complained and told him how uncomfortable they made us feel and how this was the second time we felt pressured to leave directly after eating. I think the food here is very good but will not eat here again out of principle. There are too many wonderful places to eat in Chicago where the dining experience is just as good as the food.
