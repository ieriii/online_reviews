My first sushi I had when I moved to Chicago, definitely sets the bar high. I felt fortunate that my friends got a table, this place was so packed. Probably one of the nicer sushi/Asian restaurant that I've been to. I wouldn't be surprised to spot a celebrity. Fantastic and attentive wait staff, the people at the door made you feel like you've been there many times before. Everyone in the place had a smile on their face, a lot of birthdays/anniversaries/early xmas parties were being celebrated. Sushi was delicious and great presentation. I hardly ever order dessert but we had the Mochi balls... so good!
