Sun Wah!!! So good! I came here last night with a party of like 1,000,000 and they were super accommodating. We ordered 2 ducks to split between 12 or so people, plus a few other treats to share. The best part of the meal were the duck sandwiches - they carve the duck at the table and you build your own sandwich on soft little bao buns. I wasn't very impressed with the duck fried rice or duck soup, but the sandwiches totally make up for it. I don't think it's a great place for vegetarians - I didn't see much on the menu. Plus they're like, parading pig carcasses through the place the whole time. Not to mention the duck carving. I'd def recommend for a group - they were really accommodating and splitting the bill wasn't annoying. Plus, it was cheap - under $10 per person. I'm excited to go back!
