Believe the hype! I visited Frontera with a group of friends for an early dinner on a Friday night. Our party of 6 was seated within 10 minutes of everyone arriving (disclaimer, we arrived at 5PM on the nose to put our names on the list). I started off with a mezcal margarita. It was shaken at the table, and poured in to a salted margarita glass. The color was a pinkish orange, the flavor was smoky and delicious. Drink two of these, and you're ready for the worm! ha! We started out with some guacamole, it was fresh and flavorful. I particularly enjoyed the paper thin radishes that garnished the dip. It added a wonderful crunch! My entree was the Chilpachole de Mariscos. It consisted of mussels, shrimp, scallops and corn dumplings in a spicy chili sauce. The seafood was fresh and delicious. The mussels were gigantic! The largest, freshest and tastiest I have ever eaten. The sauce was simple and added a little bit of spice. A perfect compliment to the delicious seafood. For dessert I had the Tartaleta de Pinon con Caramelo. Absolutely decadent! The home made whip cream was thick, sweet and wonderful. And the salted caramel corn gave the dessert a toothy crunch and a bit of salty contrast. it was wonderful. I will be back, and would gleefully wait 2 hours to eat here again.
