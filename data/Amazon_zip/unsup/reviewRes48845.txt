The best i've had in a looooong time. I went here with a friend on a Thursday evening and had a very early reservation for dinner (5:30 reservations is a great way to get one of the tables for two rather than one of the massive tables that remind me of something out of a Arthurian legend). We decided to sample as much as our bellies and wallets could handle. We each started with an oyster (my first!) from New Zealand. It was really a spectacular first experience with the slimy little guys--fresh and smooth. Then we tried the potted rilletes which were not my favorite dish of the night, but still very good (they seemed under seasoned). It was a steady parade of food to the table all evening since they don't bring it all at once, but I loved that fact. It allowed us to concentrate on the flavors of the individual dishes. We had the smoked whitefish, the sweetbreads (so smooth and buttery it was sinful), the daily pickles (I highly recommend this as they allow you to cleanse your palate between courses and are delicious to boot.), and more. We sampled both a dessert (waffle with blackberries and honey butter) as well as a cheese. This place has a great menu and an outstanding beer list. I'll be back for another round of deliciousness.
