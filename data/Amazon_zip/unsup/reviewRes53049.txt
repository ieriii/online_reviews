This place is fantastic. A nice outdoor patio that is VERY warm (maybe to the point where after a few pitchers of sangria- made with your brought bottle of wine- you may want to remove your sweater). The food is simple and fantastic. I went with my boyfriend and we ate for $20. Every dish was perfectly done and had great flavor. I would recommend this place to anyone (they can make many of their dishes gluten free and there are a wide range of vegetarian options). BYOB w/the option to use your booze for mixed drinks. GREAT STUFF!
