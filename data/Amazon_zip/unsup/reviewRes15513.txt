So, I got take out with my boyfriend from Revolution Brewing. And, despite their 2 hour in-restaurant wait, our food was ready 15 minutes for pick-up (which was less than the 20 minutes wait they quoted to us, which of course is ideal.) The food was good. I'll admit, I wasn't a huge fan of the Workingman Burger. And I don't know if that's because I was already full of the bacon fat popcorn (which, by the way, seems less like bacon fat popcorn and more like plain, boring popcorn surrounded in shredded cheese and bacon pieces. yummy but slightly disappointing.) I actually liked the Workingman beer, and was surprised to read so many reviews that said it was tasteless. The guy I placed my order with said it is meant to be a subtle beer that is best suited for drinking while eating. He was right. It's a 3.5% abv, light, has a great subtle taste, and did complement the food wonderfully. And, with take out, they have growlers of beer available for purchase. Which is kind of awesome. And you can get it refilled for cheaper if you keep the growler. I will be going back for more Workingman beer. Annnd my boyfriend ate everything on his plate. And ate the rest of my burger the next day. Update: Went back again, sat down, received fast service. The bacon-fat popcorn was amazing this time, and my wheat-protein ruben was FANTASTIC. Go go go.
