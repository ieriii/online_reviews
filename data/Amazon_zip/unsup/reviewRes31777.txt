This is simply the all-around best vegan/vegetarian restaurant I have ever eaten at. About 95% of the items on the menu are vegan. The only items that aren't are the eggs, as far as I can tell. Loved the restaurant so much that I went there twice in a three day period.  Tried the Chicken Fried Steak, with mashed potatoes and gravy. It was absolutely delectable. The crispiness and flavor of the fried breading is out of this world, and it's simply impossible to tell that it's vegan. Another dish that I tried was the Radical Reuben, a fiercely viable competitor to the real thing. The flavor of the marble rye bread along with the grilled onions, corned beef style seitan, sauerkraut and vegan thousand island is out of this world! The sandwich is so good that it apparently won a Michelin award. I also tried the chickn bacon ranch burger which was good, and if I didn't have the Reuben, it would've been great. The thin layer of "chickn" was tasty as was the bacon, but it was really a supporting role...the reuben was the star. On to the appetizers. Had the buffalo wings, which were chewy and delicious. Moving on to desserts, had the pineapple cake and the cookies and cream cake, respectively. I have to say that after having such amazing food, the desserts, although tasty, were not on par with the rest of the meal. Both items, ordered on separate days, were somewhat dry and did not have the moistness I expected from a good vegan dessert. Finally, the coffee was excellent. On both of my visits, I had the hazelnut syrup infused coffee with vegan whipped cream. Really excellent! In summary, a wonderful five star experience, despite the somewhat disappointing desserts. My only regret is that I live over 3,000 miles away from Chicago, and there is really nothing like it around LA, apart from Veggie Grill. I cannot wait to return!
