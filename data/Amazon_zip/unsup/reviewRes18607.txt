Came in for a quick bite after getting recommendations from my buds Davey B. and Eric V. It was a good pick. I went with the Sir Loin, a burger topped with sliced sirloin and provolone on a pretzel bun. Really good. When have you ever seen that as a burger option? My wife wanted something light, so she somehow ended up with the hangover, which had ham, bacon , provolone, a fried egg and fries in a pretzel bun. It was huge. I think she almost popped a blood vessel in her eye trying to take a bite. I liked it a lot, but it was almost too much to handle. I did say almost, because I handled it just fine. The fries were just ok. Nothing great. Great burgers and I was able to catch some of the Hawks game too. They also have a pretty large beer menu that I hope to sample next time.
