Ironic that I'm not much of a brunch person, since there are 3 brunch joints within a block of me. But it's nice that on a Saturday morning, I can sleep in, roll out of bed, and amble on over to eat. I've been to Bongo Room a few times and luckily, I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes. I've had a mix of menu offerings. Chicken sandwich was disappointing. The chicken was a tad dry and flavorless. Lesson learned, don't get a sandwich at a brunch place. Duh. Then my friend and I ordered one sweet and one savory option from their Fall 2009 menu (which is still available, even though it's winter). The pumpkin and zucchini pancakes are what prompted me to give the 4 stars. So delicious! It's one of those experiences that you feel like is in slow motion-- you know, like in a food commercial. Where the girl takes a slow bite, savors it with eyes closed and lets out a "mmmm..." Yeah, it's like that. I've also tried that omelet that has a Mexican twist. It was good, but not great. Most recently, I had an omelet with beef tenderloin medallions and spinach. I could have used more flavor. The egg wasn't salted at all. Their hash browns are better than most. Overall, I'd stick with the sweeter offerings. Their savory dishes don't do it for me.
