When crews started working on this place, I spotted the faade and thought it looked like the biggest cheeseball bar known to man.  When I had a hankering for a tasty burger and didn't feel like scouring the internet to find a good place (close to home), the boyfriend and I decided to try it out.  To our delight, we discovered it was 1/2 price burger night (Tuesdays, folks), and immediately we were sat at a table by the door.  I LOVED the thanksgiving-y burger (forget the name, but it's a turkey burger, with melted brie, cranberry compote and stuffing). My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his burger, and both were served on pretzel rolls. (By the way, HOW DID WE EVER EAT BURGERS BEFORE PRETZEL ROLLS!?) We came back a second time, fully knowing about 1/2 price night. There was one party waiting before us but a nice man (who we later learned was the owner) offered us beers "on the house." NICE!  The only beef I have (pun totally intended) is the multitude of media on the walls. I'm an easily distracted being and as much as I enjoy television, I felt like a dick watching the AC/DC live DVD instead of gazing into my dude's pretty blue eyes. That's a joke, but really - too many TVs!
