I loved this place!  Let me start by saying that if you go on a weekday, it's a flat price of (i think?) 35 bucks! Can't go wrong! It was my first time at a Brazilian Steakhouse, so I didn't know exactly how it worked. We walked in and was greeting by a very nice young girl that showed us to our table. Our server greeted us right away and explained the process and took our order. We went to the buffet (WHICH IS FREAKING AWESOME) and piled up. The Mushroom risotto is out of this world! As is their shrimp salad. I didn't try anything I didn't like! On to the meat.. DELISH! They came often and the server always asked us if there was something specific we wanted to try and made sure to send them to our table. We got full pretty fast but was able to sample most things. We ordered dessert, which was also great. I would recommend this to everyone! mmmMmmMMMmmmmMmmm
