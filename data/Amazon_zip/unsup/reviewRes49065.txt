I'm still getting used to the "popular and trendy" communal tables that have been sprouting up all over Chicago. Publican's main dining area consists of a very long communal table and once it starts getting packed, it reminds you of dining with Harry Potter and his classmates. I was sitting arm to arm with complete strangers and although everyone was nice, it's definitely not a place to go to if you want to have private conversations. The concept is cute, it's similar to going to a barn or farmhouse to drink exotic beer. Publican carried a lot of Belgian and Austrian beer and the waitress was very helpful with providing suggestions according to your palate. My friend and I had mussels with fries and it was alright...nothing mind blowing. The mussels were a bit small for my taste and the broth was salty. Fries were great...it's really hard to screw up fries though. Haven't been back since.
