I've been wanting to try this place for a while since its right in my neighborhood and when my date suggested it, it was on like donkey kong. For starters we had Egg Rolls and the Tiger's Cry. The Egg Rolls were standard but the Tiger's Cry was delicious! My date had the cashew chicken which was yummy and I had the Chicken Pad Thai (my standard white people - ordering Thai food dish). It was decent, but nothing overly amazing. Besides the Tiger's Cry, the best part of the whole evening was the BYOB, which meant we stayed at the placed and chatted it up until they closed! And they didn't hurry us along at all.
