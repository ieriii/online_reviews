AMAZING Food!!! Can't say enough about the food here. Everything is delicious and perfect for sharing with group of friends. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star as oppose to 5 is the amount of time it takes to get a table - any day of the week.... you could be waiting up to 2 hours on the weekends!
