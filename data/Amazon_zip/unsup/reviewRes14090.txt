Another good addition to hipsterville. Great selection of home brewed beer in a very pleasant space. Better than average pub food including gourmet pizzas and burgers. Highly recommend the bacon popcorn. It's an indulgent treat. Otherwise, a pleasant way to spend and afternoon is to work your way through the beer selection. You will not be disappointed. Try the triple--one of the best belgian style ales I have had.
