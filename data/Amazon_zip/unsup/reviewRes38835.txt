Garlic, garlic and more garlic. I don't care if you don't want to kiss me...I'll stand by my garlic. The garlic bread at this place is a must. I don't care if it has as much fat and calories as a Big Mac, I'm eating it. The minestrone soup makes a nice dipping sauce to compliment the garlic bread. The garlic bread stands alone. Let's not forget about the free foccacia bread you get along with some bread and oil as soon as you sit down. Yum.  I don't know how many times I've brushed my teeth, but I can still taste garlic.
