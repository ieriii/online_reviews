I went to Brazzaz on a Friday night for their Restaurant Week price of $32. I had made reservations, so once we arrived we checked in our coats with the coat check and were seated immediately. Our table was placed by the kitchen entry way, which was awesome because most of the meat skewers were served to us first! lol. The salad bar had fresh salad, cheese, bread, even sushi (but the sushi was terrible). The meats were very delicious. I love chicken, but was disappointed as some of the chicken offered tasted dry or burned. The grilled pineapple was yummy. Their sides of cheese rolls and fried bananas were to die for! Also had a slice of delicious, creamy cheesecake for dessert! Excellent service. Casual atmosphere.
