It was apparent the fireplace and lighting, were working in tandem. They immediately stole my attention, forcing me to pull up a seat at the bustling bar. I didn't put up too much of a fight. It was only then did I make sense of their diabolical plan. Yes, they wanted me comfortable, cozy, and for a few hours, to feel like I disappeared from my everyday world. And that I did. From the second you walk into this place, you can't help but notice the warmth this place radiates. Add some friends and a whole lotta' cold beers, and you have the makings of one fantastic time. I notice a few comments on how slow the service was. It has varied for me on my few visits. Sometimes slow, sometimes average. It hasn't bothered me much, as I generally have not had plans beyond the bar. The food. How can you go to an Irish pub and not have the Shepard's Pie? I guess if you are not in the mood for it? The Shepard's pie has been wonderful. Meat was cooked properly, and not overly greasy. The potatoes on the pie were a bit few, but each place seems to have their own unique potato/pea/meat ratio. On the one occasion I was not up for the pie, I went with the meatloaf. It was good for an Irish place, but probably not the best thing on their menu. Prices are slightly higher than I would expect from a typical Irish pub, but I think the atmosphere of the venue fully justifies the 10 to 15% premium. All in all, one of my favorite Irish style pubs in the city...
