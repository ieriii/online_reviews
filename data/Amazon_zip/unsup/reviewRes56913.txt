I stopped in for the first time for a late Saturday lunch. The place was comfortably full, but my young daughter and I were seated promptly in a booth in the side section. The space was more kid-friendly that I expected - it's a sports bar atmosphere with music, but not unbearably loud, at least not during the late lunch hour when we visited. I tried the oatmeal stout beer and liked it very much. So far so good. We ordered a plain style pizza (which means it has parmesan but not mozzarella cheese). After a longish wait (20-30? minutes) our pizza arrived with the crust looking plainly overcooked. Our server managed not to notice or care. The crust was hard enough that cutting it with a knife and fork for my daughter was a real challenge. It's hard to factor out this rather essential failing in trying to assess what the pizza might be like if properly prepared. To its credit, it was missing the thick layer of greasy mozzarella that ruins 99% of thin crust pizza in Chicago. The sauce was a little on the light side both in quantity and taste with a strong lightly cooked garlic flavor. Overall, this was a major disappointment for such a highly touted pizza joint, and the fact that our server seemed totally oblivious to the clearly subpar product she served us only compounded the feeling.
