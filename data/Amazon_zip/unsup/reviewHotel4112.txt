This Hotel Sucks. It is so crowded and crazy in here and not in a "Whooo what a party" way. It's more like "There are 500 kids running all over the place and I want to die" kind of way. Outside of the completly cheap and cheesy lobby, the rooms are totally meh. The wireless internet costs $15 a day and is SO SLOW. Don't even bother getting it, you are better off checking your email on your cell phone. If you have a choice don't stay here, there are many other better hotels around the same price that are on or near Michigan AVE (Raffello for example).
