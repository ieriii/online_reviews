If you love the idea of a literal cheese pie, the Giordano's is for you. Seriously this pizza is about an inch deep full of cheese. The pizza should come with a warning: For safety, you should be in good health and free from high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, high cholesterol, or other conditions that could be aggravated by this adventure. Lactose intolerant should not ride.
