I just got home from Geja's. This review will compare it to The Melting Pot, since they're my two fondue experiences. I won't complain that Geja's doesn't offer a larger selection of cheese fondue, since I always choose the classic Grueyere & Swiss at the Melting Pot, anyway. Geja's version is better, with more nutmeg and not scalding, mouth-burning hot like the Melting Pot. At the MP, they give you veggies to dip into the cheese, whereas at Gejas they give you more fruit, like grapes. I prefer the fruit, because the veggies are raw and often too crunchy (califlower, anyone?) The meat is the same--meat you cook yourself with a selection of veggies--and I honestly can't perceive a difference in the sauces served at each, though I do like the butter with herbs at Gejas better, and the Thai chili sauce at Gejas was better and more interesting than the cocktail sauce at MP. The chocolate (I always get the plain dark chocolate) fondue at MP is better than the chocolate at Gejas, because it's thicker and seems to be darker chocolate, which I prefer.  The atmosphere at Geja's is too dark and crowded, but I prefer it to the cheesy lines MP makes their waiters feed you.
