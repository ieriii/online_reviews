Great experience last Saturday afternoon. We stopped by on a whim and are glad we did. Revolution Brewing Co. has a great laid back vibe completely devoid of television screens airing sports - a welcome rarity in Chicago. The experience improved when our lunch arrived. It was delicious - I had a Smokehouse burger and a stout, while my wife had the fish and chips with a belgian style beer. I highly recommend a long afternoon of conversation and beer at Revolution Brewing Co.
