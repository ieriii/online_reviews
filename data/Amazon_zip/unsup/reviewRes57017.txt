They have really great pizza here. It's called New Haven style pizza. Never been to New haven, so I can't compare that aspect. I really admire a restaurant with it's own brewery too. I've tried most of their brews and they are excellent. It is pretty large inside with really long tables for multiple groups to sit at. This gives it sort of a mess hall/highschool cafeteria feel. Nobody's going to make you stand in the corner for being too loud here though.
