If you we're so expensive i'd have you every weekend, ugh i love you. 1st off, they take your coats-adorable. Then you enter the piano room with someone who actually can sing is sweeping you into a romantic, classy atmosphere dueting with someone who knows how to play classics and new songs on the piano. *whimsical sigh... *Mastro's cosmo-poured over dry ice, with bubbles and spill fog over your martini glass, a pleasant surprise for sure! *seafood appetizer tiers, you can pick as many of what you want, and they will built you a tower of appetizers, also with dry ice so the fog tumbles over the seafood on ice! Entree...do NOT touch your plate at first. plates are heated to above 400 degrees, and the service bastes it with butter and herbs and lays down the plate. *We ordered lobster mashed potatoes OMG. MUST HAVE. they spoon it onto your plate and it sizzles when it hits. we split a porterhouse, best of both worlds and since they knew we were splitting it, they sliced it up for us! how nice! at the end, we had the famous yellow cake, it's like the pound cake from heaven. SOOO hot and buttery...mmmm.... I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!
