Going to Zed451 is always a good time. If your looking for great food, beautiful people, and swanky decor this is your place. Most recently took some friends to dinner here and absolutely loved the experience. My server(LIZ) who I have every time I sit down for dinner was great as usual. There whole dinning experience is phenomenal, from the friendly service to the chiefs serving various choices of meats, poultry, and fish servings. Try the Braised pork belly. My Favorite. The cherry on top was the executive chef coming to our table and chatting about the foods and how lively our group was, oh and also meeting one of the owners in the john.Must go for those who like to indulge in fantastically prepared foods and decadent wines.
