I love this place. The highlights: Great location, trendy ambiance, delicious and unique menu, and surprisingly amazing value. I promised my boyfriend, who is on a "find the best pork-belly dish in Chicago" kick, that I'd take him out to a nice dinner after he dominated a Tough Mudder race. The verdict? To this day, this is still his favorite pork belly dish he's experienced in Chicago (and he has a blog about this, people. It's serious.) We ordered the bone marrow appetizer (I'm still not sure how I feel about this, but the BF loved it and practically licked the dish clean), the pork belly and whitefish entrees, and the incredible ice cream sundae dessert (where you pick three homemade ice cream flavors over a warm brownie with chocolate YUMMMM), plus a few drinks. I thought I was going to drop close to $200 but the bill was under half that much! Sweet! The dishes and sides were delectable, the drinks were crafted with skill, and dessert was de-lish. I'm looking forward to going back .
