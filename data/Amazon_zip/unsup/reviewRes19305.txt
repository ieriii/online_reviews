I came here on Saturday for lunch with friends. The service was great! Our waitress was so helpful and friendly. I had the mushroom/truffle sandwich which was delicious but very messy (maybe they shouldn't slice the bread all the way through). My husband had the poutine and the special of the day (pork belly open face sandwich). Everyone loved their food and the beer selection was great. This is a great spot to stop by if you're walking around millenium park. Although my mushroom sandwich was very tasty, I think the best mushroom sandwich I have had so far was probably the mushroom sandwich at Xoco!
