what a cool place. when we got there (a sat) the line went outside and on the sidewalk for a bit. The main menu is ok, but the specials are awesome: antelope sausage? elk sausage? pretty cool stuff. I had chorizo with chipotle mayo and smoked gouda. it was quite good and the service is fast (once you place your order that is). the fries are homemade and actually taste like potato. the only thing is that, man, that sausage is sitting hard in my stomach. i mean you think oh i'm just having a sausage...it's not like a half pound burger or something, but no, it's heavy as hell. enjoy the craziness of the place, just don't plan on running around afterwards.
