My wife and I left Bad Apple last night and she apologized for picking this place on our date night- that about sums up our experience. I was underwhelmed by our food- we both had burgers and fries, and I've just had better. For me, it's hard to top the Burger and the Butcher.  That said, the drinks we tasty and cheap and were (along with the friendly hostess) the highlight of our evening. I also enjoyed the decor, kind of eclectic with a biker-meets-found-art vibe.  Our server was terrible. I mean I would have likely given the place a 2 if we hadn't had such rotten service. Our server was next to non-existent, ran into our table a total of 11 times (we started counting) while serving others, and was just generally unpleasant. I don't need someone hovering by the table, making faux-cheery small talk, but don't act irritated I happened to choose your restaurant and then I'd like to actually eat there. I wanted to like this place, because I like the concept and it's close to our home. We won't be coming back. It's worth the extra 30 minute drive and wait to eat somewhere else.
