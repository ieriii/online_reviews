A gem of a place in walking distance of where I live. BYOB, with no corkage fee is reason enough to go. Pasta is amazing. Gnocchi are cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. I always get the pasta special with the meatballs and the sauce with onions and garlic. Penne cooked al dente and with just enough spice. Food served hot and they give you enormous portions! Waitstaff are amazingly friendly! We had so much fun with our waiter last night that we asked him to join us for a glass of champagne. The only downside was that although the dipping sauces for the bread are great, the bread is like the basic stuff you find at Jewel. I wish they would get better authentic Italian style bread. Espresso wasn't strong enough and desserts are good but not amazing. This place is very accommodating for big groups and is well worth the wait! I wish they had outdoor seating!!!
