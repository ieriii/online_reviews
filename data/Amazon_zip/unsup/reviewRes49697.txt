Food ranges from huh? to middle-of-the-road. Service at the bar is for masochists - note to management: we don't pay to get attitude or talked back/down to - I'm talking about Brad-my-last-name-is-not-Pitt-but-my-ego-is-bigger (if it is even possible, I've noticed it gets bigger whenever I've taken a date over). Look for Jimmy - knowledgeable and friendly. I've sucked it up and been to this place for over a couple of years just for the wine: decent by-the-glass selection by Chicago standards - well, not any more.
