I am going to keep it short and sweet. The Mayan Palace is awesome. I am not saying this food is literally passed down from Mayan Gods to my table, nor am I saying their drinks are the nectar of the Gods, but for real- this place is awesome. Tuesdays and Thursays are half price margaritas, and its a great deal. The food is the perfect compliment to their tasty liquid delights, and to top it all off the service is incredible. I am not ashamed to say I am a regular, and they know me by name there- its a worthy accomplishment! So, go to Mayan, eat and drink up! Ask for Alberto or Augustine (GREAT servers)
