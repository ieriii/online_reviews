I booked this hotel on a whim and had never been there before. I must say, quite the lucky strike! This hotel is amazing. From the doorman, to the reception, to the room, itself, this hotel has it all. The location is in downtown very close to everything you'll need: shopping, eating, or site-seeing. We had booked a queen-size room. The room size wasn't that large, but the cleanliness of the room and decor was what gave you the homely. yet contemporary feel. There is a mini-bar in the room along with a small sitting/study area. Whenever we needed anything, all we had to do was step outside the hotel and everything was in reach. The staff was very helpful and professional. Very clean, very quiet, and a great experience.
