Bloody marys were amazing!! Every single thing that was ordered was very tasty. I had the black beans with eggs and the red salsa on them were very yummy but i wish it had been more spicy. My husband got the egg new orleans and i WISH i had ordered that, mmm mm mm. Also the biscuits with the spicy jelly made my day.
