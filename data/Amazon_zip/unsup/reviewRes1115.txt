Yes, it wa an adventure not just lunch. Hower a 5 star adventure. Took Blue line from downtown chicago. However you have to catch a cab from there. Good luck in the middle of nowhere. However we found one. Paid him an extra $20 to come back in an hour and pick us up. Only 15 people in line on a rainy monday! After we got there line quickly wrapped around the building. 50 min later we order. Rattlesnake sausage Duck and Foie Sausage, chicago dog and fries **Duck fat fries only on fridays and saturdays***BEWARE*** so we have just enough time to cram ourselves in the cab at 1:15 knowing we have a 2:30 flight back to DC. Best hot dog ever, Best sausages ever. Well worth the tummy ache as we ran through the airport to only find that our flight was delayed.  Wait in 90 degree heat: 45 min. Cost of meal: 45.00. Cab ride to eat hot dogs 27.00..  The feeling of getting to try Hot Dougs before leaving chicago? Priceless.......
