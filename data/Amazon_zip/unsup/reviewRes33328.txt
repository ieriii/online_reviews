This was my first breakfast in Chicago and I loved it. I am a huge fan of eggs benedict and like to think I am becoming an "expert eggs benedict eater." That said, I have my favorite: The Inn on Coventry in Cleveland. And with THAT said, I have a favorite in Chicago now, too. The eggs benedict was recommended to me before we got to the restaurant, so for once, I barely looked at a menu, knowing I had to give it a try. I certainly did not regret my decision. While my favorite in Cleveland is perfect diner food, slightly greasier and especially tasty with a side of grits, my new Chicago favorite is a bit lighter. With the fresh fruit and excellent potatoes, I wasn't able to finish my whole meal, but I left incredibly satisfied and without feeling TOO weighed down.
