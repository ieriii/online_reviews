Being from the suburbs, I'm not familiar with the great breakfast places in the city. So when some out of town friends suggested meeting here for Sunday breakfast, I was game. Because of how crowded the waiting area was, I had high hopes regarding the food. I mean doesn't crowded restaurant = great food? Not always I found out. I ordered the cheese omelette with a side of their chocolate strawberry pancakes and the strawberry orange juice. The strawberry orange juice was probably the best part of the meal. You could definitely taste how fresh it was. Yum. The omelette was huge...like a brick. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy it. It was so thick and all the cheese was on top of the omelette. The pancakes were a bit better but nothing spectacular. All I could taste was the chocolate chips and chocolate sauce and fresh strawberries. The pancake itself really didn't have a taste to it. I really wanted to like this place and tried really hard. But in the end, it was just ok. I don't know if I would come back just because of the number of other breakfast places in the city and even the suburbs to try.
