This place is amazing. The wait is well worth it. I had my sister and brother-in-law in town this weekend and they loved this place. Duck-fat french fries were amazing. We went shortly after they opened for the day, just before lunch on a Friday, and waited a half hour or so - not too bad from the lines I've seen before.
