Surprisingly, a top quality seafood palace in the shadow of the stockyards. Fresh fish is flown in daily from both coasts and the Gulf of Mexico to supply this restaurant that's been popular with locals for more than two decades. Cold or hot appetizer combination platters allow diners to sample the shrimp, oysters, crab, clams, and calamari. Although chicken and beef are on the menu, the spotlight is on the extensive list of grilled, broiled, sauteed, and fried seafood offerings, including pan-fried yellow lake perch and shrimp in six different preparations. The key lime pie is primo. Live jazz and blues every Tuesday and Thursday night.
