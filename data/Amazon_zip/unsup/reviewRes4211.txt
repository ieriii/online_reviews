Amazing food, OK everything else. When we got there we were disappointed because the 9 course menu they are currently serving is entirely different from the one on their website. We had gotten ourselves all excited about some of the dishes we had seen on the website and read about. The MOST important thing is your attitude going in. Someone else on yelp had written that you should be prepared to be insulted to your face... YES. The head chef is quite a character. The room is small, loud, and not that well decorated. But the food... wow. Even though it wasn't the menu we thought we were going to get, we loved the food. They gave us several surprise courses not on the menu, including the famous quail egg ravioli. And, to his credit, the head chef realized that his odd behavior was bothering us, so he backed off and other cooks at the restaurant interacted with us instead. (The cooks are your waiters). Food 5 stars, but the loudness of the room and the kitchen really bothered me a lot, it was hard to talk to my friends. When dropping this kind of dough, I was a little bit disappointed that the atmosphere was this poor.
