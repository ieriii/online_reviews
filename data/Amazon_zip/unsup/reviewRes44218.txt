My fiance & I recently got married and chose Alliance to create our wedding cake. We had some difficulties with our reception venue and their contracted cake vendors. Our cake was to be included in our reception package, but after much frustration - we were given the option to take a credit, and arrange our cake on our own. Since we live in the neighborhood, we thought we would go by Alliance. We met with Mitchell for the tasting and everything was great. They were friendly, professional, and had much more reasonable pricing than other bakeries. The cake was delicious, decorated exactly how we wanted, and delivered to our venue on time. The whole experience was perfect.
