There is nothing i can say that hasn't been said about Hot Doug's already - it's pretty much AMAZING The wait at first may turn you off, but please, it is soooo WORTH IT I would recommend definitely trying any of the specials. The regular hot dogs are also delicious, but when you've been waiting in line for almost two hours, the specials will hit the spot! The staff is also VERY friendly. Doug is always there, and always attentive to your order. The wait staff will always help you find a table for your group. also make sure you try their duck fat fries on Fridays and Saturdays!
