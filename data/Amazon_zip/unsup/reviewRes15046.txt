Brew pubs aren't nothing new, especially in other cities. But in Chicago, it seems...well...revolutionary. When I heard the handlebar folks were behind this one, I went in with high expectations for their beer. I enjoyed what I had. The IPA was quite solid, robust choice. Has a great Han Solo quote in the beer list menu next to it. Something about "I'm not in this for your revolution..."  Also had the Scotch Ale and the Stout, both of which were great examples of craft brews, no holds barred, we aren't limiting the resulting alcohol level for those beer drinking urbanite runner types that leave the financial office for a run during lunch and then enjoy happy hour with some ultra-nano-light water beer from miller or bud for happy hour because drinking beer is somehow about cutting calories. No. Here you get no fears of calorie counting and maintaining that appearance to do television commercials. At Revolution, the only beer is beer itself. Such an environment may have emboldened a younger generation. A lot of infants hanging out. One was sneaking up behind me and playing with my coat zipper. Another kept trying to sneak up and grab my glass of stout off the low height beer barrel table. I had to remind him that it wasn't his organic chocolate milk that his mom had for him on the next barrel. Although it is our young adult generation that has revolution brewery, I have a feeling that the real revolution will be carried out by the next generation, this infant trying to steal my beer generation. They are certainly bold, as bold as the stout that intrigued the infant to my right. They are off to a good start on the beer end I think. Can't wait to try the food. Looks like a number of great vegetarian options on the menu.
