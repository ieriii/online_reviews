I've driven by this place a million times and never noticed it. But now we live in the area and my dude was Yelping new breakfast spots. When this came up, we decided to give it a go.  We walked in and everyone was SO FRIENDLY. Not only the staff but the patrons as well. The first time we were in, I had the meat skillet. It was good, better than average. This last time we went though, we asked them if they could make a skillet with the much Yelped about corned beef hash. They were happy to oblige. It was AMAZING! As previous reviews said, it's real corned beef hash, not that canned stuff. As we were leaving on New Year's Eve, one of the staff members asked us what our son's birthday was because they were going to play it in the lottery. We were in a week later and they sadly informed us that his birthday did *not* win them the millions. Boo.  Probably our new go-to breakfast place in our area! I can't wait until next weekend when I shall be eating that dreamy hash again...
