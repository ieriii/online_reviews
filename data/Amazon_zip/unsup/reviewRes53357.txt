First off, I never do reviews for restaurants... This restaurant has something going for it....I got in line at 10:45 AM yesterday morning and waited about an hour and a half. I am impatient and my friend who went with me is VERY impatient.... We are from out of town and were on vacation and even took the CTA to this place in the suburbs... We both had amazing hot dogs / sausages from here. The duck fat fries are amazing. Would we both do this again and wait in line? Absolutely! See Albert H. review below...
