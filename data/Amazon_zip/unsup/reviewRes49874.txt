this place is terrible. if you say you're going to put bacon on a sandwich then put more than a bacon bit on there, it would be less insulting if you just put none, then I would think you just forgot, but to put instead just a little crumb of bacon on my club sandwich indicates to me that you dont know how to make a sandwich and you dont care about your customers. Moreover.... if i pay an extra $1 for waffle fries, GIVE ME WAFFLE FRIES. if i ask for tomato... GIVE ME TOMATO. Seriously. then dont take over an hour to deliver food that may have at one point been edible but arrives as just a soggy mess. The Chicken Wrap is awful and flavorless. Just cus you make something big doesnt mean its good. I huge piece of excrement is still a piece of excrement. Why would you eat here when you can just eat at Jerry's and get some of the best sandwiches ever... this is a terrible restaurant that will never get my business again.
