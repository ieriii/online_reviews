Good lord... we had the worst experience with our main waiter. We had a large group (10 people) that wanted separate checks (5 checks) - you would have thought we asked him to part the seas. We waited (honestly) 45 minutes for him to return and offered nothing but added frustration. They require a deposit for a large group and that is always a hassle... they completely complicated the return of the deposit to the rightful owner in which they gave up and decided to call the manager the next day. The meat - pretty good, pretty quick and always added more sides as they were eaten.
