Great atmosphere! We sat at the bar and had drinks and appetizers. We had the artichoke dip and the steak salad. Both very tasty. The Dip was cheesy and hot and the salad had asparagus and artichokes, two of our favorites. The drinks (margarita and cosmo) were served with care. The bartenders were as friendly as can be and we were able to watch The Masters with cheer and share comments with the locals. Great place to hag out on a weekend.
