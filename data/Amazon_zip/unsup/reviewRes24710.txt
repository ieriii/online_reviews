I visited Chicago recently for work, and we decided to go somewhere fun and exciting for dinner one night. That led us to Mercat a la Planxa. The food was amazing, but the experience of dining for hours and trying copious amounts of delicious small plates made the night really special. The roasted apple seasonal sangria was amazing, and from there the waiter was knowledgeable and recommended some great wines to pair with our food. Between the four of us, we tried 12 small plates and three desserts, and left satisfied and boggled as to how EVERYTHING was delicious. I hear about the ham and fig salad and how amazing it is, but with all the great dishes, I have to say this and the scallop and shrimp meatballs were our tables least favorites. The standouts in a sea of delicious were easy to pick out. The bacon wrapped dates were phenomenal. So flavorful and amazing. The short rib and horseradish flatbread was unique, spicy, and memorable. Lastly, the butternut squash and lamb ragout dumplings were a dish we talked about all evening. There were so many high notes that it's hard to call out specifics, but if you are ever in Chicago, even for a few hours, make Mercat a la Planxa a MUST on your to do list. You won't regret it.
