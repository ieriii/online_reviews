I really like this pizza place/ brewery. The pizza is a delicious thin crust, my fav. And they offer a New Haven style that I love. The craft beers are awesome. I love worryin ale, camel toe, dysfunction ale, as well as many others. It's really hard to go wrong with anything here. Only reason it isnt 5 stars is that its a bit expensive and it is impossible to get in on a weekend.
