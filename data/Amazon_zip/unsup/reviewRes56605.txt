Last Saturday night my girlfriend and I ate at Mastro's for the first time and absolutely loved it. The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all great. Normally I would have gone to Ruth Chris but I wanted to try something different and was more than happy with my choice. As a matter of fact, from now on I will be going to Mastro's when I want a steak instead of Ruth Chris. To top everything off, the day after I dinned at Mastro's I received a call from them thanking me for coming in. Thanks for a perfect evening Mastro's!
