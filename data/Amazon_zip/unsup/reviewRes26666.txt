Best Mexican food in Chicago. Period. Having taken several trips to Mexico and being a Latina myself, I make it my mission to try to find the best Mexican wherever I am. My family and I have been coming here for several years. I love that it is still byob. I love the complimentary "appetizer" you are given at the beginning of the meal. I love the atmosphere period. Unpretentious, delicious food in a casual environment. The salsas are to die for and the chips? Addictive. So far I have tried: the carne asada-pure beef bliss, the combination plate-my "go to" item, the tostadas topped with guacamole that can almost rival mine and the pollo en mole. Considering myself a mole freak, this stuff is sweet and savory and utterly divine. I will keep coming back to Nuevo Leon as long as the prices stay low and the food stays tasty. Make sure to make a trip-its more than worth it!
