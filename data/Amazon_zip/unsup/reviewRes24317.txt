I don't know.. just not very impressed. My boyfriend and I dined with a Living Social, so at least we knocked off $30 from our bill (it was $50 but originally paid $20). The whole romantic atmosphere is great, I'll give it that! Great ambiance. And service was spectacular! But what we didn't find impressive was simply the food. We went all out and had the Prince Geja's combination, the whole three course thing (or four if you count the wimpy salad). Cheese fondue was good! Meat platter was decent at best. Dipping sauces were fine, nothing impressive. We enjoyed the experience of cooking your own meat the most, not so much actually consuming it. BTW, our server gave us times for cooking our meat... please multiply them by 3 if you're avoiding contamination of raw meat. I left the beef in there for five minutes and it was still red (when we were told 3 was well done). But maybe it was just our oil was not hot enough? Who knows. All we know is all the timing was completely off. The chocolate fondue however was phenomenal. That's probably what got this review 3 stars as opposed to 2. Great goodies to dip into the chocolate, and the whole high flame for a few minutes due to the orange liqueur was awesome to play with! Overall, we didn't find the food to be that amazing and it ended up being pretty pricy for something we could've done without. Maybe we would've been better off with just a cheese and chocolate fondue, and maybe a cheese platter. But definitely should've avoided the bulk of the cost - the geja's combination platter.
