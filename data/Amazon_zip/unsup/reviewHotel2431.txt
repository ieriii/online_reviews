I've never stayed here- but I do VIP hotel accommodations for perhaps the most powerful businessman in the world. I've visited every luxury hotel in Chicago, and intensely scrutinized every Presidential suite and penthouse- and I think the most luxurious is the Hilton Presidential suite. Their sales rep for our request took us on a full tour of the hotel, gave us historical background as we toured (really fascinating history), and a very elegant front entrance off of Michigan Ave. A nice touch- the United Airlines check-in kiosk by the hotel check-in counter. You can kill 2 birds withone stone before you even head out to O'Hare. The views are stunning if your room faces East.  The hotel is beautiful, the Presidential suite is exquisite, and their sales staff was intensely helpful ad friendly and paid us a lot of attention. I appreciate their help- as my list of questions and inquiries before the VIPs arrive is quite extensive.
