Chicago Diner is the number one spot for hearty vegetarian/vegan food on the North Side, in my opinion. I've never eaten anything there that I didn't dream about later. My favorite is the Titanic BLT burger... it's so tasty and so filling! I always get it with a side of sweet potato fries. Also, everyone who works at Chicago Diner is so nice! I sat at the diner counter a few weeks ago, and was hungrily eyeing everything they were bringing out. The dude behind the counter must've noticed this, because he gave the leftovers from a peanut butter chocolate shake... and he made it all pretty, with chocolate syrup and chocolate chips. So nice! Of course the downside is that if you want to eat at a normal hour, you have to wait at least 20 or so minutes for a table... but if you can get over that, you must... MUST... try this place.
