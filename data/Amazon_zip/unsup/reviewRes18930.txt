Hands down one of my favorite places in Chicago! Their restaurant week 2012 offerings were memorable and I'm so glad my first taste of duck was here. Their lunch prix fixe that week had a lovely BBQ duck sandwich as the star. Delicious! I've been here several times before and since for both lunch and dinner and always try to grab a cocktail table by the bar. I love the atmosphere and it's loud enough that despite that the tables are close together you can't hear the conversation at the table next to you. I've been here twice with vegetarians, which is ironic since this place caters to carnivores but they are wonderfully accommodating of herbivores. Their presentation is interesting without being ridiculous. Don't let the portions fool you. They seem small but you'll get stuffed quick!
