I haven't been here for a while, but I've never had a bad meal here. It's a carnivore's delight. I like the steak au poivre (with peppercorns) and the blue cheese crusted filet. The pork chops and planked salmon are both excellent. I hear there are salads here, but I wouldn't know. But the double baked potatoes -- yum. I think I hear my cholesterol calling.
