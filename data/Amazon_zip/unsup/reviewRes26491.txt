a-pho-dable and pho-nomenal when it comes to food, service and convenience. the best pho in the LP area, top-notch/quick delivery with always a "complimentary" surprise in your bag, friendly service and great vietnamese all around. there's just something about vietnamese food that i love - it's lighter, still flavorful and fresh. this is usually my sunday night go-to for delivery. for under $16 you can snag some great chicken or beef pho and an appetizer or main dish. for dine-in, it's great for a group and it's byob. what i've tried and love: Lemon Grass Beef Saigonese Crepe - Banh Xeo Shrimp Beignets - Tom Cuon Chien Simply It's Beef Noodle Soup - Pho Bo Chicken Noodle Soup - Pho Ga Spicy Tofu Cold Beef Salad try it once and you'll be hooked too.
