My friends and I were at Boundary this afternoon and couldn't watch all the NCAA games there so we went to the new place, Fifty/50 down the street. Supposedly the owners managed Joe's Stone Crab for the past few years, so we were interested.The food and service were amazing. I had the skirt steak sandwich and I think it was the best I've ever had. The cheese fries were also better than any I've had. All my friends enjoyed their food, we watched the games, and had Mickey's 40oz beer all day long. They even give hot towel service after you eat ribs and wings. I have a new favorite place in Wicker Park...
