For the food alone, 90 Miles would get a 5-star review all the way. Oh my goodness it was so delicious. I got the Bistec (steak) dinner and I swear every bite was better than the one before. The steak, the chimichurri sauce, the rice & beans, the plantains... my mouth waters just thinking about it. It was difficult to restrain myself from continuing to eat once I got full but I really wanted leftovers. So now you may be asking why I'm only giving a 2-star review to an establishment with 5-star worthy food? Well, the answer is simple, really. I can't give a 5-star review to a place that I believe to have shady business practices. Shady practice #1: inconsistent pricing. The prices are different everywhere you look. The chalkboards are different than the menus which are different than the menus online. And I'm not talking a little different, I'm talking different by many dollars in some instances. And I could overlook the difference between online and real menu, but not between chalkboard and real menu - that's just ridiculous.  Shady practice #2: well, this one takes more explanation. We were a group of 8. And so having tip added on wouldn't surprise me. When we got our bill, there was a "misc charge" added pre-tax. It wasn't listed as gratuity and we couldn't find our waiter so I broke out my calculator (ok, my iphone) to figure out if it was in fact gratuity. Hmm, it was more than 20%. And it was pre-tax (meaning we were taxed on it as well). When we finally found our waiter, he assured us that of course "misc charge" = gratuity and no, he couldn't change it and yes we had to pay all of it and be taxed on it. Excuse me? What? I would have been happy to pay 20% but I'm not happy about being taxed on my tip and I'm mostly not happy about being charged more than 20% automatically. Not cool. So, 90 Miles, as delicious as you were, I won't be coming back because I just don't appreciate your way of doing business.
