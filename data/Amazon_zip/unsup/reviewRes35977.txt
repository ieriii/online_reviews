This place is as good as it gets as far as I'm concerned! Cheap, Delicious, Fast and in the neighborhood. This place brought me back to Chinese Bar-b-que in Guangzou. I got the BBQ chicken and BBQ pork with rice. Flavorful, balanced, and included Chinese Broccoli all for $5. Awesome. You'll start seeing a lot of me here, that's for sure.
