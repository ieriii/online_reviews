I am a Korean BBQ neophyte, but this easily might have been the most amazing food I've had in quite awhile. After a long, hard night of drinking we were starving for some Asian fare and decided to hit up the Korean BBQ that's open 24/7. Got inside and the place was full and lively from all of the other drunk people eating fourth meal. The patrons were drunk, but not the obnoxious Lincoln Park / Wrigleyville kind of drunk. All I wanted was some Bulgogi and Mandu and they delivered more than what I expected. Upon ordering our food, in came a pot of red hot flaming charcoal in a ceramic bowl with a grill on top, quite visually appealing I must say. Then came the largest selection of Korean appetizers that I have ever seen, I counted twenty little plates of appetizers that ranged from potato salad, sardines, tofu, noodles, kim chee, and all manners of all Korean cold appetizers that you have ever ordered. That begged the question, "Why get regular appetizers at all!?" When the Mandu came, there were about eight giant pieces of Mandu with an amazing dipping sauce that was filled with spices and chunks of some veggie. The Bulgogi came with two veggie filled miso type of soup. The meat came piled high on the grill and we could cook it to our own delight. Delightful meal, delightful atmosphere, and fairly priced for what you get at about $20 a person. Next time my friends are hungry for a late night snack, Korean BBQ will rule again.
