I was not impressed with this BW. It was the 3rd one I stayed at in 10 days and it was the most disappointing. :( When we were checking in the lady was not very helpful answering our questions. We asked about parking and she suggested a public lot. Later another worker said they had valet, so we did that, but why didn't she tell us?? They also neglected to mention that valet doesn't open until 6 am and we were leaving before that...How to get the car?? The morning guy was VERY nice and got it out for us and it was waiting when we came down. The room was clean but not very comfortable. It was very cold on in the room and on the floors. The Red Line train was loud and you could hear everyone who got on/off the elevator. I think we paid too much for what we actually got. But I would stay here again if I had to, I just wouldn't choose it.
