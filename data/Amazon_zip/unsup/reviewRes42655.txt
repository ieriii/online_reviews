Loved it. The table, the lights, the service, the drinks, the crowd, the food...oh the couch too :) Timing for drinks and food was really good. The tables are setup real nice. It feels like got your own space. I think its because of the lights in this place. Once you get seated you'll know what I am talking about .. Make sure to have a reservation or show up early. Real early :P
