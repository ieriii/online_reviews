The baked good in this store are OUTSTANDING. The bakery itself, meaning the staff, leaves MUCH to be desired. Every time I go there (and I live two blocks away, so I go often), it is like pulling teeth to get anyone in the bakery to even look at me, even when I am the only customer in sight. When I do get their attention, they are CLEARLY irritated at having to wait on me. It's a store, right? I mean, the items are behind glass. I cannot simply serve myself. Similarly, the bakery staff are also tasked with serving coffee. My experience tells me that you MUST go out of your way, no matter how obvious your presence, to beg them for coffee. You could stand there with a hatchet sticking out of your head and I doubt the employees would notice or care.Fox & Obel carries a number of specialty food items I enjoy and purchase there often. But I never leave happy. I always leave feeling that I wish someone else in the neighborhood carried my items. And I don't want to have to feel that way.
