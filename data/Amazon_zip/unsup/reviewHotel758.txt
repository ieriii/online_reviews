Stayed here once... This is a great location... Right on Michigan Ave just north of the hancock. Can't beat that... I liked everything about the hotel except the room size... Just a bit cramped but that is to be expected in downtown Chicago. I have seen far worst too in NYC (the W hotel-tuscany for instance) and you will pay double for that space! I would imagine this is a great place for business along with personal ventures alike.
