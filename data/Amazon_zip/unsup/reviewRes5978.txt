This is the only place I've been to in Chicago that has a "REAL" wine by the glass list. most places have garbage by the glass. Not here, they put some thought into it, and are very fair with the prices... Food outstanding, again prices are amazing for quality. Sarah was our sever and was splendid.. Rocking brunch too.. good job folks.
