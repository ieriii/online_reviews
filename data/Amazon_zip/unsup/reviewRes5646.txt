honestly, i dont know what all the fuss is about purple pig. most everything its just OK, not too many dishes are memorable or worth the price tag. the beets with goat cheese and the olive oil soft serve are awesome, but after eating here twice and not finding one stellar pork dish, id rather spend the dough at avec or bristol
