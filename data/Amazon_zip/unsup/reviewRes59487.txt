Value Value Value. I cannot find another place that will match the cost and quality of the food. I've had every steak and veal dish and loved them all. The chicken Vesuvio is famous, all the pizzas are great. We had a 100 guest baby shower there, served family style, and had guests call us to meet for for dinner. Usually family style is so/so at a banquet but not here, the cost per person and the happy (and full!!!) guests makes La Villa the best family Italian restaurant . P.s. I have over 300 call in/catered orders over the last 6 years.
