#1354.... Is Hot Doug's the best Chicago dog I've ever had? Absolutely. Would I ever wait 2 hours for it again? Probably not. I mean, come on people.... it's only a hot dog. I devoured a Chicago dog with everything, and a specialty sausage - wild boar. The wild boar sausage was garlicky and amazing. My advice is to go to Hot Doug's hungry enough to get 1 "regular" dog and 1 "specialty". I was there on a Saturday, so we got the duck fat fries b/c they were available. Call me a philistine, but they didn't rock my world. If you're there on Friday or Saturday, just get them.... but don't kill yourself just for these over-hyped potatoes. CASH ONLY.
