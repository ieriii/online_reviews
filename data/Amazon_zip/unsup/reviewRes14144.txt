The food is all really fantastic. Let's start with that, and get it out of the way. I want to eat it all, every single day. (Brunch is consistently magical.) Their beer, however, is a different story. It's not special! Or if it is "special" (as in, limited in quantity) they're probably out of it. The guest draft list is fairly good, and while there's nothing actually wrong with their beer it just isn't exciting. It's also unreasonably loud. While the decibel level has improved with the introduction of ANYTHING on the walls, the music is always both loud and bizarre, and there is just nothing to absorb anyone's voice. It's a fine place for brunch, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it after work or if you're looking for a thrilling new brew.
