While in Chicago, I asked my cousin to take me to try a Chicago Hot Dog....she took me to Superdawg. I thought, cool...lemme see if they have anything on Pinks Hot Dogs back in LA. Driving up, it totally reminds me of Sonic (drive, park, order from your car, and food is taken right up to you). Cool, fun place, and didn't have to get out in the Humid Chicago weather. The Hot Dog was very interesting looking (florescent green relish) along with a large slab of pickle on top. The look threw me off for a second, but when I ate...it was really good. It also came with fries and a drink. Really cool experience and good hot dogs.
