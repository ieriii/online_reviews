Perfect place to spend Valentine's Day with my husband. I love the vibe of this place - sultry yet relaxed and chill. Great mix of music. Now that I'm a little older I don't dare venture to the younger bars that are crowded with really loud music.This is exactly the kind of place I want to go to. I can still talk to my husband and hear what he says. The drinks were great - the mixologist was friendly and helpful. I heart Violet Hour (like A LOT).
