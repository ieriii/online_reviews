I remember eating at Calo pre-rehab. It certainly has a different feel then, than it did "back in the day". The food here is certainly consistent and we probably order take-out once a week. We ate here on Saturday evening and we all enjoyed our meals. The closeness to home makes it very convenient and we have never had any complaints. One thing I feel really defines a place is each consistency. I hate ordering a pizza and wondering what pizza I was going to get. Sauce is always the same as well as the ingredients which is why we go back.
