This would be a good hotel if you were spending one night in the city to see a play and you didn't care much about having a quiet, relaxing, comfortable night. Otherwise, there are far better hotels in the area that are infinitely better than Hotel Allegro. The best things about this hotel are the fantastic bell hops and room service. And the art deco theme is wonderfully done. Otherwise, its a fairly dismal, low-class hotel. The "quiet room" we requested may actually be quiet when the only noise you would have to deal with is the usual hall noise, but we could hear every word (and everything) the people next door were up to until 11:30 pm, by which time we called the front desk and security asked our love bird neighbors to be a bit quieter. Perhaps these people were just exceptionally loud? But even without the noise, the King bed in our room was simply awful- it was rock hard and actually slanted towards the floor. The room itself, as so many others have pointed out, is very small (especially with a king bed) and the bathroom tiny, but clean and well designed. Overall, the hotel worked for us because it was in walking distance to the building where we were giving a presentation, but I would never recommend it to out-of-town friends and we will definitely not be going back.
