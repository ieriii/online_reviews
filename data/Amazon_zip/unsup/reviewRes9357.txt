Absolute tastebud heaven!!!!! I love coming here for lunch or dinner whenever I can. I've never had anything I didn't like here. Literally. That's the kind of place that earns 5 stars with me! Some of my favorite bites are the grilled scallop salad, the Vietnamese grilled chicken and mushroom raviolis, the shrimp wrapped around sugar cane, and the clay pot chicken. They also have a great $8 glass of Riesling, the name of which escapes me now, but it's the only $8 one. Overall, the atmosphere is dark and classy. Good for dates or dinner with my parents who come from out of town. If the weather is nice, sit upstairs on the balcony with a view of the street. Yeah it's a little tight space, but it's worth it if you have a group of 4 people or less.
