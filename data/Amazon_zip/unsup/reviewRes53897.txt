This is my must go to restaurant when in Chicago. I love the atmosphere as soon as you step in the place. I usually choose to sit at the bar next to the pass so you can see all the dishes going out. I have yet to have a dish I have not liked. My all time favorite is the Crispy Pig Ears with the fried egg on top. Sounds weird but I can't get enough of that dish. The Bone Marrow is a must try. Also the Beets with Goat Cheese is a great way to start. This place is out of control good. I have been there 3 times during my last two trips to Chicago. Perfect for the late night bite too. Not sure I want too many people to find out about this place it is already really busy so my selfish side is saying I shouldn't post this.
