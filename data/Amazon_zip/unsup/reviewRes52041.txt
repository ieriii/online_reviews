I remember eating deep dish pizzas from this location from over 20 years ago, my father worked around the corner from here and would bring back pizzas for special occasions (both cooked and ready to eat and frozen pre-made ready to oven bake versions). This place is on my requisite list of restaurants to visit on any trip to Chicago, we visited last week and enjoyed their sausage (pie patty) and spinach deep dish pizzas. I tend to prefer their corn bread like crust over other crusts that are more standard. One slice of each is more than enough food, we took home plenty of leftovers- A few years back, my wife and I tried taking a frozen pizza back to Cambridge and while it looked intact when we arrived home (after the two hour flight), the pizza did not do well in the oven! The crust was defrtosted enough so that it melted into one big blob! Ugh - still tasted the same but clearly was not recognizable!
