I love love love their enchiladas suizas with the ancharo sauce! YUM! The place is a dive but always packed and always a line and BYOB! I ordered a few things before besides the enchiladas suizas and not a fan, I have to stick the enchiladas suizas for sure! its Cash only- pretty cheap and pretty fast... We got a to go order last weekend and it was ready in less than 10 min but I would rather prefer eating there but didnt want to wait in line! My husband really likes their Steak Tapiquena? not sure exactly but something like that-thin skirt steak with an enchilada and guac and rice, last weekend he ate the whole thing in one sitting...
