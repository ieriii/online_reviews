I attended Pequod's for the lunch special. I was disappointed to say the least. After a few sips of my Diet Coke I noticed something floating in it. I asked the waitress for a new drink about 10 minutes before we received our food. I did not receive a new one until about 10 minutes after we received our food. I did not receive an apology for the wait, or the fact that I received a drink with a mysterious object floating in it.The quality of the pizza was sub-par at best. The sauce is too sweet and there is way too much of it. There was also way too much crust which took away from the taste. I had heard raves about the caramelized crust, but I was not at all impressed. It' taste was a mixture of tasteless dough and burned dough.My experience was enough to convince me to not return.
