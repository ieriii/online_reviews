Waiting in line for... nothing. I love Chicago. I love the amount of great restaurants and bars that I can immediately walk into in Chicago. That's why I was so surprised when arriving at the Violet Hour, there was a bit of a line out the door. Now, I can't remember the last time I waited in line to get into a place. I wasn't too worried. The line wasn't that long... wow, was I wrong. After waiting an hour, inching my way into the front door, only four more people in front of us, I saw a rule list posted on the wall. Some of the rules included, must have proper attire, do not order beer, do not order grey goose, no reservations. Weird. After investing a full hour of my life waiting in line I was determined to wait a little longer to see what this was all about. The place was at full capacity, meaning the only way the line would move forward was if someone left the club. The guy in front of me said " this place better have freaking cherubs servings drinks in there!"... My thoughts exactly. Well, there was no way we were getting in anytime soon. Suddenly, at the hour of 10 pm there were about three groups of 4 to 5 girls walking right past the line, saying to the doorman, "we have reservations." I was shocked. Right next to me there was a rule list that stated 'no reservations'. And to my doubled shock the door man let them in!! Suddenly, I went from having only four people in front of me to having twenty people in front of me! I turned to my date and said, "lets get out of here." We promptly left the line, walked into a hoppin' bar half a block away and ordered ourselves two grey gooses, straight up. It was great. Listen, I will never waist my time waiting in line like that again. Chicago has too many great places for me to enjoy... without the line.
