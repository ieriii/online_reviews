The hotel is very clean and the rooms are comfy. The best part is the location. You are in the heart of downtown and you have the Hancock building next door and the view from our room down Michigan Avenue was plain gorgeous. Also, you can walk to Rush Street to have some food and drinks. The bad part is that they don't have free parking, no free WIFI and the worst they don't have a swimming pool or a jacuzzi. This is a very expensive hotel so I cannot believe they don't have a pool.... I have been in way cheaper hotels that have those amenities so it doesn't make sense for such a nice hotel don't have it. Service on the front desk wasn't the best either. I was standing there for more than five minutes waiting to check in and then we went to check out their system were down so we couldn't get our receipt at that time. Overall, not what I was expecting from the Westin or for the room price.
