Such a bad service,Slow, unhelpfull, unkind, without supervision.Don't bring here someone you want to impress about Colombia's restaurants.We just went yesterday for lunch, 5 persons.* waiter never came to our table to ask "is everything ok?"* when we needed to order more (drinks,deserts,etc.) have to wait too long to call their attention.* They don't know how to say "would you like more coffee?" (neither english nor spanish)* We requested an extra fork and the answer was "another??"* My sister in law asked the waiter to describe their stake and he say "is  stake, that's what the menu says"* There is nobody overseeing the operations on the floor to make sure all the patrons are having a good experience.* Our menu didn't have the prices printed, we paid over $100+ tip* Had to wait too long to pay* The Bandeja Paisa is not the best in this place.Mybe is time for another waiters meeting,.......... if you ever had one.
