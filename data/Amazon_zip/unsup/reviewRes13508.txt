I would have gone at least 3 stars since the food isnt by any means bad, but my bigger problem was 2 of the 3 times I've been there, our servers have really ruined the experience. One of them acted just plain old pissed off to have to be taking our orders. She spent at least 500% more time looking at her cellphone and talking to another server as she did checking on her tables. She distinctly gave the "i wish you would just leave me alone" sigh anytime we asked her for anything. I know everyone has a bad day, but if you hate your job that much, give it to someone who wants it. The food and drink are pretty good, but I've had plenty of $7 burgers around town that are just as good as their $13 burger. I wouldn't say stay away from this place by any means, just saying I think there are plenty of places who do the same thing just as well for a lower price.
