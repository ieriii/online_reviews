Maybe we just caught it on the right Saturday during college football but I thought this place was great, maybe the best sports bar I've been to. Dallas, Austin, LA, Miami, NYC... The Fifty/50 has more TV's per person than any other sports bar I've been to. The refereee girls were encouraging us to get loud and throw things, the cold air was blowing in from the wide open doors n patio windows, and the college football atmosphere was nuts. So yah I guess thanks for ruining my old favorites? Can't wait to go back, all other sports bars seem tame in comparison.
