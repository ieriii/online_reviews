Definitely lives up to the Westin name. Hotel bar area had great service. Friendly, fast and seared shrimp tacos were nice and had a little spice! Room is spacious with fantastic view of the city. Front desk helpful and fast. Was here for only one night for client work but will certainly return. Other favorites was the comp water bottle for Starwood members. And really like that they email you the final bill.
