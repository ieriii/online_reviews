I really don't understand why I don't come to The Chicago Diner more often! I always love the food and have a great time. I am a vegetarian so I am a little biased. I don't have that many vegetarian friends (might be the reason I don't go that often) but when I get a chance to drag them along almost all of them enjoy it as well. I recommend Chicago Diner's sandwiches. I have had most of them and they have never let me down. If you go at dinner time or on a weekend you might have to wait 15-20+ minutes. Their waiting area is very small so you might be waiting outside... plan accordingly if the weather is bad. The last time I went it was very cold out so we all hopped over to a near by bar and had a drink while we waited. If you enjoy vegetarian dining or are just in the mood to try something different I highly recommend The Chicago Dinner! PS: The milkshakes are vegan and they will impress anyone!
