This is the way to celebrate your anniversary, Wow! Mastro's was unbelievable from the minute we walked in the door, and meeting the GM, until the minute we left! Fantastic service, great food and a fun time! I highly recommend this restaurant! Our waitress was so nice, helpful, fun and, out going. Let's talk about the food. First we started off with the incredible seafood tower, (could have been my dinner). Then, the wedge salad which was scrumptious and the French onion soup, out of this world! The main course was steaks that melted in your mouth. The two side dishes that we had were delicious, one gnocchi and the other lobster mash potato's! (who wouldn't love that)Ok, let's not forget about dessert. The butter cake was amazingly yummy, it came with a side of whip cream which was insane! (My husband was bummed we didnt take dessert home) ;)All in all this is worth the money. Be prepared to eat a lot of food and lovin every minute! Thanks again, we will be back. :)
