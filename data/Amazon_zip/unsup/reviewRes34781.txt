The sushi here is GREAT. I especially like the caterpillar rolls and the philly roll. The last time I was there, I was droooooooling over the honey roll that my friend ordered. This place is definitely a place to share sushi with others (I didn't ask for part of the honey roll, because my other friends were devouring it and I wanted the person who actually ordered it to have some). The only fault is this place is tiny. But they do delivery, so, score! But on the weekend nights, if you arrive before 6 or 7, there's little to no wait for a table. It's also byob, but there's a CVS a block away, so that's pretty handy.
