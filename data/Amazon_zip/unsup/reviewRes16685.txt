I nearly had a heart attack when I saw the daily deal they had for today. It was dun dun dun, "INDIA HOUSE"..... Give it up for Groupon... $20 for $40 worth of food. Me thinks yes-sir-re-bob! India house is the best or rather my favorite indian style restaurant. I've been to devon and people say they are the best but India House is something else all together. Plus, my bf says it's more cleaner to eat here than devon. I don't understand that but since he's indian, I'll take his word on it.  Their menu is quite extensive and at times it could be overwhelming. Too many names and too many things I haven't tasted. Hence, why it's good to try the buffet. I usually get the butter chicken and the lamb curry with a side of nann and rice. Even with that, there are tons of leftovers which I love. All the food is very infused and flavorful and maybe that's why I love it so much. But to everyone who loves Indian food, please come to India House... You will not regret it.  I'm now excited to try the lunch buffet that everyone is raving about and eat some palak paneer! Now to wait a couple of days before I can get my Groupon on!
