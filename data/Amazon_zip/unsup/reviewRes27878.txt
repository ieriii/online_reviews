With all due respect to Yelp-pro "Ed to the M," San Diego is NOT the Mecca of Mexican Food -- the San Antonio-Austin corridor is. I grew up there and live in San Francisco now. The Mexican food is pretty good here. Nothing like Tex-Mex, but if you like burritos, the Mission is the place for 'em. I was in Chicago to visit my sister and text messaged my buddy from San Antonio, asking if he had any restaurant recommendations. This guy is a serious foodie and a great cook. When he recommended Frontera Grill -- a Mexican restaurant in Chicago?! -- I was dumbstruck. it's all been said before, but the food is absolutely spectacular -- Chef Rick Bayless is a genius. The combinations of ingredients and tastes were just extraordinary. I've travelled all over Mexico, Central America and Spain and have never tasted ceviche like Frontera's trio. Ed to the M, no way this place is "El Torito with a fusion-y twist." Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm going back to Frontera.
