Better than any other bar/pub to have existed in this location. Hipsters can be overwhelming, their seating policies can be stupid. Last time I visited Chicago I went there twice: The first time we were not allowed to sit at table if only drinking - they were reserved for dinner and its was still 5pm and completely empty. The second time I was allowed to sit at a table and the staff was super friendly. What gives? Great selection of whiskey and beer. I liked the bone marrow. But, there is a strong presence of pretentiousness and douche-baggery.
