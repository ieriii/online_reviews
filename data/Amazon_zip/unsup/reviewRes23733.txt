Food was not very good and the service could definitely use some help. The flaming cheese was very salty. I like salty food, but this was not edible. I ordered the sea bass, and it was literally soaked in olive oil. I could only taste the olive oil and not the fish. Shame really because sea bass is such a great fish. My girlfriend also ate only a quarter of her order and couldn't take any more. Service was disappointing. Our server took our order and the next time we saw him was for the check. I cannot recommend this place, nor would I ever go back.
