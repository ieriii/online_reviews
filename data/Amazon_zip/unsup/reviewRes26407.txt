Probably more like a 1.5. The food was mixed. Some things were great (the bacon wrapped dates, as others have mentioned, and some of the cheeses), others were not (some mushroom thing, and the tuna). I would say that I really enjoyed 1 out of every 3 dishes. You would think that a good server would have helped us to better navigate the menu, but sadly ours did not. The service was horrible. We were a group of 9. 18% gratuity was included and we were treated accordingly. Our server was unfriendly and unhelpful. "Get the chef's selection" (at $65 a person) was her only real suggestion when asked to recommend food from the menu. When we declined and started ordering, she kept telling us we needed more. At the end of the meal we had way more than we needed and, if we had kept listening to her, we would have had 4 or 5 dishes on top of what we had left over. Ridiculous! At $70 a person, I expected a little more professionalism. Maybe she wasn't feeling well or something, I almost hope that was the case. In any event, I won't be going back. I bet you COULD have a good, or even very good, meal here, though, under the right conditions. But, at this price, the stars shouldn't have to align to get a great meal.
