Alliance Bakery is one of my favorite spots in Wicker Park; I love how laid back the vibe is, yet it also has a very authentic Polish bakery feel. Lucky for me, I live around the corner and I get to walk past the window display of beautiful cakes every day! Aside from the coffee, some of the stand out items are the spinach/feta croissants, and the cupcakes (love the carrot, strawberry, and red velvet). In the summer, Alliance has a great place to sit outside and relax on Division, while in the winter it is a nice place to stop inside and warm up. Plus, my dog, Olive, loves the fresh baked dog biscuits. UPDATE: I finally made my first visit to the seating area next door to Alliance Bakery and it kind of sucked. First of all, a cloud of dust surrounds you the instant your ass hits the cushion of any seat in there. And god forbid you open your mouth to speak: one of the hipsters in there will shush you over the top of his or her laptop. My advice? Take their delicious cupcakes elsewhere so you can actually enjoy them!
