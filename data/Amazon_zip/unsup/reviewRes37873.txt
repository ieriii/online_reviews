Ordered a Deep Pepperoni pizza- Lots of CHEESE! Ordered a Ten Inch for two people and it was VERY filling! It was super busy, the wait was about 20-25 minutes then another 15-20 after sitting down we got our pizza. The price was good, and the pizza was very good! I'd go back anytime! If you are in Chicago- This is the place to check out for pizza!
