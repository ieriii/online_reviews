I really like the stone, Mediterranean look of the dining room. I like the variety of the family-style menu, though nothing on it was that remarkable in either a good or a bad way. Good value, and the gyros and sliced lamb are good choices. Greek wine isn't available very many places, so it's also nice to try something new.
