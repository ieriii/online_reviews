Outdoor patio in the middle of winter? Initial response, curious. Turned out to be every bit closer to spectacular. This quaint little spot extended its space by creating a enclosed outdoor patio with fireplace and more. The food was good, the service was attentive, and the ambiance was truly a gift. Chorizo brochette was Delicious and assuming you like peppers (much like myself) this is one appetizer that is hard to pass up.
