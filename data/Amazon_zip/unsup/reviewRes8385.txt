A little of Fogo de Chao goes a long way. I don't feel the quality of meat here is that good, you are much better off at one of the familiar steakhouses downtown. The meat is very salty and they are always pushing the lesser quality cuts on you. Don't get me wrong, I have been here many many times and I am always full but I just don't feel good afterward. I do think the service is excellent, I love the team style they use and a manager is always coming around to see how everything is. The polenta is excellent as well, and is one of the highlights of the trip.
