Really good thin crust. At times a bit chewy. Have had about a dozen or so different variations between the red and the white pizzas. Really good toppings: sausage, giardinara, pepperoni, green pepper, spinach, and of course mushrooms. Anxious to try the pizza with clams to taste the east coast style that their pizza is modeled after. Enough about the Pizza - let's talk BEER: try 'em all and listen to your server if you have questions or are in the mood to try something unique. They will steer you where you need to be. All in all a great thin crust pizza place with a great beer list that can get a little loud, but when so many people in one place are enjoying themselves with friends & family what else would you expect? Only caution would be when you order their Pizza to go - it can get a little extra chewy (which some may like; i don't). If you've never been, what are you waiting for? Just go...
