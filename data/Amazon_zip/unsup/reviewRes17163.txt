good atmosphere, excellent service, average food. The food at this downtown location lacked in flavor. I have specifically asked them to make it spicy, which to my disappointment they didn't. not authentic at all. appetizers and the soup are really good, except for the Samosa. I am sure there is much better indian food in chicago than this chain restaurant. I will keep looking. devon street i am told
