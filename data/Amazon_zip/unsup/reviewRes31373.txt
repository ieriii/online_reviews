Great place! Drank and dined in the bar. It was busy with a great crowd to people watch. Sophisticated but very friendly people there and good music in the bar area. The wine list is extensive and has a variety of prices for bottles. The staff was friendly, attentive and not pushy. Food was amazing and good portion sizes. The filet was cooked perfectly and was delicious!!! I will be back soon!
