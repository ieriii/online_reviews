I might not be the best person to be writing a review on this place because I'm not a fan of Brazillian bbq in the first place. I know this is what people go there for, but it's very meat intensive, and having someone show up to the table every 30 seconds with a dead cow, lamb etc on a skewer doesn't really lend itself toward good conversation. The salad bar is awesome, though. If you're not into the bbq thing, I think you can get just the salad bar, which has a huge variety of food. Now, for the service--the guys who serve the meat are fast and do their jobs well, but the woman assigned to my party as a server was rude and dismissive. Pardon us for asking for water. The day we were there for lunch, the broiler broke down during our meal, so they couldn't serve any more meat. The manager gave us gift certificates good for another full meal on another day. When an African-American couple asked for the same thing from the same snobby waitress, she rudely denied them. Then the manager denied them the same courtesy that was shown to us. I'm not claiming to be a mind reader, but at the very least, the restaurant's behavior was unseemly and could easily be perceived as racist. I'm just sayin.'
