Saw that Glenn's Diner was being reviewed and just had to jump in. Lived behind Glenn's for several years...my back porch faced their kitchen door and the dumpsters that are on each side of the kitchen back door.At all times of the days, I would see the cooks and the wait staff come out the back door to smoke. They would haul dirty empty milk crates around to sit between the dumpsters outside the back door and on each side of the back door. During slow times they would go out and toss a football back and forth.Do they properly wash their hands when returning to work? I don't know. But I do know that the area directly inside the back door never looked very clean when I would cut through the employee parking lot. Were they smoking 15 feet from the back door...no, they were right outside the back door, sitting on the dirty milk crates they moved to sit on to enjoy a smoke and sitting in between two restaurant dumpsters.Personally, I like to know that restaurant employees do not contaminate their clothing by sitting between dumpsters, contaminate their hands by handling empty milk crates that have been out around the dumpsters, and smoking immediately outside the back door to the kitchen.At night I could sit on the back porch and watch the rats climbing over things to get into the dumpsters, so I would be very concerned about the cleanliness of the staff after sitting out there and touching things rats had been crawling on.It's worth the time to walk around to the back of the building to peek in the kitchen back door (which is alway open in nice weather) and view the close proximity of the dumpsters to the door and their seating arrangements if you are planning to eat there.Also, please note, as of a year ago when I moved, there was no rat flashing on the back door to prevent rats from finding a way to get into the kitchen area. Of course since they had plenty to eat from the dumpsters immediately outside the back door, that might not have been a problem.
