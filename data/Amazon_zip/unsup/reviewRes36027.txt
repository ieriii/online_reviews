BEST BREAKFAST EVER!! I can't get over the menu filled with so many creative, delicious food from omeletes with different type of ingredients to specials like tiramisu pancakes! Never even thought that could happen. And don't forget about looking at their drink menus, I don't know how we split a peanut butter shake with bananas but we did! Warning: Long wait. BUT: Worth it!! If you're gonna go out for brunch, you better have it good! It's the best way to start a day. Also, once you order, the food comes pretty quick. Nice strong coffee, and a busy place. They play annoying music though- had to mention it, we heard the techno song play for literally 15 minutes. P So I've been here for Valentine's day weekend and we got chocolate, interesting and fun. Today we got omelets with a kick of spice. You have to check out the menu: http://www.melicafe.com/ And the juice bar menu: http://www.melicafe.com/ I know there are tons of great brunch places in River North, but this is one of the top for sure! Can't wait to go back.
