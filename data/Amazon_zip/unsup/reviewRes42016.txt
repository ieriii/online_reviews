4.5 stars Gilt bar is one of my favorite places in Chicago! Food is surprisingly affordable for how trendy this place. (I saw Ivanka Trump here hehe). Dim, mysterious, swanky ambiance. Anyway an extra star for just how affordable it is! Also the drinks here are phenomenal! $12 hand-crafted cocktails. The bartender was so nice!!! Swooon~ Foodwise~ The bone marrow here is heavenly! Totally delicious and flavorful. Highly recommend! Gnocchi was pretty good too- great texture. I also enjoyed the beet salad (and I'm not even a beet fan). The truffle pasta was slightly underwhelming (truffled creamy spaghetti basically) but still quite a popular dish amongst our group. I feel that the dish has a lot of potential though. Pork belly and pot roast were both good- no complaints, cooked perfectly and very tender, but I'd prob try some other items on the menu next time.
