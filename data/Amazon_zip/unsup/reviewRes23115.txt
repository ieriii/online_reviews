Last winter, the guy I was seeing would always want to go here on Sunday afternoons. I didn't really like "Chinese Food", but I liked him, so I'd put up with it. In time, the place grew on me- the food was regularly good, the staff were regularly friendly and we were never rushed to end our lazy Sunday meal. Instead, they patiently waited for us to stop drawing pictures of each other's mothers on the paper covering the table cloths. When the plates get too messy, they bring a new one...and sometimes the tall woman waitress sings. Eric likes Dungeoness Lobster, I like dry chili beef, and cumin lamb. We both like the cabbage that comes out as an aperitif. It's been a little over a year since I first tried LSC, and sometimes, I get sentimental for it. Looking back, we've had some important times in that place. Maybe if he and I make it another year, we will have a party in the upstairs room where all the people we know, and all the staff who remember our order will come and celebrate with us. anyways. this place is nice. just dont go when its crowded.
