The set-up of this place reminds me of a 'hipper' Chipotle. I'm going to echo what everybody else has said about this place.  Yes, it's good food..... but am I the only person to think that the Cubana Torta had an ever so slight funny smell to it... like formaldehyde? (No, I'm not crazy - I haven't been around this chemical in years!)
