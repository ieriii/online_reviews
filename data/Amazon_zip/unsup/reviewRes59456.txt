We went to Giordano's on a Saturday evening. We had never been there but saw a large crowd and assumed it was good. When we checked in we were told we had a one hour and 45 minute wait. You can pre-order your pizza at the when you hit the hour mark. While waiting outside near the hostess, a foreign speaking couple approached and did not understand they had to go in the restaurant to place their name on the list. It was then a young man who was waiting behind me began to tell the couple to "get out of here, go away," because they had trouble communicating. I told him to leave them alone. Once I defended the couple, they young man turned his anger on me spewing vulgarities. The hostess, a very young woman, kept apologizing to me and contacted a manager. She explained what occurred to the manager, Robert who did nothing. He acted as if nothing happened, ignoring what had occurred to the Italian couple and what was said to me. The young man was forced in the building by his friend. At the hour mark, my husband went in to order his pizza the young man returned, stood at the door way and called me several "f" names. Again, the hostess went for Robert. My husband returned and I told him what happened. Robert was addressing the young man in the doorway my husband approached and told him he wanted this to stop. Robert and two other managers, proceeded to tell my husband to "stay outside and he will stay inside." Why we stayed I have no idea, but we did. I think we were both in shock. We were also concerned for the foreign speaking couple. The pizza was sub par, Lou Malnati's is far superior and the experience was horrendous. For an elderly foreign couple and a 50 year old woman to be harassed in front of management is outrageous. DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!
