This place is REALLY good. Cool atmosphere, fun but classy without being stuffy. Excellent for any occasion. Not exactly cheap, but not too pricey either, considering the quality of food. They've got a lot of shared plates which is nice too. Unbelievable wine selection with very knowledgeable waiters. I love this place; it's usually pretty packed though, so head across the street to the Wine Dive (or something like that) to wait out the wait.
