Went for supper club with the girls (4) of us. We were warned that the portions are large and we could probably share dishes. We were also warned to get there before 7. We arrived at 6:45 to get a nice table outside without a wait. About 15 minutes later, people were lined up the street sitting on nice little benches just outside the fenced off area drinking the night away as they were waiting for tables. DEFINITELY arrive before 7pm if you plan on doing anything else that night. We ordered the guac (yummy, but not the typical mexican guac that i LOVE) and then an empanada appetizer platter. I would recommend picking which ones you think you'd love vs. a sample platter. Some were definitely better than others. We also ended up sharing 3 meals instead of 4. But probably would have been fine with 2. We got the Bistec Tico which was delicious. Highly recommended so much that my friend who recommended this restaurant is having her wedding catered with it. Second entree was the Chicken Casado. I really liked the flavoring of the veggies and the mixed rice was delicious. However, the chicken was REALLY dry. I would try that with steak next time. Third we got the Milanesa. I thought that was just ok. For dessert we got the homemade bread pudding (i don't love baked goods but the girls liked) and an oatmeal chocolate shake which was, DELICIOUS. tasted like a potbelly cookie. Overall, I would definitely go back.
