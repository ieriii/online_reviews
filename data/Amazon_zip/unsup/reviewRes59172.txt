My boyfriend, daughter and I stumbled upon this place and we fell in love with it!!! The presentation of the food was incredible and the sushi was absolutely delicious. We were also pleased to see that the staff was "child friendly" as they recommended a dish my daughter may like...not only did my daughter love it but she asked for another order.We will definitely be coming back for more!!
