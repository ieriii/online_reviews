I liked this place- there just wasn't a love connection happening for me. Maybe it was their 45 minute wait on a Sunday morning to even sit in the place. Maybe it was the food that was good but wasn't extraordinary (although the side of hotcakes that we got was pretty close) maybe it was the level of noise in the place, or that I couldn't get a Bloody Mary (I did know this before we entered but a girl can still dream!). But all in all- I think Yolk did a good job in getting me most of what I wanted at a reasonable price- it just won't go on my list of revered brunch spots. I had the Eggs Benedict (my favorite and what I judge all brunch places on) which, while good, was just that. Nothing amazing and I didn't care for the potatoes that came with them. No amount of doctoring up got the potatoes to where I liked them. They were just eh. The best part of my breakfast? Sitting at the counter and watching the food move through. Man- these guys and gals are hopping to serve all those people who have waited. It was like a frenetic dance but impressive. The decor is modern and fresh. Street meter parking is available but know that they have those new meters where you get 7 min for a quarter and you have to pay every day. They will also validate in the garage down the street for $7 for 2 hours. If you can go early or on a day that is not a beautiful weekend day- then give it a try. The menu is varied, the servers friendly and the food- well- like I said- I liked Yolk. I just didn't love Yolk.
