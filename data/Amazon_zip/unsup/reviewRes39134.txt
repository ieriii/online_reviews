Yay yay yay! L&E actually lived up to expectations!!! I always get nervous when I finally have a chance to go somewhere that I've walked out of in the face of 2+ hour waits and heard SO much about. Is it really THAT good? In this case, yup! We went on a Friday night at 6 and only had to wait an hour. And they're willing to take your phone number and call you when the table's ready, so it's really not that painful. We went down the street for drinks since the L&E bar area is super squished, and the hour flew by. I have to admit, we got lucky and were seated in the back room. The front room would be pretty annoying with customers, waiters, and bar patrons crowding your table. But the food would still be outstanding, so you should go despite this risk. We asked the waitress to just bring out her favorites, since we'll pretty much eat anything. Some favorites were the fois gras that was on special - melt in your mouth amazing. That was followed up with more amazingness in the pig face, which I pretty much can't stop thinking about. Even the dessert, which we often skip, was fabulous. The menu changes, so these recommendations aren't super useful, but just know that out of the 5 or 6 things we tried, every single one was amazing. Oh, and the drinks are great too! Love this place!
