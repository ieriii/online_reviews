Mmm, me likey. I grabbed some Crisp to go before going out last night, and it was super. I had the "Jessica special" - 3 chicken strips. He asked me what sauce, and I said, "whatever is the least spicy." He nodded. He understood. He was a very nice man, and my food was ready quickly. Sweet. When I got to my destination and opened the box, I was a bit sad because it smelled really, really spicy. Meh. Not what I wanted prior to a night of drinking. It was also hot temperature wise so I let it cool down, but had already resigned myself to the fact that I probably wouldn't be eating it. But then I tried a little bite... and YUM, HOLY MOTHER OF YUM. It smelled more spicy than it was. Actually, the sauce was freaking perfection. The chicken was moist and delicious. Oh my yumminess. And did I mention they gave me 4 chicken strips, not 3? Nice. Though I only made it through 2 - Crisp is very filling! Good thing I didn't opt for the meal deal.... I sort of can't wait to go back here.
