My experience here can pretty much be summed up by the following words: Disorganized, kitschy. I work pretty regularly with the Four Seasons Hotel in SF, so truth be told my expectation level is set pretty high for service and ambiance, but honestly people. The decor was... loud. I actually didn't mind the design clusterf*ck nearly as much as my boyfriend did, but I can see why it hurt his feelings: hot pink, gray, and gold couches with copper tables, and gray geometric wall paper? Please. You either have Special Needs or you're as mentally unstable as a serial killer if you picked that out and thought it looked good. And the service. Oooh gurl: Our reservation was through Priceline or some other 3rd party vendor - so even though we called to let them know we were showing up past Midnight and they assured us that they'd keep our room for us, when our flight was delayed and we showed up much later the room was gone. Fine, whatever, we get it - always book through the hotel. But then they promised to move our luggage for us into a bigger room with two beds, and we show up in the new room and of course they didn't move our stuff. So we call them to explain. Someone in our party had the old room key (which still worked, PS) so we grabbed our stuff ourselves cause it was taking too long, and then like three doormen came by the new room, letting us know our stuff wasn't in the old room, and we explained every time to each new person. Just communicate! There were a few other times something similar happened, so all in all everything got done 2-3 times or not at all. The one redeeming quality? Free wine for happy hour.
