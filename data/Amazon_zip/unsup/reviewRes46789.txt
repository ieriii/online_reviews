Food was fair but not great. A bit let down on the price and portion sizes. Had the truffle mac and cheese and it was obvious they used truffle oil and way too much of it. Also ordered the only fish on the menu (aside from fish fry Friday option) which came with an over cooked chicken sausage, three mussels, and a piece of fish that was about an inch and a half by an inch and a half in size, maybe half an inch thick. While the taste was there with the fish, the sausage and mussels were just unnecessary filler - if only the fish portion were larger, it alone would have been wonderful. The plus was that the service was good and the hibiscus ginger ale was really refreshing. Those three items ran us about $50.
