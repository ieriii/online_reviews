Wait, what? VEGAN RESTAURANT? This is nothing new to me. I live with a vegan. Some my know him as my husband... My brother's wife is a veggie, too, and they recommended The Chicago Diner to us while we were visiting them in IL. After browsing their menu online, we decided it was worth the adventure on the L to check them out. (side note of excitement: Cubs game that same night so the energy on the train was great!) I could have easily just eaten the BBQ VEGGIE WINGZ and been 100% satisfied. But no. I had to go for more. Hubby got the Radical Reuben and it was fantastic. I ordered the Chicken Fried "Steak". HOLY CRAP. ALL of the food was absolutely amazing. Even carnivores would be pleasantly surprised. Taste, texture, all of it. Totally rad. I guarantee when we go back to Chicago, we'll hit up The Chicago Diner again. Better yet, howsabout you guys open up one in SF?!
