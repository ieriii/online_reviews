Doug is the best. 5 stars for Doug alone! Every time I go, I try and get a fancy sausage (one of the weekly specials: tequila chicken sausage with black beans or jalapeno duck and bacon sausage - with exciting toppings like mango salsa or gorgonzola cheese, respectively); and a regular hot dog. Until two trips ago, when I ordered the veggie corn dog for the first time and holy moly!!! I will never go back to a regular hot dog (though they are delicious as well). A friend of mine swears by the Don Rickles (and really, with a name like that, how could it be bad?) An old roommate of mine once got the rattlesnake sausage. I greatly enjoyed the Paul Kelly (bratwurst) on my first-ever visit. Are the duck fat fries better than the regular fries? You bectha. But don't feel bad if you don't wanna splurge - the regular fries are great as well. The only thing that could make Hot Doug's better is: 1) a location near work and 2) open longer hours or on Sundays On second thought, nah, it's perfect how it is. I don't need to gain 100 pounds. ;)
