I've been to this place before, in 2010, which is good for them because otherwise this would be a one-star review. The food is ok. Nothing truly mind-blowing, but it's good. The service on the other hand is terrible. There was 4 of us sitting together this past Saturday. We were one of the first people in the place, and given the choice we decided to sit out on the patio. We placed our orders and were the only table out on the patio. Soon the patio filled and we noticed that everyone on the full patio was getting their food and we had nothing, the waiter hadn't come over to let us know what was going on for a long time. After about 45 minutes people that were seated after us were done eating and paying their bill, getting up and leaving. Yet, we waited. When the waiter finally did talk to us he assured us "only another minute on your food, guys". About twenty more minutes went by and by this time people that were seated after those that had already paid and left were being fed. The hostess came over and assured us that our food was "on its way out". About 10 minutes later our food came and despite not being exactly what we ordered were were nice and too hungry to complain so we just ate what we got. Our waiter pretty much ignored us as we sat and waited and avoided coming to our table and when our food came he didn't even ask to see how things were until we were nearly done. The hostess then came by and gave us all complimentary half-glasses of lemonade. Too little too late. "Sorry that your orders took a little bit to come out". Her understatement and insincere sentiment did not help us. We arrived at 12:10 pm and left after quickly eating and paying at 1:45. Food was ok. Not worth that wait. I've never experienced service so poor.
