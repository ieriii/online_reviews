It is clich to say "It's the little things that count"... but consider this. The next time you are dining and the people next to you leave before you do. Usually there's a flurry of activity as they clean up for the next party. Frequently the choice of cleaner lingers. Yeah, a little thing right, Bad Apple picked the right cleaning agent and that matters to me. Oh the food? What of it? They specialize in burgers and to be honest one has to try real hard to do a bad job of this when they have quality meat, which they do. Here again, little things. They serve the burgers with really tasty fries that are not from the "Autofrench fry machine GT-2500." Their beer selection is extensive AND cheap. I can't guess what their angle is here and I am happy for it. All the beers on their menu could probably be a dollar or two more expensive and I wouldn't raise an eyebrow. I will be back to try the other burgers that I couldn't stuff in on my first visit because in addition to all the above we had a fantastic server.
