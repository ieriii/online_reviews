The Black Truffles made me feel as if I was dining in France. For some reason I never had them here before. The staff as always was impeccable. The ambiance was perfect. We have been gone to Alinea's for years. Alinea's is a nice pairing with the theater which is right by there. A great dinner and a show. Life is good
