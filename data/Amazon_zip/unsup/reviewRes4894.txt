Wow, a great all-around experience. Most of the plates were delicious. I would highly recommend the razor clams, the Pig Ears, and the Turkey leg. The pig platter is a nice starter as well. Presentation is outstanding but service could be a little more attentive. Also size of the restaurant causes waits to be somewhat long and difficult for bigger parties. I plan to return and try more plates!
