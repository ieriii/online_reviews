Great place. The food was pretty good and the prices were very reasonable. The interior was pretty cool and beautiful. All in all, it's a good place to go to from time to time. I didn't find the food to be anything memorable or that would make want to go back right away, but it was all very good. It will satisfy you at the very least.
