In a burg with 4000 or so bars, how does one distinguish oneself from all the others? I had the opportunity to see for myself the other night, and the luck to visit the Hour with a friend who works there. So kind of an insider's initiation, if you will. All I can say was it was a thorougly enjoyable experience. While not much of a cocktail guy, and pretty boring and rut-like in my cocktail consumption habits (traditional martini, scotch and soda, margarita,) I am a huge fan of flavors and flavor pairings, and anything that dances on the tongue. So I tried both the Juliet and Romeo (or was it a Joliet and Romeoville?) and the Dark and Stormy. The first was Beefeater, Mint, Cucumber and Rosewater. The second, Brugal Anejo Rum, Lime Cruzon, Blackstrap and Ginger Syrup. OK, so I had no idea about some of those ingredients, but my chum Tyler educated me. They were both tasty new and experiences for me. The ambiance, the vibe or esthetic I liked very much. It's classy, enthusiastic, sudued and intimate. And the postcard they have to describe the customers they want could be interpreted by some as a New Yorkish attitude: no baseballs caps, no Lite beers, and an actual dress and behavior code. Personally, I find it refreshing. As David Manilow from Check Please points out about restaurants, a place needs to know what it is. And sometimes that lack of identity leads to failure. Not true here. And those waiting in line on the way out attests to the success. The staff was pleasant and appeared to be enjoying the joint themselves. One price for all cocktails ($12.00) makes things simple. While I could'nt make this my neighborhood "hang," it's surely a great special occasion place. Great for dates, celebrations. But be mindful that they do not encourage large groups. If you don't like that, you can check out the other 3999 alternatives.
