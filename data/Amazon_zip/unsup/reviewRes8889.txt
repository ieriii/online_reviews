Once again.... my stomach is growling at the thought of this place!!! If you are in the Albany Park area and are hungry please please please eat here! I have been eating at Noon O Kabab since the place first opened up and have seen the business grow and flourish and I can understand why! The food, atmosphere, and did I mention the food is great!!!! Pros: The food, from pitas served with goat cheese and small turnips (which taste great), to the number of assorted kababs, to the fish served, and the dill rice that seems to meld and taste great with any platter, I cannot think of one thing that I think may taste bad! The prices are extremely cheap! My brother and I had recently treated our family (a group of 6) to a dinner, nay a kabab feast. We had ordered 6 meat kababs and one order of their salmon (which I highly recommend) and the total came out to be around 100 dollars! Less than 20 bucks a person! That's a deal! The service is always friendly, helpful, and they get the food out fast. Cons: Since Noon o Kabab is great... many folks know about the place and there may be a wait time if you just show up without a reservation. Parking also may be difficult to come by. But all in all please take a chance on this place, it's a must!
