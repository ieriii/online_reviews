The bomb biggity!! The whole menu is very exceptional and everything is delicious. I highly recommend their breakfast burritos. They are HUGE and a good item to share. The best Mango Margarita, i've ever had. Lot's of fresh veggies in most dishes. The atmosphere is festive and clean inside and they also have outdoor seating. I still haven't figured out their hours, they close sometimes in the afternoons for a couple of hours, so it's not a bad idea to call ahead and ask.
