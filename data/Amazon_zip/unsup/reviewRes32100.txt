I went to Sunda for the first time last night based on a friend's recommendation. When you walk in you are immediately impressed with the decor. Very cool setting. The menu has so many great options -- it is hard to choose! I ordered sushi and loved the freshness and quality of the rolls. I must say -- he had at least three people come by asking if we were enjoying dinner. The wait staff is extremely attentive! I would recommend Sunda and look forward to going back the next time I'm in town.
