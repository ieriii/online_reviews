This place is amazing...I am not sure what is up with the whale with the thong on its face but the pizza is heavenly! They bake their pan pizza in a cast iron pan so the cheese gets burnt on the bottom--might sound gross but its really good. The staff their is really nice and patient... I recommend getting garlic on your pizza it adds a little kick!
