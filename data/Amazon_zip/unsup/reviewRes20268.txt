i recently moved from sf to chicago and everyone in california seems to think that the sushi can't be as fresh here. i argue because no matter where you are in the US, your sushi is likely flown in from somewhere so i don't know why it would be any different in chicago. i always try the sashimi at sushi restaurants to get a sense of whether or not the fish is fresh, and coast passed the test. really fresh, buttery hamachi. i also tried a couple of rolls, most of which were good, except for the po' boy. i should have known better as this was likely some not quite as fresh fish fried and thrown into the roll... pretty mediocre. the rest of my experience at coast was great though. love that it's byob. good to eat: tempura veggies
