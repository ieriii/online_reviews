While the smattering of fruit flies at the beer taps entertained me with their acrobatic dance, even they weren't enough to distract me from the lack of fruitful service behind the bar. Waiting for a beer was a painful exercise in futility. I felt parched, as I watched my empty glass for what seemed an eternity as the barkeep cleaned glasses, checked her watch, chatted up other patrons....anything but refill my glass. It was as if I had become invisible.  Once a staff change took place, it was a different story. New drinks were poured before the last was empty. And they even offered to take my food order! The result was a tasty burger, cooked to perfection, topped with meaty bacon and delicious cheddar. The frog leg appetizer was equally delicious. Something like mini chicken wings, with a little heat, accompanied by whipped blue cheese. Yumm.
