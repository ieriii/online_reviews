Thanks to the Japanese for inventing sushi. Again, the best sushi I've ever had is in the upstate of South Carolina. Chicago has some great sushi places and some are a lot better than others, but I only know of one decent BYOB one in my area...Coast. My first time here was for my 23rd bday in 2007. Loved it then...was still in awe of the great city invention of BYOB. I've been coming ever since. Ebs B is right. The noise level is horrible, and it's hard to have an intimate dinner there; however, I've managed here and there. The sushi is fresh. Salmon sashimi is ordered every time I come as is the shumai. Spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls are good. The angry salmon is fantastically spicy, and I always devour those little chip things. Po Boy, White Dragon, Tuna Avo, Volcano, Spider, Dragon, those are favorites I always stand by. Rolls are kind of small but they're standard size for Chicago...(I come from SC, land of the oversized, and that includes sushi rolls). Pretty decent for the price you pay--I've averaged about $25-45 a person, but I can outeat a guy who is 5x my size when it comes to sushi. Staff is always friendly as well, maybe a bit slow due to the fact they're contantly slammed. I keep my trips to a Mon-Wed night now in order to beat the crowd. BYOB...can't go wrong. They're pretty strict with their bottle policy bc they get slammed so make sure you make reservations.
