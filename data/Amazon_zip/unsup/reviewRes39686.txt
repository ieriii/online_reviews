This is one of the best places to eat authentic Korean Food! My friend taught me what page of the menu to look into and I ordered my bibimbop for less than $10! It came in the traditional stone pot, steaming with all tons of rice and vegetables which were cooked perfectly! But wait, that's not the best part. For every order of food, they give you a load of side dishes. Actually its more of TONS of side dishes. They fill up your table with all sorts of korean kimchi ranging from the traditional napa cabbage, radish to spinach and seaweed! Very flavorful and can't be anymore authentic! Aside from the cheap eats in the menu, they also serve the traditional grilled short ribs, seafood pancake amongst other good eats. But I am very much happy to stick with my BIG bowl of bibimbop :) O yeah, don't expect much from the service. It can be quite erratic, sometimes they are in a good mood and there will be bad days for them. So if they are a bit abrasive on the service, just brush it off and enjoy your meal!
