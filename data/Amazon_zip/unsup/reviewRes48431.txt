This place is very cool. Such a lively crowd and great open space. Came last weekend with my husband...been wanting to check this place out for a while and so glad we came. I love the idea of a plate of pickled veggies, I love anything pickled, so we started with a plate of pickled carrots, Brussel sprouts, pickles, onions... My favorite small dish though was the Mushrooms with egg custard. Oh my goodness, it just melts in your mouth! Wagu beef was my favorite entree. I wish we had gotten two of those, but the lamb sausage was very good. The only dish that wasn't really for me was the kale. Everything else was amazing.
