I had a chance to stay here last night and it did live up to it's historical reputation except I think they need to do some remodeling. And I didn't like that fact that my TV was so far away from my bed. Or maybe it was my room since I had an upgrade and it was huge. By the way, sorry about the picture (having my bags there) and no, it's not a murse. It's my computer case! Anyway, not sure if I would pay another $350 a night to stay there although it's conveniently located. I just don't think it was worth it.  Nonetheless, it was a good experience.
