My second visit to Hopleaf was a difference experience than my first (although my wife isn't convinced enough to give it a second chance, calling it snobbish, pretentious, expensive and with a lackluster menu and quality to match.) Where on the first visit, the waitress was unhelpful and intimidating enough to allow me to screw up my beer order, the waitress on this visit was friendly and perfectly willing not to condescend when I asked her to describe the taste of mussels and very quick to offer suggestions on the pairing of a Belgian beer with them.As recent convert to a limited selection of seafood, eating mussels seemed like a long shot. But they were delicious, served in a white wine sauce with vegetables. And the Tripel (don't ask me what it was; I can't find it in the million-page beer list that I downloaded prior to the visit and studied assiduously) the server brought me was the perfect complement. And the mussels are served with fries with a nice garlic dip.For my entree, I had the brisket which had a wonderful smokiness to it (far better than the greasy yuck they serve at Smoque) with a great mustard sauce accompanying it. My friend had the duck reuben which he liked a lot. For dessert, we had the apple fritters, which were salty but tasty. My friend thought there could've been a couple of additional dipping sauces rather than the caramel one we had but having only one was okay by me.The kicker: for my second beer of the evening, I asked our waitress if they carried the Left Hand Milk Stout. (See my comments in DMK Burger Bar.) She said they did; but when she returned, she said they didn't carry it and had brought me a Falson's Lasko Milk Stout instead and since I hadn't ordered it she wasn't going to charge me for it. (It also wasn't as good as the Left Hand, but free's free.) That was something the waitress on my first visit would have cut her left hand off before doing.
