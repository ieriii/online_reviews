The tuna sambusa, my friend. Strange in theory, excellent in practice! And the sauce is amazing. All the dishes are great. I'm veggie, though, haven't tried the meats. The chickpea flour nuggets are so rich and delicious! And the beet salad is a wonder of garlic and lemon.  They did have a new maitre'd last time who was excessively friendly. My boyfriend is a little scared to go back because of him, but probably hopefully he was just nervous at his new job or had excessive amounts of ethiopian coffee (which looked neater than it tasted, but still cool that they have it!). I recommend the veggie sampler and the bedele beer. They also have music on weekend nights, which is a nice touch!
