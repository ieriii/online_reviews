I wish they would stay open just a little bit later. At least long enough so after you've had your fill at any of the bars in the area, you could stop in here for a refreshing bowl of pasta! A great alternative to the usual grease we are accustomed to. Pasta served up within fifteen minutes of ordering. Not bad. It could almost be called fast food pasta. I'm not crazy about pasta, but, of what I've tasted here, I like it. Parking is only on the street and usually hard to find.
