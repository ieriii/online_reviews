What an awesome take on pepperoni pizza. Completely covered in both small/thin and large/thick pepperoni slices, the pepperoni pizza at Fogo is a little bit greasy but a whole lot of awesome. The Margherita is equally awesome with wafer thin tomato slices and a healthy dose of flavorful basil. I am extremely excited to order some delivery from this place and try one of the myriad crazy pizza combinations they offer. Half off your second pizza? Methinks yes. Welcome to the neighborhood.
