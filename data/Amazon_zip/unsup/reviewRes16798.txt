This place seemed like a lively and fun place with all of its eclectic and bright decor. But it stopped there. The food was off the mark. { WHAT TO ORDER....It's only OK } * Ginger mojito - never had it before until I came here * Ropa Vieja (loved the plaintains and it was drenched in the spicy cheesy mayo sauce. Perhaps ask for just a little bit of the sauce or have it on the side) { WHAT NOT TO ORDER } * Trio of cerviche tasting (shrimp, mixto (yuck!), and tuna) * Guacamole - nothing special, bland * Churrasco - the grilled beef tenderloin was tough { ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE } Very open space with lots of funky decor on the walls. The staff wasn't as lively as the decor. Service wasn't anything spectacular.
