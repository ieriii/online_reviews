Feels like amtypical old school establishment, the ambiance is great.The menu is very varied and, on the advice of the waitress, we settled on crab. It was ok but not particularly special. At $150 for two with only one course and glass of wine i dont think the price reflected the quality. Another restaurant living off it's reputation but not delivering against it
