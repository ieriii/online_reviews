I thought this place was excellent, especially if you are looking for vegetarian dishes. I shared a veggie burrito with empanada and plantains on the side. We got here early enough that we didn't have to wait. But be careful...it does not get crowded. It's small so be ready to sitting right up to the neighboring table and hearing everything they are talking about.
