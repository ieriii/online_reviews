I think I can safely say this is the best Pizza I have ever had in my life! I have had other pizza in Chicago before, had really good pizza slices in NYC, had amazing pizza in California (yes I said it, California actually does have some very good pizza in certain areas) and plenty of pizzas all over the country. Pizza is always something I love getting everywhere I go because the pizza flavor, style and consistency differs so much from place to place. Giordano's really impressed me. This pizza is definitely living up to the stuffed pizza label, it filled me up on 3 slices....can I call them slice? It filled me up on 3 slabs!!! We had plenty to take back on the train with us, and I think it was almost as good heated up the next day as it was when we had it, thought not quite as good. This is the crispiest, thickest, most buttery crust I have ever tasted and definitely the largest pizza I have ever eaten. Good stuff, The Windy City rocks!
