I debated between 4 and 5 stars, but ultimately settled on 4 because I don't have much to compare my deep dish to. The last time I had Chicago deep dish was about 10+ years ago. Anyway.... We showed up a little after 6 on a Sunday evening Labor Day weekend. Busy. 45 minute wait for 2 people. But we spied 2 spots at the bar and took those instead of waiting for a table. Best decision ever. The bartender was AMAZING. He was so fun to watch, quick to respond to drink requests and so accommodating to the table drink orders as well as those of people waiting for tables. He was one of the highlights of the meal, seriously. The pizza was delicious. We got the SMALL special stuffed, it was MORE than enough for my boyfriend and I, and we took home 2 slices for leftovers. As I continue to explore Chicago I may have more of an opinion on this pizza compared to other places in town, but overall the experience was great and the pizza delicious, cheesy and unique to Chicago.
