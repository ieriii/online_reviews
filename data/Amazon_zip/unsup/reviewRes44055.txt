i like kinzie chophouse and frequent for lunch, but i do seem to have the same problems every time.  1) lunch takes WAY too long... restaurants that cater to 9-5 ers should be able to get people food FAST. 2) i always have to ask twice for oil/vinegar and parm cheese to compliment that delicious bread.   besides those 2 complaints, the food is great! i'm a vegetarian and recommend the wild mushroom risotto (from the SIDES, it's CHEAP too and is a pretty good size) or the mushroom ravioli
