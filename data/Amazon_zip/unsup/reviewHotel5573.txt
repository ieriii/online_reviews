Awesome hotel, right in the heart of Chicago. It's in a great neighborhood and everyone who works there is friendly and helpful. The coffee shop had wonderful scones and pain au chocolat, along with good coffee! The room was beautiful - nice art on the walls, well decorated. the bed was very comfortable, which is the most important detail to me, along with an affordable price. Highly recommend, and will definitely stay here again.
