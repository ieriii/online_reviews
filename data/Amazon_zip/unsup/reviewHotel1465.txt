I booked a 4 night, through the weekend, stay for my mother who was visiting from out of town. I know the area well and the hotel is definitely centrally located, walking distance to John Hancock, great stores and dining, and Millennium Park. It also appealed to me because all rooms are suites (which I assumed meant spacious) and the hotel has a pool. They assigned her a room on the 12th floor which had a horrific view of the building next door. Had I known it would be THAT bad, I would have definitely paid the extra $30 to get the room with a city view. I'm talking seal the window with bricks bad view. The living room area did not have a sofa but instead two armchairs, one of which did not have an accompanying ottoman. Website pictures made it look large and spacious but in reality that was not the case. Bedroom area was really good with enormous comfortable bed. Amenities: -Pool area was mediocre and filled with children when I went to take a look. -Also, the hotel has a complimentary car that guests can book during weekday business hours. A car was booked to take my mom to brunch - it was running late and she had to stand waiting with a friend on the ground floor area which had no seating. Her friend asked if they could just call them when the cab arrived while they waited in the seating area on the 3rd floor lobby. Hotel staff said they could not and admitted other guests had requested this service in the past. If the car booked is running late (fault of hotel) then it seems this is not too much to ask? All in all, I expected this hotel to be a great experience for my mom but was let down. Being the great mom that she is, she had no complaints, but I have a feeling if it were on her tab she would have had plenty ; )
