While it seems that most people who decide to sample the pleasures of Costa Rica's pacific coast wind up in Tamarindo, I prefer Playa Flamingo for that off the beaten track feel. I'm more of a sailor than a surfer, and I don't seem to relate to twenty somethings very well. Yes, I am getting older. And wiser, I hope!A client brought me to Irazu for a casual working lunch and I was instantly transported back to a tumbledown cafe halfway between Daniel Oduber International Airport and Sardinal, on my way to a memorable tryst in Playa Flamingo. Ah, love's labors lost!Affairs of the heart may like a candle burn brightest before they expire, but the appeal of an Irazu oatmeal shake may be eternal. Ditto for the grilled plantains. Within the coarseness of its origins lie a complexity of textures and flavors best enjoyed with an intimate companion. As with Playa Flamingo, I hope to return to Irazu some time soon!
