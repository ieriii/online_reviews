Honestly, this place has the best chicken wings I've ever had! And I like to call myself somewhat of a fried chicken wing connoisseur. The skin was pure perfection, crispy and thick. And these are not your typical wings you'd find at Bdubs, they are HUGE. I believe my friend and I tried the Seoul Sassy (garlic soy) and Crisp BBQ sauce. The Seoul edges out the BBQ by a slim margin. I honestly can't say enough about the wings, just let the pics speak for themselves! We also had to try the Baby Buddha Bowl while we were there. Very simple and refreshing. The veggies were crisp and lightly seasoned and the rice was cooked to perfection. It was hard to switch back and forth from the bowl to the wings...they were both just so good! My only grip with Crisp is the layout of the place. There's only a few large communal picnic-looking tables and they're sort of uncomfortable. Once you take that first bite though, you'll soon forget where you're sitting! I can't wait to come back here!
