Pibil: wood-roasted suckling pig with achiote, black beans, pickled onion, habanero salsa $12.00 (Almost $14 w/ tax) In other words - Torta from heaven. Eat it with the habenero salsa and it's the torta from hell. I've been here twice. The first torta i'd had was unmemorable (Chicken tinga) and the bf's torta got soggy in the soup (ahogada) but I love the Pibil. Crusty crunchy bread toasted to perfection. + Wood-roasted suckling pig was pretty much mexican pulled pork. Dreamy, succulent, moist and flavorful. + Mashed black beans offers a creamy texture + Pickled onion adds colors and a tart little kick + Habenero salsa that will put your lips on FIRE!!! I didn't believe it when warned on 3 separate occasions this was Hot stuff. Now I know better. The 30 minutes wait was worth it. The sandwich was the most expensive I've ever eaten. Once in a while treat, yes!
