I haven't yet experienced Zed 451 ordering from a menu, but rather went here for a holiday party. I was pretty impressed with how well the meat was done and how tasty all the other components of the meal were. The atmosphere is pretty cool in itself. It has a very chic feel to it. It's a two story restaurant with the upper part for parties, I presume. When we sat down, they first served jalapeno corn bread with some butter. It was quite delish. If I hadn't been saving room for meat, I would have been content to eat several of the little poppers. On that note, their sides were all not bad at all. They had this yummy mashed potato dish that I would have been quite happy to eat as part of my meal, had I not been really set on eating a lot of meat. And the meat was good. They had a large assortment from beef to chicken to pork to lamb to fish to venison. I am not a fan of venison so I did not like that one, but enjoyed all the other ones. They were also less salty than the comparable dishes at Texas de Brazil. I would return to Zed for sure!
