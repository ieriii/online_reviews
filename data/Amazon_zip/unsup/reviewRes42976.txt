If you are looking for great cocktails, festive atmosphere along with solid food offerings this is a must staple. Yes cocktails are on the higher end, however I guarantee you will never have a more properly made beverage. Nice to go early to check out the bar before dinner. Did not go to bar downstairs, although it did look nice. For those that do not like to eat/drink in the dark, it might not be your scene. Overall, I think the quality is better than most places at higher price points.
