So I made reservations for 2, looking forward to a very romantic date, and ended up being seated at a convertred 4-top which they split into two 2-tops 2 inches from each other. The person seated next to me (other couple) was twice as close to me as my date across the table. I heard their conversation more easily than I could hear my own (and I imagine vice versa). When I POLITELY AND DISCREETLY asked the host for a table for 2 people, the host, visibly agitated at my audacity to desire a romantic dining experience with my date, quite rudely replied that it would be another hour wait (I knew better, and called him on it - he stammered and stumbled but wouldnt' reseat us). Plus, he knew what I was going to ask for before I even asked, which indicates I wasn't the first to have a problem with this. Granted, he did apologetically come up to our table 5 minutes later and offer to seat us at a better table if one came available, apparently recognizing how inappropriate his earlier behavior was (SORRY BUDDY, too little, too late, and another admission of guilt). Needless to say, we weren't re-seated in spite of the fact that half the restaurant opened up within the next half hour. Plus we were seated right next to the kitchen - I can't tell you how many times I was bumped by the waitstaff running by. The table was small and was unable to handle our dinners and a bottle of wine. I had to carefully navigate all night just to keep from knocking something over. How can ANYBODY enjoy a romantic dinner at "the most romantic restaurant in Chicago" under such circumstances? ADVICE TO GEJA'S - Don't take reservations for 2 at a time when you don't have a table for 2 available just so you can cram more sardines into the can. I would much rather have had reservations a half hour later and actually ENJOYED my dinner. If you get a good table, you'll enjoy this restaurant. However, this isn't a given so DINE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
