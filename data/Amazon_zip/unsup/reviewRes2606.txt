have been here a few times and tried many different items. most of the time i usually get a few of the specials and share them with whomever i'm eating with. the last time i went we got about 5-6 dogs between the 3 of us and the regular fries. i remember a lamb and shrimp sausage and the foie gras dog. the others were tasty but i just can't remember what they were. i can recommend their corndog too, tasty! i don't usually order from the regular menu because i think it's a waste if you are going to hot dougs to order a chicago dog with the works (exception being the corndog). i can live without their regular fries, but the duck fat ones are delicious. don't think a place like this exists anywhere else and i'm glad anthony bourdain out it on his chicago episode. hope the lines don't get too long b/c of it :)
