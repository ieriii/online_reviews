I was looking for a good Korean BBQ place by me and this place came up. The food was ok...but the service was terrible. The bi bim bop was bland. The portions are on the small side...I find this to be typical for most Korean BBQ joint. I think after trying so many Korean places...I'll just marinade my own beef and make my own Korean BBQ. The only thing I like is that they have many different side dishes.
