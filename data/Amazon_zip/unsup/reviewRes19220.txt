After dinner at Frontera, we decided to go to Xoco for dessert. The churros were delicious - still tasted fresh at 11pm. The spicy hot chocolate was so thick you could almost chew it. In fact, it left little brown stains all over my gloves and my boyfriend's leather jacket for a week afterward... totally worth it!
