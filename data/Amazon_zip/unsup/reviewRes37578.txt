So many beers! Such good food! I've been frequenting the Hopleaf since 2001 and I've always loved that place. When I first started going there, it was just a bar, but a few years after they opened up a restaurant in back. GREAT MOVE! The selection of beer is amazing. If you are into beer, you have to come here. It gets way too crowded on the weekends, but I think that's unavoidable...
