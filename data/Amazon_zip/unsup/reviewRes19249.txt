My food here was awesome and there is a ton of vareity on the menu. I had the celery root puree and duck confit which was so pretty it was hard to eat (not really since I ate the whole thing). I love the fireplace and green glass tiles on the walls. Our server was very friendly and didn't mind splitting the checks. If you're going for lunch on a workday, plan to be there 1.5+ hours.
