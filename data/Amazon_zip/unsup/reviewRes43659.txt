I've been to Milk and Honey twice for brunch. I love that you can pay in advance, so you can sit and chat as long as you like and not have to worry about paying for the bill. The food was excellent as well. Yes the line is long, and it's tough to get a seat, but that's the case almost anywhere you go when it's lovely outside. So why the three stars? There's this hostess. I didn't catch her name, but she had dark brown, long, frizzy hair. I was in line with a friend, and noticed a table open up outside. As is usual strategy when this situation occured, I gave my friend the order, and went to hold the table. This particular hostess quickly intercepted me, and wagged her finger, saying "I don't think so. There's a waiting list". Now I understand that in the Wicker Park/Bucktown neighborhood sometimes manners and tact can be checked at the door, but to have some 18 year old hostess chastizing me in front of the entire patronage of the cafe was downright embarassing. Shame on her.  My recommendation: Go here, enjoy the charming experience, avoid the nasty condescending hostess.
