BED BUGS!!!APPEARS very clean and just old, BUT I only stayed ONE night after prepaying for THREE because i was bitten so severly. I wish I could upload a picture of my arm (the one that was under my pillow while I slept). Only laid down for 5 hours! I should have been wary when on their website they stipulate NO REFUNDS FOR ANY REASONS - it's because they probably know what is happening. I showed my arm to the front desk clerk, and she did not appear suprised at all. Said she would "Contact the maid" !!! Really, the maid, for bedbugs?!? Unbelieveable.DO NOT STAY
