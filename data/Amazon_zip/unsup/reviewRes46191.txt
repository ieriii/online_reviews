This place hits the spot when I'm looking to drown my sorrows in comfort food carbs. Their hot bread and butter is heavenly. The reason I am knocking points off is that it does not take reservations, which kind of sucks since I am always trying to go with a rather large party, meaning you have to wait til every single last person gets there and put your name down and wait...and wait....bummer because I do like the food. The chicken royale is heavenly, as is the chicken pot pie. I'm not too impressed with the pastas, however, so I'd leave them for Rosebud, down the street. Their deserts are so yum. The beignets are SO decadent. The servers are obviously well trained but sometimes I feel like the person talking to me and telling me about their large portions is not a human, but a waiter-bot!
