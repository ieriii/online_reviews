Everywhere I go for brunch, I always order to the same thing....eggs, bacon, and potatoes just to compare ingredients and taste. This time was no different. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large. The flavor was mediocre however. Nothing stood out. My friends ordered the lobster sandwich and french toast. They were pretty happy with their dishes. The decor is very busy. There's not a spot on the wall that doesn't hold some type of picture, menu, or cereal box. The service was okay. She did check on us once during our meal which I do appreciate. This place can get pretty crowded so I would recommend making a reservation.
