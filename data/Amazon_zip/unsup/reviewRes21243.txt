Totally over rated and WAY not worth $13+ for 2 hot dogs and a small root beer. I ordered 2 original Superdawgs and 1 with fries. Both dogs had the consistency of a Polish Sausage and were very greasy - if I wanted a Polish I would have ordered a polish, but I wanted a good hot dog and that is not what I got. The fries COULD have been good because they were the old fashioned ridge cut, but they too were nothing more than a clump of grease. The Root Beer, however, was excellent - Hey hey! I cannot understand all the raving reviews - but as I've said before, people get caught up with the atmosphere and I guess the nostalgia, which is why places like The Olive Garden still survive today. You can get a better hot dog almost ANYWHER in Chicago and pay a lot less. If you are a tourist or have never been there, go take a picture of the place (like so many people were doing last night) then go to Gene and Judes, Portillos, or almost any little joint on Motrose, Harlem or Addison - trust me, it will be far superior than Superdawg and you will still have enough money left over to pay your bills..
