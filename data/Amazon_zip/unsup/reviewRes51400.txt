Man, was this place overrated on Yelp! Portions were small for the price, and I just wasn't impressed. I keep thinking there's actually a decent Mexican place on the "North Side", but this is not it. It's not bad, just not good. I had standard tacos- chicken, with avocado and cilantro only- and rice and beans. The serving of rice was small and it was blah and the beans were really thick and greasy. I'm a rice and beans freak, and these did not meet my standards. Plus: the chicken wasn't greasy and the portions of it on the tacos were generous. However, whenever a "Mexican" place has fajitas on the menu, it automatically loses a star. Fajitas are Tejano! Not Mexican! Oh, and since it's obligatory in the US to serve chips and some kind of salsa in Mexican joints, please don't give me pico! Granted, this was at least a fresh (but lame) pico. Gimme some chipotle salsa, some red, some orange, some avocado. Please!
