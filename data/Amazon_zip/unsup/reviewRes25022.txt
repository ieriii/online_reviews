I like Geja's. I've been close to 8 times. It's definitely an every-once-in-a-while thing for me. But I do put it higher above Melting Pot for several reasons. 1. It's not a chain. Automatically I like it more. 2. It's got history, a feeling, a vibe, romance. That, you just can't get with the kicking and screaming tots and families at a place like Melting Pot. 3. The restaurant itself is cut up so that you feel intimate. It's not wide open, people are right next to you, but you don't really notice... Moving on. The food is good. It's not out of this world, but it's good! I would highly recommend this with 4 or more people. It's a very fun interactive date or celebration night. The conversation won't reach a lull because you're too busy trying to fish out the meat or mushroom that is floating around alone in the oil! The sauces are a must. Do not put anything in your mouth immediately, 1. because it's hot, and 2. because you must dip it in 1 of their 8 great sauces. Truthfully, I don't love their chocolate... and I do like almost everything dipped in chocolate... so that's a bit odd for me. Luckily, I'm busting out of my dress by the time it hits that part of the meal anyways, that I can try to take it easy on the chocolate. Overall, is it expensive? Yes. Should you go with some sort of coupon that is always floating about online or in the mail? Always. Is it worth a try? Definitely.
