Two stars because: 1) Two of their best beers were not available and this is the second time this has happened to me. 2) Tried 3 pizzas and didn't love any of them. Buffalo chicken and Chorizo were too spicy, and the Mushroom was too rich. 3) Tried the pork belly watermelon app. I didn't know the pork belly was going to be fried - it takes more like pork rinds than pork belly. Service was great, though, and the beers we did get to try were good.
