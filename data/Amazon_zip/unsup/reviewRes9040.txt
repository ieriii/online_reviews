I have no idea how this place has so many stars. There are much, much better Persian restaurant in Chicago. (See Semarimis right down the street). The service was good, but the food was average at best. We had the eggplant appetizer which tasted pretty good, but had a strange texture. Our main meal was chicken and steak kabobs and they were terrible. The chicken was dry and seemed like it had been cooked 4 hours before we showed up. The only saving grace of the meal was the dill rice. I will not be going back. This was not worth the prices on the menu.
