Wow. It's amazing how far a "name" will get you. Didn't think it was possible for a hotel to get away with such terrible service in a highly competitive market as the Chicago hotel market. These people really could give a rat's ass about their customers. From wait staff, to security, hands down worst service I have ever experienced, and I have stayed in hotels all over the world. Trust me when I say, the Holiday Inn Express a few blocks away destroys them in service and accomodations. In terms of the actual hotel. Extremely dated and cheap looking. Probably considered classy during the Nixon administration. Thin walls. Crappy furniture. Funny smelling carpet. Laughable elevator bank with an Atari game-looking elevator indicator screen (no offense to Atari). Clientele - old (ancient) money and white trash. weird combo for sure. Stay away. If you are going to spend that much money, do yourself a favor and stay at a hotel where they give a damn.
