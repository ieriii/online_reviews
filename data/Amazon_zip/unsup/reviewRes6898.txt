Very solid neighborhood Italian. Grew up blocks away and had never really even noticed this place until I came across it while browsing on Yelp. It's nothing fancy inside, sort of unfinished floors by the front elevated platform and pretty basic. But the food was really, really good. Started with the avocado crostini and it was terriffic. The presentation on the caprese was great- though I shouldn't have ordered tomatoes in winter....just aren't great this time of year. Was impressed with the home made pastas and the portions were huge. They didn't skimp on the seafood in a pasta special I had...was loaded with shrimp, calamari, and other good stuff. They have a very decent wine list that includes a reserve and grand reserve list and everything is fairly priced. It's not an elegant place like Spiaggia, Picolo Sogno, etc...but it's more your everyday Italian. I enthusiastically recommend the place!
