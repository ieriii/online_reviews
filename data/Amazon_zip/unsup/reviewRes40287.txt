This place is P.I.M.P. That big of a whiskey and bitters selection will keep me coming back. Also the food was pretty awesome, albeit expensive. Worth it though. I'm still a little perplexed how every decent place in Logan Square now has lines out the door 24/7. I hate waiting on corners for food. These places turn me into a trollop.
