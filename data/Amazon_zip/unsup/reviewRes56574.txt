My husband wanted to go to the new (well, newer) Mastro's here in Chicago for his birthday since he's a huge fan of their location in Scottsdale. We arrived a few minutes early, and were politely asked by the hostess to wait in the bar until our table was ready. The place was packed and it seemed no one was in a hurry to finish their meals. No big deal - but after a 40 minute wait, we were just a little annoyed - not to mention hungry. Luckily, we had an awesome server to make it all right. Emily came over as soon as we were seated to tend to our drink orders, find out how familiar we were with the menu, get our take on the appetizers, and then insist on bringing us not one, but two, on the house. We had the ahi tuna and the crab and both were fantastic. I would have been happy with just that and my huge martini. Our entrees were excellent as well - actually, my husband says his porterhouse was the best steak he's ever had. And to top off the night, Emily had gotten wind that it was Jake's birthday, and because we were too stuffed to eat any more, packed up a special bag of their famous butter cake, ice cream, whipped cream, fruit and syrup - again, on the house! This dessert is to die for!! I had to dig into it on the cab ride home. We loved Mastro's, and a huge thanks to Emily who made the night perfect!
