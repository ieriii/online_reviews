I liked Piece's concept (craft brews and tasty pizza), but I didn't understand the hype of this place. The pizza itself was good, but not particularly memorable. The crust was a little chewy, and the toppings were not as generous as expected for $2 per topping. The beers were okay, but not exceptional like some reviews will make you believe. The service was good and it's a cool scene inside, but I don't see a great reason to continue coming back, particularly given the long wait time for a table.
