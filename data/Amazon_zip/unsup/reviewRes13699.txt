My visit started out with my wife and mother in law having a rude run in with the owner (yes, the owner). They did not see the "please use other door sign" and entered the restaurant. The owner gave them a dumbfounded look and asked if they were waiting for a table and pointed them to the other side of the restaurant about 10 feet away. Another waiter came up and apologized for the owner's attitude. Really! Not sure how a place like this survives with such a huge menu with such a variety of fresh fish. I had the shrimp po' boy and others at the table had some brunch items and a salad. My sandwich was great but very messy. The waiter was very friendly and we got in an out in about 50 minutes. Nobody in our group left feeling like this place was on their return list. I would give it another chance to try some of their fish. I think i would have to live within a few blocks to make this a regular spot for me.
