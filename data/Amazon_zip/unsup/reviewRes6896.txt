Very pleased with the service and atmosphere. Crowded on a Thurs night, and we weren't seated until 20 min after our reservation, but Q gave us a sincere apology and 2 free apps, which more than made up for the inconvenience in my mind. Had a good beer/wine/cocktails list. As far as the menu, I was a huge fan of the shrimp and grits, and the pulled pork. I'm normally not a big fan of South Carolina mustard BBQ sauce, but thought that Q's was really good. Everything else we had (fried green tomatoes, St Louis ribs, other BBQ sauces) were solid and hit the spot. I'd definitely return to Q for my next BBQ craving.
