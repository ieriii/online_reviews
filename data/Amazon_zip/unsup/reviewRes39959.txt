Absolutely horrific service. MY FIRST TIME BEING KICKED OUT OF A RESTAURANT!!! I went into the restaurant to attend a birthday dinner. Our party had 18 people in total. As we were waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, the waitress repeatedly came to our table and asked if we were ready to order. When everyone arrived, the waitress asked, "Is anyone Korean here? No one is Korean? Do you know how to order?" I found it very insulting. Her tone was not very nice. Anyway, we started to order and yes, we did not order much. We order about 4 kalbi, side dishes, and beers. The waitress said, "No, you have to order more." We told her that we would order more food later. She replied no. I don't think she even understood what we were trying to say. She kept telling us to order more food and when we kept saying that is all we want for now, she left our table to talk to someone. She returned to our table and told us they cannot serve us. She gave us the bill for the beers that we have ordered. I understand it is hard to do business when there is a large party and they do not order much. However, it is extremely wrong to kick someone out of a restaurant because they did not order a lot of food. Restaurants usually charge extra per person if that was the case. This restaurant did not even bother to charge us extra. They just told us they could not serve us. In addition, I felt the waitresses are very racist. A majority of my party was Chinese. They did not take time to take our order, they were extremely demanding, and their tone of voice was not friendly at all. I will never return to this restaurant and I hope you will think twice about going. No one deserves service like this.
