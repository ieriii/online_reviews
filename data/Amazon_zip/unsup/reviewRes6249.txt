Great restaurant...good food (the salads/fish/non red meat options are actually quite deLISH) and even better ambience. It's like stepping into some 1920s period movie...Wildfire is dark and woodsy, and makes me just want to order a great glass of merlot, sit back, and pretend I'm an oil baron. 4 stars for decent food and great atmosphere.
