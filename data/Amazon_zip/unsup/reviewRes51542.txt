I have a love-hate relationship with Garcia's. I've been going there since my wife and I lived a couple blocks away several years ago. The food has always been hugely abundant and tasty and an amazing value for the money. The salsa is always fresh-tasting with just the right amount if cilantro. The chips are warm and fresh-tasting and not too oily. BUT, the service is almost always AWFUL! I know this sounds terrible, but I always feel like I'm getting the "gringo treatment" here. Long waits to order, disinterested waitstaff, empty water glasses awaiting refills, nearly accurate orders, etc. But like I said, I can get stuffed here for well under $10 a head so I'll continue to return...however reluctantly.
