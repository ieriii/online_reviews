First..you will have to wait to get a seat..but it is definitely worth the wait! I recommend coming early (5-ish) and be prepared to stay awhile.  The service, was amazing. Nico, was our server, and he couldn't have been more educated about the food or more charming. He gave fantastic suggestions & didn't hover! The food, awesome! We started with the roasted almonds soaked in pork, then dived into the Mussels, Pork Shoulder, Bone Marrow Spread and Pigs Tail. All were cooked perfectly. Full of flavor! They have an amazing wine list with choices from all over the world. A huge bonus for any of you that love your wine! The only downfall, was it is communal sitting in the majority of the restaurant. At first you will be a little hesitant but once you start eating & drinking, you don't even realize where you are sitting! We will definitely be back!
