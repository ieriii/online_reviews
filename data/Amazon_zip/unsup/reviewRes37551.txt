This place became my home away from home while visiting Chicago. Wonderful selection of artisan foods, beer, wine and more. Their bistro attached has some great soups and sandwiches. I had to get the melted cheese sandwich with tomato basil soup. I grabbed a great split of prosecco another evening with some salted caramels and was in heaven. I even brought back goodies for my coworkers from this place. Go, shop, dine, indulge!
