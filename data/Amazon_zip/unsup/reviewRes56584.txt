I've lived in Chicago for over a decade and pride myself on knowing good spots to eat out. Mastro's is by far the best steakhouse in town! From the drinks to the entrees, there isn't a single flaw on the menu. Seafood and meat eaters alike will be thrilled with their options, and no dish disappoints. I ordered the petit filet and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. (big fan of gibson's -this was WAY better!) my husband ordered the bone in filet and loved it - had plenty to take home for lunch or dinner the next day.) love that their salads are big enough to share we split the Spicy Mambo, Like a ceasar salad packing a punch,and were very pleased. Gorgonzola Mac & cheese and creamed spinach sides are noteworthy...and though no one had room for dessert, we just had to try the butter cake....mouth still watering, it was THAT good. Our server, Nathan,was fantastic, and the rest of the staff - impeccable. Even received a phone call the next day thanking us for dining with them. Simply put - this place is worth every penny for a special night out, celebration, date, business dinner, or if you're just craving a fabulous meal. You will not be disappointed.
