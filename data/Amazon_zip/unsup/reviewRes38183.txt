OK this is not meant to compare against all Pizzerias just the ones that specialize in Chicago deep dish. I gave them a 4, the only reason they did not earn a 5 was parking is a hassle, and the line for this place can be terribly long. Being that this is located in downtown Chicago this is to be expected, and although this may not be Giordano's fault, its still a hassle for customers to eat there. We ordered the anti-pasta salad and a deep dish sausage pizza, service was great food was excellent. This deep dish is a very cheezy deep dish so take that into account when eating there. The crust has a nice buttery flavor to it very good. About two slices is all that is needed for one person, prices are ok. I highly recommend to put in your order right when you arrive as deep dish takes a long time to bake. Alternatively, Giordano's is in a few locations, I would recommend eating in Naperville as parking is much easier to find.
