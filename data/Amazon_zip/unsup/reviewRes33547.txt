Sultan's is a great place to get something cheap and different for lunch when you don't feel like doing Panera, etc.  I introduced my roommate to this place a month ago, and he's already eaten there two more times without me. The falafel sandwich is a great value, only $3, and I think and the chicken schwerma (sp?) is good too. As a side note, if you order your falafel "spicy", it really isn't all that spicy. Sultan's has an outdoor patio open when the weather is nice and street parking isn't all that bad either.
