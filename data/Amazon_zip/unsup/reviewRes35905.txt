This place is special. When I lived in Chicago, I used to go here about 3-4 times a month for Beijing duck and Yang Chow fried rice (and other delicious things). I recently moved to San Francisco hoping that there would be something similar. Nope.  I had reluctantly moved to Chicago and I can't imagine what my life would have been like without Sun Wah. You will have hard time finding anything like this restaurant anywhere in the US (Boston, NYC, SF included). The Beijing duck treatment for $37 can feed 4 normal people (comes with a full duck, buns, duck soup, and duck fried rice) and the taste is absolutely unbeatable. When there are bigger groups, I get the roast anything (duck, pork) and a Yang Chow fried rice. Other dishes are not bad, either. The quantity is very good, too.  Enjoy while you can! I certainly no longer can :(
