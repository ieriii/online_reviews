Great restaurant. I love the hip/casual waiters. Very knowledgeable but young and fun and relaxed--not at all snobby. We all had the 10 course prix fixe menu and it was great! Standouts were the fois gras lollipops with pop rocks (which are an add-on for an additional charge), the waygu beef first course and the chicken with dirty rice. I do have one negative comment, and that is regarding both fish courses. We had the halibut with leek brandade and the salmon with blis roe. Both were quite bland. Very surprising given how tasty every single other course was. But overall a wonderful evening, very good food and service.
