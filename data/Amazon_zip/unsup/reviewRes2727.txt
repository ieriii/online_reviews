My husband and I truly enjoyed dining here. The food was very good most notably the lobster and the pumpkin patch dessert which incorporated foie gras. The tables were placed far enough from each other to ensure privacy which was much appreciated as I'm used to cramped surroundings when dining at restaurants of this caliber in the Bay Area. The staff were very attentive the sommelier stopped by towards the end of the meal with dessert wine compliments of the house because he had enjoyed our company so much. How nice is that! Will return on my next visit to town
