1st time going tonite - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans, Burrata Pugliese with Peas, Radish, Celery, Spring Micro Greens & Aceto Balsamico, Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs everything was amazing. i think i loved the deviled egg, bone marrow, and salt roasted beets the best.
