No, I did not stay at the W but how rude are these human beings. I asked, what I believed at the time to candy of my eye, if should could help me with a room reservation that I was apart of. She turned into a demon man, saying I wasn't on the reservation, which could of been solved by the use of the W's phone, which couldn't be accessed by my hands. So, please if you could go to any hotel, go there...not the W!
