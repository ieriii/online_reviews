I have only lived in Chicago for half a year, and in the south suburbs for a year before that, but I've visited friends here for longer, and this is our go-to place. It is also where I take people who visit Chicago and want deep-dish pizza. In the rare cases where they don't want deep-dish pizza, I use enhanced interrogation techniques on them until they do, then I take them to Pequod's. This pizza never fails to make me happy. I learned to love giardiniera here, and I learned to love caramelized cheese crusts here. The non-caramelized crust parts are also great, as is the sauce (some of my friends say it's on the sweet side, but I love it). Their salads are great too, but that's not the point. Go here. Eat the deep dish. Become happier. If you can, try the lunch special. It's one of the best food deals anywhere.
