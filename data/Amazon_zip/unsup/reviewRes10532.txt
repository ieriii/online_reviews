Best Italian in the city, hands down. Authentic Italian with highest quality ingredients. Right portion size, Not overly fussy. Pasta, pizzas, apps, salads, fish, deserts -- everything is great. Did I mention the most beautiful garden dining in the city. Beautifully landscaped and walled off but without that claustrophobic feeling at many other restaurants. This is probably the best restaurant in Chicago, taking into account value, ambience, convenience, food quality and service.
