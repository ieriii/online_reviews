at the time of my stay, they were doing some major renovation to the place. so i felt a little cheated for not having able to experience what it had to offer. although both the restaurant and the bar were open, i was not able to take advantage of it. the stay was very nice, i had a double bed room. the room has a very old, antique-ish feel to it. the bathroom was nice and clean but it was not fully stocked with all the bath essentials (shampoo, conditioner and lotion). i might also note that the bathroom had a "mildew" smell....ya.....pretty gross. the room came with all the normal amenities that you would expect from a hotel EXCEPT a coffee maker! i am a dedicated morning coffee drinker and not having a coffee maker in the room really ruins my stay. =( i like the location of the hotel because its a short walk to any fast restaurant or a mini mart if you want to go grab a snack or something. its in the theater district so if you're in town for a show, this would be a good spot to stay. its also VERY close to the Art Museum (just one block) which also means a short walk to Grant and Millennium Park.  just a note, since they dont have coffee makers in their room, it does appear that they are opening a starbucks in the lobby area. there's also a cornery bakery right next door. overall my stay was pleasant and a descent experience at a historical chicago hotel.
