I can only speak from delivery experience but this places is excellent. The first time we ordered, my partner ordered a burrito and I ordered a steak pepito sandwich. Our order arrives and it's still hot but they've left all of the toppings off of my sandwich. It is just steak and lizano sauce. Which wouldn't be a big deal if I hadn't paid extra for avocado on it. So I call them and they take down my name and number and say that the next time we order, they'll throw in a free sandwich and shake. Since everything was delicious, we made good on that about a week later.  The steak pepito is great, the nibbles I've stolen from Rob's steak burritos have been great, the steak fries are awesome, the chifrijio is yummy, the arroz congri is great, and the veggie burrito is the second best burrito I've ever had (I added mushrooms, zucchini, and a side of lizano salso to put on it). The best was the California Veggie burrito from Mariachi's in San Francisco which has become a mythical food creature for me since I ate it three years ago and will never eat it again because they closed last fall. But the veggie burrito from Irazu is a very very very close second. The only thing I've had from here that was even remotely meh was the potato tacos. They were still good, they just weren't as good as everything else and arrived rather cold and lacking mole.
