This place is about value for money! The hot food and salad bar is stocked with raw/cooked veg, Mediterranean spreads, cooked grains, and protein dishes, and priced very fairly at $5.95/lb. The made-to-order wraps and plates, which I haven't tried, also look plentiful relative to their prices. Better quality food can be found elsewhere, but the quality here is nonetheless quite decent, and the value is outstanding.
