Their dinner menu had only one real vegetarian option (a pea-mushroom-tomato sauce clay pot). Sadly, they were out of this dish by the time we sat for dinner Friday at 10pm. But our wonderful waiter offered modified versions of other menu items, e.g. replacing oyster sauce with a veggie sauce, replacing pork with vegetables and tofu, etc. My veggie - fried tofu - noodle dish was flavorful with remarkably fresh veggies (e.g. the snap peas were crispy, not overcooked).  My husband said he liked his duck - it was lean and well-seasoned, and the tamarind dipping sauce was good. The highlight, though, was our fried banana wonton with chocolate sauce and creme anglais with a side of vanilla ice cream. The hot and cold temps were terrific together, as were the crispy wonton with banana and slightly sweet sauces. Just amazing.
