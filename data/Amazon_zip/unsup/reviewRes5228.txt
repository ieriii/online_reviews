omg. I made the mistake of coming here after a wonderful, over the top, awesome experience. I can't complain much about the food. The wine was great. The cheese selection was great, I just wish our waitress hadn't recommended the same three that everyone else in the room was having, just because it was easier for her. The wait was.. HORRIBLE. As there was literally NO room to wait inside (unless my date and I were going to wait inside the bathroom) we told the hostess that we would wait just outside under the awning. 15 minutes pass... 30 minutes pass.. no call. I go inside to check how far exactly we were down the list (since she had told me it would be 15 minutes) and instead she tells me "oh! I thought you left!" umm... no, that's why i looked you in the face and said.. "I'LL BE WAITING JUST OUTSIDE THE DOORS".... the main host came over and quickly tried to resolve the issue. We were seated next, but in the back booth table. A cute, intimate and cozy spot.. only... other people waiting to be seated were hovering around us.. awkward. We looked at the beverage menu before sitting down, and knew what we wanted to get. Why is it that our bottle of wine took longer to get to the table than the food items we didn't know we were going to order? It also made for an awkward wait, as we had a full table of food, a full bottle of wine... but only one plate, one wine glass and one water glass at our table.. were we supposed to fight over who gets what? And surprisingly, our favorite item was not of the cheese, wine or swine variety, but actually the grilled octopus and swiss chard. yum! Either way, this place is much more for the tourists. I'm not sure I'll ever make my way back here again, unless it's on a weekday evening or early Sunday afternoon. I think my chances are better heading to Gene's Sausage Shop & Delicatessen in Lincoln Square, where I know the service will be much better and I can just al fresco in the park at a quarter of the cost.
