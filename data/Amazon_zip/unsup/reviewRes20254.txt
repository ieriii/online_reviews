Great tortas! They actually make them in a wood burning oven. The bread was toasty on the outside, but soft on the inside. The self-serve sparking water was a plus! I don't think I've ever seen that anywhere. The guacamole and chips were awesome and super-addictive. Too bad I didn't have room for churros and hot chocolate. Will definitely be back for them if I'm back in Chicago.
