I was impressed with the service and the food. The price is extremely reasonable given the menu offering. We had the pork fried almonds (which were passed out to hungry people waiting for a seat - very nice touch), the shrimp and clams, the deviled egg, the french fries of the sea, the marrow, the pork blade, and fried brioche. All excellent courses, my favorite pig items being a toss between french fries and the pork blade.The dining atmosphere/area is a wonderful concept - diners share long tables and this creates an environment where diners interact with other parties and talk about what their favorite dishes are, what are you ordering...etc. Wait staff is knowledgeable and well versed in both the drink/wine and food menus.My only complaint (and the reason why I did not give it five stars) is because of the front of the house staff. We waited an hour and a half and our drink taker noticed that we were waiting longer than usual. She contacted the front staff and we were promptly seated and comped a drink - we were clearly forgotten about. As we made our way through the restaurant, we noticed that there were several openings available at the tables, even though there were still a number of groups waiting.
