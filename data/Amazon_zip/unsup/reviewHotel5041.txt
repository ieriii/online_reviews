Stayed here in May 2012. Room was lovely, modern, comfortable, nicely decorated, clean, large, quiet and easy to find. Which is saying quite a bit, actually.However, front desk personnel were an unwelcoming committee. They didn't smile, didn't welcome us as HiltonHHonors members, didn't tell us about the reception or breakfast or actually, anything. They weren't outright mean or straight-up rude, but were somewhere between surly and sullen. I would've written it off as one person having a bad day, but two different people checked us in (one a pre-check-in when we dropped off luggage, and one after official check-in time). I stay fairly regularly in other HIlton chain hotels, and have always been pleased with the attitude and service. Wi-fi was a pain and required multiple tries, calls to the front desk and finally, IT support, to get it connected.
