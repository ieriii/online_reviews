To call Hot Doug's a hot dog stand is highly understating the excellent choices and food. There was everything from a traditional Chicago style dog to gourmet options with such things as Elk, Steak and gourmet cheeses. Worth the wait in line! The owner was really friendly and the atmosphere was bright and engaging. I can't wait to go back and try the Duck fat fries. I can see why Bourdain liked this place.
