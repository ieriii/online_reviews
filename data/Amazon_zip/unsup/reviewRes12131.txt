I've really been wanting to try this place and we recently went with some friends. Our experience was only okay. I think it is pretty pricey for what you get and there are better, less expensive, Cuban restaurants throughout the city. I tried the Ropa Vieja with Rice and Beans and thought both really lacked something. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but both my husband and I walked away from the meal thinking it was just 'meh' and not really worth the money spent.  I'll try this place again, but most likely only for brunch.
