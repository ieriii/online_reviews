Went to Le Colonial for a group dinner. Overall, it was decent. The food was OK and arrived very quickly. Our waitress was attentive without being annoying. The ambiance is trendy, crowded, and loud. For the price, there are better places in the city with a better atmosphere, in my opinion. Maybe it's because this place is in the Viagra Triangle I don't enjoy it as much. Just not my favorite part of town.
