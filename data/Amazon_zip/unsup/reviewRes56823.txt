Spacca Napoli is hands down the best Italian restaurant I've ever eaten at. The pizza's take ONLY a couple minutes to cook and the crust is delicious. I didn't think I would be a fan of one of their pizza's with only marinara sauce but it was unbelievable. The cheese pizza also has the best cheese. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to eat at an authentic Italian restaurant!
