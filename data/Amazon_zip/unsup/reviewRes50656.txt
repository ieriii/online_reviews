I don't get why people love this place so much. The food is totally average, sort of bland, and the portion sizes are small. The food arrived lukewarm and presented haphazardly, like some crappy truck stop diner (except truck stop food would have probably tasted better). I've traveled extensively in the south, and this cuisine doesn't adequately reflect what real Southern food should taste like. The ambiance is pretty all right, and our server was nice enough, but we waited a long time for food that was cold and a breakfast that I could have made better at home. Sorry, Wishbone, we won't be back.
