I have to say that after living at UIC for 4 years Artopolis is one of my personal faves! I love the Tiropita and the pizza, and the pasta salad is good too. They also have a bar with many options and the drinks aren't too badly priced for the area. I had the Cosmo on my last trip and I have to say it is one of the best cosmos I've had. The dessert though is the best. They have the most amazing dessert so TRY EVERYTHING! :) Great for Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, and late night. It's even pretty good for groups as long as you go when its not too crowded!
