Very yummy! I had the Ahogada which is a pork carnitas torta dipped in a tomato broth. Delish! The Churros were amazing also. My fiance had the Chicken tinga torta....and he didn't like it. I'm not taking his opinion into consideration though because he doesn't like anything. I had a bite of it, and thought it was good :)
