I can't think of a better place to spend a nice summer/spring day. The outdoor seating area is located pretty close to the mess that is Division Street, but for some reason the exhaust and noise doesn't bother me. The coffee is always great and the baked goods are usually right on target. I haven't tried the sandwiches but I have been meaning to as they look delicious. This is one of the few coffee places where I actually tip the employees since they're ALWAYS courteous and friendly.
