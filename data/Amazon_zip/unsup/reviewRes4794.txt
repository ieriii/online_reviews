The only (small) gripe I might have about this place is that they don't take reservations. On the other hand, I've never really had to wait more than 30 minutes, and it's pretty easy to get up to the bar to get a glass of wine while you're waiting. They have a great outdoor area to eat (also to sit and drink your wine while you wait for a table). It's sort of small and cramped inside with communal seating, (communal seating outside as well)..but has a great vibe and atmosphere inside and out. The wine selection is large and I've always been given great recommendations from the staff. Plates are small, but filling. Never had a bad experience here. Also an excellent place for groups.
