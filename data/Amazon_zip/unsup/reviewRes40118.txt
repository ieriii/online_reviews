decent korean bbq place with 20 cars in a 10 car parking lot, which i guess adds to the authenticity of the place. also authentic are the sassy/mean waitresses. these korean ladies are just no nonsense so don't take offense if they seem rude. anyways, nothing special about the food. it is korean bbq which is pretty hard to mess up. delicious but not mind blowing. the banchan (side dishes) are average and so are the jjigaes (soups). it is a little over-priced so expect to pay $25/person just for food.  one good thing is that it is walking distance from lincoln karaoke so it's easy to go get your karaoke on if you want to complete the true korean experience. just be sure to go get some pho in the morning to help shake off the soju.
