Love this place. I came here recently with a couple friends and my friend's daughter. We had a bit of a wait, but that's expected on a Sunday during brunch time. We got in, and our server was fantastic. She was very attentive and on top of all her tables. The restaurant itself is really cute - it's a little cramped in there but nothing that made me feel claustrophobic. I ordered french toast, my friends ordered omelette's. Our food came out pretty fast, and though I wasn't feeling great and didn't eat that much, it was very tasty. I did end up taking it home and it still tasted delicious later that day when I popped it in the microwave. That surprised me - I'm not a fan of reheated food in general and I wasn't sure how french toast was going to fare, but it was still delicious. I can't wait to go back for another brunch here, but I'll probably wait until it gets colder so the crowds will (hopefully) thin out.
