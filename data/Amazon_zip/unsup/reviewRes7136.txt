Although I do love my meat, I am not a big BBQ person. Which is why I was a little hesitant going to this place. But I'm SOOO glad I did! I ate at Chicago q shortly after it opened when it was BYOB (they since have received their liquor license..and I am excited to go back and try some drinks because they have a cool bar/lounge type area upstairs). While looking at the menu, my boyfriend and I munched on complimentary sliced pickles. We ended up ordering the bacon cheddar hush puppies, brled macaroni and cheese, house fries, and the Kobe sliced brisket. I LOVED everything! The brisket came with three different BBQ sauces. I cannot stand BBQ sauce so I figured I would just eat the brisket plain, but, to my surprise, it came with something I've never had before; Eastern North Carolina Vinegar-which was amazing!! My boyfriend is originally from the south and said this place was the best BBQ he's had in the city! The atmosphere was cool. Looked like an old house that was turned into a restaurant, different from most places in Chicago. The head chef came over and talked to us and was super nice. The wait staff was also knowledgeable of the menu and was very helpful. I will definitely be back..that Kobe brisket is still calling my name!
