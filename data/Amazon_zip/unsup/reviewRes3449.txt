I have to say, for someone that grew up with a ton of Korean friends, I really didn't get into the cuisine very much until pretty recently, mostly due to the fact that I never realized there were non meat options. I saw the Crisp link on the yelp front page and knew instantly that I had to try it.  I studied the menu enough to know exactly what I was going to try, and the 25 minutes it took me to find parking really made me long for my food even more. Walking in I was a little hesitant, as there were no Koreans behind the counter and the place really had quite the gringo feel to it, but that was quickly tempered when I realized that all of the Koreans were seated at the tables.  We walked in and they tried to discourage us from ordering the chicken wings saying there was a 25 minute wait for them. My friend had been looking forward to them and was disappointed and switched to a steak bowl. I ordered the bad boy Buddha bowl without the egg, but with brown rice and tofu. We then tried to find a place to sit in the packed restaurant and waited for our food. My friend was a little ornery when the steak bowl took 20 minutes to come out, though it was noted that it was significantly better than all of the do it yourself Korean BBQ places around. My bowl was also pretty good, though the sauce was cold and it created a strange temperature change that is probably my only complaint.  I'll be back and ready again to enjoy some fine Korean cuisine.
