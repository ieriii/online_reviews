Probably the best bar in the city for beer. Literally hundreds of choices--its just ridiculous! If you want to go on a beer safari or just try out a beer before you drop $9.00 for a six pack of that obscure Hefeweizen from Cameroon, this is your place. Just read all the other reviews...However, it is very crowded and you'll really be pressed to get a seat here. They have a restaurant in the back with pretty good food but I think they would be alot better off downsizing it and opening it up for more bar seating. It is much more profitable to sell beer than serving food which has more expenses tied to it. They probably fall into that whole 51-49% food to alcohol sales law or something...Maybe they could add a second floor in the back area where there used to be one. The trick is to go there early before the crowds roll in or on an off day. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't so crowded constantly. Service is hard to come by as they busy and crowded. Did I mention they get crowded here? I recommend it highly, it's just too bad they don't have the space they need here.
