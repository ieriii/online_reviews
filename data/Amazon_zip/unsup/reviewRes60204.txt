I love this place!1. The pizza is amazing. As a die-hard Chicago-style fan, its hard to admit, but Fogo's tasty flat wins out over my deep dish cravings more often than not. The veg ingredients are the freshest I've seen, and the meats and cheeses are of such high quality and in such large portions that you really notice the difference.2. The service is amazing. Brad, the owner, is the friendliest guy ever, and everyone there makes an effort to know my name and what kind of pizza I like. They're fast, too.  3. The place is clean. I'm a food-industry person, and I can honestly say Fogo is among the cleanest places I've ever seen. Only issue: when they're busy, the "no-touch" (read: sanitary) trash bins get really full - and I feel bad leaving my trash on the counter! I recommended you shove a 32 gal bin outside the door on busy nights!4. They have 60 kinds of pizza on the menu. Even so, I am one of those people who always asks for something special. The Fogo folks are always accommodating and even make recommendations about which changes would be good. 5. I should probably eat here every day (instead of 3x per week) because I would save money. $6 for two pieces (this means about 10" total crust-arc) and a soda!?6. I think the delivery problems that some people mentioned a couple months ago are gone - one saturday night, when we felt really lazy, my boyfriend and I ordered delivery, even tho the place is 2 blocks away. 30 minutes later, the owner showed up at our front door with the pie. And he refused a tip. 7. Their chicken is also great - I always forget about it though. Maybe some kind of lovely chicken display along with the pizzas in the window?
