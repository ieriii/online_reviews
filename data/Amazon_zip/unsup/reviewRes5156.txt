Here piggy piggy... wait no, I go to The Pig, it doesn't come to me... dang it! I went here with some friends a while back as the first spot in our "supper club" meetings. The food here is great and the atmosphere is A-MAZING!! It's warm and welcoming in the winter and vibrant and easy-going in the summer. I had tuna with lima beans, veggies, cheese, homemade breads, olives... and it was all finger-lickin good. I can't wait to go back here again sometimes soon!
