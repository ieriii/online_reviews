Great looking room and cool cocktail lounge. Unfortunately, it gets really loud at Carnivale. Go for drinks and get dinner somewhere else. The food was really overpriced and the waiters give your pretentious speeches about how great it is. I found it to be mediocre. Now, the mojitos, on the other hand, are spectacular. I recommend the fresh raspberry ones. They are potent and delish!
