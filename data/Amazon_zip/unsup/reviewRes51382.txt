My boyfriend took me here a few nights ago when it was freezing out. Needless to say, we didn't have to wait for a table. The service was OK, not the best. The chips and salsa were very good. I tried the ground beef tacos (yes, I was boring) and they were so-so. The re-fried beans and rice were tasty - and I'm pretty picky about that stuff. They have this fruit drink - some kind of smoothie - made with fresh fruit. That was pretty good. Would I go back? Sure... But when I'm REALLY craving Mexican food I'd head somewhere else.
