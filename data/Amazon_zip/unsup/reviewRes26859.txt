Yeah, two stars may seem pretty harsh, but it's about as honest as I can be. Please read on. I didn't come in with "high expectations" but I knew that Graham was awarded a Michelin Star so I did think that it would be a decent meal. The first thing that threw me a little was the price. I knew it would be a lot, but I was only planning to get one entree a la carte, but the rest of the table wanted the tasting menu ($75) and all of us had to get it so I was out voted. As tasting menus go, the portions are small - I understand that - but sometimes they are way too small even to get a real taste of it. The first thing that I noticed it that everyone's portions were HORRIBLY inconsistent. On the first appetizer, the bread had literally no butter while the fellow next to me had a huge chunk. I had one less slice of beef for the entree... a whole slice goes a long way in a tasting menu. One of my dishes didn't even have the garnish! I expected a lot more quality control, but it was as if they were rushing all this stuff out. Missing a garnish seems like a pretty big flub.  The best thing I ate all night was actually the untraditional ceasar salad with an anchovy on top. Quite tasty. Everything else was just filler and honestly just not that great. I'm not really a food snob or anything, but at the price you're paying you should expect a lot more. Honestly, I expect this place to lose their Michelin Star soon.  Try the Bristol instead, you get more for your money's worth and the food's better too.
