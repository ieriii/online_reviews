My boyfriend bought a groupon for Brazzaz so we tried it on a Tuesday night. The salad bar had a great selection (a little random- sushi and tortellini?) but it is truly all about the meat. We noticed when we first flipped our coins over to say "bring it on!" we were swarmed by the staff with different cuts of meat. We noticed that after that initial burst we didn't get very much attention and my boyfriend had to ask someone 3 times to send more shrimp over. Some of the meat also wasn't warm by the time it got to our plate. Great for a groupon but I would never pay $50 for this meal on my own. It is an experience but I have heard that Texas de Brasil is a more impressive opertion.
