So who doesn't love the Green Mill? It's classic, it ushers in amazing talent, the drinks are amazing, they let you bring food in, and they have an amazing Sunday night poetry slam. I've met people here and have successfully gotten people to come out who rarely leave their neighborhood hovels. It's a magical Chicago landmark. If you live in the city and consider High Fidelity to be your only interaction with the jazz icon, turn off the TV and get your butt to Uptown!
