I just don't get it. I've been here three times and have had poor service every time. I have to admit, I really want to like this place, and I keep going back to give it another chance. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times... I give up, I'll write a bad review. I stopped by after an afternoon of shopping and was hoping for some relaxation. My food was delicious, but the service was so awful that it actually put me in a bad mood. My drink came out during my meal. I know its small, but I really wanted a coffee. We had to constantly flag down our waitress, and then were never offered dessert or the check. Eventually the bus boys had to bring our bill over. No one even came over to pick up the check either. Finally, a different server had to run my credit card and make it a whole ordeal that we caused him any inconvenience. Writing this review alone puts me in an awful mood, so I'll stop here.
