I just decided to check the website, and read the "about us" section, where they explain why there are 3 restaurants on the same block... Not very exciting, but still nice to know... Apparently the one I frequent is "La Nueva", the newest of the 3. The food is fine, not spectacular, but definitely hits the spot for a cheap lunch, which I take advantage often on accounta I work a block away... Service is fine too, the cashier ladies up front have warmed up to me a lot after several visits (and tips); they weren't unpleasant before, just working. Since I don't expect to be fawned over for lunch, this has always been perfectly acceptable for me. I often get the veggie taco with everything (super sloppy and "American" but yummy!), the barbacoa taco (onions, cilantro and cheese!) and the chips and salsa negra. I love that damned salsa, and the chips are good too. I got a steak torta once, and it tasted good to me!
