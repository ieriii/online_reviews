This is an amazing restaurant! Its soo authentic and a family run business. I would recommend it! My friends and I came in and they loved it! Great for family, friends, and dates. Plus the Garcia family is so down to earth! U must go! I love their enchiladas and carne asada! Just check it out urself. Its been my hangout since hs. Thanks Braulio for being kind, helpful, and having impressive hospitality etiquette. Will always come here for mexican cuisine and never go anywhere else!
