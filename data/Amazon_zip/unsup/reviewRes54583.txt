I often have visited sultans but never taken advantage of there delivery service and i will never do it again. I ordered 2 sandwiches and a small rice. I waited about 45 minutes was excited for my delicious food then the delivery driver hits me up with a 34 dollar bill. I have often ordered this at the restaurant and it was only at most 15 dollars slap on a 3 dollar delivery fee and you got about 20 dollars. I ask him are you sure and he says thats the total and i was forced to pay it. Thats the most I'm ever paying for a Falafel ever in my life say no to this delivery service if you can. Not worth 34 dollars at all
