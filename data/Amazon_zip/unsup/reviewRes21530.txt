Me and my co-workers went here after work. It was awesome. We got a long table (~18 people) in the back room and it was very festive. My friend and I shared a pitcher of strawberry margarita. It was A LOT of margarita, but I'm not complaining ;) We went on a Thursday, so margaritas were half price! Next time I would love to try the other flavors as well. The food was good - I got a chimichanga on a recommendation from a friend. There was enough food leftover for lunch the next day (possibly because I was full from trying to finish all the margarita).
