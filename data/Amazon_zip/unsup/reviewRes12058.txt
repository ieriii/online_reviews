Onsite micro-brewery. Huge sprawling cavernous interior, felt like an indoor biergarten. Boisterous groups and packed on weekends. Worth the wait though, the draft beers are on point (the hefeweizen flows thick and in the right glasses) and the pizza is a great alternative to deep dish. Get the Neopolitan style - uses parmesan instead of mozz for a lighter pie.
