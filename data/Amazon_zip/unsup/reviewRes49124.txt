Bin 36 is a great Chicago staple for good times and a wine list to compete with any restaurant in the city. It's a fantastic place for large groups - which was the reason we were there a few weeks ago. A large round table is perfect for tasting wines and sharing small plates. I was slightly surprised with the food selection in that it was smaller than I remembered. It works out just fine because the small plate options are all tasty and allow you to create many different meal combinations. At our table of 12 Jeff C, Erica and I decided to team up and try a bunch of things. We started with a cheese plate of four tasty varieties of goat cheese I believe. Next up was lamb meatballs, lamb ribs, flat iron steak and sides of asparagus, mashed potatoes and cauliflower. The lamb dishes were not as juicy as expected but the sides and steak were quite good. The last dish was a griddled three cheese sammi served with a tuscan tomato shooter. There's not much more that needs to be said about Bin. It's a classic wine bar/restaurant in the heart of the city. It's fun and very approachable (not stuffy or pretentious) for people to learn and tasty many different wines at a reasonable price (wine flights around $15 each). The setting is perfect for large groups and the food is above average solid - nothing to change the world but perfectly adequate for the setting.
