I went here with a group of friends after work. It was extremely crowded. We didn't have a reservation, and the wait was somewhere around 2 hours, so we ended up finding seats in the bar area. The drinks were amazing! I had the best margarita of my life. I think it's called the Gold Margarita. I highly recommend trying one...or four. The food was also excellent. We ended up just ordering a bunch of appetizers so we could sample a little bit of everything. I wasn't disappointed. Everything was delicious. My only complaint is how crowded it was, but I guess that's just an indication of how great the food is.
