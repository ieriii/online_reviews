{3.5 STARS} Came here on a Saturday morning with one other person. The hostess said the wait would be 20 mins but we were able to sit down pretty quickly. Probably didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes. I ordered the {HUEVOS RANCHEROS} and my friend ordered the {APPLE CINNAMON WAFFLE} with a side of {BACON} -I had high hopes for the {HUEVOS RANCHEROS} but in my opinion they were only okay. I wish they had some tortillas on top instead of all baked in so you got a little bit of the crunch factor, it wasn't bad but I would pass next time. The {APPLE CINNAMON WAFFLE} on the other hand was mighty tasty, it was a perfect combination and not to sweet. The side of {BACON} seems a little sad, they give plenty of it but the bacon strips are thin and weak looking! :) I'd come back again, in a small group -the baked goods looks really amazing will have to try those next time.
