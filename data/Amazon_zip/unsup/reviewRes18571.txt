after a movie with a heavy emphasis on piles of pasta and indulgence, we had italian on the brain. a google search later, we were on our way to caro mio for a rather unreasonably early dinner. from the fresh garlic served with the table bread, to the melt in your mouth pasta/potato-ish soup to the main course, a simple homemade pasta with meat sauce (that we thankfully shared)...it was simply perfection on a platter. i thought i knew my favorite italian in the city, but i think we may have a contender for that first place honor. bonus: its BYOB. fantastic place for a birthday party or general celebration. but please order moderately. portions are massive. will be back. ciao bella!
