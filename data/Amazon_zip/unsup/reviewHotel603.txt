I would give this hotel a 3.5. Having visited Chicago many times and having stayed in several similar hotels, this offered a larger room than we usually have in Chicago. The location is near pretty much everything downtown and has two bus stops within a block. My complaint would be that they came by to service the room at 8:45 am. Naturally, being on a trip for leisure, we were not out of the room at this time, but didnt have the do not disturb on the door because we were planning to be out by 10. Unfortunately because we were not ready for the room to be serviced at 8:45, it was not cleaned! This happened two days in a row. It just seems senseless to me to not plan to clean rooms that will remain occupied for a few more days later than 8:45. I didnt have any of the issues with the televisions (big flat screen in our room) or elevators (fast and always available). I would definitely stay here again, but would have had a better experience if the room cleaning had been different.
