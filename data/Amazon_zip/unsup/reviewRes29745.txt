With this many reviews, pretty much everything has been said. I just wanted to chime in that while they have been hit or miss, most experiences I've had there have been great, with a very authentic flavor on the many, varied dishes that they have at a nice low price. I am pained that due to sodium restrictions, I can no longer go here. Someday, someday....
