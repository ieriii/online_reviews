A good dining experience, but seemed off its game in little ways. The waiter was distracted and kept looking at other stables while speaking to us, then forgot to give us napkins before the first course arrived. The service was friendly and effective after that. The food was excellent. The sweet potato soup was spectacular, will dozens of unique flavors combining perfectly. The decor is kinda modern, but kinda outdated at the same time. It's quiet inside. I felt like this was a place that should be a "5", but just couldn't quite get there.
