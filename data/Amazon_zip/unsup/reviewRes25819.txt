i am in love with geja's. seriously. this place has lasted longer than any of the romantic relationships that i have ever had. that being said, i came here on my recent trip to chicago. this time, there was no romance involved...well, i lied, there was romance. fondue + anna marie = pure love. i got the beef and lobster combo. the cheese fondue appetizer is one of the tastiest things i'll ever eat. and anything cooked in hot oil...well, that just makes my day, night, lifetime. anyways...one word of advice--as romantic as this place is, don't expect to get laid afterwards, unless if your date is a dainty eater. because all i ever do is pass out in a food-drunken coma afterwards.
