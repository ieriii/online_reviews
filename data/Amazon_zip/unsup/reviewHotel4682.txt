One of my most favorite hotels...in the country. Have stayed here twice: 2009 and 2011. Fun, eco-friendly boutique hotel in downtown Chicago (great location walking distance from Mag mile) with a stylish looking lobby and bar area. The beds are so comfortable. Modern decor, nice amenities such as a spa but old city charm. Of course, quite clean. The staff are quite helpful and nice, hotel is not too big. Feels comfortable and not over the top like the chain hotels. AND, it's affordable! Call for the best deals or look online for specials. Highly recommend.
