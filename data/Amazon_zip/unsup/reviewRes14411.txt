This is a good place to take your parents. Nice ambiance, great use of materials and textures throughout the place. The service was really damn good considering how busy it got. Too bad the beers we tried didn't match the brewery name. Pulled Pork Sandwich: Very good. Coup D'Etat beer: Great start, empty finish. Cross of Gold beer: It was ok but it could be any other beer.
