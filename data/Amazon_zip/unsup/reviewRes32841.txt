Not a vegetarian myself but enjoyed this restaurant immensely. The drinks were good, and the food selection was more than acceptable. I would return, especially in the summer. I must admit, after a few of their margaritas, the sweet potato concoction ordered just didn't seem memorable. But those margaritas rocked. The outdoor patio is a fun venue.
