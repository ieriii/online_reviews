As a native Southerner, I was skeptical about brunch at Big Jones. My concern was the use of the terms "low country" and "cajun/creole" in the same sentence to describe the same place. This may seem petty, but to me these two terms mean two completely different things. When I hear "Low country" I think of the flavors & elements of coastal Carolina (mainly Charleston & surrounding areas). "Cajun" & "Creole" mean for me New Orleans & the Mississippi Delta. In my mind, the two together are too much; too broad of a reach.  Luckily, I was wrong. We started brunch with fried green tomatoes. Not normal brunch fare, but I couldn't pass up the chance to try. The tomatoes were great - still a little firm. The batter was perfect. My wife had Eggs New Orleans. The hollandaise was outta sight. I ordered shrimp & grits. The shrimp were cooked to perfection but the grits were the best. Maybe it's just been too long since I've had grits, but I thought Big Jones' grits were right on with the perfect combination of "gritty" crunch and creaminess.  I skipped the brunch coffee & went straight to the sweet tea. Mmmm! Good enough to make this Southerner homesick. The service lacked a bit. When it was time for the check our otherwise attentive waitress was no where to be found. Nearby waitress chatter about other guests and the kitchen staff detracted from our overall dining experience.
