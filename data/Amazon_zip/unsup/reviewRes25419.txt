I'd never had real Chicago-style pizza before, so I was determined when I finally stepped foot for the first time in the Windy City. Some laborious Yelp research indicated to me that Pequod's has the best in town, so it was off to Pequod's we went. I almost wish I didn't experience this, because now I'm a full-fledged addict and, of course, can't find anything that matches it at home in San Francisco. Their menu said something about never cleaning the grease off their cast iron skillets, so the crust crisps perfectly and caramelizes the cheese in this way that just makes you want to cry. I don't know how it works... black skillet magic? We stuffed our pizza with hella meat toppings like real Chicagoans (who don't say hella) and I think I passed out in a food coma at like 9pm that night. Party animal!
