I grew up with two Southern grandmothers who loved to cook. And they loved BBQ. I feel qualified to say that Q is the best BBQ restaurant in Chicago. There's other good ones in the city, but Q hits all cylinders. I've been there three times now and I think I've tried everything on the menu but the short ribs. Everything was delicious. The braised greens and the BBQ beans aren't anything special, but they are tasty. Everything else is off the charts good.
