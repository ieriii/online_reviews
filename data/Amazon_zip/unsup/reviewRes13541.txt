Cereal, fresh fish and a nice beer list...makes for an awesome combination! The crab cake was done really well and we loved the chowder. While I wouldn't get it, having cereal choices made a family next to us very happy (kids weren't fish lovers). Most important tip, make sure you have a reservation (they are great about keeping on track). Can't wait to return.
