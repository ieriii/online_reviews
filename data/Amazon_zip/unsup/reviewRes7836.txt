This is my kind of pizza! The thin, chewy crust that is charred on the edges is my favorite in the city. And I adore how you can actually taste the ingredients: tomatoes, olive oil and basis without a dairy overload from a mountain of cheese. I think Italian is done best when the flavors are clean and it's not weighed down wiht heavy sauce or cream. My friend has raved about this place for years and now I'm hooked too. Can't wait to try more of the menu.
