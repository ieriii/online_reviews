We loved our stay. We have a well trained dog who we enjoy traveling with, but we don't want to compromise on luxury. The James was exactly what we were looking for - luxury, great location, amazing service, and a friendly, smiling (no way!) staff. The only draw back was that valet was $50 per day, but we also weren't sure what the market is around that area either.
