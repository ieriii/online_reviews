Alinea is a great restaurant. It is expensive because it takes a lot of people's effort to make a single course. They even have to hand wash many of those dishes. I think price is justified in that sense. It was like attending a performance at a theater where each course has a part in telling a story. The first course prepares you for what to come and each course after is related to one another and help each other out to bring the best out of each course. I've enjoyed this aspect of dining here. Each course just disappeared in front of us as soon as they brought it. I screamed for every course. I hope I wasn't too noisy. From a course so delicate to a course so explosive it was like a great concert. The wine pairing was exceptional for the price we've paid. It is amazing what people can do to express and enjoy life. Maybe Grant's this passion for bringing life into his food help him get through the hard time when he had a very serious cancer. I can truly sense that when I was there enjoying his well prepared food. I really appreciate all the staffs at Alinea for working so hard.
