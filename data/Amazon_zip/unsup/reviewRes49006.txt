I went to the Publican on Memorial Day....I had checked out the menu online beforehand and was excited to try the fish stew. We ordered oysters first and those were great. I ordered fish stew and then 25 minutes later, around the time I should be getting my food, the waiter informed me that they were out of them. He brought the revised menu back and all of the seafood items were off the menu. I was totally disappointed. I mean extrememly disappointed as I don't really eat much meat. The waiter comped my beer and I was supposed to get excited about that. I would really hesitate to go back to this restaurant as a result of this experience. A restaurant of this caliber running out of main course entrees at 8:15? This just seems crazy and totally amateur.
