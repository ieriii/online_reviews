After reading the reviews on this site and tripadvisor I came pretty close to canceling my reservations at the Congress Plaza for Lollapalooza weekend. I live downtown, and had booked the hotel for it's convenience to Grant Park, thinking that it would be easier to commute 2 blocks rather than 15. I have to let you all know that, perhaps because I was expecting the worst, I was pleasantly surprised. Our room on the 13th Floor, South Tower was clean and nicely appointed with a flat screen TV and 15 ft ceilings. We didn't pay extra for a lake view, so we had a great city view. The carpet was fresh, and while not overly decadent, the bedding was clean and new looking.  I didn't order room service, but I did request extra pillows, which were delivered within 10 minutes at 11:00 pm. Nice! I understand that your experience could be much different, but for us, it was perfect!
