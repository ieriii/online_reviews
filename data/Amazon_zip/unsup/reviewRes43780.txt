Boys and Girls, Ladies and Gentlemen, Guys and Gals, word I had heard on the street was that Kinzie Chophouse was just "okay"! But thinking logically about it, if it was just "okay" then how could Kinzie stay in business being a mere few blocks from Gene & Georgetti's?  The atmosphere is pretty laid back for a steakhouse that serves up some quality meats. The Prime Rib is up there with some of the best I've ever had, if not the best! It was probably the juiciest I've had too, and didn't need any horseradish sauce. FLAVOR! Get the loaded baked potato. It IS loaded. I have yet to try the filet or porterhouse, but I may be sold on the prime rib for my next visit. They used to do a $2.95 bar menu thing from 3-6pm on weekdays, which featured a serious meatloaf sandwich, 1/4 lb cheeseburger, calamari, etc. Quite a deal. I didn't ask about it last night and don't see it on their website offhand anymore, but I hope it's still there.  Nothing funny happened last night. It was purely a red meat extravaganza.
