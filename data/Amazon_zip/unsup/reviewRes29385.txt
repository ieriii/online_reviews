Just went, AGAIN, to my favorite Thai in the city. I know there are glittzier, more expensive places to go, but this place has plenty to offer. They are very consistent with their entrees, and the portions, though small, are filling. That, and the BYOB factor is a plus! You may want to check yourself before you say "very hot" when they ask you how spicy you want a dish. I tried to be bold once with the spicy basil fish, and ended up sweating uncontrollably! Hot, or medium are perfectly hot enough! Also, if you don't get the fried banana dessert, you've blown it. It's a cold, mushy banana surrounded by a warm fried filo dough, all smothered in honey. Drool city. It cools the mouth off nicely when you finally stop sweating from the food! Go, and enjoy yelpers!
