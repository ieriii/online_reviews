My buddy manages this place and my husband was the handy man there up until yesterday so this reviews integrity may be compromised.  Sometimes the food is spot on and amazing, the Dagwood sandwich, the squash soup, the gravy, the jalapeno dip. Other times, things aren't quite right. However, I always have a pleasurable experience dining here whether it's a date on the back patio, kicking back with my dad while he's in town, or a quick pick me up after a bike ride. I highly recommend the cookies and cream sheet cake for your next bday. Lara brought one of these yummy cakes to my son's 2nd birthday and it was a hit with toddlers, grandmas, and everyone in between. The fact it's vegan is a big ole bonus!
