Maybe the stars just weren't in alignment, but I had a borderline rotten time here. We were having dinner with a friend and had made reservations in advance, but we ended up sitting at the worst table in the whole place. (Hello! A pregnant woman should not be seated right by the stairs, way out in the aisle, where people are constantly asking her to scoot in so they can get by.) And even though I am absolutely NOT the kind of person who says, "I can't believe how small these portions are" or "I can't believe how much they charge for that," I was muttering these very things under my breath. The halibut was excellent, but when that teeny tiny piece of fish appeared before me, with fifteen peas and a quarter-sized dollop of whipped golden beets, I seriously laughed out loud. And then I ordered some mashed potatoes. Puzzlingly, the entrees my husband and our friend ordered were so big, they had to take them home in doggie bags. When the day comes that I can eat undercooked meat and drink imported beer again, I will definitely give The Gage another whirl. I mean, how can 300+ Yelpers be wrong?
