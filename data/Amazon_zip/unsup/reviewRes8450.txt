I came here on a Sunday night with 4 other women. The food and service were good but the noise was unbearable. I could often not hear what my friends were saying. Honestly because of this I wouldn't come back. I gave it 3 stars because the food really was nice - I had the "Insalata di Mare" and the "Funghi" pizza. Both really were excellent. Only if they sort out their acoustics will I go back.
