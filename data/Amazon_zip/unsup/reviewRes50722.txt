Ok...I'm giving 4 stars with a BIG caveat... If you want to rock the world's greatest breakfast special, then the Wishbone on Lincoln is tits! The other meals of the day can be...ummm...somewhat iffy... But for the most part, the food is decent, the service is always friendly... And honest-to-goodness...the breakfast special is amazingly cheap and totally filling! Go for the early morning special...do it. It's great!
