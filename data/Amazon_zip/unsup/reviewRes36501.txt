Five stars? You better believe it! I rarely give that rating to a restaurant, but this place would get six stars if I had the option.  Is it really that good, Mike? Yep! Seriously, what are you waiting for? Go to Meli Cafe already! FOOD Mana Mou! Could be the world's best breakfast. Eggs, steak, cheese, peppers, mushrooms, onions, and love fill this skillet (and keep me coming back for more). Want some freshly-squeezed liquid satisfaction, then take your pick and let your server know. They will do the rest!  SERVICE Greeks in general apparently are not that friendly... Just like the French! However, there is that super-friendly owner at Artopolis... so there goes my theory. Anyway, the service does bring that terrific food out to you, so I suppose it makes the grade... OVERALL See above.
