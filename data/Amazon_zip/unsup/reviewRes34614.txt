I like this place and truly enjoy the meals.  The only thing...its a long wait. For parties of 2, it seem to go a bit faster, but bigger parties probably want to get there early. I have tried the sante fe skillet, and french toast and have enjoyed them both. I thought the cinnamon rolls were going to melt in your mouth, but the were just OK - I've tasted better. The waitstaff were friendly.
