Food is good. They scene is a little slice of lincoln park. Womp Womp. I mean look at their menu...It looks like an 'affliction' t-shirt. I live near by and order carry-out with relative frequency. ONLY because the food is decent. THE SERVICE SUCKS. Every time I come in to pick up food there is never a person to help me. And the 3 times a bartender was idle, they found that texting took precedence over their job.
