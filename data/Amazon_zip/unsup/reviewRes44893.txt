I had a very disappointing experience at this Giordano's. I got there about 10 minutes before it closes and asked if they were still open. They told me they were, but a few minutes later, after I ordered a deep dish pizza, the waitress told me they had "turned the oven off" and therefore they couldn't make me a pizza (who knows f that is true? About 10 minutes after that they served a pizza to another table, so maybe they just didn't want to wait for the pizza to bake). The waitress was also not very attentive and took about 15 minutes to bring the drinks we ordered... (although the place was almost empty) I am not going back to this Giordano's - and maybe not even to other Giordano's. You can eat the same or better deep dish pizza at several other places in Chicago (e.g., Uno/Due).
