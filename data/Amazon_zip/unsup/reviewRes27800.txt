One of the best restaurants ever, I absolutely love this place. Everything is always fresh and flavorful, it is located next to their own tortilla factory so you always get hot fresh chips and great salsa. The flavors are very authentic with the right amount of spice. I recommend the nachos, they are amazing. It is BYOB which makes this cheap spot even cheaper.
