I've been a couple times. The service is average to above-average and they shove maybe four or six seats too many than is comfortable when full, but the food is to die for. The grilled octopus somehow had the texture of high-quality beef -- and that's surprisingly a good thing. Also, my friend had to actually apologize to the server; he ordered some sort of steak, and when it arrived no steak knife was given. After asking for it he realized it was so tender it just melted off with a fork. Definitely give it a try, but make a reservation. Both times I arrived early at opening, but by the time I left it was packed to capacity.
