Ended up here on Saturday night following a cancelled trip to another place, due to their running out of Great Lakes Christmas Ale. My friend called the Bad Apple and they had the ale, so we were off. I was pleasantly surprised. Atmosphere was a good mix of lively yet still able to hear your dinner companions. We started off in the bar waiting for a table. Huge beer selection, probably rivals Hopleaf, but plenty of valid options for the non-beer drinkers as well. As someone who drinks beer minimally I sometimes feel stupid ordering a cocktail at a "beer" place, but not here. Bartenders knew their stuff and helped out a friend who was looking for a beer she had once but couldn't remember the name of. Once we sat down our server was friendly and funny, even making jokes with my tipsy friend. Lots of interesting and off-beat options for burgers, maybe even more creative than the ones at Kuma's (which, admittedly, I think is overrated). I counted at least 3 or 4 veggie options, which is pretty good at a burger place, so vegetarians need not stay away. I got the Edmund Fitzgerald burger (goat cheese, bacon fig relish and grilled onions) and truffle fries, both of which were cooked perfectly. So many fry options our party decided to each get different ones so we could try a few. Yeah, their ketchup is a bit different, but I didn't want any ketchup to cover the taste of the truffle oil anyway. Cozy neighborhood place even if you don't live in the 'hood, and easily worth the trek. Next time Kuma's grumpily tells you there's a 2-hour wait, go here instead!
