It was Toro Tuesday, but since we had our usual foursome, and it was pretty late, there was no way we were getting a table. So of course the Todds et al opted for plan B- Coast Sushi. I had been there before for a book club meeting, and really liked the food, so although I was sad to have to forgo Toro, I was excited for Coast. We had called in a last-minute reservation (I recommend making a reservation, because it does fill up) and basically walked in and were seated almost immediately. We uncorked the wine, ordered some edamame, then ordered our requisite 7-8 rolls. We fed our faces, me until I was about to enter into a food coma, which obviously attests to the fact that the sushi is pretty damn good. Not too much in terms of selection (the menu is a bit limited but their offerings are good ones), but as I said, we weren't disappointed. The ambiance is nice- a little too dark (I almost tripped over a table of people on my way to the bathroom because I couldn't see that well in the dark !) but nice- so if you want to get cozy but be discreet, this would be a good place- just ask for a table in the corner.
