One of THE best pizza in the city of Chicago, specifically the pan pizza, as the thin crust is just average. I also like Art of Pizza, but this pizza takes the crust. The restaurant is busy sometimes, but it's a cool place. Delivery is not fast, and the prices are a bit high. I guess it's so popular that they don't really care about how they treat you.
