We made a reservation for 11am Saturday brunch. We were running 15 minutes late and called to notify them of this inconvience. No problems there. Let's see... we shared a dozen oysters (comes with this balsamic dressing on the side - delicious) and maple syrup braised bacon (can't go here without trying good ol' swine). He had the meatloaf sandwich (wagyu short rib and pork shoulder ground together with other sauces on ciabetta bread with a sunny side egg - this is a must) and I had the eggs with foccacia bread (this one was just ok, nothing extravagant about this plate. Just that it's very airy and light). Besides the egg dish, everything else was spectacular. On my top list of brunch places for sure!
