My friends and I stopped here for Breakfast this past Saturday. Not everything was perfect - but overall it was very good and I'd go back. I had a Michelada, coffee, and the breakfast sandwich (eggs scrambled w/ bacon).n The michelada was different than Michelada's I've had in the past, but I was a fan. The breakfast sandwich was great - eggs cooked perfectly, great homemade muffin, and superb bacon. My friend ordered the chilaquiles - and while delicious, there was a lot of "fluid" on the plate.  Really no complaints, the food was quite good. Our drinks took longer than we would have liked to arrive, but really, that wasn't even so bad. All in all, a great experience - seated quickly, well fed, and happy.
