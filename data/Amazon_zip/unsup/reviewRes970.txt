I just moved to New York, and one of the things I miss most about Chicago is Hot Doug's. It just doesn't get better than this. The price is terrific, the options (standards aside) are ever-changing, and Doug is there each time to make you truly believe that, yeah, that Thuringer and fries was a great choice today. If I hadn't left Chicago, I'd still be standing in line on a weekly basis with my roommate.
