Always very crowded and a huge hotspot, near/on michigan ave. the food is eclectic with many options and variations of 'pig'. the taste for some of the dishes are excellent. i had the slow roast pork with mashed potatoes, was excellent. all the dishes are small, but it's tapas style. the dessert was very good as well. a very decent selection of wine.
