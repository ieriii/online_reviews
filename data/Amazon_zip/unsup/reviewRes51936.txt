This is the best deep dish I've come across in Chicago! Got the small spinach pizza (4 slices, $17.70) for 2 people. Crust is delicious and cornmealy without being overly rich like Lou Malnati's. Generous amounts of tangy tomato sauce heaped on top. Lots of crunchy spinach in the middle (texture seems to be more like frozen spinach - works well). Almost makes pizza seem like a healthy thing. Felt really good after eating two slices - both in terms of yumminess and non-bloatedness. Could have gone for a third! I really love deep dish joints that use tomato sauce as the topper vs. cheese. Giordano's does the same thing and, in my opinion, has the better-tasting sauce (sweeter balance whereas Gino's has a saltier leaning). However, Giordano's crust is way too flour-y and bland, and that's why Gino's is top on my list for solid, all-around deep dish performance!  Tip: Don't bother waiting in line to eat in (if you can help it). Much better to order and take out - less than 45 min wait.
