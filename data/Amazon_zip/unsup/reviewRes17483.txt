I've been back to Violet Hour several times since my first review, and let me tell you... the cocktails just get TASTIER! The more you are exposed to the art of cocktails and the flavors, well.. the more shitfaced you get, but I never regret it. Pretentious, schmetentious... whatever. I like how the place stands apart from what people expect from a liquor establishment. It's a great place to just really enjoy your drinks and chill with some friends. The bartenders are absolutely excellent, hands down.
