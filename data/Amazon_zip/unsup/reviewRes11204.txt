Piece is a weekly meal for us. It has a great crust and sauce. Its very fat kid, but my fiance and I order a large everytime just so we warm it up the next day or two. Personally, I like my pizza less flimsy without a knife and fork, but this place is good. I also sometimes reheat the pizza on the oven rack to firm it up some. Our favorite combos are pep, onions, banana papper or jalopeno, mushroom, and maybe garlic.  This is our thin crust pizza place, along with tomato head. Our deep dish place is pequods with their carmelized crust.  Oh and their beer is good.
