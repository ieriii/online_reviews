By far the cutest hotel I have ever stayed in. This is the perfect girl's night out hotel. I hosted a bachelorette party a while back, and I reserved a few rooms here for all of our out-of-town friends. I discoverd the hotel while jogging one day, I lived right down the street at the time, so I got the neighborhood discount. The rooms were set up so perfect for her pre-party/personal shower. There were plenty of space and seating for all of us. I came in early and decorated, it looked really nice. Everything was clean, and comfy. Our view was pretty cool too, we were nextled amongst the city buildings. Our out-of-town friends loved it! If I did not live here, I would stay here everytime I was in Chicago. The lounge in the lobby is perfect for cocktails, and the ambiance is amazing. P.S. The pictures shown for this hotel are NOT of my group of friends.
