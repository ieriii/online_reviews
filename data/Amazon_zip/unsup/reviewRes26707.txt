This is the first time I've eaten here SINCE Jamie Kluz took over as General Manager. What an incredible transformation in such a short period of time. I don't consider myself a Yelpper, however when remarkable or unremarkable evenings are experienced I feel compelled to honor the evening. This was a remarkable experience. Service at GE is a symphony of precision without pretense. The jeans attire on all staff is a terrific way to respect a serious endeavor, fine dining, without the nose-in-the-air demeanor of too many Chicago establishments. There were 12 courses in the Repertoire menu (who's counting) and yes I understand these are not large servings (please see any Bucca di Beppo for the gluttony size portions) however they were perfectly sized and well timed. Do give yourself ample time on this menu and I suggest the wine pairings to accompany. Learning about each dish and why this or that particular wine was chosen, always adds to the pleasure of the dish and meal. This evening was no exception--we traveled the globe and the pairings were spot on, every time. Obviously influenced by Jamie and perhaps her work at Avenues in The Peninsula or just years of wine study. Decor is warm, not euro-neuvo-cold; plenty of wood, good sound, great windows with plenty of natural light. I don't particularly mind the menu changes as I think it keeps the offering fresh and of course seasonal. The amount of edible flowers was impressive, as was the truffle course, foie, crab and beef. I enjoyed the "sparklers" to start and loved the "doughnut" to finish. A terrific evening for sure and definitely within my top ten dining experiences ever. Thanks GE! Cheers, Martin
