The hot dog was awesome but the box it came in was annoying (although somewhat entertaining to read on the outside). The counters in the sit-in area were filthy. Since this area was completely empty when we got there, there was no excuse for this. The room in which you order is too small and unorganized. All that being said, it's about the food and the hot dog is five stars. All of the other nonsense only loses one star.
