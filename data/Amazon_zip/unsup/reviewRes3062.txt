Solid wings. Like the sauces... I was spoiled by BBQ Chicken in Arlington Heights. I know that sounds so weird since BBQ wings is in the burbs, but that joint had the most ridiculous Korean wings in the history of man. Sadly, many will never know... I mean the batter on those wings were just incredible. They've moved on... *tear* Now I'm back on the search for the best Korean wings... I'm not satisfied yet... But.. Crisp is good. Bowls are good. Definitely get wings AND a bowl.
