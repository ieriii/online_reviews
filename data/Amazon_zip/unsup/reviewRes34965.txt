This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago. This is the place I recommend all my friends to for sushi. The rolls are good size, and I am continually being surprised by the uniqueness of them. The service is great; fast, always on task with keeping the waters full, and checking to make sure everything tastes great. I've never left with an empty stomach, or dissatisfied with my meal.
