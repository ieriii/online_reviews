Was able to get a room in a pinch on a very busy convention weekend in Chicago. That was the best part of this place. I'd second a lot of the other comments although I'm not sure why the ratings were otherwise so high. The rate was good for a hotel in a good location in Chicago. I had a decent sized suite with really all the amenities you'd expect in a hotel - including a safe, which I feel is a rare find these days. The bad: The train is an issue. We were on the 5th floor facing the train. It was loud enough to be annoying, but really did not keep me up. I could see it being a huge problem in 3rd floor rooms. The bed and mattress were old and creaky, and the room was really dry, so I really didn't get a good night sleep either night I was there. Finally, there was absolutely no style. It was all beige, tan, and lightly stained wood with Target-esque faux modern light fixtures. Blah.
