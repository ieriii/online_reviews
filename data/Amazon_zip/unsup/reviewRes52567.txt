I have a love hate relationship with Brazilian steakhouses. First of all, my buddy and I found a coupon that was was like $25 off. So that was one of the reasons we went, since it does usually cost a pretty penny to eat dinner at one of these places. The meat was amazing. I mean, some of the best I've had. I particularly liked the garlic steak and the filet. And their salad bar was one of the best I've seen. A little bit of sushi and I think oysters too! You don't usually wanna fill up on the salad bar, but at least at Brazzaz you are getting your money's worth. And their sweet fried bananas + the cheesy bread... both excellent side dishes. Here comes the hate part. I always overeat. In a quest to get my money's worth, I tend to have several too many portions of meat. The last two times I have gone now, I vowed to never go back for another 6 months. Looks like I'm gonna keep this promise this time... maybe.  Oh yeah, make sure you call ahead for reservations even on a seemingly offday. We went on a Wednesday but there was a convention in town. Even with the reservation we had to wait almost 10-15 minutes to be seated. I talked with the hostess who told me they are NEVER this busy on a Wednesday and just got slammed. But it was worth that small delay.
