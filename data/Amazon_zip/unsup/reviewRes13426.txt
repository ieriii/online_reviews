This place started out not so good but i think they have worked out their problems and now...now it's coming along and on the way to being a great place for seafood. Fresh, Fresh, Fresh Don't let the name fool you this is not your Uncle Joe's Diner, this place is all about fresh fish and seafood. Service is good Try the Simon and Garfunkel (Tilapia with parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme) Oh and don't expect Ice Burg Lettus in your salad. Update: 10/13/2006 Glenn's is now a solid 4 star! All the kinks of being a new place have been ironed out and it's truely a great spot. Love the Glenn's!!
