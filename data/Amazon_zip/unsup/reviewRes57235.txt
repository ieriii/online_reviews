This establishment has the best beer selection in Lincoln Square/North Center by far. Go just to have a beer or two, add an appetizer and a burger. I recommend the Warm Goat Cheese Fondue Dip and the Edmund Fig-Gerald burger. This is a family/kid-friendly restaurant, so expect some screaming if you're there before 7pm.
