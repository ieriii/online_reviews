Meh. I've experienced better. Their ketchup looks and tastes like marinara sauce, I don't see why they don't just buy bottles of heinz, y'knowwwhaddaimean? lol. Yes, their prices are reasonable and they have Montreal poutine .. but their poutine is far from the real thang, so ;o And their veggie burgers are not so yummy. Definitely opt for the pretzel bun cause their regular bun is prettty badddd.. lol. but interesting menu?
