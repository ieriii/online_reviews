Waited 50 + minutes to get a burger and fries to go, when I was told it would take only 20. The fries were saggy because they left it sitting on counter for more than 30 minutes. So not only am I dissatisfied with the service I am now dissatisfied with the food. 1 person behind the bar, 2 cooks in the kitchen in an over-packed restaurant. Never EVER coming back to this crappy place of a restaurant.
