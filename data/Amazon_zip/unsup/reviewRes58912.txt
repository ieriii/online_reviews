I came here on a Monday night with a friend who is from Tulsa, Oklahoma. She thought it was great...I thought otherwise. It was a nice place, decorated very well, nice atmosphere, busy crowd (for a Monday), but the food was so-so. It didn't blow me away and there was a lot of confusion with the wait staff and bus boys. We were trying to decide between the special and one of the regular entrees, so we consulted with the waiter. Well he brought us both instead of what we decided on and hence, we felt obligated to just eat it and pay for it. Problem was, it wasnt very good. Lesson learned. Then the bussers kept trying to take away our food when we weren't done eating! We had to practically, yell, "no, no!, were not done yet!" when they were walking away with our unfinished plates!Overall, decent...but not fabulous. I'd say "Sunda-Par"
