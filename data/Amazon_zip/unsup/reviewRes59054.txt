Yolk was our favorite place since 2007 until the management/owner changed ...or something. The mood of the entire place changed; everyone is in a rush. The guy who takes your tab was rushing us even though there was only one woman behind us. It was very strange. The food is still good, but the service is just really bad. Our waitress was moody and gave us the wrong orders. no apologies. The guy who seats you definitely already looks like the typical restaurant-iere asshole type. This is no longer our favorite spot unfortunately. M.Henry is the new favorite. We'd rather have tight quarters vs being degraded whenever we pay them to serve us at Yolk.
