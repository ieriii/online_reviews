Ok, I thought this place really stunk. I will it say upfront - it has a nice decor. But I had a bad feeling when I saw the menu as only one thing looked interesting..the wahoo. It sounded good on paper, but then the folks next to me ordered the same thing and the waiter had to say "make sure you mix it with all the ingredients as that is the way to get the flavor." I knew I was in trouble. So when it came, I tried the first bite of just the fish and the light sauce it had on it. It tasted like bland no-flavor fish. Uugh. I tried mixing it with all over the other things on the plate like the rice and choy and nothing helped it.. $35 bucks down the drain. The only good thing I had at this place was the carrot cake desert. I really had to have something to get the bad taste out of my mouth. so $200 later, a totally bland and nondescript meal. Someone told me the chef is related to Camilia Parker Bowles or something. Wow. Who cares.
