First of all, I've tried two other restaurants in the Francesca's chain already -- Forno and Campagna -- but this is the first time I've been on a crowded night. I really enjoyed the homemade dumplings with pesto and chicken, and it was really reasonably priced compared to some of the other Italian places I've gone to in the city. Portions, as usual, were more than generous... the friend that I went with eats like there's no tomorrow and there was still a full lunch's worth of food left over on the plate.  Only things that kept this from being a five star experience: 1) Do NOT go for any kind of romantic experience, unless you're on a first date. Tables were very close together and it was very loud; more than a few times the person sitting behind me knocked into my chair. Also, lots and lots of children around. I guess it would help you to think about not making any bad decisions that night? 2) What's up with the musical selection? I'm usually not one to notice, but why were they playing the entire "That's What I Call Music" album from 2009 on loop? 3) My server was REALLY rushed! If you ever order a beer during a busy time, tell them you'll pour it yourself...
