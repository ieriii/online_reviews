Big OPA!!! for your buck! I absolutely loved this restaurant! It is extremely family-friendly, and the portions match their ambiance- big enough to share for your entire party. We decided to get the prepared menu, and it turned out to be a steal- four courses of bottomless plates of food for about $22 per person! But the best part was the quality of our meal; I grew up eating Greek food, and the spanikopita and gyro that we had at Greek Islands is the best I've ever tasted. Everything was fresh, and nothing looked "scary," which can be quite common at other Greek restaurants. Plus, the service was very accommodating and fast in getting our table and food, even though it was extremely busy. Greek Islands is certainly the fun restaurant in the area and simply cannot be missed.
