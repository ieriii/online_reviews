This is a BYOB place with a refreshingly nice atmosphere. White table clothes, candles, a pleasant and knowledgeable wait staff. I had a really flavorful curry with veggies and tofu that is normally just for the lunch menu, but my server was very nice and willingly offered it as a dinner item. It was a generous portion and plenty for leftovers. We all shared an appetizer sampler that was so hot and spicy-we loved it. We made a reservation and sat right away. The crowd was a mix of young and old and most people were dressed on the nicer side.
