Just a cool experience in general. The atmosphere and the professionalism of all the staff members makes you feel special. It's a lovely place, and I think it's kind of cool they don't allow you to use your cell phone in there. It's relatively quiet and calm inside, and every party has their privacy. You can hardly see other people because of the large chairs. It's totally different from what I'm used to, but a great place to grab a drink...a very pricey one, in fact. On those nights that you're feeling particularly sophisticated. Or your parents are paying. When I tried it, I got the Part & Parcel. Very sweet, but I like my drinks that way. It was good, and hard to choose just one given all the categories of liquor and drinks listed under them. I also really loved the sparkling sangria and the Moscow Mule. It was cool watching the bartenders as well. I can't stress enough how much I LOVE the interior - the chandeliers, the curtains, the oversized chairs. I plan on trying it again, on occasion...when it's somewhat justified for a recent college grad to spend $15 on one cocktail.
