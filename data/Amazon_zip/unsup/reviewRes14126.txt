I'll try again in a year; maybe they will have more of their own beers. I'm disappointed by this place- they are routinely out of their "special" beers (most recently, the saison that I was dying to try), and their standard beers are standard. While I appreciate a lengthy craft brew list, if I wanted a Dogfishead, I'd go to the Long Room. Bacon popcorn gets two thumbs up, but the rest of the food, while good, is not reason enough to haul out there.
