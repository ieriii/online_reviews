I heart this place so much. It has everything you could want in a restaurant: beautiful decor, pleasant atmosphere, attentive service, even a fantastic location (hello Bucktown!) but most of all, the food is exquisite. I was initially worried that Coast Sushi wouldn't live up to all the hype, but it surely does. You must, must try their signature makis. That is what they're famous for. My picks are the Wasabi, Coast Crab, Ceviche and Volcano. I don't even like wasabi, but I definitely liked the Wasabi roll. And did I mention that it's in Bucktown? On a strip of N. Damen Ave. filled with gorgeous, unique clothing boutiques. If you're a sushi-loving fashionista (i.e. any woman over 18 living in a big city), this place will seem like the brainchild (and love child) of Vogue and Gourmet. Bring money. You WILL spend it.
