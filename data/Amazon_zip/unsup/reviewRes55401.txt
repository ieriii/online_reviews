Just fantastic! Loved every dish, especially the cheese course/grilled cheese! Service and atmosphere are fantastic as well. I was dining with two avid fans of Sprout and Chef Dale (one who is a world traveling foodie and thinks Sprout could be his favorite restaurant in the country right now). Both were sad to see the change in the menu format, but they still love it and will keep coming back. We all Strongly recommend!
