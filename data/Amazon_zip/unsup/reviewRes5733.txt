I just stopped in here today for some lunch. Today and every time in the past, I've always been greeted with a smile and a hello when it was time to order. I don't vary my purchases far from their Cubano sandwiches, but everything friends and I have always shared have been fantastic. There's a nice patio to sit outside and eat in. The staff always brings your food outside when it's ready, and the location has a nice little parking lot so you can avoid parking on the street. This place ranks right up there with the shops that sell similar food in little Cuba in Miami. If you can't book a flight to south Florida, go here!
