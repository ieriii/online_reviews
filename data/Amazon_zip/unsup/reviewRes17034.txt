This place is as pretencious as it gets...but it is totally worth checking out, just get here early. They don't have a sign...you can't find it if you "dont know"...The place has a yellow lightbulb by its door, that's it. No reservations. Get there early and put your name down by the host/hostess, and hope that you dont have to wait. If you get here before 8 you likely will be ok...though I did once come here with a group of 10 girls at 10pm and we were seated immediately, and I believe we pissed off the 25 people in line.  They don't allow cell phones inside (i kind of like this rule!) They have a hilarious list of house rules (ie don't order anything with "bomb" in the name) The dark and stormy is one of my favorites ever...better than Girl and the Goat...not as good as the one in Boston (Drink). Drinks are $12, and they are strong! The decor is great, kind of this Victorian feel...great date place, chill yet swanky...and yes you better look nice here. It's pretty dark which sets the mood pretty well, and it's never over crowded, but I don't think I've ever seen it quiet either. I think they only seat people per chair so that it doesn't turn into a crowded mob (again, like this rule) If you are a U2 fan...Bono had a private party here about 2 years ago...that's pretty sweet ! Check this place out, at least once...bring your out of town friends, and dress up! But get here early!
