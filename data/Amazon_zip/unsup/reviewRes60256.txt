60 types of Brick Oven Pizza, and great Charbroiled Chicken..You just don't see any place around that does what Fogo does as well as they do it...You would think that 1 would be better than the other, but our family just loves all their food. Sundays have become our Whole Chicken Dinner day from Fogo, and Thursday or Fridays are our Fogo pizza night. The staff knows us by name, and you can tell that they know a lot of regulars by name. The Buffalo Chicken, Prosciuto and Arugula, and Quatro Formaggi are probably our most ordered pizzas, but sometimes the kids just want a good old Pepperoni or Sausage(good sausage on theirs).  We have noticed that the restaurant keeps getting busier and busier, which is great to see in a little family business. We do call ahead to get in and out quickly for dinner, and grab slices on the weekend too for lunch(just sit down for those). We haven't been to another pizzeria this year, and look forward to our weekly trek toquench our chicken and pizza needs.Keep it up FOGO!!!!!!
