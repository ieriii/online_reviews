Behold RJ's wall of fame. Decades of waitresses are immortalized in photos that somehow all look like they're from the 70s, just like the rest of the decor in the restaurant. It's a time machine life-sized diorama of disco days and wood paneled everything.  R.J. Grunts has out-of-this-world burgers and a decent draft list, along with surprisingly friendly service. Three times, with separate circles of friends, I've been here for bachelor parties and the waitstaff is always accommodating. It's a must-try Chicago landmark and a good spot to take visitors.
