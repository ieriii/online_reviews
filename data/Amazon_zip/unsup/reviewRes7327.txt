Lena, executive chef, came to our private birthday room to thank us and ask how everything was---now thats what I call outstanding service! Lena, lets get down to your DELICIOUS menu and thank you for your kindness and BBQ bliss that is Chicago Q..... We snacked on sweet pickles and BBQ sprinkled, light, crunchy potato chips that were on the table waiting to be devoured as we walked in. The way to do it, is to make a sweet pickle sandwich with two chips and crunch your way to goodness. Next up came our appetizer order---you HAVE to get the smoked dry-rub wings; def some of the best wings Ive ever had in the city. Hush puppies?!?! Oh yes, bacon/cheddar hush puppies, and they certainly didnt disappoint, esp with the chipotle dipping sauce. The salad had elements of hominy, smoked corn and black beans, which also had a southwestern, savory smokiness to it. By this point, I was feeling pretty food drunk happy so you can only imagine how 'hammered' I was with the main courses we ordered. KOBE BEEF ribs.....I mean.....they were dinosaur bones and worth every juicy bite. One rib took me about 10 minutes to eat! The pulled pork and chicken were outstanding and tender. I LOVE all of the dipping sauce choices so that each bite had a different savory flavor. My absolute favorite kind of coleslaw, honey butter and poblano pepper cornbread, and creamy, gooey mac and cheese rounded out the sides. I am so happy this BBQ place popped up in Gold Coast--good 'ole BBQ comfort food that shouldnt be missed!
