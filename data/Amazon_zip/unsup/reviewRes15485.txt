We were walking down Clark looking for a place to sit down and have a good pizza. I let Yelp lead us here.  Well, service was excellent! The servers, bussers, and manger were very nice.  But the pizza was not so tasty. We had a thin crust, which is one of my favorite styles of pizza. This didn't do it for me, though. And though we picked out flavorful veggies toppings, their taste was somehow masked by the sauce and cheese.  A large pizza is huge, especially if you've had some of the breadbasket beforehand. The prices are ok for 1 topping, but each additional topping beyond the first costs something like $4.
