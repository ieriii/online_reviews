3.4 stars. The place looks like a fast food joint if you're coming down Milwaukee. The neon ATM sign is more prominent at night than the sign that says Irazu. The food though is quite good. Get one of the big plates with a bunch of chicken or other meat and you'll be happy. The sandwiches were good, but not great, and my mango shake wasn't nearly as good as I expected after reading the reviews on here. For the prices and interesting food I would definitely go back, but I wouldn't bring my parents or anyone that's put off by the grimy exterior.
