Pequod's Pizza is simply good as hell. (provided you think hell is awesome, like I do. I am Ronnie James Dio, after all) The pan style saaaasage, (Ditka), Peperoni, and Peperoncini pizza truly kicks ass. I highly recommend that you purchase this foodstuff. This place definitely competes as a top choice when ordering Chicago style pizza. I stand behind this good review, and hope that Pequod's will supply me with a free pizza for my efforts.
