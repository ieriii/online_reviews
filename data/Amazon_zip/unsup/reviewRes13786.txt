Been waiting for this to open for what seems like years, and we were excited to check out the newcomer to the 'hood. The interior was woody and inviting, with a nice bright storefront. The place was very busy for mid-afternoon, but I guess that's to be expected when it's new. The amber ales I had were pretty good. A little thinner than I expected but tasty all the same. Also checked out the bacon fat popcorn, which is The Sh*t! My burger was tasty, not the best ever but far & away better than the place across the street. Wife's salad (no clue of the name but had candied walnuts) was kickass. It's pretty kid friendly too, and a good mix of people in there. I'm sure it'll get more stars as we cozy up, but they are off to a great start. Note: it ain't cheap.
