Fancy Restaurant, but OK food. It seems that the food has been frozen and is not too fresh. A couple of things went wrong during our dinner on a Saturday night. My mom ordered a Chicken with Risotto - when the order came in it was not Risotto it was Jazmin Rice. The other person in my party ordered a beef risotto, and it tasted like fried rice, no Italian flavors at all.  I had a salad with salmon. For the size and the price was a good deal, but nothing out of the ordinary. For dessert we had a chocolate lava cake, and it was very dry :(. Overall it is an OK restaurant for a good salad and a glass of wine if you don't want to spend a fortune. However, there are better restaurants and steak houses in the city. I believe they need someone in the kitchen with more experience and culinary knowledge.
