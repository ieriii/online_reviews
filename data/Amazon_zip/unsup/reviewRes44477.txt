The bakery itself looks pretty cool, but that's not what I want to talk about. What I want to talk about is the fact that the adjoining "lounge" is always chock-full of macbooks, and their too-cool-for-school owners. I'm a writer, ok? So, sometimes I need to get out of the house and go somewhere so I can concentrate in order to get my very, very important, Pulitzer-esque WORK done in a timely manner because I work on a DEADLINE, ok folks? However, on the Sunday afternoon I walked into this dump, I was blinded by lit-up apples, flannel and it wreaked of stale PBR and bike locks. I made a face (think lip snarl, head cock, eyebrow raise with a sudden jolt of the neck) to all of those jerks and took my own MACBOOK PRO elsewhere (Starbucks, so disgusting and not at all cool).
