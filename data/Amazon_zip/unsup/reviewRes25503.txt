WOW. I bought a Groupon for Geja's a few months ago and it almost expired before I made it here but boy, am I glad I managed to squeeze it in. Geja's is an amazing little maze of a restaurant. Whilst mostly a date spot, I actually went with two friends, and it wasn't entirely awkward. In fact, I would recommend breaking the norm and bringing your friends along for the experience! Everything about Geja's is wonderful. The atmosphere, the service, and most of all the food. Like I need an excuse to eat melted cheese or fry things in hot oil? Step out of my way, I've got my bib on already! Geja's has a fairly extensive wine list but if you have trouble picking I recommend ordering one of the wine flights. They do a fairly good job of pairing your wines for your meal in this regard and I found that their selections were both appropriate and entirely YUM. Of course, you can always make your own selections, or, should you prefer, ask for assistance in ordering from the regular wine list.
