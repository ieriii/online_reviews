Came here on our trip to Chicago for Fathers Day brunch and it was awesome. I was a little hesitant to go to a Mexican type cuisine for brunch but it was very tasty and you get a TON of food for the value. You get a 3 course tasting menu (2 items per course) AND a whole buffet to choose from. The buffet includes fresh fruit, muffins, breads, pastries, a WHOLE pig, smoked salmon, spicy spanish chorizo and cheeses among other things. The buffet is tasty, fresh and awesome. The tasting menu was also delicious. Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almond and blue cheese, truffle hollandaise eggs benidict on brioche, shrimp and grits with short ribs, etc. ALSO- bottomless bloody mary bar is amazing. All the spices are set up for you to add, big prawns, veggies, different types of tomato juice, mix, salsa, gazpacho. And they use Svedka which is well above well vodka. If you are a bloody mary fan this part makes it worth it just to check the place out. If you are not into bloodys you can do bottomless mimosas, sangria (white or red) or mimosas. I highly reccomend this spot and the service is great. The waitress seemed very patient and helpful despite having alot on her plate.
