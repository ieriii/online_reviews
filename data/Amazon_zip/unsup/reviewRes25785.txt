The tastiest, most flavorful vegetarian 'pho' I've ever had! I also love the eggplant clay pot. Vegetarians should def check it out. It's the best lunch spot in the north side. I would stay away from anything seafood...it's bad enough to completely keep you from ever returning. My only complaint being that the food seems to be on the salty side, but then again most Asian food seems to be that way probably because of the sauces they use.
