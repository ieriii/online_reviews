A total steal. In February Kimpton offered $44 off best rate rooms to celebrate the man himself, Obama. Our room totaled $103/night and despite the reviews, I thought it was spacious enough for a weekend with one other person. The bathroom was tiny yes, and you can hear *everything* going on in there from the bedroom but hey, it happens.  Aveda Rosemary Mint shampoo and conditioner + bath soup and face bar, beautiful and cozy linens and a very attentive staff as I've come to expect from Kimpton!  Great location -- walking distance to Intelligentsia and a few other key spots, and quiet on the higher floors. I'll definitely be back if there's another deal!  Otherwise, I'm rather anxious to try the other Kimpton spaces in Chicago.
