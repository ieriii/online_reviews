SOOOO GOOD! My friend who just moved to Chicago is a huge Rick Bayless fan and had been raving to me about this place over the phone, so I knew we had to try it when I went to visit! This place was amazing... You MUST try their Bloody Maria's, they make their own mix and its to die for! Also, their Mojitos are great, especially the Watermelon one! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, its all fabulous. The indigenous pancakes were great and the guacamole is EXCELLENT!! They change their menu depending on whether you go for Brunch or Dinner so check out both times for the full experience. Be ready to wait, but its well worth it. Especially if you have a few drinks and an appetizer at the bar!
