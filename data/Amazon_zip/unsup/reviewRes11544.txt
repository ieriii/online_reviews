Went there today for breakfast/lunc time and your hostess was not very friendly or accomdating. I asked to be seating in the back booth and she said NO, that's for a larger party of four or more---guess what we had 3 and we didn't want to be sitting in the table in front of the door. The booth was never taken by anyone and was vacant the whole time. I am the customer and I am paying the bill- I should be seated where I want if it is available-----that's what good customer service is---so was turned off on my first time at our place. Food was good and alot of different combination of tastes. Great waitress and good coffee--took for ever to get our food---too loud of music, and very noisy to start with.          The hostess, not so tasteful or tactful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Bleach Blonde hostess was the culprit!!!! Other hostess was very nice! I wouldn't hurry back!
