Being gluten free can be a PITA. I attended a retirement party luncheon today and the meal was pre selected. I know Wilddfire has gluten free bread, so I asked the server if it would be possible to get some. I figured I'd eat the things I knew were safe and enjoy the bread. I was pleasantly surprised when the kitchen prepared me my entire meal gluten free including a my own gluten free pizza and yummy flourless chocolate cake. Thank you Wildfire for offering GREAT gluten free options and having a staff that doesn't act put out by food allergies.
