Simply It is the best place to do Byob with a big group of people. There is no corkage fee or restriction on what you can bring. The first time I went we were with a group of 10 and brought bottles of wine, a bottle of vodka, club soda and some limes. They accommodated us with cocktail and wine glasses for everybody without saying anything about it. The food was delicious and the wait staff was very friendly. I had the chicken fried rice and it may have been the best in town. I have been back twice since the first visit and Simply It never disappoints.
