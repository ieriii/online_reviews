I'm not writing a review for Kuma's because it irritates me and I'm determined to be a positive yelper (to an extent) So stop spending hours puttering around clogging up the doorway and Kuma's and come here and you will be happy. I personally think the burgers are better, the beef almost melts in your mouth, which I didn't even know could happen. Salads are surprisingly good too. All burgers are very tasty that I've had so far, and they give you chips and dip right when you sit down, thank god. Also, the fries are better than Kuma's, which to me is more important than the burger. And if you are desperate to eat your food with horrible music blaring, they have you covered, so no worries!
