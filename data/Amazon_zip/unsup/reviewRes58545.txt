The pizza is as good as it is in Italy! I took my 83 year-old mom to Spacca Napoli and she said the pizza was as good as the the pizza she used to make herself while growing up in Italy. Her family had a forno de legno (wood oven). Jonathan, the owner, is gracious and hospitable. On our 2nd visit, he remembered us and brought over a little glass of prosecco as a little welcome back gesture. Little touches like that make the experience all the better. I was afraid the service would get compromised with the expansion, but everything is running as efficiently as ever. The sidewalk tables are terrific because they're on a sidestreet. Traffic and exhaust smoke aren't issues. You'll never be rushed and the service is always cheerful and friendly.I love the daily specials but what I really appreciate is that the wine selections are not at all pretentious and they're reasonably priced.Spacca Napoli will quickly become one of your favorite places to dine.
