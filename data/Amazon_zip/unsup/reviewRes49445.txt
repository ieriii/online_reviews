Went here before going to see a show and was pleasantly surprised. I expected the wine to be great and the food to be OK, but it was actually the opposite. Wine: we did the bin 36 flight, I do not recommend this flight. None of the wines were bad, but there was nothing exciting about any of them. I would try a different flight or make my own next time Cheese: we did the American cheese flight and it was amazing. This is a must have in my eyes. What moved Bin 36 from 3 stars to 4 stars is the fact that they carried 2 cheeses from Zingermans, one of my favorite places in Ann Arbor. In the American cheese flight you get the Bridgewater from Zingermans which is superb. Soup & Salad: we had the market salad and shrimp bisque were both very good. I would say that the salad is a must have with great fresh pepper, brie, pears, and vinaigrette dressing. Meal: we had the marlin which which came on a bed of mashed potatoes and topped with onion rings. The dish was fantastic, lots of pepper, well cooked, and a lot of flavors going on. Atmosphere: Nice open space with a very welcoming feel. The two person tables on the side are close together, but that is pretty common for the city, I feel.
