YUMMY!!! This place is in walking distance from my friend's house, we went for dinner on a week night. Not too busy! He had the stuffed pepper appetizer which looked delicious and he loved it! I don't eat red meat so I didn't try it. I had the traditional cuban sandwich, it was awesome reminded me of Miami. Service was pretty good, not amazing but not horrible!  I have been told the weekends are crazy at this place.
