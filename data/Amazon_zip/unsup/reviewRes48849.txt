The place is laughable, the bill isn't. Snarky waitstaff-and by waitstaff I mean the FIVE different people that came by with food: one brought beer, one explained the menu, one brought the food, one brought the desert, the check BUT THE SERVICE SUCKED. The only people working hard there are the busboys. The food sucked. Overly salted. If you like overly salted, fatty food-this is your place. The desert was a dry, stale 'cherry' brownie with a teaspoon of ice cream. What is the big deal? The beer? The noise? The posers? The snotty hostess-bots in black that ignore you when you walk in? Yucky. Icky. Expensive. NOT relazing. Tries to hard to be cool making i tres uncool. I hope they go out of business.
