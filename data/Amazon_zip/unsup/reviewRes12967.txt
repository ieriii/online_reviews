First time here and I was very impressed. 20 minute wait on a Friday evening sped by with a pretty darn good mojito. Had the ceviche to start, was extremly fresh and tasty. Onto the main course... Everytime I see duck for some reason I order it, maybe cuz I just cant pick up duck at jewel and cook it like I can a steak. Soooo duck it was. Server recommended medium or medium rare (which was nice) and of course I went with medium rare. This was the best duck I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and a decent portion. The potatoes were lacking a bit, but who really cares. GF got the porkchops... When the server put down the place I was extremly jealous. They give you two mammouth chops that nobody will be able to finish there. She was only able to finish one chop (with my help) and it was awesome. They server it with sweet potatoes which complimented it perfectly. Make sure someone at your table orders these.
