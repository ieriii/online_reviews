I had my birthday dinner here and it was very very fun. The atmosphere was great. There were salsa dancers and live music. We waited an obscene amount of time for my reserved table, but were given chips and guac to make up for it. Our waiter was quite friendly. He gave great recommendations. I had the fish tacos and shrimp ceviche. I recommend both! One friend got a side of french fries, and after several margaritas/sangria/mojitos, they were "the best." I love this place for big groups. Its loud though, so prepare to yell. By the end of the night, I was meringue dancing with the waiter and just about singing Carnivale's praises.
