Fabulous service, divine food, short wait, comfortable seating, all-in-all a great great place to eat. I had the Chop House Burger with fries. I added cheddar cheese and bacon to it, and the burger came cooked perfectly. My friend had the chicken parmesan, and he said it was delicious as well. Don't get dessert if you don't want to pop a gut. We followed the main courses with a chocolate fudge cake that was out of this world. The only thing that beat the food was our server. She was attentive, helpful, and seemed to smile the entire evening. It's nice to see people that are genuinely happy to be doing what they do, and she so clearly was. When you add on that it's located at Ontario and Michigan in the greatest little big city in the world, you have an amazing time. I couldn't recommend this place any more.
