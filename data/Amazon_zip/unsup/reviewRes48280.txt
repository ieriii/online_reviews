I went to the Publican again a few weeks ago, for brunch this time after a girl's weekend and everyone was extremely happy with their meals. At the same time, we all agreed that while everything tasted great, our service was good (not great), and we had a good time, we probably wouldn't make it a point to come back again. Same experience my friends (a different group) had when we had dinner there a year ago. Good experience, good food that isn't necessarily found everywhere, but nothing special according to my group(s) of friends.
