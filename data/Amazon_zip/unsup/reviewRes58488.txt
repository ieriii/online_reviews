I saw this restaurant reviewed on the show Check Please! (which i watch religiously) and decided to go with my sister the next day. I also made sure that we went to the right location.My sister and I weren't really interested in any of the sweet/dessert crepes because most of the things they put in them you can just buy yourself, so went straight for the savory crepes. There were no more than 10 different kinds of crepes listed and they all seemed to have the same things in them except for one extra topping whatever it may be. To be honest, i couldn't really tell the difference between all of them, so i got the Chicago Crepe (the extra topping was avocado) and my sister got the Icosium Crepe (which had generally the same things in it as mine). I ordered a bit of smoked salmon on the side in case the crepe needed something extra. Also, i just love smoked salmon.When the food came, it looked good. When it went in my mouth, it was not. This crepe was so damn oily and greasy, and not from the ingredients in it, but because of the added cooking oil. The review i had seen said the crepes were fresh and light but all the vegetables had dead colors--there was no vibrance to the food. Besides that, the ingredients totally clashed. Each one sounded good by itself, but all together they overpowered one another, which made tasting and enjoying the food hard. The smoked salmon was not fresh and was not smoked. It was more like a thin, discolored, cooked filet of fish. My sister's tasted exactly the same. In the end we decided to cut our losses. I picked off the 3 slices of tasteless cheese and took the crepe off of mine, only eating the oily vegetables.We paid 36 bucks including tip and it just made me sad.I had really hoped to have a good experience based on the other yelps. Maybe their strength is with the breakfast crepes?
