Had a great lunch here on a beautiful spring day while killing a few hours before our flight to London. The space itself is really cool, and the lunch menu has a great variety of food options - everything from pub fare (sandwiches, burgers) to tasty sounding salads. Definitely a good stop off place if you find yourself in the Michigan Ave/Millenium Park area.
