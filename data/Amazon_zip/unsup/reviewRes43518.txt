This is one of my favorite brunch spots. I love the Orange Brioche French Toast and Huevos Rancheros. Although there are a lot of other tasty items on the menu and everything looks super yummy and really good quality - not a greasy spoon joint. Make sure to have some time to wait in line if you are going during the rush (around noon) and I wouldn't go with more than 4 people as there is not a ton of seating. It is also semi self-serve so don't expect fancy service. I don't mind it though - I would rather get my own water and pay less for my meal. ;)
