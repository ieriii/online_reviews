Crisp is definitely one of those places I get cravings for. Their chicken is amazing. I've had both the Seoul Sassy and Korean BBQ.  Having me pick which one I like better would be like asking me to pick a favorite child. I had walked by this place several times before finally deciding to try it out and I'm glad I did. Now I'm back every other week or so to get my fix. The other stuff on the menu looks good, but I've been hesitant to try since I like the fried chicken so much.
