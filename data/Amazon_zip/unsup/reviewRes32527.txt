Pretty good venue, tried it thanks to groupon! Loved the sharing of food aspect and the coffee was really top notch! The Reason why I would not give it a five start review is because the service was too slow. It was not that busy and we actually had to wave waitresses down to get water and plates moved to have more space. But plenty of street parking and the food was good! Will return when I go to the green mill across the street!
