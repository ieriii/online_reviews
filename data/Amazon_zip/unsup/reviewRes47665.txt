So I base my rating on the following... 3 stars for the food, 1 star for the lounge/outdoor area. Let me start off w/ the food which is good, but not great. My meal started out very well, as they have an outstanding salad bar w/ focaccia breads, meats/cheeses, and tons of inventive side dish plates and spreads. Our waiter brought us these little seafood coctail shooters which were quite good as well. We also received this jalapeno cornbread to our table that was so good i could have eaten that all day. I tried this cranberry seasonal mixed drink which was awesome, w/ hints of cinnamon and ginger in it.   Now to be honest, the meats were a little disappointing. There were a few good highlights, like the bottom sirloin, portugese sausage, and glazed chicken. But the ribs were mediocre, as was one or two of the beef options which were either too salty or too fatty. They did come around w/ some seared ahi tuna and fried mahi mahi which were pretty good. In general I thought the selection was a bit limited, and we had to specifically ask for certain items like the beef ribs. Despite our full stomachs, 4 of us split the graham cracker smores dessert which was outstanding. There was this great graham cracker crust w/ rich, gooey chocolate and marshmallows inside w/ ice cream and some brittle type of stuff on the outside... outstanding!! So the lounge/outdoor area, on the other hand, are pretty sweet. The lounge is small but very inviting w/ the rockin fireplace warming things up and huge projector showing the daily sports events. During spring/summer you must check out the outdoor space on the second level, it's truly a unique and awesome experience. Don't forget to get there early because it's starts to fill up fast on the weekends!  I'll def be back for drinks and loungin, but probably not for the food. Maybe I just can't eat enough meat to make it worth it :)
