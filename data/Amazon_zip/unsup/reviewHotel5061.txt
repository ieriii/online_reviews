I don't write many reviews, but when I do it is for something extraordinary. That is a perfect word to describe the experience at the james Hotel. I recommend the jamesn Hotel, dining as a perfect destination for either an in-town getaway or overnight business stay. I travel frequently, and stay in a lot of nice hotels, but the experience we had here is near or at the top of our "Best of" list.My wife and I recently celebrated our anniversary with a little in-town getaway, which doubled as a babymoon. The hotel is simply beautiful -- elegant yet open and comfortable. The staff are incredibly nice, and the policy of not accepting gratuity was surprising and graceful. They are there to help you, simple as that. The rooms are comfortable and spacious, quiet and well appointed. A terrific experience, which I highly recommend.
