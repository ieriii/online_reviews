Move over, Viaggio? Ummm....uhhh...it's close...very close. Like everyone has already mentioned, its BYOB, the portions are huge, and the food is delicious. It was Saturday night, and they don't take reservations for parties under 6. I was worried the wait would be hours. Luckily, they found a little table for my date and I, wait time = 0 mins.  After eating 2 loaves of bread with olive oil and parmesan, I was ready for the appetizer. I went with the crowd and ordered bruschetta, which was mouth watering. They just take a slab of fresh mozzarella and thump it on top of garlic tomatoes and put it on a little piece of bread. Very simple, very awesome.  She had the salmon picatta, I had the chicken parmesan. The chicken breast they used must've been from Foghorn Leghorn, because it was damn near the size of the table. Each bite was better than the last. I say this a lot but rarely mean it....I can't wait to go back.
