What a zoo on a Saturday night. Had reservations, but it was a good 1/2 hour late in seating us and the front of the restaurant with the bar was elbow to elbow and no chance to sit and wait. It was apparent that they were overbooked. It didn't bode well for dinner. Strangely, after getting seated, everything else was slick and fast. Food was good, but somewhat inconsistent. The crostini is really good, the calamari (both grilled and fried) were super good. I had the alleged spicy spaghetti, which was anything but. Good, just not spicy as advertised. However, GOOD LORD are those HUGE portions. The lasagna that one of our party got could have served a small family. My pasta bowl could have easily served two. Was it a place I would go out of my way to get to again... no. Would I go back if invited by a friend or if we were in the area. Yah, probably. Not on the hot list, but not on the "not" list either.
