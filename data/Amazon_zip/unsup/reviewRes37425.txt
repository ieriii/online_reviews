I wish I could afford to live or work close enough to stop by here at the end of the day to pick up dinner. I still make the drive from the North side to treat myself once in a while. The bakery items are always enticing. Their red velvet cake I had for my birthday one year was divine. The deli and pre-made dishes are worth a try. A couple things were just ok for me. The cafe is good enough to have a quick and tasty lunch before taking on a tourist mammoth like Navy Pier. Yup, I just admitted I did that. If you're willing to splurge a little and splurge at least $20 for free parking in the nearby garage, stop by for great service and selections.
