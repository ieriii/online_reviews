Thank god I wasn't paying for this one! If you want a crazy dining experience and have the patience to sit through four hours of dining, then please check this place out. But honestly, they are just too full of themselves here. I didn't want to talk as I was afraid I would disrupt the cathedral to food. The wine pairing was outrageously expensive considering most wines came from Serbia. The food was certainly an adventure and an experience I'm glad I had. I particularly liked the six shot glasses full of vegetable extracts that were lined up in front of us. The deep fried pork belly hanging on a wire was also intriguing.
