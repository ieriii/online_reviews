Mmmm - yummy yet pricey! The food here is what you can expect from a world class chef, and the prices are commensurate with those expectations. Portions are fairly small, at least in the dishes we tried - but delicious! Love the uniqueness of the menu items, very creative and intriguing pairings of ingredients. The drinks are wonderful as well. Be prepared to wait a long time on weekends; we hung in the bar and hawked a table from someone leaving - with full menu in the bar area and somewhat comfortable seating, you'll get seated much quicker. Not your typicall Mexican restaurant; it's worth the prices to try a Bayless restaurant at least once in your life!
