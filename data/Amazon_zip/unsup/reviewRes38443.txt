ive only been here once but from that experience i have to say that i like this place and will be back again. went in later on a saturday night. it wasn't too crowded, the door guy was very nice, and they had a good selection of beers. also, it's pretty huge, much larger than i would've expected looking at it from the outside. the crowd was pretty mellow, probably mid/late 20s and older, which is great because seriously i'm too old to be dealing with freshly legal half-naked 21-year olds who get trashed and start scream talking and then vomit on themselves. which is to say, this place is no hamilton's. thank jeebus.
