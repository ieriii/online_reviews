I guess I should have known better than to try again, but Sultan's just majorly screwed up our order and refused to fix it for the second time... (There have been several smaller screw-ups, but this was the second one big enough for us to swear them off forever. No third chances though!) My coworker ordered for us, and ordered me the egg and cheese fettia with extra hummus. I got the egg and cheese pie with no hummus in sight. (The fettia comes with lettuce, tomato, onion and hummus with the egg and cheese; the pie is just pieces of bread with egg and cheese baked on it). I called to ask for the right thing to be sent, and whoever answered the phone just completely stonewalled me. He said my coworker said "egg and cheese pie" and refused to believe me when I asked her for sure and told him she said "egg and cheese fettia"... he said I'd have to pay if I wanted the fettia. My other coworker also requested extra hot sauce on her sandwich, and ended up with no sauce at all, and a dry falafel sandwich. Anyway, they finally lost a lot of customers from one business, not that I think they care that much. The food is boring compared to many other places that just don't deliver to Wicker Park, so I guess I'll have to travel to Albany Park when I want to eat decent Middle Eastern food...
