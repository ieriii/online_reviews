First off, The Strawberry Fields martini was superb! I ran in here one windy, cold spring day with my oldest son.  The small Cesar salad was really tasty. I had the fish and chips, also tasty. The reason why I didn't give them any more stars was that it was definitely not crowded during the week. And it was an epic lunch. (meaning the time-wise spent waiting for our food)
