When we order deep dish pizza, we usually go with Lou Malnati's. Tonight, we decided to try something different, so we went with Art of Pizza. To put it simply: we'll be going back to Lou's next time. We ordered a 12" stuffed pizza with half pepperoni and half spinach. Delivery time was pretty standard - about an hour. The price was a little high - $21.95 (including a hefty $2.95 delivery charge). Tack on $4 for tip and the total was $25.95. Unfortunately, it was totally not worth it. We agree with Matt L below - the sauce was really not very good (too sweet), and there wasn't much cheese. There also wasn't much pepperoni. The crust was ok, but nothing amazing. Definitely wouldn't order again and wouldn't recommend.
