Quite simply - loved it. I've been hearing about this place for a while and it is imfamously impossible to get in to on weekends, so I tried out a lazy mid-week afternoon. First of all, the service was excellent. My server (wish I got his name for the review) was only to happy to talk through the different beers with me and to suggest food pairings. Let's just say that two beers, and appetizer and a burger later and I was in culinary heaver. Started with a lighter Belgian beer (orange, coriander) and the bacon popcorn. Moved on to the burger with crimini mushrooms and a darker beer that lasted post-meal into my relaxed browse through the newspaper. I'll be back for sure!
