A really wonderful Middle Eastern restaurant. It's a bit nicer than the hole-in-the-wall places and a bit more expensive. But the range of meals is also much broader. And must tastier than Reza's for Andies, otehr popular and good Middle Eastern spots. The fessenjen is one of my favorite dishes -- a stew that is cornish hen in a sauce made with finely ground walnuts and pomegranate. On the meny, they have some dishes that they mark as "highly recommended Persian specials." I have always loved those dishes. And they're one of the things that make this restaurant better than others. Their kebabs are also really good but I wouldn't get more than one of those per group.
