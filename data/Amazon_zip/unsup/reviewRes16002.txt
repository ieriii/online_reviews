If you are in the mood to kick off a romantic evening with a nocturnal "cocktail as meal" experience, The Violet Hour will set the mood nicely. The motif of The Violet Hour is secret speakeasy -- no signs out front, dark decor inside. The secrecy works as far as the nondescript white front and blend in door is concerned, but, really, the valet parking easel out front gives the game away. But, no matter, the cocktails inside are well made. The bourbon/rye list is small but well chosen, and the manhattan was perfectly balanced between the vermouth and bitters. I particularly enjoyed the custom massive ice cube with my manhattan - it doesn't melt, keeping the cocktail cold and strong. The egg cocktail was excellent as well. You will, however, pay for the privilege of those well made drinks. The prices are as tall as the high backed chairs in the first room. And speaking of those chairs, they do create privacy, but at the expense of lounging. I prefer easing back into a club chair when sipping manhattans, not practicing my posture. But again, a small quibble if you are going there early to kick off an evening, rather than staying there all night. Which would be my recommendation to you -- avoid the lines and avoid the hassle by making this your first stop for the evening. A little Violet goes a long way.
