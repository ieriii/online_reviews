Ok. my girlfriend and I were there on a Sunday and the place was almost empty, everything was fine in the beginning. We got our first round of drinks on time but it took a lot of effort to get the attention of the bartender after that. Finally, we had to go up to the bar to get another drink and silverware, and ketchup.... you get my point? She was really inattentive and the service was slow. The food was pretty good it was just really nerve racking that there was a total of 2 tables in the whole bar area and we couldn't get anything on time. Will I come back? Maybe.
