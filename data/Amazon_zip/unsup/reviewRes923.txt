I am late to the game on this one, but better late than never, right? FINALLY I made the time to try some of the delicious pieces of heaven sold at Hot Doug's. Between 2 of us, we ordered 4 sausages and an order of duck fat fries. A little gluttonous, but how can you blame us! It was way too hard to choose! Every single one was DELICIOUS. Everything about it - sausage was perfectly prepared and cooked, the toppings/meat ratio was perfect, the bun is impressively soft and the fries were sneakily amazing too! I want so badly to go back, but it is such an investment of time. It is only open for lunch and there is always a line on weekends so I doubt that will happen anytime soon since we are approaching hibernation season. However, if I am home on a weekday anytime I am definitely making my way over there! BEWARE - check the website before you go. I tried to go awhile back with a friend of mine and it was CLOSED! They close anytime the owner is not there and apparently announce when they are closed on the website.
