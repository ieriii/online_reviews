I almost didn't want to write a review on this place, but then I saw that over 70 other people already did. I guess the secret's out. This is the best neighborhood Italian restaurant in Lincoln Park. I love the fact that it's in an old house. Super charming, the food is amazing, the wine is great, the service always good. I have never tried anything on the menu that made me say "Meh" -- everything is always "Mmm". Let's just try to keep this secret to us city folk though, okay?
