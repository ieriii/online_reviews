I love it. I'd seen this place every day on my way home from work, but it only stood out to me. I had no desire to try it until I read the reviews only after a friend told me this place brings him to Wicker Park (from Hyde Park). So, I came here with some coworkers for lunch. I had the lamb shwerma sandwich. It was awesome as was the service. The guys who work here are pretty cute too, on a side note. I've come back already. The only thing I didn't find to be as tasty as it is in Hyde Park is the hummus. I like my hummus here in HP, and the lentil soup matches to my favorite place for middle eastern food in Hyde Park. Otherwise, this place is glorious.  The atmosphere is just as nice and relaxing. Something to know before coming... CASH ONLY (although they do have an ATM inside)
