Two words: Irish Benny. This savory delight is a eggs benedict with corned beef hash. Holy. Snap. Good. Probably the best breakfast dish I have ever eaten. The food selection is awesome, lots of different things to choose from. The wait is usually pretty significant if you go on weekend mornings, but it really isn't that bad if the weather is nice, otherwise, there isn't that large of a place for the throngs to wait. Negatives: I don't care for the coffee they have here, the restaurant is OMG loud with all those people in there, and the service can be pokey with so many people in there.
