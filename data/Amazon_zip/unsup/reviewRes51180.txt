I've been to Big Jones a handful of times, and I have always left satisfied. I feel lucky to have it in the neighborhood. With the large selection of restaurants around, it is strangely comforting to know it's there to turn to, when you have a hankering for solid filling food! it is definitely my go-to fall-back option for an easy dinner out. It has looked crowded a few times, but we have never had to wait to get a table. Once we sat at the bar. I prefer brunch to dinner. My favorite is the Eggs New Orleans. Despite other yummy looking options on the menu, it is still the best. The beignets are a nice perk, though sometimes they are really amazing and sometimes they are just ok.
