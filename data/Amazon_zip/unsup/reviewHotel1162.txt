Downtown, free parking, indoor pool, fitness center, and free WiFi....for less than $90 on Valentine's Day! Looks like it doesn't get any better than that...right? On paper this place looks great but it didn't rank very high IMHO...I would have given it 1 star but the free parking was worth a star. Checking in, I got the first glimpse of their customer service...or lack there of. We got a standard king, it was a little smaller than I expected...but not so small that I felt claustrophobic. The Internet access was a piece of cake to login to. The noise on the street wasn't too obnoxious from the third floor. However, the elevators were ridiculously slow...I was better off taking the stairs. The icing on the cake in our hotel experience...finding there was NO hot water in the morning! My hubby had a big meeting early that day and was less than thrilled to discover this fact. When I called the front desk, I was told maintenance wouldn't be available for another 2 hours. Nothing like a cold shower to wake you up. While the hubby was at his meeting, I took full advantage of the fitness center. It was pretty lame, only 4 pieces of equipment: treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike and multipurpose weight machine in a tiny little room. Lucky for me I was the only one there and had the place to myself. Not only was the fitness center small but it was HOT, there was no air circulation, venting, fan or window I could open. It was a little hot box. Plus, the water jug they had in there was empty. I checked back on the status of the hot water issue before heading back up to the room and the front desk said that maintenance didn't find anything wrong with the water and they were sorry for the misunderstanding. I'm pretty sure the hubby didn't misunderstand that he had to take an ice bath of a shower earlier that morning. One star for free parking and one for free wifi & location...never going back, Chicago has a ton of other hotel's.
