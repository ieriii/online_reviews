Went back one more time, like I said before stick with Kuma's. This place is trying to hard to copy that. I tried a new burger and was the same as the last time I was there, just nothing special about it. What is up with some of the people who hang around here? Not sure if they own the place or they work there but come on. Tried it out two times and that will be it for me. Maybe if this place had super low prices I would say try it out, but this is the city you can find amazing food on any corner don't need to deal with mediocre bar food.
