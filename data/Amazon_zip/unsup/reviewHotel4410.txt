Enjoyed my stay while on a business trip. The Palmer House Hilton is nearby a variety of city attractions, great shopping, modern and swanky restaurants, great lobby! The concierge staff were very attentive, great room service, although a bit pricey but the food was great....though do not use the business center and gym, you have to pay for the service (WHAT!?!?). I very much enjoy my room on the 29th floor, the only down side was the bathroom was on the small side and very little counter space.
