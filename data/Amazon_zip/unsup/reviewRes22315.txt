I've been here before and the food was really good but somehow everything seems to be going downhill. The wonton soup didn't have any flavor, the jumbo shrimp was definitely reheated since it was cold inside and the rest of the food was just eatable. It's sad to see how such a well known and decorated restaurant could become so horrible and overpriced :(
