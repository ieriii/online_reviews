I don't want to belabor the point. It's good. Go for the unique stuff or you may be disappointed. I mean, why wait in line for just a polish (called "Elvis" here) or a Chicago Dog (called "The Dog" here). Lots of good stuff, and even though there is a long line on any given day, be social! The crowd is fun. Oh, and check the website before you go. Sometimes the man needs a day off. Cash only.
