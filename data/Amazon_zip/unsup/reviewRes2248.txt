Came here on a Friday with my boyfriend. It's a bit far from Downtown so it was about a $20+ taxi ride from our hotel. We got there around 2:00 p.m., the line was long, but we decided to hop right in. The person in front of us told us that it was the shortest line he has ever been in and he's been to Hot Doug's five times now. It took exactly an hour to get to the counter to order. Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered five hot dogs and of course the duck fat fries. We got four specialty ones, Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel, Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Pork Sausage with Roasted Tomato Dijonnaise and Trugole Cheese, Uber Garlic Pork Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise, Blue Marble Jack Cheese and Roasted Garlic Cloves and Smoked Crayfish and Pork Sausage with Cajun Shrimp Remoulade and Queso Zamorano AND one off their regular menu, The Dog. The only one that was somewhat of a disappointment was the sun-dried tomato one. It came out a bit dry and didn't have much flavor. All the others were delicious! The duck fat fries were absolutely addicting. No ketchup or any other condiments needed. This was a great experience! Make sure you get there by 2:00 p.m. or else you're kind of cutting it close to closing.
