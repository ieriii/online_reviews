This is my favorite pie in Chicago. The concept is design your own and I usually get a standard combination, but the taste is anything but conventional. The dough is thin and crispy, but substantial enough to support the long slices. The ingredients are fresh and there are lots of options from pepperoni and peppers to mashed potatoes and clams. The home-brewed beer is delicious and they bring in new beers periodically. The price is right too. Two thumbs UP!
