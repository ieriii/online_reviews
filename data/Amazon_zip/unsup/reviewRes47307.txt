I love this place. Its like the smaller, less crowded version of Kuma's that lives in my memories only. So, there is obvious similarity to the food (big delicious burgers on pretzel buns) between Lockdown and Kuma's, but by virtue of the details I have to say i slightly prefer Lockdown. I used to eat at Kumas more regularly maybe 5-6 years ago, but as they grew more successful, and wait times got longer, I've attempted the trip less and less (even though I only live like a mile away). Now I don't begrudge Kuma's their success, but the first time I ate at Lockdown I said to myself: "now this is more like it". The burgers are delicious, they are big, but not too gargantuan (I can finish one without physical pain). The Mac and Cheese steals the show, like velveeta Mac on steroids, its so so good. The ketchup does not have horseradish in it (yay). I was also impressed by the ginger-sauced wings (perfectly fried). Service has always been great here as well. This my new favorite local burger joint. I know eventually the place will be too popular for its own good, the food is too good for it not to be.
