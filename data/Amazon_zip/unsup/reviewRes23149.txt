We expected the worst as far as a wait on a Friday night, so we were really happy when we were seated in about 10 minutes. We were seated upstairs which seemed a little less festive, albeit less crowded. Their was a nice mix of folks and a few large tables where we got to observe some of the group eating customs. I tried to spy some of the entrees that others were eating to get some ideas. I spied a table eating meat out of a boiling pot of chili sauce and my choice was made for me. The Lai Lai Lai Chicken for me and Tony's special for the wife. We started with some springs rolls which, while cooked to perfection, were a little lacking on the filling for my tastes. Still they were pretty damn good. The Lai Lai Lai was a little difficult to eat as it was chopped up chicken on the bone. However, the taste was fantastic, albeit really spicy. I couldn't stop eating it, despite almost breaking out into a sweat. The Tony's special was really good as well. A perfect blend of crispy/chewy and spicy/sweet. It's unlike anything I've really had before. We brought our own wine and they charged a $5 corkage fee. Still, it helped keep the price down. While it may have changed from the good old days, I will be more than happy to head back some time soon. It was a great dining experience (for the food, more than the ambiance of the restaurant).
