A week later and I'm back already! Went with my two vegan-loving friends and my meat-loving boyfriend. The friends loved the food. The boyfriend liked it too, just not the fake meat. I ordered a smoothie again (just as good as last time) and spaghetti with meatballs. The pasta was great as well as the accompany garlic bread. However (this is the reason I wanted to update this review), the meatballs were terrible. I thought maybe it was just because I don't like imitation meat but my two friends didn't like it either. It was taste-less, mushy, and falling apart. I'd advise against getting the meatballs.
