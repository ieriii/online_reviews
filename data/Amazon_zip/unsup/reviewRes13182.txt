Loved the cheese sauce that arrived alongisde the pretzel, and the sweet potato cakes - which reminded me of a mix between falafel and samosas! Great place to try some new beers and munch some delicious food. Be prepared to wait a bit (at the bar is always a good option), but get excited for great friendly service once you've been seated.
