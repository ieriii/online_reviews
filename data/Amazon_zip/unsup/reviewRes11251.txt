I love this place. They have THE best thin crust pizza in the city and some of the tastiest beer as well. I have tried the white pizza and the red and both are fabulous but beware, the pizzas are large, my boyfriend and I can easily share a small and sometimes take a slice or two home as leftovers. The wait can be long 45 mins to an hour around dinner time but its easy to kill some time at the bar thats filled with t.v. screens. The beer is awesome, I love the Captain Kickass. This is a must try when in Chicago!
