It's been quite awhile since I've been here, almost two years. The placed was still packed as I remember, but with more suits & tourist-looking people in large groups. The quality of the food is definitely not the same...more "Americanized". The refried beans were tasty, but didn't have the "love" like it used to. The mole sauce was definitely changed, almost similar to a taste of a mild BBQ sauce. Again, tasty but not like I remembered it. Beautiful exterior, located in a great area and lots of charm.
