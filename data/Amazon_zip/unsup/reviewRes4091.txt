This is one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've had in quite sometime. I enjoy food, but am not solely a gourmet diner. First off, you HAVE to have a reservation. They are very good about returning phone calls and since the entire kitchen staff serves as the servers, the chefs, the sous chefs, the hosts etc, it's pretty impressive. My boyfriend and I made reservations a month in advance. We got in on a cancellation, so it was pretty lucky. When we got there, they were still setting up, were extremely nice and very laid back. It had a great vibe. Small, quaint, playing great hip hop and a very polite staff. We ordered the 6 course dinner (my memory is kind of bad, I went this past February, and I feel like they gave us an extra sampling of things during dinner). It was fantastic. They were very accommodating and took the time to not only name the food, but give us an overview of the food, how it was prepared etc. It could have been that we were there on the early end, but the extra time they took answering questions, giving us information on how they cook each dish was very much appreciated. The menu changes seasonally, or as they told us, whenever they want, so it's worth making multiple trips for special occasions. I just read the article in Time Out about the reopening of this restaurant and it made me love it more.
