I'm generally a girl who likes to try new places before doing repeats so the fact that I have been to The Chicago Diner more times than I can count on one hand says a lot. The food here is fantastic. Between my various guests and I we have ordered quite a range of things on the menu and there hasn't been one miss. Among my favorites are the Seitan Wings, the Nachos (pretty sure the sauce was vegan although I got dairy sour cream, but it was still gooey and fantastic), the radical reuben, the burgers...I could go on and on and am sure I have left some of my favorites out of the mix. What I love about the food is that it is well executed and perfectly craveable. I'm not a vegetarian, but an open-minded omni and find this place to be even better than the real deal. What I love about it is it easily satisfies vegetarians, vegans and even omnis so it's a great place to go with a mixed crowd. The menu is a bit heavy on the fake meats (though I think they do them so well, among the best in chicago), but even if this isn't your thing there are many fake meat free options. The restaurant does have parking but keep in mind that like the dining room itself, it fills up quickly. In fact, even at 8:30 on a Wednesday it isn't unusual to find a crowd waiting outside so factor that into your time. However, it's generally worth the wait and keep in mind the takeout is also fantastic and prompt. My food generally takes between 20-30 minutes which seems standard and fair.
