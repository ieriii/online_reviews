This has got to be one of hottest little rooms in town. Sleek, somewhat stark, modern and hip, this is a great place to get perspective on the town of Chicago. You can watch the shower from your bed (if you are into that), there are great sound systems to hook up your Ipod, a minibar that had great stuff, and the thread count on the beds must be like, a billion. The lounge on the top floor has great views, couches and a nice booze selection. Tres sexy- the rooms are small, but hey- go there to get close:)
