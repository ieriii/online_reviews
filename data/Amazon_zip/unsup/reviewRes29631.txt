Best Thai restaurant in Lincoln Square. Whether you are dining in or ordering delivery, Opart Thai House is simply amazing. The appetizers are big and delicious and the noodle dishes are amazing too. Delivery is fast, hot and spectacular and the dining in is just as amazing. I'd suggest the Pad Se Ew. It is a perfect mix between hot, sweet and wonderful savoriness and with the perfect 'al dente' rice noodles in this flavorful dish. Opart Thai House is highly recommended for a great night in or a spectacular night out!
