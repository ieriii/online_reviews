I ate and drank here with a friend last night, and I must say I was impressed. We started with some champagne cocktails that were very refreshing and tasty. We then ordered a few items off the menu and shared everything. We got fries, pork belly and mushroom truffle pasta. I LOVED it all. I really want to go back and try other things. The ambiance is very cool and our waitress was really sweet and attentive. They also played a good selection of music, but it did get a bit loud. I felt like I had to shout across the table. I will definitely be back.
