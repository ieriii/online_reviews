I am officially upgrading to 5 stars.  This Place Does NOT Disappoint The servers, while not the most amazing service ever, are funny, pleasant and accommodating. They really create a great atmosphere and seem to be having fun, while still taking care good care of their guests. And the food. The food is amazing, plus its BYO with No Corkage.... Fiction, you say? I swear it is not. I was here a couple of weeks ago for a friend's birthday and ate some kickin stuffed gnocci. Then, last Friday, had lobster & sun dried tomato raviolis in a marscipone cream sauce. If I ate like this on even a weekly basis, I would have a heart attack in a month. Its certainly not healthy, but DAMN its so good! Great appetizers, homemade pasta, amazzzzing cream sauces & mushroom sauces, decadent desserts, great coffee. I think this may be my favorite place. Ever. Literally. Yum. What else can I say... trying to use words to describe the cream sauce is absolutely futile. Just go.
