piece, you are my favorite place pizza place in all the land. and following this sentence, i will tell you why: i love their pizza. the crust is thin and delicious. all pizzas are custom built, so you have exactly what you want. you also have an option of sauces, and when one of your best friends won't eat red sauce so you never get to eat pizza with them, it's a game changer. i love their beer. it's full of flavor and there's a good variety. they always seem to have new ones each time i go. and it usually gets me drunk.  they don't take reservations for smaller parties and the wait times can get pretty lengthy on the weekends. and the weekdays. but i've also walked in and have been seated right away. it all depends on the time you go. and if you do have to wait, just go and start drinking some beer. maybe that's why i'm usually drunk when i leave...
