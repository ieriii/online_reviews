Ok, I get it...fine dining = small portions because every fricken' ingredient is so fricken' special. Ladi fricken dah! We ordered from a la carte menu. Everything tasted really good. Unfortunately, that taste did not last long in my mouth because we went to dinner after our dinner at Graham Elliot. My beef entree was about 4 bites. I would have liked it soooo much better if it had same flavor + 6 more bites. I don't give a crap how good things taste. If I have to go into a restaurant full or I have to go to a dinner after I had dinner, you get 2 stars in my book.
