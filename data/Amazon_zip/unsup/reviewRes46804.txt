I am adjusting my review down by one star for: a. Closing on a Saturday night for a wedding. If it was an employee I would understand, but I cannot accept that a business operating as local bar/restaurant can close for a function such as a wedding during a prime social time. There are plenty of function venues in Chicago.  b. Whilst this is not entirely the fault of the venue and involves poor parental control. I went in earlier in the week to enjoy a beer at the bar and have some lunch. The enjoyment was short lived as I had to endure a child running and playing in the bar area making a complete racket. I would have thought that it would make sense to place minors in the restaurant section and not at the bar. Needless to say I left after my first beer and without buying any lunch.
