Favorite pizza in the city! Thin crust is perfect here. Don't get sidetracked by the pizza though also try there spinach dip and goat cheese. Dining in it gets crowded and pretty loud so don't go here for a first date but during the day it's pretty quiet. Staff is polite and they don't over do it with the checking up on you at your table or the bar. Speaking of checkout the microbrews. Delicious. If you get the take home jug you can get it refilled for $12.00. If you go in the evening try to get there a little early or take a seat at the bar. P.S. Delivery guys are dreamy. LOL.
