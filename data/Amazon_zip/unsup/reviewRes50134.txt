A nice place much larger than it looks from the outside. No wait, quick service. After we placed our drink order, five beignets arrived warm airy and well powdered with confection sugar. A great start. The bar was very well stocked and almost made you want to order a whiskey or bourbon up. It was too early for that. The menu options are great. The descriptions made you want to order one of everything. My wife had the gluten free waffles which were crisp and soft in the inside. She thoroughly enjoyed along with a side of two small pieces of ham. The ham was okay but needed a little more salt. Grandson had the cajun pancake/griddle cakes that were really crepes. He really enjoyed them. I had the biscuit and "dirt" gravy. It was served with greens and a biscuit. A poached egg atop each. The gravy was really a broth like sauce with bits of ham (I think). I had expected the roux gravy with a lot of flavor this had neither flour nor flavor. The egg yolk had no flavor. Such a disappointment. The greens were perfect and the biscuit had a weird metallic after taste. I would not order this again. Service was outstanding.
