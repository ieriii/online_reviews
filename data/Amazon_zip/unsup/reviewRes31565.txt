As I write this thinking back on my experience all I can think about is how I wish I was eating there right now. My fiance and I came here for lunch during the week about a month ago. It was a perfect day so we grabbed a seat on the sidewalk patio and started to look over the menu. After seeing what they had to offer it was really hard to narrow it down to just a few things. I ordered the english muffin sandwich with a house made english muffin and my fiance got the chicken and waffles. We also ordered a small side of the truffle mac & cheese. The mac & cheese was good but not needed with the other two heavy meals we got. Out of the two, my favorite was the english muffin sandwich, since the english muffin is made in house it is more like a biscuit then english muffin which I really enjoyed. Being organic and locally focused this is a great spot not only for bridgeport but the city. If you can make it over, do it!
