Surprisingly good. I was not expecting much when I strolled into this funky southern style diner. I ordered blackened chicken, sauteed spinach and mac & cheese. The mac and cheese was bland, but the rest of the meal was delightful. My chicken was juicy and tender, and the spinach was just slightly cooked, like vegetables should be. My kid's burger was incredibly flavorful, and cooked exactly to medium. We skipped drinks and dessert, though I saw another table eating key lime pie, and almost joined them. The service was good and our bill within a very reasonable price-range. We lucked out with parking in front of the building.
