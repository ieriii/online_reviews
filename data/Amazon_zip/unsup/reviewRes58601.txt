I was excited for this place to open from the first time I saw the menu. Fried cheese curds, french fries pulled pork- Awesome. Some friends and I thought we might as well go check it out on a rainy day. Our waitress, Joey, was really nice and gave real recommendations on the menu.(not those half ass- people seem to like it reccomendations- hate those) She was even kind enough to ask the chef and bring out a piece of ham for my friend who was worried about the smell/ taste (she is preggo and very sickened by the smell of beer). we had beer and water whenever we needed it (no- preggo friend didn't have any ;)), my cheese curds were excellent and yes, I agree with everyone else the fries were great. My boyfriend had the poutine which he had been drooling about for weeks and really liked it. The beer list was great- 15 on tap and 60+ in bottles. I tried a couple different ones and really liked them all. Being that the place was not even 2 weeks old when we went I say bravo and keep up the good work- it can only get better for a place that had fried cheese, excellent fries, and lots of tasty beer!!
