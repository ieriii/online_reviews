Great mole's, great cocktails.... a delightful Mexican food experience My colleague and I wanted to check out this place because it was highly recommended by some friends as the best Mexican in town. So walked into this place on a Thursday evening at 7 p.m. The place was packed and we were told it was an hour long wait. So we decided to order at the bar. The bar was out of the question and packed to the core. So we decided to stand by the window and use a small ledge as our table. And mind you this is not a small restaurant. We were greeted by this delightful Mexican waiter who treated us like royalty. Their mole's and the cocktails were exquisite. A must try place if you are in downtown Chicago.
