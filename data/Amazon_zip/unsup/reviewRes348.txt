not going to ramble on and on about how this is an experience and life changing. a few notes on things others havent talked about. When you make your reservation they ask if you have any diet restrictions, vegetarian, vegan, no eggs, no milk, allergies, whatever diet you are currently following. I opted for the standard vegetarian and the wild part, every dish that was served to my brother (22 in all) mine looked exactly the same yet made veggie. It was incredible the length chef Achatz and his crew go to ensure every patron is blown away. Also for the non-alcohol drinkers, they have a house made soda progression to go alone with your meal. do it. this place is insane. imagination gone wild. I filmed my meal including the epic dessert being made directly on our table. youve never seen anything like it. http://vimeo.com/22749603
