If you're looking for a fun, trendy spot to pick at a couple random dishes with girlfriends while sipping overpriced specialty martinis...perfect. If you're looking for excellent food that matches the price combined with superior service...disappointing. Not once, but twice, we had incorrect food brought to our table by food runners. That really didn't bother me, until the waiter accusingly asked us to confirm that we did not order that. "No, my kosher friend is pretty positive that she didn't order the pork sandwiches, thank you." After that, the waiter seemed to be miffed. I'm sorry that you entered something in the computer wrong, but that gives no waiter the right to completely ignore a table for the rest of the evening. We literally sat with empty martini glasses (all 4 of us) for a good 5-10 minutes visibly searching for our waiter before he would reappear. Food was OK. There is so much delicious sushi elsewhere in this city (for much cheaper), that paying almost $20 for a fusion roll seems silly...so I didn't try it. The special scallop hash appetizer was great. Garlic noodles with crab meat were tasty. Greasy, but tasty.  Overall...trendy, but overpriced.
