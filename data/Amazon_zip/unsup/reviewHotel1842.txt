I like to stay at W Hotels because I get Starwood points and use them in Europe or NYC. I stayed at the W Chicago for 3 days, and it was only memorable in how painful it was to stay there! Upon checkin, there was a line a mile long in the hotel to the point that the bar was taking drink orders from guests waiting to check in. Not free drinks for our trouble, but we had to pay and still wait! Then, we had made arrangements to receive a very important package at the hotel. When I checked in, they told me it was in security, and when I asked them to retrieve it, it was nowhere to be found. This carried on for 8 hours, until 1am when it finally appeared. Pretty annoying. The customer focus at this hotel is completely lacking. I asked to have the package shipped after we checked out, and I told them, no rush I don't need it sent overnight. I arrive home the next day and lo and behold the FedEx guy is at the door - and I've been charged for overnight service. Ever get the feeling people don't listen! Sorry - hip doesn't cut it.
