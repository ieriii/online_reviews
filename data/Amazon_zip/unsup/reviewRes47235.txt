Lockdown has everything I look for in a bar/diner. Great bartenders, great waitresses, great music and mind-numbingly delicious food. Not crazy about sports on the screens because I can find that at most other bars. It distracts from the atmosphere which I think is great. The arson burger is outstanding. Well cooked and just the right amount of spice. A side a mac is the icing on the cake. Im sorry to sound like a broken record amongst reviewers but I do have to have the Kuma's comparison. If your looking for the same night out then head to lockdown where it wont be nearly as long as a wait time.
