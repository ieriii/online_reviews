One of the coolest pizza place I've been to in Chicago. I'm not a huge fan of the deep dish. Actually, I'm NOT a fan of the deep dish. I love the oven crust (NY style). I love it. My friend suggested Piece to me for a birthday dinner. They don't take reservations. We had a group of 5. Perfect for a pizza dinner. I got there at 6:45pm on a Friday night (the night before St. Paddy's parade and the dye of the river). It was NUTS. I was the first to get there so I put my name down. It is, btw, right off of the blue line Damen stop. It's a short 4 minute walk around the corner East on North Ave. I put my name down and the wait was 1 hour long. It turned out to be.. ONE HOUR long.. We didn't get seated until close to 8. We ordered a Large pizza and a Medium BBQ pizza. I think I had 9 slices. I don't eat the crust so I had more room to pack the pizza. It was great. I was starving. Between 5 people, we were able to down a large and a medium and leaving only 2 slices left. However - I'd say a large is perfect for a group of 4-5 girls. and I use the term "girls" loosely. I ate like a Man. Great service. GREAT BEER (Thank you, La fin de Monde, you helped the pizza go down better).
