The service here was almost laughable. I could have sworn it was our waitresses first night and almost spit out my over-buttered, greasy, mediocre food when she said she'd been working there for 5 years. The water girl, while attempting to refill one of our glasses, spilled the whole pitcher over one of my companions rather full plate, and did not offer to replace it, and even commented that she "saw that one coming". One steak, ordered medium, looked like it just got hacked right off the cow-it got sent back. You couldn't drag me back into this cheesy, overpriced excuse for a restaurant.
