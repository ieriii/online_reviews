I was hesitant to try this place since I'm a total wuss when it comes to spicy food and I know that they have a lot of focus on the South and dishes that have a little kick to them. I'm so glad I gave this place a shot. I've been to a couple different locations a few times for brunch now and I've never been disappointed. I love the concept that it's comfort food without being covered, cooked, and served with lard, grease, and a whole lotta unhealthiness. Also, their staff is so great: very low-key, nice, and friendly. I've tried the following and they were all yummy: pancakes, biscuits & gravy, Kentucky Scramble, Red Eggs and Denver Omelet. Their home fries are ridiculously good, as in I could eat an entire plate for my meal.
