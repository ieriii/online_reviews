Twas the Monday night before Thanksgiving and my girlfriends and I were in the mood for something fun, yummy and ethnic! And while Irazu is typically slammed at all times I figured it couldn't be too busy on a Monday night. Right? Um, wrong! Apparently people are always in the mood for those delicious oatmeal shakes no matter what day of the week! After a 20-30 minute well worthwhile wait we were seated and greeted by the fabulous Omar. And based Omar's suggestions we filled our tummies with the following: Chlfrijo- I wasn't sure if i was going to like this one cause of the fried pork topping, but I pretty much licked the bowl. Uhmazing Veggie tacos- we split 3 among the 4 of us, but I decided mine was too good to share. Sorry friends Shrimp, rice and veggie dish from the "special menu"- there's a reason they call it special...it was darn good Chicken Tico- eh. The only thing I didn't like. It took 5 billion years to come and I think the reason may be that they ran out real fast to buy a chicken. My friends commented that they've loved this in the past, but were not fans this time. Fortunately, we were pretty full from the rest of the meal and didn't need the chicken Lucky yelpers these days can score a free oatmeal shake for the table by just mentioning Yelp. Yay! My friends and I split the best shake EVER (seriously) and I found myself wanting a big one for myself even though I was full enough to feel like I had just devoured Thanksgiving dinner.  It had been a few years since my last visit to Irazu, but I'm going to be knocking on their door daily for one of those oatmeal shakes. Oh wait- I don't even need to knock because they'll deliver that oatmeal shake (and the rest of the menu if I'm lucky) right to my door!
