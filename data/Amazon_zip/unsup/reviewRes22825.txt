I found su ji here. That's a Chinese/Buddhist-style mock chicken and that's how I know how authentic this place is - it just brings back memories of the food I used to eat as a child at my grandmother's house. No, this stuff doesn't actually taste like chicken, but it's freaking delicious, and they did it just right. I think everyone should try this. Made from layers and layers of tofu skins wrapped around chopped bamboo shoots and shiitake mushrooms, braised in a sweet soy sauce, chiled, sliced and served cold, this is the perfect side dish to get as an accompaniment to whatever spicy hot food you're probably gonna order.  But I suppose if you're going to go here, you should try the hot pot, as it's what everyone around us was having.
