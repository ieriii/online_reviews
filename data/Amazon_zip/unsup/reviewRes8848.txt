Wow, you have to try this place, NOW! I have been going here for 4 years now and hesitated telling people about it because it is the best Persian restaurant in the Midwest, if not outside of Tehran.  They have expanded and spruced the place up a bit in the last 6 months. The decor is not cheesy, it's pretty authentic. Let me put it this way, you won't feel like you are at a Lettuce Entertain You establishment. The food is authentic, fresh, and delicious. The menu is not huge, but everything is outstanding. I like to stick to the basics: kabobs and rice, but the other dishes are very good as well. If you want to be adventurous, try the Fesenjan, it's a meat stew flavored with pomegranate. I would also recommend the Kashk e Bademjoon (which I will admit is the only dish that is better at Reza's) to start and the homemade Bamieh or Baklava with tea for dessert. The location is totally out of the way for me but totally worth it. I would eat here weekly if I could. Totally try it out, you won't be sorry.
