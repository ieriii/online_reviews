Giordano's is my pick for best Chicago deep dish pizza. The cheesy deliciousness cannot be accurately described in words; it is truly something that has to be experienced firsthand. Once we arrived at the restaurant we were informed that there would be an hour wait which seemed a little confusing because there were lots of empty tables and this added to the all-around disgruntled feeing of the group but we decided to wait it out. The hostess staff at this particular location is not very pleasant but once we were seated our waitress was very nice. The wait was only 20 minutes or so. For the eight of us we ordered two large pizzas, one pepperoni and one sausage, and an appetizer sampler filled with an assortment of deep friend things. They call their pizza stuffed, not deep dish and it's more like a pie than a deep dish pizza. It tastes like a delicious gooey piece of lasagna with crust. They offer other things too, sandwiches and such but why would you ever order anything else there?
