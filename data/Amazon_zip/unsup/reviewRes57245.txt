Went with a large group last night and had a good experience. What a selection of craft brews at great prices, food was solid although I wish had a burger instead of the brisket. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly and handled our individual (group of 30) payment of the bill with grace.I will go back for some more beer and a burger!
