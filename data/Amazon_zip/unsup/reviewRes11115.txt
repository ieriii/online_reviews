Deep in the heart of what I like to call, "Los Angeles Jr." is Piece. Probably one of the most interesting and best names I ever heard for a pizza place. I don't know what it is, the name of it just makes me happy. And then there's the peace symbol above the door...hmm. I like it.  But anyway, on to the food, yes? We had pizza of course, and I quite enjoyed it. Tasty and such. Overall pretty good. No complaints. The service was excellent too, our waitress was always smiling and very helpful. But most importantly, I loved the award winning hefeweizen they serve! Now that...was some good good stuff! There was something a little extra nice about it, I want to say a fruity after taste but that may just be crazy. I dunno, I kept trying to figure out what it was that made this one stand out among the rest. But it definitely was delicious, and that's all that matters.  The atmosphere was nice too, I'd say if not a little off. And I don't know what I mean by that. Ha. I liked the look of the place and there's plenty of space.  So GENIUS.
