The olive bread is excellent. Very clean and excellent selection. The bakers were really niceHowever, the cash register lady with blond slick back hair was really rude to the customer ahead of me and had no training in welcoming a customer.  No hello, smile, or thanks. I think she was even a supervisor so I couldn't say anything . Maybe she was pissed bc her workers had not showed up (8am) so she had to take of the cash register or it was too early for her.   Customer hospitality must be priority for any store to succeed! Too bad I had to give Fox and Obel 3 stars
