Do I even need to review this place? I mean, what's some Star Wars obsessed geek from the burbs going to tell you that 4 stars over the course of nearly 1000 reviews haven't already. This place is the highest of the high quality. The food is very difficult to describe, it's just that good. Wonderful ingredients made with care just make for a great meal overall. And if you look at the menu and see something in an otherwise great sandwich that you might not like, get it anyway. I guarantee you XOCO will find a way to prepare it that you'll love it, or at least not even notice it. And yeah, you have a decent wait for your food, but considering how popular this place is and how much individual care they put into each order, it's actually kind of remarkable. It's a well oiled machine that's got providing excellent foot quickly down to a science. Oh, it's also distinctly possible XOCO exists in a time bubble. See, my wife, best friend/co-conspirator, and I were here exactly a year ago and everything was eerily the same down to the detail. The hostess still had an injured arm, the woman at the register was the same, the credit card reader was temporarily down, and we were seated in pretty much the same spot. Plus, when we were eating, I could see a really buff guy across the street in a black tanktop and shorts jogging. Then on our side of the street, exact same guy in the exact same outfit, but really scrawny was jogging. Clearly it was the time pocket showing this guy as a before and after... weird. But in all seriousness, XOCO is an absolute gem. Just amazing, unique food all around.
