Came here with 5 friends 10:40 AM on a rainy Saturday. Even with the weather the line the went around to the very end of the building.... which we didn't really mind since we were chatting the whole time. We all agreed that the wait made us just a little more excited about our food. Part of the wait is so that everyone will be able to sit and enjoy their food. With a group of 6 it somehow magically worked out that a large group left as soon as we placed the order and they even made sure to pull enough chairs together for us. I was pretty amazed by that.... 5 stars for service at a hot dog joint... so on to the food... Rosemary and garlic chicken sausage with cumin mayo and roasted peppers... This was VERY good...Juicy flavorful sausage...the mayo left me wondering where I could buy some... and the peppers added a nice kick.  The Elvis... a polish sausage with everything on. Pretty good but didn't think it was the best I've ever had.  Everyone else got the foie gras duck sausage... didn't try it myself but everyone was pretty happy with it. Duck fat fries... I give it 3 stars... I had been pretty excited about this... but maybe I don't have the palate that could tell the difference? I had tried the regular fries too and really couldn't tell a huge difference.... a plus that the large portion is huge. We had 4 servings and the 6 of us could barely finish 3 and trust me we were trying... I definitely will return to try their other specials
