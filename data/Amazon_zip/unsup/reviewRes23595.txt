I was really disappointed with this place. The service was terrible and the food tasted like cooking gas (at least I think that's what that flavor was...). They give you a bit of spicy cabbage when you first sit down and I made the mistake of eating it. It was so spicy it closed up my throat and I couldn't talk! I have to admit though, that the menu was huge and everything was cheap. Maybe if you like spicy, it's good? I won't be returning.
