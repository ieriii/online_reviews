I decided to check this place out when Groupon offered a deal and I'm glad that I did. My BF and I went for brunch and were pleasantly surprised by the live guitarist they had. The food was very good...I had the Cuban steak sandwich which have very nice flavors and my BF had the honey jalapeno pork chops which he loved! I also tried their pomegranate mojito which was yummy and a nice size. Prices were not bad either...our Groupon was for $40.00 and we had to order a couple of extra things to make sure we made the amount! The only small complaint that I have is that the service wasn't the best. They weren't bad, but they weren't as on top of things as they should have been. However everyone was very friendly so that helped to not make it that big of an issue. We're planning to go again and try it out for dinner next time.
