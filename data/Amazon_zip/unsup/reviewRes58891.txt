Delicious food and excellent service! I went to Sunda for the first time with a group of ladies, and we had a fabulous time. What a great place for a night out! We loved the oxtail potstickers, the crispy rice with wagyu beef, the rock shrimp and the devil's basket. The dragon roll was outstanding, but my absolute favorite was a new addition to the menu, a lobster roll with avocado and pieces of bacon sprinkled on top. I absolutely cannot wait to go back to eat it again!  Our server was very attentive and kept the cocktails flowing. Can't wait to go back!
