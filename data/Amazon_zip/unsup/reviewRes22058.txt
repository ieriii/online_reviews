Too bad the girls aren't on roller skates. I love the whole throw back feel of the place - and those creepy hot dogs on the roof... hilarious. Please tell me why their arms are white but thier bodies are brown? The design on the packaging is great too. But I wasn't so impressed with the superdawg I had. Maybe it's because I'm a NY girl and to me Hoffman's hot dogs are so much better than Vienna Beef dogs. (Don't get on me for that - it always turns into a deep dish vs. thin crust, hoagie vs. sub argument) Plus I'm not a fan of crinkle cut fries.
