I've been here a bunch of times for brunch. The food is great, but go early. Like before 10 am. It gets packed. If you're going with a friend i'd suggest splitting one savory meal and one sweet. All the pancakes/french toast are wayyy too rich for one person.. although they are fab.. it's like eating dessert.
