Alinea is a total sensory experience. It isn't just about the food, because come on, the food and presentation are obviously innovative and exquisite. It's also about the restaurant itself. I have just entered a new dimension. I am walking down a narrowing hallway, when a door automatically slides open into the waiting area where a host/hostess waits to greet you. I glance past him/her into the spotless kitchen and spy chefs work with intention and precision. I follow up a flight of stairs into the dining area where our culinary journey is about to begin. We chose the tasting menu. I did not elect to have the wine pairings because I'm a lightweight, but I did enjoy the champagne cocktail that starts with the first plate. It is hard to pick one favorite because they were all good, but the desserts stole my heart, and the dishes that invoke your sense of smell first were also particularly enjoyable. I'm not sure how people do the tour, because I was stuffed with just the tasting. I like the personalized menus that we received at the end of our meal, where we learned that the chef had given us an additional dish that originally is on the tour. The dinner lasted just under 3 hours. We stood in awe at the flawless process going on in the kitchen as we waited for the staff to flag down a cab for us. It is a well-oiled machine. Quite impressive. I could have watched for hours, but alas, a cab finally arrived. The automatic door slid out, and we were out of the dimension and onto plain old Halsted Street again, but this time in a satiated haze. Grant Achatz, you are my hero.
