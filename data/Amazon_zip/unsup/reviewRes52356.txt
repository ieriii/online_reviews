I grew up going to this location as a kid in their old building. Love deep dish pizza and this place used to be the best. Even though I keep giving this place chances its not up to par. Crust and ingredients they use are not as good as they used to be. To top that off you have to deal with a "bouncer" at the front door to get a table.
