staff was definitely friendly and attentive! a friend and I showed up 5 minutes before opening but they were fine and sat us down.  we shared cold spread plate served with baguettes. it looked like napoleon ice cream when it came out...pink, hazel, white (i believe it was salmon hummus, eggplant, and feta). they were all delicious! next we share combo plate with baked eggplant, lamb, dolsa, meatball, rice, veges. and another combo plate with stuffed tomatoes and baked pasta. portions were huge. baked eggplant and stuffed tomatoes were my fav...flavorful and packed with flavor. lamb was a bit dry.
