Irazu is a really great neighborhood sort of place. All of the staff is super friendly and the food is simple and flavorful. I've had the gallo pinto both times I've eaten there with a big glass of horchata and left satisfied and looking forward to another visit.  By boyfriend has been with me both times and has tried two of their sandwiches and loved them both. The place has such a welcoming atmosphere and it's easy to while away an afternoon on the patio. It's BYOB, but good for a nice lunch. I will definitely be back again and again.
