Finally made it here for a late late Sat lunch. The place has a weird setup...almost like a Potbellys but fancier. Waiting in line to order, we were then approached by the chameleon hostess who then asked us if we were dining in....and told to *wink wink* come find her after the order to be taken to our seats. The guac and chips were great, very fresh and delicious, but after having had Mercadito's spicy guac, this one just couldn't compete. For tortas, we sampled one each from the grilled and oven-toasted menus. The Cubana was good stuff...but didn't particularly taste Mexican to me; since it was on a griddle, it was almost like a panini. Next to the Gunthorp though, the Cubana was flavorless. I appreciated the Gunthorp and its tomatillo salsa much more, though the baguette was a bit hard. And the churro was a good size, though super sweet for those that can't handle high doses of sugar. Regardless of my nitpicking, Xoco is a great lunch option! Can't wait to go back to try the shortrib red chile caldo!
