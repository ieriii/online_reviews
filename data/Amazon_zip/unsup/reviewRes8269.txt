This place is worth the trip for the salad bar alone! Don't get me wrong tho the meat selection is wonderful but I think one of the tastiest things to me here is the fried polenta. Hah, it is so good! The service is so attentive...you will lack for nothing when you come here. The ambience of the restaurant just adds to the overall experience as well.
