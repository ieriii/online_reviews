My older sister and girlfriend come here religiously on Saturday mornings. Obviously they have never been let down here. Ive never had a savory crepe before but GOOD LORD I was missing out! Not pricey breakfast with a shared dessert (nutella Crepe)MMMM so good you leve spending about fifteen a person with tip and a full belly. The staff is charming and remember regulars which is in my book the secret to return customers at a restaurant. I have nothing but great things to say about Icosium Kaf and any excuse to visit is a good excuse.
