June 9,2011I'm from out of town and my first time at Calo's was exceptional. Ray, the waiter, was very helpful and recommended a delicious pasta fish for my husband and I. The luncheon atmosphere was very pleasant, the service by the waiter as well as the bus boy, was memorable. I will definitely be back to visit and I'm I'm hoping to have this same waiter, as helped make my husband and I feel very comfortable and satisfied.
