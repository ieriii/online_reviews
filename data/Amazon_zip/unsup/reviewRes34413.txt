Well prepared, solid diner food, but nothing special. Our meals were tasty, but I was not impressed with the creativity of options or the service. That being said, if you want all-American classic breakfast, this is a sure bet. But, with all of the other brunch options in Chicago, there are many others that have more originality to offer. It just doesn't stand out.
