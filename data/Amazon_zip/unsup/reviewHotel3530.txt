You can definitely tell the Avenue was renovated. The elevators, ceilings, walls, and general structure looked pretty old... but whoever manages the property tries really hard to keep the decor modern enough to hide the building's age.  Our room was a suite and had very trendy decor and furnishings. It even came complete with two matching zebra-printed robes. The bedroom was large and had a comfortable king bed, a great view of downtown Chicago, and a flat panel TV. The living room area had a pull out couch, a flat panel TV, an i-home deck, and a bar area. The staff was always quick to bring towels, bring wine glasses, or assist with luggage as needed. I also enjoyed the fact that it was a quick walk or taxi ride to the nearest malls, Walgreens, or bars. The only negative thing I could really think of was that the fitness center was pretty weak. There were like 3 treadmills and 1 didn't work. They only had a couple other pieces of equipment in there. It was really bare.  If I ever felt like dealing with the snow and wind of Chi-town again, I wouldn't mind at all booking a room at the Avenue Hotel.
