As a first time diner I am sold on India House! I choose the buffet because I am unfamiliar with Indian cuisine. $14 dollars introduced me to over 10 dishes and that is not including the delicious desserts and salad bar that is part of the buffet. AMAZING tandoori chicken came out with flat bread as part of the meal (which was my favorite part of the meal!!!) Service was top notch. The hostess was beautiful and smiled the whole time, the server was very informative and even the bussers were attentive to answering questions. (I was eying a dipping sauce at the salad bar and he informed me of what were the two most popular, told be about each one, and explained that I should try them out with the appetizers offered at the front of the buffet.) I am planning to dine here once a month, which is a lot for me.
