The rooms are nice. I want a corner room some time when we stay there again. Walking distance (meaning within a mile) of so much! We walked to Navy Pier and the Magnificent mile and even home from Soldier Field but that was more like 2.5 miles. If you stay here go to the Purple Pig which is 0.4 miles from the hotel. Get the Eggplant and Goat Cheese Spread. YUM! YUM! YUM! They have continental breakfast set up on every floor with is such a brilliant idea and really was a great touch. Sadly, the pastries are not good. It is a real shame because there are so many great options in Chicago which I am sure wouldn't be that much more expensive and would leave more of an impression.  The gym has nice sturdy machines which we didn't use because that is not how we vacation. The bed was wonderful. We will be staying here again. $44 a day for valet is a huge negative but we didn't see where it was any cheaper anywhere else in that area. If somebody knows of a better option/place to leave a car we won't be using all week please send me a message and let me know. Don't want to pay that bill again. They did do it fairly though and charged by 24 hours instead of calendar day which we really appreciated.
