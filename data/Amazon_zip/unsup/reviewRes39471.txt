This place probably offers one of the best Korean BBQ experiences in Chicago. If you are having a craving for good, authentic Kroean food this is the place. Came here recently with a friend. We'd been wanting to go out for Korean food for some time, and tonight was our opportunity. fortunately, it was a Monday night because I hear this place gets crowded. the wait would have been worth it though because the food here is great. My friend had the bulgogi (marinated beef) and I had the squid, both of which we grilled at the table. We shared a seafood pancake appetizer, which we really wanted to have, but did not need because there was SO MUCH food. one of my main criteria for a good Korean restaurant is the quality and variety of side dishes that come with the meal. The side dishes are also the most interesting and fun to eat. So our two meals came with perhaps twenty side dishes, ranging from fermented soy beans to two kinds of seaweed, to kimchee, radish chunks, broccoli, lotus root, mountain potato, lettuce and cucumber salad, soy bean cake, bamboo shoot, potato salad, and more. Too many to remember. But I do remember that they were all really interesting and delicious. We also got a plate of lettuce to wrap our grilled thing in, a soy bean paste (I'm guessing) to go with it, a bowl of soup, and a bowl of rice. I'm telling you, it was a lot of food and all for under $60 for two. What a great deal, and totally satisfying too!
