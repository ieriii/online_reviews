Come here for breakfast on the weekends or a quality late night meal. They serve breakfast all day which keeps options open. I like their pancakes...a LOT. They also make good eggs and nice sandwiches. Staff is efficient and pleasant. The location is sweet too, on a nice quiet part of Dearborn surrounded by beautiful landscaping and nice housing. Another perk...they have a full bar and wine list as well. Order a vodka tonic with your blueberry flapjacks and you're set.
