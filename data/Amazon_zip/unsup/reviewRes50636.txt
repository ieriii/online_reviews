The Big Jones Breakfast is a must have! I love the grits and pancakes. Chicken Salad is also one of my favorites. The service is fantastic! Its one of those places that has 2 faces...it's a cozy family vibe on Sunday mornings, but then dinner's there can also be romantic. Nice. If you'd like to go on a Sunday morning, arrive early...there will be a wait. Live, Love, Eat. JLR
