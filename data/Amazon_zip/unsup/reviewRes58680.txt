The service was poor! Got there, sat around for a very long time to get complimentary water. While we waited, other customers came in and was served immediately. It's impossible to miss us because we came in a group. And of course you know it, the waiters take their orders first while we were still waiting for water! It's funny though... because all the waiters kept walking pass us, looking at us, but didn't even bother to come serve us water. Finally, fed up and tired of their poor service, we almost walked out until a friend flagged for a server and then someone finally came over. Not just that, but we also waited a long period opf time for our food! Never ever going there again!
