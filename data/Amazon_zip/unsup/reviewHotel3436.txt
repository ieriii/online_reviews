This is another one of those times when I would LOVE to have a half star function. 3.5 Stars is exactly what I want to give. We stayed here this weekend for a friends birthday. The Pros: 1) The rooms are beautifully decorated. They really have worked to keep the style very vintage 1950s chic, and it is working.  2) The staff is friendly, professional and attentive. Even the bellhop was a really nice guy (thanks for everything Moises!) The Cons: This room we stayed in was TINY. REALLY, REALLY TINY. I felt like Alice in Wonderland when she gets all big and the house she is in is little. I could touch the ceiling. The bathroom (while beautifully decorated) was pint size, and oh, did I mention the FULL SIZE bed? A Full. Really, for a four star hotel? So many things about this hotel were great, but I would have to know in advance the size of my room before staying here again.
