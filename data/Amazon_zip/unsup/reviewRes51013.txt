Tried out Big Jones with some friends last week and was glad we did. It was a refreshing experience to try a new restaurant, as well as experimenting with some cuisine other than Italian or Mexican. Portions seemed just right. The prices were not out of control and the service was excellent. I appreciated that I could book a reservation with them using http://OpenTable.com.
