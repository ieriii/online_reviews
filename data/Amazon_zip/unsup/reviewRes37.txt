I couldn't believe I was able to get in Alinea on the day I called. I was on a business trip in January to Chicago and my original dinner plan fell through so I decided to call Alinea to see if they have any availabilities for that same day. Luck was on my side that day. The staff called back and said they had room at 9:30PM. I was super ecstatic! Who says you have to call two months ahead? =P Yes, I went to Alinea and ate by myself. I was not going to let this opportunity pass me by. It's hard to describe the wonderful experience I had at Alinea. Without a doubt, it was one of my favorite meals! I think I had 20 courses. For $210 for the meal, I truly believe it was a bargain. I got there a bit early (9:00pm, i know i was overly excited), and I still managed to be there until past 12am. I didn't get the wine pairing because there was no way i could drink that much alcohol and be able to wake up early in the morning for a tradeshow. I just ordered a glass of rose champagne to start the night off. ( If I had company and didn't have to go to a tradeshow in the morning, i'd definitely get the wine pairing to compliment the yummy dishes!) Every single dish was either served with a story or a purpose. It was an overall sensory experience. You enjoy the culinary adventure by not just tasting the food, but also hearing, smelling, and seeing the food. Not a single dish was served the same way. Some of the presentations are just so creative. No wonder it is ranked as one of the tops restaurants in the world. If you have a chance to be in Chicago, you should definitely try Alinea! You won't regret it.
