So I've been to Spacca Napoli before, have had my wife's leftovers from girl night out as well. I've always been a fan. Nice chew and just the right amount of char to the crust. Always pretty tasty, but I had a pizza last night that really freaking rocked.  A recent trip to Europe has ruined me on some food. No longer will Pillsbury crescents satisfy me for croissants and no longer do I go by the "no pizza is a bad pizza" motto. You can definitely get more bang for your buck elsewhere, but I think it's worth it here. We went with the Bianco Nero which has Pecorino with Black Truffle, Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Porcini Mushrooms, and White Truffle Oil. It was pretty good, really earthy and mushroomy. If you're into that, you'll dig this one. I found it a little wet especially towards the middle. For our second pizza we went with one of the specials for the night, The Bismark. As our waitress described this pizza I spaced out during the rest of her spiel imagining how good this must taste. It's a white pizza with their Fior di Latte Mozzarella, speck, with an egg cracked in the middle of it before it goes in the oven. A breakfast pizza done right. If you like eggs even a little and this is on the specials board, do yourself a favor and order it. It was awesome. Safe to say, I enjoyed our dinner here. I was even taking trash to the leftovers as they boxed it up, "I'm going to tear you up tomorrow..I'm going to heat you up so fast..." I'm a man of my word, they didn't stand a chance.
