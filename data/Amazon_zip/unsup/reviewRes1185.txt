"Damn you Hot Doug's... my taste buds love you but my arteries hate you. Why must you tempt me with your amazing traditional and constantly everchanging selections of eclectic encased meats (which can be ordered not just grilled or fried but grilled AND fried)? I know the true secret of your hot doggy powers... your special seasoning... it's really crack isn't it? Yeah, I thought so. How else could anyone in the right and proper mindset put up with waiting in a line that runs out the door and around the corner on a perfectly good Saturday afternoon just to get a taste... oh dear god please, just one more bite. I got to sample your ribeye sausage with pesto dressing, gator sausage with feta, and corn dog... but damnit all! I forgot to get your duck fat fries (only on Friday/Saturday) and foolishly ordered a LARGE order of the regular goods. I reluctantly scarfed down every morsel in 60s flat... but that didn't mean I liked it!... Who am I kidding, I LOVED it... I'll be back, OH YES... I'LL BE BACK... AND I'LL GET YOUR DUCK FAT FRIES TOO... MY PRETTY!"
