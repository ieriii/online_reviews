Overall I was fairly underwhelmed, actually "let down" would be a better way of putting it.  We ordered the regular chicken Brasil pizza. It was good, but not great like some here might have led us to believe. Had I ordered just this and nothing else, my opinion probably would've been more favorable overall. But we also ordered the Baltimore pizza (crab and Old Bay). After nearly living in Baltimore this sounded like good nostalgia, but their crab pizza was just gross. I *love* Old Bay on just about everything, but the chef making it was WAY heavy handed in the Old Bay, to the point where the pizza was inedible.  We actually threw all but 3 pieces away, and it was a $28 pizza. A very expensive mistake. We also ordered 3 Coxinha's. I didn't really know what they were or how many to order, but Yelpers said they were great so order I did, 1 for each person. If you don't know, think chicken croquette of some sort. We could've shared 1 between the 3 of us, because they were very large and heavy and just weren't good. They were really doughy and undercooked inside, kind of a mush not worth eating. Oddly, both pizzas tasted MUCH better cold. You could actually taste the cheese, which was actually fairly gourmet, but when it was melted it didn't have much flavor. When it was colder you could really taste the nice flavors. $57 for 2 large pizzas and 3 xincha's and delivery charge, + 4 delivery tip. I had a living social $15 off coupon, so I actually paid $46 when all was said and done. Kind of overpriced even with the coupon, given that half of it was inedible. The guy who took the order over the phone was hopefully stoned, if not he wasn't a very smart person. It literally took 12 minutes on the phone to place the order of 3 items. Delivery took exactly an hour, pretty much what we expected.
