This place mostly lives up to the hype that it's garnered since its opening last winter. I went there with my girlfriend for a holiday dinner. The service here is second to none. I'm not the neatest eater, ok - I'm a slob, and every time I'd spill something someone would be on it cleaning the table. My water never got below half before someone was refilling it. As for the food, I'd stick to the specialty rolls and sashimi. I am no sushi connoisseur but I've eaten enough of it to know this stuff was pretty damn good. Do not order the lo mein. This dish was very disappointing. We ordered the beef lo mein and it was very bland and extra oily to boot. The drinks were interesting and expensive, but you're not going here to save money. We will definitely go back.
