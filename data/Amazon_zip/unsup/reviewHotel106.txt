My boyfriend and I stayed here last Saturday while attending a nearby wedding and Holiday Inn Express far exceeded our expectations (considering it's very fairly priced in this highly desirable area). Pros: - Extremely friendly & helpful staff. Checked us in when we arrived at 10:30am. - Free continental breakfast. Good bagels, eggs, danishes. Free coffee all day, actually tastes good. - Free wifi + 2 public access computers. - Very modern and clean decor. Room was clean. - Location! 5 min walk to Red line. 15 min walk to Blue line (to O'Hare). 2.5 blocks from shopping on Michigan ave. 1 block to Trader Joes! Cons: - TEENY TINY ROOM. But it's no biggie if you're not planning to spend much time there. - .... that's it.
