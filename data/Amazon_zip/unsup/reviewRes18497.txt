I stopped at Xoco for a quick dinner last night. It was okay but didn't live up to my expectations. The layout of the restaurant is very interesting and considering the amount of people inside, things seemed to be running very smoothly. Because it was hot outside and I wanted to stay healthy I ordered a side salad and the coctel rojo - a cold shrimp and scallop cocktail with avocado served in red sauce and accompanied by tortilla chips. The side salad was boring and the seafood was good but not great. Considering how much people love this place and how much I love mexican cuisine I'll probably go back and give Xoco another shot, but in this visit, I wasn't too impressed.
