Want a once-in-a-life-time dining experience at an "undisclosed" location? I don't want to sound like a cheesy commercial ad, but Alinea blew us away. The entire culinary experience was perfect. I'm sure Alinea changes their menu from time to time and I can tell you what we had on the evening of January 27th to celebrate our love of food but why ruin the surprise? You get a menu with a list of all the artistic expression of Grant Achatz (head chef) and his team at the end of your meal. If you do the wine paring, which is wonderful, be prepared to shell out the big bucks. The paring will cost you 2/3 of the meal, which might be something to think about.
