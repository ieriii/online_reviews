we had dinner last friday night with no reservations and waited about 30 minutes. the decor is very rustic with brick walls and dim lighting. very intimate setting however the place gets really loud. pizza DOC - simple thin brick oven pizza. pork shoulder ragu - highlight of the night, creamy polenta that is poured table side onto a wooden slab and than pork shoulder on top. lots of meat and good size portion for the small linquine with sea urchin and crab - very creamy and flavorful but the size is tiny! rigatoni and sausage - tastey and a lot bigger portion than the linquine that we ordered great wine selection, prices start to creep up as they recommend about 4 plates for two people since portions are much smaller than what you would expect at a typical italian joint. ran about $90 with one glass of wine, but we also had some drinks a the bar while waiting so spent about $120 for the night.
