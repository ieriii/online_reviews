We thought we were in for a nice treat at Uncommon Ground on Devon one summer Saturday. I had been the Grace Street location and always thought it was pretty nice.Not so UC on Devon. First off it has a little parking lot of its own that is almost impossible to access from the street. When I finally did get there the lot was full. Great, street parking for me. We wanted to dine outside, but they claimed there weren't any tables. We pointed out two that were unoccupied and they grudgingly wiped down a table for us.We saw our server a total of two times: once take our order and once to give us the bill. When our food was delivered we had no silverware or napkins (they were delivered later with no apology). Basically only one person checked to see how we were doing and she didn't seem to care very much.My cornbread waffles with fruit topping were okay, but very filling. After eating only half of the concoction I felt as if I had a lump in my stomach. I drowned myself in Ice tea to compensate. My co-diners felt their sandwiches were bland, and also also oddly too filling. Also, we were told there are no refills on the ice tea. I don't think I've ever heard of any place with that policy before. It's a little outrageous.as ice tea costs pennies to make.I also had a personal battle with the bathroom. I thought there was only one unisex bathroom for the whole place--and it was always was in use. When I finally got in there, people were constantly trying for the door handle or knocking. No matter how I yelled, "just a minute!" they kept it up. When I got out, no one was there. Later I discovered that there was another bathroom around a dark corner. How about a sign telling people this? It might cut down on the chaos.All in all, I'd say Uncommon Ground on Devon has a lot to learn from its sister store on Grace.
