Similar to many of the other reviews, the Amalfi has many strong points and a few drawbacks. The room was comfortable enough and I liked the fresh colors and contemporary feel. The jazz and soul music collections are a nice touch. I really enjoyed the cocktail reception with the appetizers and signature drink, the Amalfitini. The continental breakfast served on each floor was also well done. Finally, the location is central to many of the popular downtown destinations. I'd have given the Amalfi 4 stars if not for a couple problems. First the room, while appealing in decor, looked a little like it had been done on the cheap. Some of the furnishings looked good but didn't have the level of quality as comparable hotels. Plus, the carpet was really dirty in spots. Since the place is really new, I suspect it's going to look worn before long. There is no view as others pointed out, and the street noise can be troubling. Finally, we had a billing issue where the rate didn't match what we'd booked on the internet. We got it worked out but it punctuated a decent but not great stay. The overall value can be really good if you get a favorable rate. If not, and you want an interesting newer place to stay in the same neighborhood, try the Hotel Sax.
