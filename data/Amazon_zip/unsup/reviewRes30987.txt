The Chicago Diner is a totally faithful standby for take-out nights or when you're showing off Chicago institutions to visitors. The food always hits the spot, but anyone expecting a culinary masterpiece will perhaps be disappointed -- this is a diner, after all! The sandwiches are consistently the best thing on the menu, especially the ones made with Upton's seitan, but I have a soft spot for the sweet potato quesadillas as well. I think the macaroni here rivals Soul Veg for deliciousness as well. Desserts are always phenomenal, and best from the source -- buying a cake slice in a box at Whole Foods can't compare! The raw cheesecake is excellent and inventive. And seriously, there is nothing like their peanut butter cookie dough soy shakes made with Temptation. The service here is always excellent and the staff is down to earth, easygoing, and funny.
