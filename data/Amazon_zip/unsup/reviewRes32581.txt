Absolutely amazing food. Service was fantastic. We were blown away by the fact that the manager came to the table to check on our dinner.  The "tale of two tunas" was great.  You really can't go wrong with all of the appetizers and small plates and sushi. Not so sure if we would do entrees again. Desert was also incredible.  This is a must go.
