When I first moved to Chicago in '98, I lived conveniently 2 buildings up from my favorite restaurant, Irazu. One veggie burrito, one shake, and one order of tostonas were a shared meal for two. I've had numerous BYOB celebrations inside and out on the patio. In yet another review I can't really provide much info on the non-vegetarian options. I've tried the steak and chicken tacos and I wasn't wowed, but the chicken soup will cure what ails you. It never fails I want a burrito on the one day they are closed - Sundays!
