I have to admit they've got a pretty damn good falafel sandwich, just the perfect amount of hummus, cucumber, etc. The homemade hummus with pita is good as well. However, that's as far as I'll go, besides a few of the salads. I'm not a big fan of meat sitting in tins at lukewarm temperatures, and that's exactly what I got when I made the mistake of ordering the lamb shwarma (during my first visit). The lamb was chewy and far from fresh, in fact it didn't even taste like lamb. No matter, the falafel is obviously the way to go and for $4 its a good deal...
