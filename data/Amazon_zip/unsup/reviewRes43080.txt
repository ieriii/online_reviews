Now that fogo has been in full effect for a year or so, I can say I've dined there over a dozen times and had a ton of pizza, chicken, salad and even their desserts. All of it is amazing, seriously you can't go wrong with anything. What prompted me to update my already 5 star review was to say how nice the staff is there!! Me, 9 months pregnant and needing some cold frozen treat of some kind but not wanting to walk far and not wanting any crap from 711 or baskin robbins. Time: about 10pm, I knew Fogo 2 Go closed at 10, but I thought i could waddle my fat tail down there in just enough time to purchase one of their pints of ice cream from bobtail or even their chocolate sprinkle cake i recently read about on facebook. Well of course, im moving slow these days so i didn't make it before 10, but with a sad look on my face, the staff stopped mopping and let me in!!! YEAH, and to my surprise, they now serve anthony's DELISH italian ice!! They were happy to get me my sugar fix and on my way. This is now my go-to dessert place. Both cakes are awesome, and you can't go wrong with the italian ice or ice cream, and its much closer than walking to bobtail or anthonys. 10 starts fogo 2 go!!
