The meal was wonderful. I was quickly seated and I can see how that might be a problem there. The place is packed always and rightfully so. The meal was quick and the Pho was perfect in flavor. My only wish is a bit more flank. Maybe I recieved a poor amount or maybe I was served the correct amount. I've been to Pho shops in Cali and received a lot more beef. Either way the flavor was dead on and the seating wasn't instant but fast enought. It beats the wait at Panda Express or P.F. Changs and the taste is authentic. If you want some decent Pho then this is the place to hit.
