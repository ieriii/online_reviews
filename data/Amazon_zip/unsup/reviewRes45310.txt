Based on BRUNCH ONLY, yes. Yes. It's never crowded, the atmosphere is great, the staff are nice and not snotty. And the short stack of pancakes ($6!) made me believe in Jesus. Get the pancakes and try to be disappointed. I don't even LIKE pancakes. But trust me. Fluffy, light, super eggy and enough butter to make a Midwesterner happy. Pancakes.
