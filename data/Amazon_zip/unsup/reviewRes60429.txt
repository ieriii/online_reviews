Absolutely loved it. Amazing food and perfect service. We weren't crazy about the first bottle of wine we ordered and the waiter insisted we find another one without being charged. The antipasti were fantastic- peppers with breadcrumbs, caponata, and the grilled octopus was hands down the best I've ever had. My boyfriend marveled at how much I ate, given my propensity to pretend I'm some sort of eating disorder afflicted supermodel while we dine out. Let me assure you there was no trips to the bathroom for cocaine and purging this night! But I digress...My ball and chain had spaghetti amatriciana which was simple yet flavorful, and I had the goat cheese ravioli in a light buttery sauce with orange zest and fennel pollen. Unusual and unbelievably delicious.We had to dash before desert, which was a little disappointing, but I left feeling giddy nonetheless. I'm already plotting a return trip with out of town guests for next weekend.
