The food was very fresh and tasty, the Sweet Potato Fries were awesome! Crispy, thin, salty and sweet. Yum! I don't see it in the menu (must be seasonal) but i had an almost gnocchi-like pasta with lemon sauce and crab. It could have used a little bit more crab for the price but good overall. The atmosphere is loungy and relaxed. Glad i went and tried their food but probably won't go back anytime soon, a little too expensive for me.
