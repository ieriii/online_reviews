After plenty of build-up and buzz, I finally braved the lines for the Bongo Room and I have to say I wasn't completely disappointed. Highlights: -- French Toast -- whatever topping you choose, you can't go wrong. Not too fluffy or dense, they are all a bit indulgent, but not rich too the point of overwhelming -- Breakfast Burrito -- they had at least 5 different types on the menu and I'm writing this a few weeks later, so I can't recall which I had. I remember Chorizo and being impressed, but not bookmarking it for contention with any of my favorites in New Mexico. Lowlights: --Service and Crowd/Noise -- It's VERY popular on weekends; it's on my running route and I have to cut through a substantial crowd outside each Saturday/Sunday. That being said, our hostess could have been a bit less hostile. Also, when I have to yell across a table while hungover at brunch to overcome the noise, I'm not a happy camper. The unfriendly staff and long wait are the #1 reason this doesn't deserve 4 stars. Lower your expectations a tad after hearing the uber-hype about this place, be prepared to wait an hour, and you won't walk away disappointed. It's very good, but not great.
