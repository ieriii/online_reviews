Rick Bayless could have done better, honestly. But there are a few items on the menu here that are OUTSTANDING. With the exception of those 2 or 3 things, I would have given this place only 3 stars. There was this Cucumber water juice drink thing - it was SO AMAZING. Sort of a limey, sweet, cucumber-ade, perfect for a summer day, but I'd drink it in any season. However, I am not sure if this was just a daily special, because my friend who visited here said she could not find it. :(, they oughta make this one permanent, if you ask me. The tortas were OK. Perhaps I've been spoiled by places like BellyShack and Cafecito, who do this sort of thing with more creativity and sensitivity to flavor and texture, in my opinion. But that doesn't mean that this place won't thrill those who have not tried this genre of latino-american fusiony panino-esque torta delight. It's all the rage right now, and XOCO is just capitalizing on a trend. The one sandwich that stood out for me, BOTH times I ate here was the Chicken Tinga. The carnitas was good, but nothing special in this age of Chipotle. The Milanesa is also amazing. These are both Chicken tortas, and are the two best ones I've had here, surprisingly. The Cubano was just a less-intriguing version of Belly Shack's Cuban style sandwich. The Pibil was made with very TENDER pork, and was all around a good quality sandwich. But it was nothng that I had not tasted before. I guess I was expecting XOCO to be a pioneer of new flavor combinations. However, their tortas are all just GOOD, TASTY, and ENJOYABLE. If you are looking for "unique" or "exhillarating," check out Urban Belly / Belly Shack / Cafecito / Gastro Wagon / Etc.
