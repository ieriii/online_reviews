ate waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much. the oaxacan steak was great! even the argentine in the group kept raving about it. the yellow mole with the white fish was spicy and delicious.  if i go again, i'd stick to ordering lots of the small plates rather than the big entress. oh yes the flan was yummy too. tres leches cake was not my favorite. i'm a tres leches snob :-)
