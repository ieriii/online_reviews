Revolution Brewing... key word is...BREWING. The first beer I tried was the cask Workingman mild, I have always had a bit of an obsession for cask brewed beers; revolution is totally lost in this process. The beer smelled like warm pool water and the taste was a mix between water, water, and yeast... in short terrible. The iron fist pale ale was no more appetizing than drinking a skunked PBR. I gave them one more chance with the Bottoms Up Wit, it might have been ok with a wedge of orange, the aftertaste was similar to licking a quarter. Beer gets a negative 2 stars. If I ever go back I'll just stick with Fat Tire Revolution's redeeming quality is found in the kitchen, the smoked pulled pork burger was fantastic. Their pork was just the right mix of tang and sweet, on top of a medium rare slab of beef... it completely redeemed the place for my beer. If you get a burger ORDER THE POTATO SALAD!!!! The blue cheese potato salad was a perfect complement to the burger and was a great improvement on the old stand-by. Their Margherita Pizza was great, a safe move as a first timer.
