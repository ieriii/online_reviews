First let me get this off my chest: I don't like deep dish pizza. I think it's gross and heavy. I also don't like most paper-like crispy thin crust. Sorry, I just don't. However, the thin crust is really the best in the city.  It's not so thin that it snaps in half, it's probably more like a thin hand toss. I have lived here a while now and haven't found my pizza stride till Pequod's. We have eaten (ate?) there - the place was packed and we had to wait a while for a table - I think that's normal for good food in the area. We had a basic italian salad with dinner and it was OK, thankfully the pizza was less mediocre. We have also had take out several times. Searching on the internet, we could find no coupons. Sad, because that's really the best way to order take out food.
