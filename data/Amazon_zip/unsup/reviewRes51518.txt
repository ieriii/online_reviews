My friends and I ate at Garcia's after our initial lunch plans fell through. I suggested it after remembering their burritos being featured on TV (190 North) the night before. Overall we had a very enjoyable experience eating here. We came in a little past the lunch hour, so they were not very busy at all. The space is very open and has plenty of seating for groups of five or more. The decor is somewhat "rustic mexican" and very colorful. The waitresses were very nice, funny, polite, and were very fast in regards to taking our order, getting our drinks, and making sure we had a good dining experience. We got chips and salsa right away, and refills early and often. We all got different kinds of burritos and were all very pleased with our choices. I had the Burrito Suizo Ranchero (the one I saw on TV) with carne asada. Their burritos are huge and very tasty! The price is very affordable and the quality of ingredients is very good. There are better and more authentic mexican places out there, but this place is a nice place if you're feeling like going to a mexican place a step above Chipotle or the dirty Burrito place a few blocks from your apartment. I also learned that they are open very late. Next time my friends and I are hankering for a late night meal after a night out, I might have to suggest Garcia's. Good food at a good price.
