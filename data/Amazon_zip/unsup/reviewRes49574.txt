I love the ambiance of this place, very cozy but sleek. I liked how this wine bar is more casual feel rather than the lets TRY to be hip and snooty attitude. Also the servers are great in making recommendations on wine flights and pairing it with some tasty h'orderves. Also if you fall in love with one of the wine in the flights you can purchase a bottle right on the spot.
