We came here an hour after our reservation, in a rush to get to the theatre (A Christmas Story, the musical!), with $100 worth of gift certificates. They delivered a fantastic meal, got us in and out on time, and provided really great service. They put out warm bread immediately. We could have used some more butter for it (and I promise, we're not butter-grubbers!), which we did eventually have to ask for, but the breads were so good... A brown one with raisins and a mini onion loaf. So good! I ordered a cup of the shrimp and crab bisque (since their corn chowder, the soup of the day, had bacon in it)... It was good! Certainly not world-changing, but tasty. (I may be pelted with live crabs for saying this, but I think Bonefish Grill's crab and corn chowder might be a little bit better). Being a mostly-vegetarian, I got a small version of the roasted beet and goat cheese salad. Ohh my goodness. It had two different kinds of soft, sweet beets in it, a hearty helping of almonds, loads of balsamic vinaigrette (okay, maybe a little too much), and a fair amount of creamy goat cheese. Definitely enough food for dinner, and a fantastic entree for the veggie-inclined. The rest of my family loved their dishes, my mom especially loved her spit-roasted half-duck in a sweet cherry sauce, which is the daily special on Thursdays. My brother loved his 20 oz steak, I think mostly because he was proud to be able to gloat about finishing a 20 oz steak. But I get the last laugh-- I ate his side of roasted vegetables. And they were delicious.
