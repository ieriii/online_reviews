I am not a Chicago native, and tend to waiver between thin and thick crust pizza depending on the day. One thing I can say about about Pequod's that makes it stand out from the crowd--their thick crust pizza has a ring of burnt cheese which is absolutely delicious, and unlike any other pizza. Also, their sign has a fish with a thong on his head. 4 stars for that alone. For an appetizer..try the fried zucchini!
