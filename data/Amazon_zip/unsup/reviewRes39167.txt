Longman & Eagle is simply amazing. Yes, it oozes sex appeal, and is a great place to take a date on a weekend night. Because those are the ones when you really want to make an impression, and L&E can totally be your wingman for the night! Service was impeccable, from the time we arrived, to the enjoyable wait at the bar trying their big beer list, and whiskeys and old timey cocktails like a sidecar with shaved nutmeg. Once seated, no less than five people took care of us, and explained every dish that was put on the table. L&E has enough appetizers and small plates, that we made our meal by assembling small plates of Gastropub "tapas". -Pretzel w/Welsh Rarebit, great! Rarebit is like beer cheese soup, and dipping a big homemade pretzel served as a great appetizer. -Bone marrow w/spicy jam served on crostini. Scooping bone marrow and jam out of a big dog's bone was new to me, but this was really tasty! -Pumpkin gnocchi w/foie gras, juniper berries and rosemary. Excellent! And the juice was great to dip the crostini in. (I'm getting the name of the dish wrong, it's way more "culinary", but pumpkin gnocchi is what it is.) -Spicy Wild Boar Sloppy Joes- big enough for a meal, this came with fries, and oddly, just plain old ketchup. The sloppy joe was, indeed, spicy, and huge! Dessert was out of the question! But since we had been talking about ice wine, decided to order the Apple Ice Wine from Ontario, which was a nice light way to end a great meal, and a great experience at Longman & Eagle. Many happy returns are in order!
