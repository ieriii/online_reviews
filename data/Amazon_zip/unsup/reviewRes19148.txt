We went here last night with Osi V and Kev to finally see what all the talk was about! We got there at around 8 PM and had to wait about 40 minutes to order/get seated. Not bad. We each ordered a torta...Coriqueso, Milanesa, Pepito and Cochinita Pibil. We also ordered two soups to share...Posole and Pork Belly. And for dessert, of course we got the churros. The sandwiches were very good, but my only issue was that they were one the smallish side and the bread was very crusty compared to what I am used to with traditional tortas. I even heard a few other patrons say they thought it was hard to eat because of the bread. But the flavors were really good except for the Cochinita...it was on the dry side which was disappointing. The soups were pretty good, the Pork Belly being better than the Posole. But maybe it's is just because my husband is Mexican and Osi V. is Mexican and we are all used to the traditional homemade bright red posole with lots of garlic and chiles. Who knows...but it was on the flavorless side for our palates. Now the churros.......those were on point!! HAHA But seriously, they tasted almost as good as the ones I recently had in my father-in-law's home town in Mexico over the summer. They were reallllyyyy good! I could have done without the chocolate sauce, but that is just my preference, I like them plain. *To drink, Osi V. and I both had the Agua del Dia which was a Raspberry/Prickly Pear and to be honest, it tasted like limonada with a hint of bright pink juice (prickly pear). It was SUPER limey, which I am fine with, but lime wasn't even in the description. Oh yeah...and we saw Rick...it was awesome...I was star struck, again. I just love that man, okay?! Ahhhhh...so overall, it was a fun experience and I will definitely be back for some churros to go sometime but for authentic Mexican tortas, there are a million other great places to get one for like half the price and double the flavor.
