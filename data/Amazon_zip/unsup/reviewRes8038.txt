Just a couple brief comments: 1. Probably one of the very best restaurants for large groups in Chicago. You can start eating just about literally the moment you sit down, and since it's prix fix, you don't have to worry about doing check-splitting acrobatics at the end. 2. I'm pretty sure that I was served by the Brazilian Jon Lovitz.
