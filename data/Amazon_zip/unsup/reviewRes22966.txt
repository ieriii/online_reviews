How can I review an institution like Greek Islands and not give it rave reviews? I dunno. I just wasn't impressed. Everything seemed to taste the same and have the same mushy texture. The gyros didn't taste any better than my favorite joint in Tempe (Phoenicia Cafe). I ordered the combo plate; others got the braised lamb shank, mousaka, and dolmades. We also got the flaming cheese and the cold octopus (which was really good). Overall, I just expected something better. As the boyfriend's family favorite, I'm sure we'll be back. Next time, I'm going to stick with the apps and a salad.
