I have been a huge fan of Indie for a long while now. I think that in the past they always did a great job with BOTH their Thai and Sushi offerings. And had I written this review last year I would have give 4-stars, easily, maybe 5. However, over the last 6 months or so, I have noticed a decline in quality. The food has been inconsistent - ranging from (still) fantastic to a little bland. And the last couple of times I dined at the restaurant I found the bathrooms to be dirty - which is gross. And I cannot give more than 3 stars to a restaurant with a gross bathroom. Maybe there has been a change in management? The BYOB/Full bar option is obviously fantastic. I love that. And the food, when the chef is having an 'on' night, is very nice. I am still a fan - just no longer a huge fan - and if they can get their food back to a more consistent quality and get that bathroom cleaned up, I will be back to update my review.
