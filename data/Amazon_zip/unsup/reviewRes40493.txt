I'm pretty sure I'm on a weekly schedule with this place now. Even in the summer, if pho is a little too hot, I'm in there for spring rolls and a chicken and veggie dish. I CRAVE IT NIGHTLY. They do it so well. Huge menu with colorful choices. Awesome tea and shake selection. The crowd is just as colorful and diverse; from sunburned, drunk Cubs fans to quiet hipster couples. I love it. Service is fast, food comes out super fast, prices are great and the quality is incredible. Curious to try Vietnamese cuisine? Get in HERE. NOW.
