For the amount of press this place gets, I am not sure what the fuss is all about. I found the food to be mediocre despite the somewhat pretentious way it's presented by the waitstaff. We started with the bone marrow for an appetizer and shared the special (roasted chicken with truffles, for 2), scallops with oxtail gnocchi, and something else that I cannot recall. The bone marrow was a new experience for me and I wasn't really digging it just from a pure textural perspective (admittedly, I don't like the concept of chewing on fatty tissue, though the onion jam should be on everything). The oxtail gnocchi was very good but it was more of an enhancement to the scallops (which I didn't care for because I'm not that big of a seafood eater), and the chicken was average. Given the long wait time, color me unimpressed.* from my visit on 10/2/2011
