The Gage is one of my favorite places in the city and one of the only places I'm willing to go for food or drink downtown. You have to understand: I work in the Loop. After work, I want to get as far away from the Loop as possible. But there are times when I have to suck it up and meet a friend from out of town for dinner, or need a place to go before a museum or show, and those are the times I go to the Gage.  The atmosphere is great and the decor impressive, I especially love the bar that goes on forever (though, as others have said, it's really noisy and gets crowded). This is the kind of place where you might run into Da Mare (no joke, I saw him there in March) and it somehow seems less full of tourists than so many other restaurants in that area. Or maybe they're just better dressed tourists? Whatever, I don't get that Indiana vibe from every other person I see and that's just fine with me. The wine list is extensive and expensive but if you're up for a splurge you'll get a great glass. Good beer list, though I've never actually had any here, and a nice selection of cocktails as well. The food is fantastic; curry chips are amazing (huge portion though, best to share), they have good soups and salads (word to the wise: if you're a strict vegetarian or don't care for seafood stay away from the Romaine; it comes with anchovies and the dressing is much more fishy than your average Ceasar) and a nice selection of sandwiches and as for entrees? Well, to be honest, I've only ever gotten the Daily Risotto. Because it is just that freaking amazing; I love Grana Padano like the fat kid loves cake. I can't comment on the Brunch menu as I've never tried it and I've only ever sat at the bar (always to avoid a wait for a table) but can say that service there is great. Seriously, writing this review has been enough to make me want to go for dinner tonight! Love you, Gage...
