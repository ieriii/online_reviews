Went in a small group and we thoroughly enjoyed our mixed drinks, bottles of wine and the sushi. Everything was presented nicely and our server was very attentive. It was a little loud but only because every table in the restaurant was taken. I think noise is to be expected. Our wines were quite delicious. We had a Riesling and a Sauv Blanc. The cocktail menu was unique and my drink tasted quite lovely. My group seemed very pleased with the sushi and apps. The side of cauliflower was incredibly tasty and I recommend it for vegetarians.
