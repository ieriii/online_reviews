I grew up blocks away from Superdawg. This was my neighborhood hot dog joint. Superdawg set the standard of what I expect out of a Chicago hot dog, and no one has measured up to it yet. Kitchy atmosphere aside, this place is thee place to grab a dog & fries. My boyfriend, who grew up in Manhattan praising those pathetic dogs with brown mustard and onions, forces us to stop here every time we visit my parents.  If converting a native NYC-er (with stubborn view about NYC hot dogs being the best) from NYC dogs to Chicago dogs doesn't convince you that this is the best hot dog out there, I don't know what will.
