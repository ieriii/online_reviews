I didnt have high expectations and was delighted to learn how wonderful this place is! Super bright and beautiful on the inside. I ate up in the balcony which i enjoyed looking down at all the people buying delicious pasteries below. I had a sandwhich with ham and sun dried tomato sauce, it was great! my friends got these filo pasteries with cheese and chicken inside and they were also really good! i would def recommend this place! also one of the more cheaper places in greek town!
