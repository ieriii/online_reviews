Last night was my second visit to Davanti Enoteca, and I have yet to be disappointed. Since the wait for a table was up to 45 minutes, my hubby and I decided to cozy up to the bar and order a bottle of wine and our meal. The bartender recommended the Wednesday night martini special, made up a small glass and let us taste it. Not my kind of drink (strawberry, basil, balsamic vinegar something - a liquefied salad in your mouth). We ended up ordering an Argentinian bottle of red. We ordered the mascarpone polenta with pork shoulder ragu (the ragu of the day), 3 cheese plate (Robiolina fior de Bosco (my favorite), Grana Padano, and Montasio Vino Rosso), and a pizza D.O.C. Everything was VERY good and just the right amount of food for two. I recommend Davanti for a romantic meal for two or bring a group and share your food selections! The restaurant seems to clear out a bit after 9pm (on a Wednesday night).
