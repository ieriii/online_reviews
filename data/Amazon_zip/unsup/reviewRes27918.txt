Don't get me wrong, this is far better than Domino's or Pizza Hut. But in a town where you have delicious thin and thick-crust pies, Pequod's just doesn't cut it. They are most known for their thick crust pizza, which has a layer of burnt cheese around the crust. That's a nice touch, but it's not enough to offset the mediocre sauce and too-thick bottom crust. Again, you won't hate Pequods, but there's just no real reason to go.
