I love piece... outside its location, its one of the best all-around places to be. Their beer is great, and as others have said, the pizza is different in a good way from the Chicago norm. The guest drafts and bottled beer selection is great as well. It can get pretty busy, but I've never been disrespected by the staff, who seem to be constantly working. Live band karaoke is what pushes it over the edge. Make sure you allow time for the alcohol to have its effect, though.
