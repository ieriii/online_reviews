Nice decor, excellent service, but the rooms are so SO tiny. I mean, c'mon, a closet that is only 7-8 inches deep? Really? And the bathroom sink was no better; it only had about 8 inches of depth from the front to the back, making it super hard to hit the target when brushing my teeth. On the other hand, the quality of the bed, linens, bathroom products, and even the clock radio were all top notch. For the price, however, I prefer the Hard Rock; it has much bigger rooms and is right next to Millenium Park; it also has free wifi, a big flat screen TV, and even a stereo system and DVD player in each room. Oh, and the Hard Rock is also about a hundred dollars LESS than the Allegro per night.
