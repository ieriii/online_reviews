The fact that I have been here at least 50 times without exaggeration (really) and haven't reviewed this place yet is me fulfilling the role of failure and traitor to the Yelp Community. I have been here in Vegas and Chicago, and I am happy either way. So this place is done by the Cheesecake Factory, and you can certainly tell that by being here. This place is Cheesecake Factory (which I like a lot) upgraded. The place is HUGE, and has remained incredibly busy year after year. I've tried a lot of things here...they have a HUGE menu that can make you indecisive, and so here are some of my recommendations: -Those incredible spring rolls (They have a couple options for these but they used to have these philly steak ones...please lord bring those back!) -Chicken Royale -Jumbo fried shrimp -Rustic Apple Pie A la Mode(Give them 30 minutes to prepare this fantastic concoction of apple goodness) -Any of the chocolate desserts Any way, the staff is nice here, I haven't encountered anyone rude, and they seem to do a pretty good job keeping up with the large menu and current specials. Also, have sat at the bar and enjoyed the game with a full menu available. They have a pretty good system set up for if you have a wait (thankfully the place is so large they can do that.) Just a well done place, and I wish there were more like it, especially for the price.
