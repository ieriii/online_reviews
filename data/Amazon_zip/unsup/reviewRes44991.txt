First of all, I need to thank my friend Eli for recommending this place. When I told him I was going to try another restaurant, he insisted I go to this spot. I am so glad I finally listened. Thanks Eli!!! I have no idea what kind of sauce they use on this pizza but it is really really good!! Very cheesy and just all around great!! I recently visited Chicago and was recommended this pizza place. I actually ate this delicious pizza pie on my final day in Chicago, but wish I could have found it earlier, as I would have eaten it each and every day!! The ambiance reminds me of a Soprano's episode. It's a bit of a wait and extremely filling, so make sure that you come to this spot hungry. Between three HUNGRY girls, we ordered a medium deep dish pizza, and were unable to finish the entire thing. It was definitely an amazing experience for all of us, as we had been anticipating Chicago style pizza from the day we arrived. I love the way the restaurant takes your order prior to seating you. I think that helps with the agony of waiting around a table for 30 minutes filling up on bread. I hate when I do that!!! We received our pizza pretty quickly, but we had to wait awhile to get a table. But, I thoroughly believe that good things come to those who wait! If you go to Chicago, please make sure and eat here. You won't regret it!! Bonne Appetit!!
