I finally got around to eating at Shaw's. My dad and I went here for lunch and had no trouble getting a table in the restaurant. There was a lot of good stuff on the menu I would of liked to have tried ... oysters, and crab bites are just a few. Both of us went with the lunch special that day. A seafood potpie and side salad. The potpie was more of a soup than a potpie but either way it was excellent. It has crab, lobster, peas and lots of other tasty goodies in it. To finish it all off we both also got a key lime pie sampler, that was top notch! The total was just under $40 for the two us, not too bad. Cool vibe, good food and nice service.
