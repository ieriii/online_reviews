This is a great restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere. We went for our work team's holiday dinner with a group of seven and everyone was happy and had something to eat (even the vegetarians). They recomended the olive margarita to me and although I was skeptical, it was deliciousious! Trendy and you pay for it, but it's worth it!
