Always one of the first places that comes to mind when someone asks for a great place for craft beer. This cozy and perpetually busy place sits in my mind somewhere between an old European pub and a warm ski lodge. The vibe can't be beat, especially when the snow is falling and you find yourself at the bar chatting it up with a fellow beer snob barkeep when the crowds are down early in the day. The beer list is formidable as you might expect and heavy on Belgian varieties. Not to worry if you're more into domestic craft brew as they have that covered in spades. This was the first place I knew of to have draft Great Lakes available quite a few years ago and was the first place I tried Surly Furious back when they were distributing in Chicago. So you'll likely be able to try quite a few beers here that you haven't yet found elsewhere in the city. Menu options are somewhat limited, but I've always found that the food was very good. The steamed mussels and frites with aioli are standouts and most everyone would likely tell you the same. The mussels here are easily among the top two or three I've had in the city and will certainly satisfy. The only downside is the popularity of this place. You'll almost always wait for a seat in the bar or in the dining room. Head there at a non-peak hour and you should have a wonderful experience.
