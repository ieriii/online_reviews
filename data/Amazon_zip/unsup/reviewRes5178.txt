Great collaboration of a bunch of Chicago's best chefs!  Had lunch this week with a friend "in the know".  Here's what we ordered: (1) roasted corn w/mushrooms; (2) artichoke/fingerling potato appetizers; (3) pork shoulder with yummy mashed potatoes; (4) THE most delicious bread with serrano ham, asparagus and topped off with a fried egg; and (5) finale was the marrow bones with more of the most delicious bread topped w/greens and kosher salt.  OMG.  Everything was amazing.  Beautiful day - sat outside at a communal table.  Staff was fantastic.  Just wish I could have had a glass of wine and didn't have to go back to work. Definitely will get back soon. Second visit today.  Different friend.  One new item was the whipped feta with cucumber.  Too much cheese -- too little cucumber. Could use maybe a touch of garlic.  Bread delicious.  I have been dreaming of the marrow bone dish for a couple of months and could not wait to order today.  UNFORTUNATELY -- just the top was finished -- the middle and bottom of the bone tasted like lard -- definitely not cooked through and through.  We mentioned (and showed) to our server and she took it off our bill but still.  So disappointed.  Maybe I'll try to make my own.  On the plus side -- the bread is still super delicious.
