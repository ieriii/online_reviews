Irazu is a rare example of a restaurant that gets everything right: ambiance, service, portion sizes, temperature, quality of food, seasoning. Flawless! Went to dinner last night (a Wednesday) with my husband and a college friend who is a military man with a strong appetite. We arrived at a quarter to 8 and were seated almost immediately, despite the crowd outside. Our server, JUSTIN, was so great. Our friend asked if the portion sizes would be enough for him (he seriously eats a lot). With a big smile, Justin replied something like "If you aren't satisfied, I'll get you anything you want." Whatever that means, his sense of humor and awesome attitude made us feel really well taken care of. Literally 2 or 3 times, we felt like staff was reading our minds. As our friend said, "we're gonna need more chips" someone plopped some on the table, saying "Here are some more chips for you!" It was great. I am so grateful to Irazu, because we only see our friend once or twice a year, and he LOVED it. We had such a great time, with no exception. I have worked in food & beverage, so usually I experience something - lip stick mark on a glass, cold food, underseasoning, portion sizes - I guess I have bad luck. No such occurrence at Irazu. Even the 1 bathroom shared by women/men in the back of the restaurant was not bad. Everything was wonderful.
