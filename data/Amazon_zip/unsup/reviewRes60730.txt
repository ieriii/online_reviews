Fat Juicy burgers.That's what you'll find at Lockdown, and lotsss of them! They have SO many options and they are all special in their own way. Choose your favorite and you will not be dissapointed.So far my favorite is the Jail House Rock- a burger with peanutbutter, bananas, and bacon.. sounds strange but the mix of tastes in your mouth is amazing (yes, that is was she said). Music can be a little disturbing at times, but if you can handle a little heavy metal for an hour or two the burger will be well worth it.
