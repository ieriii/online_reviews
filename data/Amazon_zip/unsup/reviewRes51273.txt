So, I gave it a couple more tries just to see if maybe our chef was having a bad day, but the carne asada is always burnt, chorizo always much saltier than it should be. I actually took my sister here because I wanted to know if I was just being biased based on my first couple bad experiences, but... She actually got sick off her food. She prefers her tacos with just onions and cilantro, and lime... Which she had to ask multiple times for. It's hard to mess that up. so confirmed, they're NOT the best tacos in the city. I did order breakfast once, and the huevos divorciados was actually ok. But I wish I knew it was that large because i wasn't in the mood for such a large breakfast. Still super loud, service is slower each time we come back. Did they memorize my face from my yelp reviews!?!? Jk. My friends can go for their "awesome tacos" without me. Pass.
