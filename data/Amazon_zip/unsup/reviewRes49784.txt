Chicago visitors, this is a nice first stop to get oriented to the food scene in the loop. The wine flights are entertaining... But the small bowls of the demi-glasses make it a little difficult to get to know the wine. The cheese flights were fun too. I give high marks to the bartenders for fast, friendly service. Not the most intimate setting but it was enjoyable enough to lure me in twice on a recent trip. An earlier reviewer called it the Ikea of wine bars. Right on I'd say.
