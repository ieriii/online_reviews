Great Place! Beautiful and spacious inside. A lot of items and beers on the menu were enticing but I settled on a Magners Irish Cider, the seafood chowder, and the "knife and fork caesar salad". All were delicious. The romaine lettuce is grilled, making the whole salad slightly warm. Can't wait to go back!
