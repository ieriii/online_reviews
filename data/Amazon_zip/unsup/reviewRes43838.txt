This is a toddler friendly place, although a bit crowded. I would have given three stars but the kid friendliness of this place bumps it up a star. The wife, kid and I had a good early breakfast here before heading to the Garfield conservatory. The Orange French Toast was okay, but not amazing as others have described it. The dish that stood out was my wife's Huevos Rancheros. They serve it in a small casserole dish and all of the flavors blend well together.
