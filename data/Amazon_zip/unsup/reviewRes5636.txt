Thanks to The Purple Pig, I am on the hunt for exceptionally prepared pork. My friends and I enjoyed the pig's ear - crunch, well-flavored and very rich! We also tried the pork shoulder - it was like butter. The seating allows you to socialize with other patrons and check out the selections they ordered. I can't wait to return with my husband. When the establishment is full, it is a bit loud, so be prepared. We didn't really know what to order, but the server was very helpful. She recommended a number of wonderful dishes and suggested wine for pairing. It is a small plates type of place, but you can share or not.
