"You're the best around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down!" ....except for the Blackhawks parade I guess. I heard this one was supposed to be glorious. Brilliant meat to cheese ratios and super quick and friendly staff. First off, there were lines 10 people deep and when I finally chimichanga'd my way up to the front the gal at the register greeted me with a warm smile and a "Hi! How are you doing today?!" Me "I'm doing quite well, gracias!" Her "Wonderful! ::pause:: Hi! How are you doing today?!" So unless I went on broken record day, I feel like her politeness was a little not-so-genuine. Food was ok. There were no mints in my bag this time, nor gentlemen to sweep the legs...of me off my feet. Clybourn Tacy Bell still rules over all.
