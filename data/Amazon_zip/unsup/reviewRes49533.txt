The wine list is great, and the flights are all really fun and the list is accessible for us non-wine experts. The space is great, service is good, prices for wine and food seem to be on par. But, this place gets marked down on the menu. I wanted to get some nibbles and appetizers to go with my wines, and there just weren't a ton of options. Nothing grabbed me too much on the menu, other than the great cheeses they have. I had a cheese flight and a ceaser salad, and really ddin't see much else I would order off the menu, and I am not a picky guy. The ceaser was underdressed and really boring. I would come back again but only thirsty, not with an appetite.
