I am sorry Chicago.... I hate your deep dish. I walked from Wrigley field to eat what the locals call "the best pizza in the city" at the Art of Pizza. I wanted to like it, I really did. It was awful. I also tried a slice of the "thin crust" and it was equally as bad. The cheese is like melted plastic and I am positive that on the deep dish the dough is not all the way cooked through.
