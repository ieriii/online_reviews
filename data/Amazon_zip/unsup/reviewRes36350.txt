I was a little nervous coming here on a Saturday morning. We had to catch a boat ride at 10:30 and we got here at nine. There were a few parties ahead of us and we were quoted a ten minute wait. Sure enough, ten minutes later we were seated. Ten minutes after that we had food on our table and coffee in our bellys. Some days you want to sit back and enjoy a leisurely meal, some days you need to eat and run. Today, we needed to eat and run. Meli let us do exactly that. My wife ordered the tropical crepe special. It was a banana stuffed crepe covered in various fruit. It was good. A little sweet, but good. I went with the Meli omelet. Panchetta, shallots, parsley, chives and Boursin cheese. Pretty damn good. Definitely rich, but tasty and filling. The omelet came with some red potatoes and toast. The potatoes were great. They also brought out some fig and orange marmalade which was good not great. It was a more expensive than a lot of brunch spots, but they came through for us with some quick service. I've had comparable breakfast meals for about fifteen dollars less than what we paid here, but I'd come back.
