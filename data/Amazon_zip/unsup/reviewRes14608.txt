Visited this place for the 3rd time today, except today I decided to bring my girlfriend who is a big is a big fan of cuban sandwhiches. This place has yet to dissapoint, always delicious. It is pretty small inside but if you can grab a counter space you are all set. The walls are decorad with old newspaper clips and photos of Cuban history. They also have a great patio space that looks like it would be great for the summer, espically becuase they are BYOB. I got the Lechon sandwhich is pulled pork, sweet plantians and grilled onions. I also got an empanada. My girlfriend got the cuban sandwhich and a side of paps fritas. With soft drinks the total was about $19, so pretty well priced for all that you get. The food came out about 5 mintutes later. Super fresh, hot and delicous. The almost makes the sandwhich, it is super crunchy. The meat is a good quality and there is lots of flavor. Make sure to get some of the hot sauce they have sitting around the counter. It is really flavorful and makes a good punch. I give place 5 stars for great service, unique atomsphere and awesome cuban good. A place that is definetly a place in Chicago that is worth checking out.
