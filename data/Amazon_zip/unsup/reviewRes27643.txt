Work catered in our lunch from here. Mediocre presentation, but once you get past that part your sold. If you can serve up tastey rice and beans, I'm impressed, and I was. But their homemade tortillas!? Soooooooooo good. That warm tortilla wrapped around those succulent pieces of steak was perfect. Great sala...can't wait to dine in soon.
