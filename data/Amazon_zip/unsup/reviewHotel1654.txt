This is a really cute hotel! I haven't actually stayed at the Allegro, but my work held its Christmas party here. It was on a Friday in December, and our group of about 40 people were in part of the "Living Room" and "Cameo" room on the second floor. It was a really nice, cozy, lounge-like atmosphere. There was a large fireplace and uniquely shaped leather couches. I would describe the decor as "retro chic." There were a lot of bold prints mixed with dark woods and interesting art. Very hip and cool! There was also an area for the open bar, and hotel staff circulated with hors d'ourves. The food was tasty. We had chicken teriyaki, beef wellington and different types of pizza. It was good! Our bosses actually decided to extend the open bar another half hour because everyone was having such a good time. Another positive about the Allegro is its location. It is just around the corner from our office building, and it is right in the heart of the Loop. The Cadillac Palace Theater is right next door, and you're within walking distance from the river, the lake and all the Loop has to offer. I would recommend the Hotel Allegro for work parties or other gatherings. It's a very cool place and interesting venue!
