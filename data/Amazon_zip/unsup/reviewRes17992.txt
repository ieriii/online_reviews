My new favorite spot for a beer and burger! We just moved to the North Center/Lincoln Square area and I've already been to this place three times. Great, great draft beer selection that is constantly changing and the burgers are almost as good! I highly recommend the Belly Burger for all you pork belly fans. A great, friendly neighborhood spot that offers a beer selection that, in my opinion, rivals any bar in the city but checks the pretentiousness at the door (again, Hopleaf, anyone?). The food is really good too (Cheese curds!!!), but not at all expensive. It can get really crowded on weekend evenings, but from what I've seen, the crowds move in and our pretty quick.
