I will just be repeating what everyone else here as said--it was amazing. We went for my 30th birthday, planned the trip to Chicago solely to eat at Alinea. It was great and well worth it. The dishes that stand out to me are the English Pea, the hot potato cold potato, the truffle explosion and the Short rib beggar's purse. All 19 courses were very good, some were mind blowing. We did not do the wine pairing, we had one bottle of pinot noir and our bill was about $730 for 2 people. Definitely the most money I have ever spent on a meal, but worth it. Go if you get the chance. The only bad thing--my husband and I feel spoiled now. We went to some other restaurants in Chicago and they just did not compare.
