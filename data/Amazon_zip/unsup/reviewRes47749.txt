Okay fellow Foodies, here's the scoop. Atmosphere was trendy but not pretentious. Another of our restaurant week ventures. They had 4 tables set up with salads, veggies, fruit, soup and my personal fav the charcuterie with cheeses, spreads, cheese, meat and how could I forget, cheese. The buttermilk biscuits with melted cheese on top with the side of tangerine butter was surprisingly delicious. Putting so much attention into something so simple was a nice touch. Then servers running around with skewered farro salmon, buttermilk ranch sirloin and Moroccan chicken threw down piece after piece upon our plates. My boyfriend, Jeff got called out by our server for doing the happy food dance and that was even before dessert! Dessert. Oh. Dear. God. Butterscotch bread pudding with homemade vanilla bean marshmallow. IT was heaven. So this place was pretty incredible and well worth the price. Apparently they also have an amazing brunch which we will have to try. Four thumbs up and a happy food dance for good measure.
