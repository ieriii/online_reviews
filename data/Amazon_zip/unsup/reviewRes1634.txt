I went to Chicago on a mini-food tour back in May. After seeing this place featured on the Travel Channel's Hot Dog Paradise, I had to make a stop. Went here with a couple friends and waited 2 hours in line on Friday morning of the Memorial Day weekend. Wow. Once we got in, Doug took our order and when one of the bussers saw that we were a group of 3, he cleared and saved a table for us. How nice! I went with one of the specials - bacon sausage with creme fraiche caramelized onions and triple cream Brie cheese - and the dog with everything. We also shared an order of duck fat fries, which were yummy but not more special than any other kind of fries. Except that we waited 2 hours for them. Everything was delicious, although the bacon sausage dog I had was pretty rich....in a good way. The next time I come to Chicago, the long wait in line would make me think twice about taking another trip to Hot Doug's. I would try more of the specialty dogs and come wayyyy earlier.
