Artopolis is a cute cafe in Greektown that has good espresso and yummy ice cream served with cherries. The espresso is much better than Starbucks for example and 1/3 the cost. I usually go to Artopolis for dessert and coffee after a Greektown dinner. It's a fun place to sit and chat with friends over coffee or have a bottle of wine before hitting up one of the nearby bars for some Greek dancing. (Not that I can Greek dance, but some of my friends have tried to show me and the music is fun.)
