I have been a fan of Sheraton hotels and this is one of my favourites. I was here for a conference twice and we've also stayed at their suites as well. We enjoyed their thorough service and the beautiful space which is great for any business needs. You can't beat the location either. It's just by the Chicago River and if you are lucky, your hotel room might be facing a scenic river view which is especially gorgeous at night. It is also a short walk away from Michigan Avenue shops and other touristy places in the loop and restaurants in River North. I highly recommend this hotel for tourists who is looking for a wonderful place to spend the night.
