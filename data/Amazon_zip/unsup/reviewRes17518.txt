Probably the best Indian food I've ever had, short of a place called "Nawab of India" which is on Wilshire in Los Angeles. The dishes are all very rich and flavorful, and the vindaloo will knock your socks off with all the spices! It's a bit pricey ($5 for rice? Come on, other restaurants give it away for free!), but well worth the occasional trip. The lunch buffet is pretty good too for those that need to try a little bit of everything. What I don't get is why they close for a couple hours in the middle of the day. I'm assuming employees are still there, and there will probably always be customers wanting to eat...why not stay open the whole day? Anyway, pretty good place...
