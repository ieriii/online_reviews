not that impressed overall... we got to the restaurant at 5:30 on a friday for dinner...the wait for a table was over an hour. just walking inside we were confused where to stand and wait for our table...finally grabbed a seat at the bar...the beers we sampled were definatley laking in taste and not acurate decriptions on the beer menu...we were expecting more from the beers, but nothing really stood out for us. Sat down at a pretty decent seat for dinner...the waitress never gave her name, our appt sucked, and our order came out wrong. it just seemed like they wanted us to eat and get out...probably wont go back. we did like the gentlemen who took our name and sat us...he was very nice and personal. Revolution Brewry seems misplaced for its location...trying to be too trendy with the food, and laking on beer quality...
