There are so many Italian steakhouses in Chicago, and this is the best I've had so far! The food and service are FANTASTIC! I've eaten at Harry Caray's, Gene and Georgetti's, and Erie St. Kinzie Chophouse wins hands down when comparing service, price, portions, and quality of the food. The servers were excellent, which will come as a surprise to those that have been to some of the other steakhouses in the city. My girlfriend, her mother and I, went to Kinzie Chophouse for Valentine's Day this year. For Valentine's Day weekend all meals included champagne for everyone at the table, and a box of toffee and chocolates for the ladies in your party. We had the Goat Cheese and Marinara appetizer, Spinach Salad, Caesar Salad, Delmonico with the four cheese macaroni side, the angel hair pasta entree, and the bowtie pasta entree. Everything was perfectly portioned, perfectly cooked, and presented. The server was expertly helpful regarding steak selection. I mentioned the service, but it's worth noting that after making a reservation earlier in the week, I received a confirmation call from the restaurant from one of the friendliest and most helpful hostesses I've ever encountered. While confirming the reservation she added that there was parking across the street that they would validate for $7 rather than paying the $12 for valet at the restaurant. The night of our dinner we were stuck in traffic on the Eisenhower because of a UIC basketball game, a Blackhawks game, and the auto show.... We called the restaurant and they were very appreciative that we called and told us not to worry. We were 30 minutes late and were seated immediately in the packed restaurant.  Again, there is no reason I can think of to not include Kinzie Chophouse at the top of your list when considering a comfortable place with great food and even better service.
