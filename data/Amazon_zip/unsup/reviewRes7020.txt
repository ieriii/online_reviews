Chicago q is a fantastic place in Chicago to go for some really, really good bbq.  For starters, the waiter brings out a bowl of butter pickles that are pretty sweet and leave you wanting for more. You are also brought out some BBq chips that went really well with the butter pickles when combined. What I really wanted to try at the "q" was the Kobe Beef Ribs but, unfortunately, they were out of them when I got there :( I ended up ordering the St. Louis Half Slab of ribs and they turned out to be amazing. The meat was fall-off-the-bone and it was just incredibly tender. They also give you a generous side of coleslaw or, if you prefer, fries.  Along with your slab of ribs, you get to pick from 4 different bbq sauces, such as, Original, Spicy, Eastern North Carolina Vinegar, or South Carolina Mustard Sauce. For me, I really enjoyed the Mustard Sauce and the Spicy the most although the others held their own just fine.  Naturally, I just had to try out something from their drink menu and I ended up choosing the Whistlepig Straight Rye Whiskey and all I can say about that is, "lskafjoivnuroai%@!!**!" It was a mighty fine drink indeed and it went very well with the ribs & sauce.  I will say that you will pay a hefty bill when you are through if you order a 3 course meal plus drinks and tip. The food, to me, was very good and the service was outstanding. You have the option of eating indoors or out and you really couldn't go wrong either way. Check it out! -Papa Bear
