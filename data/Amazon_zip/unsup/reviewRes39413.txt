After the past few times eating here, I need to downgrade my stars to 3 or 4 stars (Imagine 3.5 stars...). The service is simply very rude. While the servers are very quick for bringing out food, the servers are not courteous or understanding. I came here with a large group of people and we were enjoying some pleasant conversation with our meal. Right as the check/bill came to the table, the server ordered us to pay right away..... Alright..... So we did. And then when she came back with the credit card receipt, she waited for us to sign it. Literally one minute after this occurred, she came back to our table and told us, "You already paid and must leave now. Need table for others."  Wow! This was a shocker on the rudeness scale.  Naturally the tip was already included in the bill, so she could really care-less how offended we were. The service NEEDS to be kinder, more patient, and less demanding to its patrons. This is not an isolated incident and has occurred to me many times and even my friends (and their stories are far worse!!!).
