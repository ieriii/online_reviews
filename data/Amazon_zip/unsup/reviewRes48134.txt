Been here for brunch twice with different groups. In one word - AWESOME. I love the atmosphere, location, and the menu is unbelievable. I didn't hear a single complaint about anything from anyone that I was with. The drinks were delicious, service was impeccable, and the food was more than satisfying. Both times we went without a reservation and both times I was given the booth I requested (remember, impeccable service). The waits were as you'd expect at such a popular restaurant, but get there early to shorten it as much as possible. Try the waffles!
