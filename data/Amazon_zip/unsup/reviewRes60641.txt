Looking for a great place to grab a bite but not break the bank? Head to RJ Grunts. (Right next to Lincoln Park Zoo) We were just there with some friends. We all had something different, but everyone was pleased with the amount of food and the selection at the salad bar. (Try the French onion soup - yum or even the cream cheese and chocolate chips or the pulled pork sandwich - boy I'm getting hungry) no matter what you choose, you will be happy...and so will your pocket!
