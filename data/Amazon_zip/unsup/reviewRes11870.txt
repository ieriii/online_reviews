Love the Bongo Room. It's abgreat spot for breakfast with friends. Be advised though, this is far from ordinary breakfast. It's more like "dessert as breakfast". There is alot more than sweet stuff though, super eggs benidict(s), and some vegetarian options as well. It's a special occaision place, not an everyday kind of place. And yes, expect a minimum of 30 minutes wait, sometimes as much as an hour. Best to get there, put your name in and go do some window shopping in cool Wicker Park.
