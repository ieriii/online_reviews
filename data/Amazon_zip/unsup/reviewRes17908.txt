This place has it all - great atmosphere, great service, great drinks, and above all great food! We went here looking for a good burger and were definitely not disappointed! Their alcohol menu (mostly beer) is longer than their food menu, and while I'm not a beer fan the locals only marg was amazing! And while the drinks were great the food was even better. My burger was topped with fig and goat cheese and was perfectly cooked. But even better was the option to add spices to the fresh cut fries - I tried the old bay which was great but the curry (which my husband had) was to die for! The fries were so good that I almost didn't use the homemade ketchup. I went home with a full and happy belly!
