The mention of pastries from their artisan bakery was enough to lure me in. The delicious food--chocolate tart, handmade potato chips, turkey/cranberry/brie sandwich, more than a pint of Blue Moon for $4--convinced me to come back. I'd like to go back and look more around the market section; it was huge and they had tons of variety in high-quality groceries. The cafe has great food, you can drink wine and beer there, and you can even get stuff from the market to eat in the cafe. It's a great place to go if you're at Navy Pier or the AMC Theater.
