So I may or may not have a slight crush on Rick Bayless... but I also know he's a GREAT chef and really cares about making sure his ingredients are sustainable - and this location is LEED certified, which I thought was pretty nifty. We waited 1.5 hours and it was totally worth it (plus Rick was still cooking there the first week and we were all excited to see him). The Azteco chocolate drink was great - dark chocolate with a little chile kick. The servings are the perfect size and we'll definite be coming back!
