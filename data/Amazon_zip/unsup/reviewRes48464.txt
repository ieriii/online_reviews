My girlfriend and I had a couple friends who had moved back to Pittsburgh about a year ago in town over the July 4 weekend. One of them is a waiter at a really nice restaurant there and he heard about The Publican and asked me about it about a month before they came in. I made reservations immediately. Both of us are really into pork and he is a huge fan of offal meats. Personally, being a cook, I like most that I have tried and am willing to try just about anything. The Publican's menu and beer list seemed perfect for us. I will not go into crazy detail about the menu items, especially since they seem to change quite often, but I will say everything was incredible. We tried many different things from fish to duck heart and it was all delicious. The most surprising dish was definitely the duck heart and liver. It was amazingly good. The sweetbread was also very nice. The beers were outstanding and paired so well with the style and atmosphere of this beautiful restaurant. It was one of the best meals, and times, we have had for quite a while. Going in to The Publican, I had heard some horror stories about bad service. I will say that our server was incredible. He was very attentive without being annoying and he constantly was bringing us free drink samples to taste and explaining things to us if we were unsure. It was an amazing experience and I would certainly enjoy going back. I wish my wallet and my blood pressure could afford me the luxury of eating there every week, but alas.
