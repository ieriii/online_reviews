Best Setian Pizza!!! Really, it is the best thing on the menu! I also enjoyed the beer cheese soup. The dinner salads & margherita pizza are a miss, but I really appreciate the extra attention given to the desserts (the choc porter cake is very rich and fantastic!). *Rev Brew now is my favorite place to get a Bloody-Mary, it is served with a huge hunk of sharp cheddar & a cornucopia of vegetables.
