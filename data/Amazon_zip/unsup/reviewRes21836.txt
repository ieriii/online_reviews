This place is one of my favorite Mexican places in the city. It is very reasonably priced, they have great food and the drink specials are fantastic (half priced margaritas FTW!).  There are only a few problems. It can get very cramped inside the restaurant (the patio is awesome though) because of how small it is. Also, the food is REALLY heavy. Don't plan on doing anything for at least two hours after you eat. This place should really be reserved for nights that you are just going to do dinner and go home and sleep. The food is that heavy.
