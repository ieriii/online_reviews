Whether it be the smiling faces that great you the moment you walk in the door, the delicious and flavorful dishes like the claypot chicken or the beef pho, or the bounty of complimentary fruit (Yes, that means FREE!) that comes with each take-out order, there are many reasons to try and then frequent Simply It. Since it first opened I have been consistently impressed with the food and service that I have experienced here, whether from dining in or carrying out, or for lunch or dinner. Dishes are very reasonable in price, but they don't skimp on fresh ingredients or quality. The owner is the nicest man on the planet and if I didn't have a father, I think I would want him to be mine. In a city where the choices for dining out are endless, know that eating at Simply It will never be a crap shoot, just a delicious and affordable night out.
