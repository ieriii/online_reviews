I went here last week for the first time on my birthday. I love the atmosphere, service were good. Our waiter was sweet and very friendly and hopefully. The place is really big, one down side about it is there only 1 bathroom stool. I have to wait 10min just to use the bathroom. But beside that the food is great! Out of the things we ate (picture posted) my fave have to be the Tofu and the Tamarind Duck. LOVE THE TAMARIND DUCK! Least fave is the seafood soup, it was too sweet for my taste.
