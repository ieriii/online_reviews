Did someone say Bacon Wrapped Shrimp? We've become regulars of Caf 28 in the past year, but it was probably Saturday night's discovery of the savory Bacon Wrapped Shrimp that solidified my love for Caf 28. And after probably 8 or 9 visits to this lovely dining establishment, we finally learned the name of our server who has waited on us for a number of those meals: Chloe! I am a seafood lover, so I've experienced the salmon and halibut dishes on almost every occasion. Both are delicious, although I had the salmon this weekend, so that dish is this fresh in my mind, and I swear it tasted even better this time around. My boyfriend's weakness is their Honey Jalapeo Pork Chops, and oh, my goodness. What a genius combination of flavors. As for dessert, the tres leche cake always satisfies whatever room we have left in our bellies. I'm salivating just by the thought of it now. Yum. Overall, a wonderful place for any occasion. We've come by ourselves and with larger groups. All experiences have been stellar. Thank you, Caf 28!
