Amazing food!!! Such a cute atmosphere as well! There was ~ 15 minute wait at 2 pmish for us to get seated but it was well worth it! Service was faster than we would have imagined. The dishes are pricey (but large!) but it's a great treat for your mouth once in a while! Our waitress was very flexible and combined my chicken and vegi omlette and allowed me to order it even though I requested it minus the meat. It was great, very tasty! My friends ordered crepes: symphony and cloud 9. Chocolate, strawberries, bananas more chocolate... Need i say more?!?! Soooo good! But they quickly had a sugar high and ended up having to carry out their leftovers. Overall great experience! Will definitely be back!!!
