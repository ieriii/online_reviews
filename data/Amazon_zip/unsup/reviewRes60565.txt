Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in the entire city. I first started going here at a kid when my family lived in Lincoln Park and hadn't been back for several years, but now that I live in the area again, I go on a regular basis.I've tried many of the entrees, but the club sandwich is easily one of the best -- I really like clubs and get them frequently at restaurants and their club is usually made with real turkey meat (i.e. not processed) which is rarity in town. The pulled pork sandwich is fabulous, and the burgers are great too. You really can't go wrong with just about anything on the menu.The salad bar is awesome -- great selection of veggies, fruit, and the usual stuff you find on a salad bar, as well as a couple of soup choices to go along with the salad. Also, the chocolate chip cream cheese is incredible, and goes really well with the fruit. And if you order an entree with the salad bar, the salad bar is something like half price, a great idea if you're really hungry.And for dessert, if somehow you've gotten to this point and still have room, the Oreo milkshakes are incredible, and if you go in the fall, they often will have a pumpkin pie milkshake that I've never had anywhere else in town, and it's delicious!
