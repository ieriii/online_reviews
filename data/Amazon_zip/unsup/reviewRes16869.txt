As others have noted, the decor and the atmosphere can't be beat - the high ceilings, bright colors, original artwork and layout, etc., all make this a very fun and social place to have a big meal. The food is pretty good too. As a fusion restaurant, you get a bit of everything to choose from. The plantains are an excellent side, and the different cheeses are delicious as well. The prices aren't cheap, but they aren't over the top expensive either - think $15-30 entrees. If there's a real downside to this place, it's that there's often a long wait. Waiting an hour for a table on a busy night is pretty much par for the course, so don't come here if you're in a hurry.
