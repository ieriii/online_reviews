I like this place. The atmosphere is a little cold but the burgers and beer list more than make up for it. The people that are pouting it's a Kuma's rip-off are the same type of people that claim they liked a band before it was popular.  If I'm comparing the 2 I'd say Kuma's has a better atmosphere and selection of burgers but Bad Apple has way better tasting burger meat (I believe its from one of the great butchers of NYC) and you don't have to wait in line for 2 hours to get in.
