This is my fav lil sushi place in the city. The menu is great! I feel like the Sushi X creater went to all the over prices sushi restaurants in Chicago and picked the best stuff off their menus. It's BYOB, which is sometimes annoying if you forget before arriving. Luckily there is a CVS nearby that has a pretty descent wine selection, however it closes early. So the food it great, service is good, you won't spend too much, but the ambience is just okay. I like the deep blue walls and video projection of odd japanimation movies, but it feels a little cold and empty. I wish there was a fireplace and comforatble booths, but maybe I'd have to wait a year to get a table. They recently added a few new items to the menu and told us they wouldn't charge us if we tried it. Come on! That's awesome! And the new items were amazing! If you like sitting near a window this place is not for you - there are no windows.
