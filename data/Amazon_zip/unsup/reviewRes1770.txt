Heading to Chicago, my friends and I had to do some research on places to hit up while we were in town. We found out about Hot Doug's and heard it was a must do. We went on an early Friday morning and stood outside in the freezing cold for about an hour or so. (Hey, we're from the south! But it was seriously the coldest day of that whole weekend). We finally made it in through the door and out of the cold only to wait some more. The place is long and narrow, definitely a tight squeeze and not good for big groups. I with 3 other guys ordered about 9 different dogs to get the best sampling. After all it's not often that you get to try something as unique as Hot Doug's does it. We got a few off the original menu and some off the specials menu. And to our delight we came on the right day! Duck-fat fries were available!! (available only on Friday and Saturday in case you're curious) Unfortunately I cannot recall the names of the dogs. I myself got the Bratwurst and Chicken sausage. The chicken sausage dog wasn't really all that great but the Bratwurst was excellent. The other dogs were interesting and good. The fries didn't really taste all that different from regular fries but I suppose it's worth checking it out. Overall I would say this is a place to go every once in awhile. I wasn't sure what all the hype was about but as a tourist I'm glad I got a chance to go.
