Four of us had dinner at 7.30 on Thursday evening. The place was jumping when we arrived and the noise level only increased from there. Definitely not the place to go if you want to have a conversation. Our server fitted us in between a couple of large tables and after a bit of a delay getting drinks, for which she apologized, she did a really good job. Other parts of the service where a bit more haphazard. We were warned at the outset that one dish (tempura shrimp on crispy rice) would come when it was ready. The bussing team did not pay attention to when diners had finished earlier courses so that main dishes arrived when there was no room at the table for the plates. They just got jammed in front of us. The food was spectacular. It's just a shame that at its price point, Sunda cannot offer a more even service experience...and perhaps a "quiet room" option!
