Small plate dining is controlling our lives! Luckily for spots like Davanti Enoteca it gives an amazing opportunity to try each and every dish on the menu! I highly recommend the truffle egg toast. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because it is always packed and without a reservation, it is hard to eat and get to the Bulls games on time. Probably shouldn't dock them for being amazing at what they do, but I am trying to be objective here.
