Wanting to impress my older brother and sister, I decided to bring them here. We all have fish dishes: salmon, bass and halibut. As we shared bites, the jury was unanimous in that they were all delicious! The sides are family style, so order 1 if you're in a party of 3, for example.  Dessert was off the charts, and the service....fabulous!
