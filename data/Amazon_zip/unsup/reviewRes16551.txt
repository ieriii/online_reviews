Delicious food, somewhat less delicious prices ... I had the strip steak with goat cheese and it was prepared so that it melted in my mouth. OMG. The appetizer we had, ropa vieja, was just fabulous, and we also got some ceviche. What I didn't like about the server was that he really tried to get us to buy more ceviche than we needed. We had an appetizer and the ceviche sampler -- we don't need 5 types! We're getting food too! Anyway, the food was really good and I sometimes fantasize about another capirinha. Lime-tastic!
