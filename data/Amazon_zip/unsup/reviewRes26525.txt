I was staying at the Hiton Chicago while on a recent business trip and discovered Mercat a la planxa next door. What a find! Chef Jose Garces really does live up to the hype with some amazing combinations. Everything I had was very good, but two of the dishes blew me away... the slow cooked short ribs & diver scallops dish was absolutely amazing! Melt in your mouth beef with a perfect salty smoke to complement scallops. Also, the wild mushrooms, a staple for any tapas restaurant, was very well done. The perfect balance of spices, garlic, onions, a nice medly of wild mushrooms and a drizzle of truffle oil for the extra punch. Like many of the other reviewers, I had to try the chocolate croquetes, but they are honestly nothing to write home about, and I will agree with anyone who says this place is expensive. The food is very good, with some truly exceptional dishes, but many of the dishes are frankley priced too high for what they are. I will also warn you that the servers need to do a much better job of describing the dishes, so don't be shy to ask them a lot of questions to tease out important details.
