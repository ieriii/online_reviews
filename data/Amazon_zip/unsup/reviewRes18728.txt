I have since returned here a couple times, as it is the best burger in close proximity. My main complaint was the service before; the service was extremely slow one trip, and excellent the second (though the second return trip we sat at the bar). My friend and I were asked to move once to make room for a larger party, but the manager comped us any beer we wanted for the inconvenience, which was nice of them. Still an amazing beer list (and surprisingly good beer cocktails) and a good burger.
