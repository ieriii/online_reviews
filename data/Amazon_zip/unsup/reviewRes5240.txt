While I still don't enjoy tapas, The Purple Pig was one of the better tapas places I've been to. The price is still a bit steep for both the quality and quantity of food. The service, decor, and non-food related attributes of the place are all very good. We went with a group of six, so we ordered a decent bit. We tried at least one dish from every subcategory of the menu from the Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette to the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs to the ever so popular Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. None of the dishes made me go "wow," though the goat cheese and pork shoulder were both very good. Some of the dishes, like the cured meat and the bone marrow, did make me have the opposite reaction. I love, nay, LOVE bone marrow, but it's almost like they managed to suck the natural flavor out of the marrow and replace it with, well, nothing. My feeling is that much of the buzz is coming from the recent pork craze which was getting really old even a year ago. Don't get me wrong, I still love me some pork, I just don't think any pig slapped on a plate should be fawned over. The Purple Pig wasn't as bad as I've made it sound. I don't plan on going back, but I in no way regret stopping in. I just don't think there's anything particularly exceptional about The Purple Pig.
