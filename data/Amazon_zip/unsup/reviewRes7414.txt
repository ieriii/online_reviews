My sorta-gf, Meredith S., already wrote up our review of our double date with our bfs so I won't duplicate her efforts except to say that the service was great, our water glasses were always filled and the food was tremendous. My bf and I went there for our "Christmas dinner" celebration. He had received one of those gift certificates in the mail (like everyone else) so we decided to try it out since he lives basically right across the street. We were NOT disappointed. The restaurant was totally full, but our waiter and bus boy were still very attentive and accomodating. I'm sure they get sick of all the 20-somethings coming in with these coupons, but they still handle it well. We started with the bruschetta, which was done to perfection and then we moved on to the caesar salad. The lettuce was crisp and the dressing had a nice kick to it. I had the pasta with seafood and the spicy marinara, it was incredible. There was an abundance of clams and shrimp (I asked for no mussels). I had an incredible amount of leftovers. The bf had the spaghetti with veal meatballs and some other meat too. He loved it and again these portions are not for delicate flowers. By the time the main course was over we were both ready to burst BUT the coupon comes with a free dessert so we succumbed to the temptation of the tiramasu. We were NOT disappointed. It was so light and tasty that we ended up finishing the whole thing and of course, our bottle of wine to boot.  Overall this place is obviously committed to customer satisfaction and delivering good, hearty italian meals. Thumbs up. I'm struggling to justify why I don't give it 5 stars, but I don't... yet. Give me one more fantastic meal and I'm sure I will.
