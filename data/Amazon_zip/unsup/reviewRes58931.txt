At the beginning we had a good waitress, explained the menu, and gave suggestions. We took those and ordered a few items to start. The first "devil's basket" was rubbery and not good. We finally tracked down our waitress 15 minutes later and told her it wasn't right. She told my husband later that chef agreed-not their standard and comp'd. Ok-next we got the WRONG order and again after finally finding her the response was "sorry". Our correct order never showed. Asked to speak to Mgr. Orville comp'd the second item from our bill since it never showed, I should hope so.  While I was speaking to Orville the waitress interrupted our conversation twice to justify the event. It was an unfortunate experience but an experienced wait person knows to back off and let the mgr handle it, (whoever made the error-kitchen or staff) it was out of her hands now. This is a nice place, hard to get reservations. From what others say there's a lot to like. The very least I want is what I ordered, I expect good service. Neither happened. The whole bill should have been comp'd and this was just a mess.
