Well, well, well. By all accounts of my past with the original UG, I truly thought I would naturally like this place. First off, I have never seen more meat on one menu in any one place that has their own rooftop organic garden than here. And the sentimental sap that I am, I also was hoping for a tad bit of the old/former UG to reappear here...a little less attempt at foof and a little more down & dirty get back to the coffee shop wholesome food small plates business that I grew to love in Wrigleville. Nope, not here. Tree-tini's and rabbit. Hmmmm. Not for moi. Our waiter was even apologetic to the point that I believe he actually does not like to work there. The space itself is great, but that's all compliments to Jody Andre, former owner of this space when it was Speakeasy Supper Club... I just am not thrilled to get my vegetarian chili cooked up in a place that serves large amounts of rabbit and pork belly.  They do have fab music and a great outdoor dining space, and for those of you carnivores with a high credit limit, check it out, I'm sure you'll convince yourself it was somehow worth it. There are true eco-posts for dining and hanging out, but this one, well, it's just not for me.
