I will be honest. I've heard nothing but good things about this restaurant. The atmosphere, the staff and everything is very good, however my dish last night wasn't that good. If I were to base my opinion solely on my dish last night, then I would never go back. However, my companions dishes were amazing and delicious. I ordered the chicken breast with pumpkin seeds, kale and butternut squash. The chicken was very flavorful, however the kale and the butternut squash were very bland. I could have used more flavor, not necessarily spice, but more flavor. My companion had the steak which was delicious and it came with this corn-bread thing which just melted in my mouth.
