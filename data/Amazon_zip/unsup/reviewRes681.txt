Ambiance was okaybut the service was excellent, the cuisine was innovative, challenging and playful, and the wine-pairing was almost spot on. I went there for my 22 birthday and somtime around thanksgiving. First time was difficult to secure a reservation (3 weeks in advance) but on the second time, my reservation was booked on a saturday night 4 days in advance. Both times, the receptionist was very nice about the booking. Entering in Alinea, I was immediately waited on every second of the way til I walked out the door. The server to table ratio is 1.5 :1 which is awesome. They seem to know when to talk and when to shut up, when to bring a meal out and when to wait a little longer. They were very polite and patient in explaining each course and wine flavor complementing it, the emotions it was supposed to invoke, etc. as I was not familiar with the culinary lingo. I would definately recommend the larger course and the wine pairing with. Their menus change constantly and its never the same two dishes. I wont go too much in detail with the dishes but experiencing it was worth the price to eat there. The wine pairing is a near perfect compliment to the dishes also. The whole experience, 20 some courses, lasted a good 5 hours and I was comfortably full in between. Overall, i recommend going there at least once if you live in chicago. Its not one of the best restaurants in US for nothing.
