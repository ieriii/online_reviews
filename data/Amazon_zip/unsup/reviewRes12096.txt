Soooo disappointed. We had several gift certificates so we were there three times in the past couple months. Each meal was disappointing, primarily because everything and I mean EVERYTHING was too spicy. And we are adventurous eaters and enjoy spicy food. It was all about the heat in the food and not the flavor, spices, herbs, etc. And, my mojito's (and his margarita) were meh.
