I wish I could give half stars on yelp, because if I could I would give Hopleaf 3-1/2 stars. Considering how much I love the mussels, though, I decided to be round up, not down. Here's the thing: the wait at this place is ridiculous. The first time I went there, it took about an hour and a half to get a table and the next time it was close to 2 hours. The latter time, the hostess definitely skipped us, as they gave us two appetizers for free. At least, though, they have that upstairs bar area where you can wait and enjoy their amazing beer selection. Because, oh jeez, that beer list is incredible. Seriously. Amazing... I've only ever gotten the mussels with pommes frites before, and they are incredible. I'm still dreaming of the mussels in a curry broth, which was a special on a night I went. I only wish they had that curry flavor in their standard rotation - it was that delicious. The other people I went with ordered something from the non-mussels menu and the food was just okay. Nothing great, nothing bad. Bottom line: awesome beer selection, awesome mussels, long wait and so-so non-mussel food.
