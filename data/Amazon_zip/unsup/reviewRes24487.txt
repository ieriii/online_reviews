Great service, even better food. The surprise was Geja's offered very good value. We left waddling with a smile on our face.  Let's start by stating the obvious, this is not the cheapest dining option around. Geja's Cafe is perfect for special occasions, but probably not for every day use. You get what you pay for, and that is an exquisite 3 course meal. The Cheese appetizer, the entree (we had scallops + beef - great choice), and dessert chocolate all were terrific. The gruyere cheese in particular was memorable. Unfortunately, we were almost too stuffed to enjoy the chocolate! Service left us wanting for nothing, yet was not overbearing. The bus boys in particular get points for keeping us well-watered and attended to. Ambiance fit the bill as a cozy romantic destination. I thought the wine bottle enhanced walls were a nice touch. All in all, great experience, solidly exceeding expectations. The check will take a bite out of your wallet, but I can say with complete sincerity that it's worth every penny. I really don't think I could improve upon Geja's performance, and will be hard pressed to find a fondue place that compares.
