The Gage was my second and last stop during this year's Restaurant Week. Branch 27, my first stop, was great and I was hoping to continue the streak here. I was at the Gage once before a few years ago. I had a variety of homemade sausages and a Scotch egg, and I remember enjoying it. This time, however, not so much. We made reservations for 7PM and got in with no problem. We sat more towards the back of the restaurant this time. This place is much longer than I thought it was. The first time we ate here, we sat in the front bar area, which is small, cramped and dark. This time we walked past the bar and into a devoted dining area that is much brighter and better laid out. We were seated and ordered some beers. The Gage has a pretty decent beer list, which is always nice. We were also given a few menus, but we were only interested in what they were offering for Restaurant Week. That menu was surpringly light on options--only 2 choices per course. We both ordered the lobster bisque for the first course. I wasn't a huge fan. It was very bitter. It did have a very prominent lobster flavor and there was a dab of shredded lobster in the bowl, but something wasn't quite right about it. For the entree, I ordered the hanger steak and my friend ordered the white fish. The steak was a surprisingly small portion and again the flavor was lacking. It seemed suprisingly dry for a medium-cooked piece of meat and overall it was very dull. The small splash of sauce and salty greens didn't add much either. For dessert we both had some sort of chocolate/peanut butter mousse that I enjoyed well enough. Overall, the Gage is a nice place, but the food just didn't measure up to everything else it had to offer--an incredibly disappointing realization.
