I have been coming here for over 30 years and have always enjoyed myself, had good food, and been treated well. The place is a work of art, and the food always consistent, fresh, and delicious. The best salad bar in the world, with delicious soup, chopped liver, and red jello. The waitresses have always been great, and professional. Im not usually one who likes louder music, but I do like the music they play there, though I wish they could dig up one of their original old tapes or cds from the 70s. I like to sit in the booths or under the banana painting. The burgers and veggie burgers are excellent. If you want to have a nice experience in Lincoln Park, then come here. If you want something the opposite, then go to Northpond.
