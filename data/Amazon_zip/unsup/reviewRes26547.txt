Been here several times before and it continually gets recommended by friends and acquaintances so here I go again. First they serve you a small meat appetizer along with their homemade salsas (and a lot of varieties) you just have to ask for it. Since I don't eat beef or pork I coudn't taste it but from the aroma, I could tell it tasted good. I ordered the Camaron Al Mojo de Ajo and agreed to corn tortillas when my friend stopped me and said OH no, you have to get the hand made flour tortillas and I was glad I did. It really made the shrimp taste even better. The service could have been better but I didn't care, it's usually good, besides I was too busy eating my shrimp, salad, rice and tortillas. Hint: sit in the opposite room of the cashier, do not sit by the bathroom and is CASH ONLY. Overall: cheap delicious food, BYOB, and home made tortillas & salsas are great
