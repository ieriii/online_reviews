I would say this is quite the experience, and for the price it is totally worth it for the food. I dont think there was anything here that I didnt like, though what stood out for me was the venison wrap and the wild mushrooms. I made a reservation on thursday, got a call friday, and was set up for sunday. If you want to dine in here last minute, it is indeed possible if you give it a try. You can read other reviews about the food and service but for me ( who has very tight "purse strings") and gets disgruntled if I pay for things that under deliver (esp a $600+ dinner for two), I left in a good mood. The wine pairings are great but really not needed if you are not a heavy wine person. 1 or 2 glasses was all i needed to last me through the experience. Expect to pay 100+ for the various types of pairings though.
