You have to get the Peking Duck if you come here! I really love the steamed bao like dough that comes with the duck and the pickled carrots and radishes. It's super pillowy and delicious. I went once with my family and once with my boyfriend, and Sun Wah was great in a group setting as well as for a date. However, the second time I went on a Monday and the restaurant was not that crowded. For some reason, there was a bit of a wait for someone to take our order and there was a wait for us to get our check as well, but besides that I would highly recommend this place!
