My favorite brewpub in the city. Their stable of beers are solid to excellent (the Mild is really the only one I wouldn't order, the Eugene Porter on the other hand is about as good as it gets) representations of a full range of beer styles, and a constantly updated rotation of seasonal offerings can satisfy the more adventurous/booze bomb seeking. Food is pretty top notch as well, although to be fair, I almost always order the burger (always cooked perfectly medium rare and accompanied by well seasoned fries). It gets crowded, but waiting for a table at the 360 degree bar gives you a chance to talk shop with the knowledgeable bartenders. The TV is almost never on (I consider that a plus). I've also waited with a larger group at a seated section off to the side of the host booth which actually has a server. We almost didn't need our table when it was ready. My main detraction is that the hard surfaces surrounding you make Revolution a pretty loud place (maybe some fabric to soften the sound?) but this is nowhere near a big enough complaint to knock Revolution off a 5 star perch. I think its time to renew my Mug Club membership...
