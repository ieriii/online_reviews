I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups after work. It was loud, crowded and the service was slow. The appetizers were pretty good, but there are plenty of other places to go in the evenings. At the moment The Gage has the "New Kid on the Block" thing going on, which probably contributes to the crowding, but it does have some good building blocks to grow on.
