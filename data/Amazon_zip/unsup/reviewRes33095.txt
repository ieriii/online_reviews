This is my favorite breakfast place to go to in Chicago. Granted I don't live in Chicago, but I visit often enough where I make it a point to have breakfast/brunch almost every time I come. While the portions are huge, it's how good their food is that makes this place worth coming back. I've had their benedicts (pot roast and traditional), omelettes, frittatas, pancakes, and they're all great. Coffee is average but good early in the morning and you can have as many cups as you want. Strawberry OJ is amazing as others have said. Service is pretty good for how popular the place is. Waits can be long (~1 hour) esp on Sunday morning and there isn't a place to sit to wait unless you go outside. Hopefully they'll get around to using that waiting area space inside more effectively by putting seating there. It's a close walk from the Red Line.
