Great place. Authentic Italian cuisine and decor. Been here numerous times and always been amazing. You get a ton of food, bread and butter, some sort of warm Italian/cheese bread, salad, soup, all with every entree. Food is very reasonably priced, as is the house wine. This is a great little local place, if you wanna get out of the big city type restaurants where everything is overpriced and you just pay for the location, come here. You will not be disappointed!
