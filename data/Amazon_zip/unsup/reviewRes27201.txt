After dining at Frontera Grill I'm of the opinion that many, if not most, of the other Yelper's who have written a review about the restaurant have succumbed to its hype. Frontera Grill is good but it is by no means outstanding. The restaurant seems more focused on mass appeal rather than producing amazing food. When I dined there, I sampled the Trio of Ceviche, the Queso Fundido Clasico, Duck Tacos al Carbon, and the Topolobampo Tortilla Soup. For the most part, these dishes were good but none of them was outstanding or had robust flavor. The flavors of each dish seemed to be muted so as not to turn off any diners. Nothing was that spicy, despite the fact that the waiter or the menu described it as such. In general, much of the appeal of Mexican food is its robust flavor, and Mexican cuisine does not benefit from subtlety as well as some other cuisines do. In contrast, while the food was lacking in the flavor department, the drinks were not. Frontera Grill has a bevy of unique and excellent tequila based cocktails (and I don't normally enjoy tequila - and usually avoid it at all costs).  My disappointment in Frontera Grill may have had something to do with my high expectations. Given the accolades that Rick Bayless has received, I guess I was expecting more of a Thomas Keller type experience which Frontera Grill did not deliver.
