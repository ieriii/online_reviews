I stayed here for two nights, May 23rd to May 25th. I was upgraded to the Pinnacle Suite, room 1312 which was nice. The hotel is definately showing some age with the elevators, electronics and furniture but it also provides some character to the hotel. The bathroom was clean, the towels were clean, the amenities were nice. The only negatives I have for this place is that my bed was lumpy and when I was checking out, it took the bellman about 30 minutes to help me with my luggage. The bellman said that they are in the process of upgrading the hotel and the individual units with new furniture so that should help this hotel in the future. In general, I got a good deal on the two nights I stayed, was upgraded to a suite and the staff was friendly.
