The chips served with the guacamole were stale! (...on a Saturday night at 8:00 PM! NOT acceptable!!!!) I guess since I'm complaining the guac was really just okay. After waiting 45 minutes for our meals all 4 entrees our table ordered came out luke warm/ cold. The Halibut was not amazing and was swimming in mango baby food...yuck. (and P.S. for $27 a small portion of some type of legume to go with the giant pyramid of rice next to the fish seemed in order, no?) The service was friendly and okay. Thank god because if the service had been as mediocre as our meals it would just have made me angry. I left Frontera Grill with a Wellbutrin high instead of my intended food coma. Total luke warm apathy.
