Oh...my...gosh...this pizza...is like no other. Oooey, and gooey cheesy goodness filled with pepperoni and whatever else you want to put in there. And let me tell you, one slice is PLENTY. But, it is completely good and a must try. Keep in mind though, that you have to wait 45 minutes for the pie to cook, so I suggest ordering a few apps to go with it. Since the pizza is so heavy, we had the Greek Salad which was an enormous plate and enough to feed the 2 of us. Our service at this particular location was okay, nothing to really review about. We came in late, around 10pm so that could have had something to do with it. I'll have to try the thin crust next time I'm in the great city of Chicago.
