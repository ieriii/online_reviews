Stayed here for a work trip recently. Pros: Friendly employees, great location (one block off of Michigan St.), clean, simple and spacious rooms. Also free WiFi and ethernet cable internet access in the room. One other bonus nice gym and an indoor pool. Cons: I thought it was a little pricey $189 for the quality of the room, but it might have been high because it was a large convention. And their currently under remodel, so weekdays from 9:30 AM on, it's a little noisy. Hopefully you're out and about by then. Overall: If you want a Marriott Hotel close to the Magnificent Mile this place is great.
