Went here for the first time w/ a group for brunch yesterday, it was my first time dining at mercat but it was a pretty enjoyable experience. The ambience of the restaurant is very cute & mod... the food & decor are both very colorful. We had the brunch special where u choose 4 tapas plus one botomless specialty cocktail (bloody mary, mimosas, red/white sangria) for $25. There was a wide variety of choices for the tapas, however the menu was a bit confusing at first because it says "choose 5 tapas & a signature cocktail, however if you order a cocktail w/ the special then you only get to choose 4 tapas. For the bloody mary they had a bar where u can mix in all the ingredients...the "yellow gazpacho" was very tasty. We also ordered the paella negra which was large enough to serve our group of 6. It had lobster, octopus, calamari & shrimp..it was very flavorful and if you've never had paella don't let the black squid ink scare you away because you won't want to miss out on this dish! Also the manchego bacon biscuits are really good too. For the tapas I recommend: the gambas (garlic shrimp), the crab omelette, skirt steak sandwich, shrimp & grits..there's plenty of choices to satisfy your tastebuds.
