Pros: - friendly service, Doug is awesome! - kitschy but cute interior that is spotlessly clean - unique encased meat flavor combinations with inventive toppings, their game of the week seems to reliably hit it out of the park Cons: - the line can get long; I came at 10:00 a.m. on my off day and was first in line, but before it opened at 10:30 there were already 10 other people behind me - cash only - be aware before you go and line up - YMMV in terms of value for price; Doug's encased meats are good, but for 3 out of the 4 specials I ordered, I found myself wishing that I had spent the money at a comparable establishment in the same price range elsewhere instead (e.g. Xoco) - this may depend on your palate's inclinations  Summary: order the specials and you'll almost forget your eating "just" a hot dog; come early or at an off time to avoid the worst lines.
