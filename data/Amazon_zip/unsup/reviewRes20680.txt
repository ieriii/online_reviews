I am convinced this is my favorite sushi place in Chicago. Although pricey for a BYOB place, the rolls are unique and I really think there is a special freshness that goes into each roll made at Coast. The atmosphere is awesome. It is a modern, but too contemporary feel. The waitstaff is nice and knowledgeable. I wish I could tell you what rolls were good, but I can't remember! Anyway, it's a good spot for a date or a small group of friends. It's a loud and busy place, so get ready to yell.
