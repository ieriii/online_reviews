It says a lot that my first visit to the Violet Hour was with a pathological liar from http://match.com, and I still liked it so much that I've gone back repeatedly with my friends. True, I go at off hours, but you'd have to be crazy to wait more than 10 minutes in a Chicago winter to get in a bar. This bar has the best "romantic" atmosphere equally matched by phenomenal cocktails. Go (before 7pm - yes, crazy early) to kick your night off with the best per-dinner drinks.
