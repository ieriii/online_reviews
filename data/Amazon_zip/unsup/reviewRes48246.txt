This place was unbelievable. Off the chain. We ate pretty much everything the menu offered. We started with a chef's selection of Oysters. These were fresh and briney and served with some kind of horseradish liquid. That was it for seafood, since our group tended more towards the meats. We had the spicy pork rinds, and these were so much better than they sound. It really tasted like fried pork, not like a pork rind from the gas station. Since we loved nearly everything we ate, I will just list the things we had and you should just assume that each one came with its own little collective moan from the table.  The only thing I didnt love was the steak tartar. Too much curry, and I love curry. -Charcuterie Plate (head cheese...yum) -Veal Brains - good, but the texture wasnt as I expected, more like ricotta -Boudin Blanc -Sweetbreads -Pork Belly - this was amazing -Farm Chicken - for the picky folks, but was amazingly delicious and I would almost never order chicken at a restaurant. -Beets - so earthy and perfect -little gem salad - like a ceasar salad but with pig ears. Who knew that I would become obsessed with pig ears. This place was seriously awesome. If you are meat and offal lover...go.  Oh and dessert, the bread pudding was ridonk. ETA: OMG I almost forgot their beer. This place is serious about beer. The people I was with were also serious about wine, so they uncorked 3 of my own bottles for me.
