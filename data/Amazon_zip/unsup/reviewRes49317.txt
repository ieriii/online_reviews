We went here for a pre-Dolly Parton show dinner. The wine flight was wonderful. The cheese flight was also tasty. The apricot and fig and honey compote was divine--hands down the best part of the meal. The waiter was an a**h*le. I asked for suggestions and got apathetic indifference and rudeness. And it cost me $45 for 4 bites of cheese and a wine flight. I know, I should've expected that price, but it's still a lot of cash for cheese and a rude waiter.
