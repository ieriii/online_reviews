Delicious Food... however I have been annoyed the past few visits by different things. 1. The waiter threw away over half of my Curry Chicken (Which is so good!) without asking if I wanted it to go. 2. My last visit they were 25 minutes of the quoted 45 minute wait. 3. the wait staff just about ran me over on my walk to the bathroom. Yield to the guest... 4. Also on my last visit after waiting the above mentioned time was informed that they were out of Curry Chicken. The whole point of visiting. I do still love the food and atmosphere. I would recommend this place but keep the above in mind.
