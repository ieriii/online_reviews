I've had my share of trendy brunch places and this place is the best one I've had thus far. It's all the great brunch foods, trendiness, and atmosphere without the ridiculous prices. Everything on the menu is a super good price. I'm talkin like ihop prices! I had the Salmon Benedict which was really good. The whole fruit garnish thing is cool but a little inconvenient as I feel like I have to eat my grapes first so they don't accidentally mix with my ketchup or something. Ew! haha ...but it is cool concept. Anyway for the prices, this place is definitely a must try
