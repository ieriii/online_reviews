I have been in once and done take out once. The food is good. It's not great, but it's good. I really like the ham and caraway Havarti sandwich. The pretzel roll is always delicious. My problem with Milk & Honey is that it is a little pricey and it's set up in a way that causes backups and traffic jams. Seems like a place that's this hoppin' all the time could figure out a way to make dining in more enjoyable.  If you end up being lucky enough to get a table after going through the ordering process, you better stay a while, otherwise you'll annoy all the other guests by trying to squeeze back through the maze of people to find the door.
