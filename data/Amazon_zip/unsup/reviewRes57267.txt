A friend and I found ourselves at Carnivale by way of recommendation after another well-championed option ended up being closed down *yikes* so, we didn't know what to expect. Boy were we plesantly surprised! This former niteclub turned eccletic and bright eatery was huge and a delight to all senses. Make sure u see Luis (proud Mexican bartender who makes a mean rasberry mojito) and Quade well versed server who had a great story about how he got his name. The ropa vieja is a tastebud pleaser and the brownie ice cream sundae won't disappoint (tho beware, the extra scoop of ice cream will cost u 4 bucks). Nevertheless, we'll be back... with plenty of friends!
