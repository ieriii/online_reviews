I used to love this place, they had such great pizza. Just like Jeff G. mentioned this place is over- rated. Unlike many reviewers, I live in the area. I ordered pizza from this place since 2004. The quality of this restaurant has been declining steadily. I'm not sure if people have lowered their standards of good food but believe me when I tell you that they do not serve good food in this restaurant. Their pizza has gone from great to mediocre (when ur drunk). I also had the opportunity to visit the dining room. The experience was unforgettable.... as in I'm never going there again. I invited my family to this restaurant. Waitstaff was rude,it took them about 45 minutes to take my order and the dining room was empty, waitstaff was clueless, and the food arrived cold and tasteless. It's a shame I had to pay for that kind of service especially when in this economy people are very selective about how and where they spend their money. People, seriously, don't believe everything you see in "Check Please". Any dumba** can call themselves a foodie. I regret following their advice when they recommended visiting "Cemitas" located on North Ave. during the weekend. They had a 17 year old kid making the food. We got charged $8 for a sorry excuse of a sandwich. Anyway back to La Villa, if you want real Italian pizza go to Spacca Napoli pizzeria on 1769 W. Sunnyside or if you want real Italian fare like sandwiches and homemade pasta (yes, grandma makes it fresh daily) go to Tony's Italian Deli on 6708 N. Northwest Hwy. Now that's real Italian.
