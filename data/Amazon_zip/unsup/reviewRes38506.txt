This place really is great, I wish I got up this way more often. Top-freakin'-notch beer selection, and the overall vibe definitely swims in the same pool with Ginger Man and Map Room. Unpretentious and fun, and you'd think the staff have have PHDs in beer. Downside is that it is generally real packed, but that's cause it's good.
