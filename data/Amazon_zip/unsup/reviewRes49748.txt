I never thought of it, but Bin 36 is a FANTASTIC venue for a small work event! We set up our power point presentation on one side of the top floor, and people had wine and mingled on the other side before the presentation. During the presentation, everything was set up promptly and without any glitches, and guests were scattered on couches and chairs--very comfortable. Afterwards we had a wine presentation and tasting, which got people to stay and network for a good while after the presentation was completed. I highly recommend going with them if you are planning a work event.
