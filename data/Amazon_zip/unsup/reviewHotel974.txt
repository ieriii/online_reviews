Four thumbs up! First trip to Chicago and the hotel experience at Amalfi blew away any hotel I have ever stayed at. Perfect location, especially for St. Patrick's day, and it was immaculately clean. Their staff at the front desk/concierge were knowledgeable, eager to help and SO pleasant. The room was roomy and spotless. Book the room that includes both breakfast AND the cocktail lounge (complimentary drinks) before walking to either corner of the Kinzie block for a fine dining experience or a casual fun bar! A ++++++++++ Thank you Amalfi for a great weekend!
