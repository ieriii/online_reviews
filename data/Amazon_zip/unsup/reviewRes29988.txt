This is bar none my favorite place for Thai food. I tried it for the first time when I moved to the area 5 years ago and love love love it! I've just now moved in with my fiance out in the suburbs but I got him addicted to the place so we try to get up there once a month still! The decor is okay, but the food quick and reasonably priced. It's always busy there....even on a Monday night! The Pad Thai and the chicken fried rice are yummmmy. I definitely recommend it!
