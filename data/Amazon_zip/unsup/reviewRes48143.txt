The specialties here is obvious with the pig stall booth, and the pigs on the logo. I like how they include a little description (creamy, firm, salty..., etc) under each oyster on the menu. It helps me make my decision since I don't always memorize the name. We ordered the Gold Creek, Island Creek, and Imperial Eagle oysters. They were all fresh and tasty. The chareuterie plate and cucussu were both quite good. Cucussu consists of a variety of meats with beef tongue, pork, and sausages. A true meat lover delight. The pork belly was on a different level. Simply the best pork belly I ever ate. You just have to take my word and get it. The signature starter here is the pork rind. Almost everyone ordered it, but I am not a big fan of fried pork skin.
