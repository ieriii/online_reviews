The food was delicious. I loved the warm bread - whole grain. I got the Greek salad with chicken - it was huge and delicious! Decent amount of feta cheese, the chicken was tender, and a generous amount of dressing. I tried not to look at the dessert case... it looked delish!  The place is huge with a beautiful decor. The thing that annoyed me was that I got the buzzer and decided to wait outside since the atrium was packed and hot. Little did I know the buzzer doesn't work outside, nor can you hear them call the names. You'd think there would be a sign or a note or something.
