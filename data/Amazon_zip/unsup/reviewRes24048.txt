Lao has big flavors and spice. Their portions are generous for one and adequate for family style with 2 or 3 other dishes. I haven't tried any of the *real* chinese dishes, but the more americanized dishes were as good or better than any place I've been before. I just don't feel excited enough about this place to give it anything higher than 3 stars. Sorry Lao, maybe next time.
