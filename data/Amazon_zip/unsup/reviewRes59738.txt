If Jesus came down and said take me out to eat, this would be the first place I'd take him. The cheese, the sauce, the bread, the crust... Unreal. If I could eat something my whole life, it would be Art Of Pizza. If food was a girlfriend, I'd ask Art of Pizza to marry me. This pizza makes s-x feel mediocre when you compare the feeling you get from your first bite.
