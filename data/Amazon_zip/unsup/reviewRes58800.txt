Cool place and yummy. My friends and i have been here many times. I can't remember the names of the dishes but they were all good! I remember when i first moved to the area in 2007 i went for the first time and it was so good i went back a week later it was shut down. I was upset soooo thats why i just loving seeing all the great reviews because i loveeeeee this place!!! rock on Opart!!!
