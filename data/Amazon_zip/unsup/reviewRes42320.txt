An overwhelming majority of Chicago Yelp folks recommenced this place on a Q&A post I put up a few weeks before coming into Chi-Town. It was definitely one of the better recommendations that we had on many of the restaurants. The locale is a but unassuming once you walk in. Service is also fast. in our case this was the first time we saw deep dish pizzas available by the slice. A rare treat indeed. So on to the pizza.....wow............very VERY tasty. On the Art's special, the crust is very average however the toppings are way much better than at other places we have been. The sauce was slightly sweet, almost neutral. In no way was it acidic (Ex. Rosati's). The cheese was absolutely yum yum for my tum tum. the only complaint I have is they sort of cheaped out on the sausage since there was not enough for my taste. The spinach/mushroom was also extremely impressive. Also something very pleasing was the prices. It was refreshing to actually find an AFFORDABLE deep dish locale for once. Especially where deep dish pizzas by the slice go for less than $3. That's sick. It will be a long time before we can try this stuff again (we got way too many other pizza places to go to when we go back). But once we make our rounds, it is sure to stay around the top of our list (if not THE top).
