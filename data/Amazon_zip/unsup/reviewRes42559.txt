The pizza slices are some of my favorite in the city; especially the Buffalo Chicken!  Very tasty tomato sauce, crust is soft and thin. I've never tried the chicken but everyone raves about it. I had the need for a pizza box one day and the owner insisted I take one without paying. I like that sort of neighborhood friendliness.  One afternoon they were mysteriously closed with no sign on the door and no mention on their Facebook page... I thought maybe it was a Brazilian holiday. I keep coming back for more anyway.
