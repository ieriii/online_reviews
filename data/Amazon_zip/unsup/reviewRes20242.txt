Meh, uninspired. After reading the list of specialty rolls, I actually had a hard time finding more than one or two that I even wanted to order. And it's not that I'm a picky sushi eater, these just didn't sound very "specialty." Ultimately, nothing we ate was bad, but I was hard pressed to pick a favorite roll because none stood out to me. Even the spicy miso soup, which I thought would be a unique twist, was just miso soup with a few jalapeno slices floating in it. I wouldn't go back.
