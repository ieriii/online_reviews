The hotel is in a great location and the rooms are clean. However, the service is horrendous and they slyly charge an extra $100 "standard incidental fee" at check out. The fee isn't listed on the final bill you sign, so it's a hidden fee that in this day seems a$$ backwards. So be forewarned that while you may have only authorized x amount, you'll see a charge on your account for x + $100 instead. Completely aggravating.     The hotel is still under renovation and has plastic covering the hallways, so it's a little dingy. The rooms are quiet, the bed is actually really comfy, and if you're a hobbit who enjoys waking up to frigid water in the dead of Winter you'll love the shower height and water temp. There isn't a coffee maker or fridge in the room, so plan on running to a cafe for your morning fix and don't bother with leftovers if you eat out. We mistakenly ordered a pot of coffee the 1st morning and had to wait 40 minutes for it to show up. Also, skip Fornetto Mei downstairs--we stopped in for drinks before dinner and waited 20 minutes before leaving because no one took our order :( Forget about staying here when there are so many other better options where you will actually get basic hotel services and not get ripped off. Update: fyi the extra fee I was charged was removed a few days later.
