Visiting Hot Doug's provided the best culinary experience I had during my recent trip to Chicago. I was standing in (an arguably short by some NYC standards) line with hungry anticipation and saw the "cash only" sign. I dug through my pockets to see what I had: 15 dollars to feed both myself and a friend. "Not a problem," I thought. Technically it wasn't: I got up to the counter and order a grilled Portuguese Linguica accompanied with a saffron rouille and 12-yearManchego cheese. My friend ordered a The Dog and a small fountain soda. We had some money left so I asked the gentleman behind the counter (Doug?) for a recommendation. "The Thuringer," he said. Heaven. The linguica in particular was one of the best things I have ever eaten...and my round belly can attest to many things consumed. My only regret was that we didn't have any more money to try anything else on the menu and that it wasn't Friday or Saturday so I could get fries cooked in duck fat. Writing this I can't help but think, "Can they ship one to me right now?"
