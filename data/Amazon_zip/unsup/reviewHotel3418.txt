The hotel was centrally located near all food and shopping areas. Even though it was an old building, they did a great job on the up-keeping. For a two full size room, it was kind of small and didn't have much room to move around. Their customer service was okay, it was so hard to get anyone during the late hours. I requested for more towels and it never arrived. For about $200 a night, I think there are other hotels around. Overall not too bad.
