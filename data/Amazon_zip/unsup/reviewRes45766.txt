Ugh, does this city really need another generic Irish pub with bad food and rowdy patrons? A co-worker recommended this restaurant but it failed to deliver in anyway - bad food, poor service, annoying patrons and the decor is just ... blech. We live in the neighborhood and would have liked a genuinely good Irish restaurant, but this experience was beyond disappointing.
