Have been hearing about this place for years and finally tried it. I have to admit the caramelized crust is delicious and unique...I hadn't had that before in a deep dish. But everything else about the pizza was not so great. FAR too doughy/bready. Unremarkable tomato sauce. Toppings were fine. Admittedly, I'll be back just for the caramelized crust. If I could buy just the crust, I would!
