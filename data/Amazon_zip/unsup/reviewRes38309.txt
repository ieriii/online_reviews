First off, I'll admit I'm biased. I love Chicago deep dish pizza so much that I get nighttime cravings for it, daytime cravings for it, morning cravings, and well, you get the idea. All of which can be a problem since I dwell far from Chicago. So when I'm in Chi-town, I gotta pack it in. Giordano's proved to be an ideal spot for it. The location was convenient to Michigan Ave. and other touristy attractions, and the pizza is amazing. We ordered the veggie pizza, and although the wait felt pretty long to me (35-40 min), it was worth the drool I accumulated while watching others devour their pies. The ingredients tasted fresh, the sauce was delicious and oh, that thick, luscious crust...swoon. The only average thing about the place was the decor, which was fitting for a pizza place but a bit too chain-stylish for me. But the pizza, as I mentioned, is quite dreamy and worth a date, or two, or three...
