if you're looking for an uncommon RIP OFF this is the right place. unfortunately we heard the hype about the "fresh" food at this restaurant. However, when we ordered a medium rare burger, it came well done. huh? no one in the kitchen noticed? the service was abysmally slow, the room hotter than outside, the prices ridiculous for very small portions . I recommend against!
