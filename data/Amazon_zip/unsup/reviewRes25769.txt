got delivery from here the other night, it was delicious, came very quickly (despite the horrible rain storms), and the delivery man was incredibly friendly.  we ordered tofu and eggplant, which was amazing, and two other veggie dishes, both of which were very good. In fact, it was so good, we ate all of it and didn't have anything the next night for leftovers! :(
