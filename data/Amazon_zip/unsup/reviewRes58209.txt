My mother and I make it a point to try new restaurants in the city all the time, and we saved Tru for our birthday celebrations (we both have birthdays in April and we tend to celebrate all month long.) The service was outstanding, the staff is extremely educated on both wine, and preparation techniques of the food. If this review was based on the service alone it would easily be 5 stars. Unfortunately, the driving force behind why I love to eat out is not the service, it's because I love great food. Personally, I feel there is a fine line between tasty and trendy. All to often fancy restaurants depart from the culinary basics in favor of more experimental and trendy preparation techniques. Tru has fallen victim to trendiness overpowering tastiness. Three items during out meal really tipped the scale to trendy, not tasty:1. The excessive use of froth. When two out of 5 dishes have some form of froth on them, that is one too many for me. Froth is being seen more and more in restaurants, but one dish is plenty. In my eyes it is for presentation, not flavor. 2. Caviar trapped in a bubble of gel floating in Sake. The sake only brought out the fishy taste of the caviar, and I don't think I will ever find a bubble of gel tasty.3. A dessert amuse that contains Pop Rocks. Yes, you read that right. The same candy that is known for the urban legend that if you drink Coke while you have a mouth filled with Pop Rocks you will die. Dinner was enjoyable, but not as great as I expected. I had a Ribeye, and while it was cooked Medium Rare as requested, I have had a better steak at Wildfire, Ruth's Chris, and Gibson's. We also had Diver Scallops, and my mother and I both agreed that we have had better Diver Scallops at places as unpretentious as Ben Pao and as outstanding as Il Mulino I would recommend going at least once just to try it out, but I can't say that this would be my go to restaurant for big occasions.
