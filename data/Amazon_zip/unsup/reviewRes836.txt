Not that this place needs another rave review but this is hands down my favorite spot in Chicago. I have never found anything like it and I have traveled a lot. The service and attention to detail that Doug offers is bar none. I remember upon my first visit that he even suggested I get the small cup while eating in to save on free refills. Wow! What a class act! Not to mention the game of the week, the sauccisson aliscienne and the foie gras sausage among others are one of a kind tastes that you won't find anywhere else. The duck fat fries are excellent with cheese (Sat and Sun only).
