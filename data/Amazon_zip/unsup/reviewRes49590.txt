4 stars for dinner, and 3 stars for lunch. Evidently, my lunch experience wasn't too memorable- the food selection isn't that great (although lunch menu is so much cheaper than dinner menu by 60%), too many tourists and business people(not that I have anything against them, but the crowd definitely changes restaurant's atmosphere), and mediocre service. For dinner, things were much better. I love their wine flights(prices range between $10-14; typically four samplers. and you can make your own flight also). One flight got me buzzed enough. What I love more about this place is its cheese flights. Or you can order slices of different kinds of cheese. As far as I can remember each slice was around 2 bucks only. I remember having a lobster sandwich+ leek soup for lunch, and scallops for dinner. The scallops were excellent. The lobster sandwich was unremarkable. Food (for dinner) is somewhat overpriced. Our waiter when I dined here for dinner was so attentive and knowledgeable. It's pretty cool that you can order your wine by number(Bin 1, Bin2,,,) like you would at a Chinese restaurant, so that you won't have to sweat pronouncing all these French, Italian, Spanish,German names. They offer wine classes (a.k.a BIN school), and you get 20% off for dining when you register for any of their classes. This is definitely a cool spot to check out if you like wine, but it's sort of a tourist(or business traveler) trap in my opinion.
