An ultrachic gastropub a few short steps from Chicago's famous Art Institute. I had the fish n chips that were deep fried to perfection. I am anxious to go back. The service was very friendly and helpful. It is hard for me to say more since I only had one dish here. I do know that it is the type of clean, and modern pub that I like to visit. Chicago baby!
