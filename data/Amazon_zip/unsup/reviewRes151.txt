So sorry, 3 hours of overpriced food and waitstaff being so serious, cool and somber I felt like I was being served by morticians.  2 of us and $900 dollars later, never again. I can see the effort put in by the kitchen yet not worth it for me.  The one strange thing to me is most everyone rates this place so highly. Maybe just a few of you feel that if you didn't rate it well you were out of sync or didn't appreciate the cuisine.
