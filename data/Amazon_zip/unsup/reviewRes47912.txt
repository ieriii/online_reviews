Excellent food and service, and the price isn't bad for a Brazilian type restaurant where people walk around with skewers of meat. I don't know if it's true but the chefs walking around with the skewers told us that each chef made their own skewer. If it's true, I think that's really cool. I also liked that each chef described what they were serving us, and the food wasn't just meat but actual dishes. For example, one of the options was duck breast with mandarin oranges. Who does that at an all you can eat establishment?? I've been to several restaurants like this, and so far, Zed451 is my favorite.  If I lived in Chicago, I'd definitely go again. PS: The banana cream pie was fantastic. Never tried Guiness ice cream before, but definitely worth getting.
