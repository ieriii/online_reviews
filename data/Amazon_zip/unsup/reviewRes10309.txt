OK we got a dark and curvy and a camel toe. Commence giggling. Our server wasn't describing the ladies at the table, but the beer. Pretty good beer too! We started off with samples of each before deciding our poison for the evening. Pizza: Love it! I can toss my native card out the window after this but I have a confession. I love super thin pizza. Piece fits the bill quite nicely. Loaded with toppings like fresh basil and mushroom only added to an already great pizza. The menu serving size is a bit off in my opinion because the pizza we got could have easily been consumed by 5 people (3 of us barely made a dent). Service: Our server was such a nice guy (and easy on the eyes). He put up with our beer induced giggling, checked in on us often and shared a few laughs. The wait was kind of insane but luckily we weren't in a rush and Piece is located pretty close to other establishments so you can do something else for a half hour and then return. This was my first time back in a couple of years, not exactly sure why but I plan to return much sooner than that.
