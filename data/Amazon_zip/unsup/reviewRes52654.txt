Rather disappointing. If I'm going to eat loads of meat, and put up with having a little meat baby stuck in my stomach for three days, I want to really enjoy it, and not just the novelty of the all-you-can-eat. The only things I wanted a second round of were the little sausages and, yes, the pineapple. And yes, I was the girl who asked for my slice of pineapple to be medium rare. Yuk yuk.
