Seriously...what's not to love? "Encased Meat" heaven if you will. Our cab ride out there was about $15 so we decided we had to do a tasting menu of our own. We started off saying we would do 2 each. As we finally got inside and saw all the specials...it went to 3...then finally 4 each! Yes...we are gluttons, but it had to be done...along with an order of the duck fat fries. They were all pretty darn tasty...but i think the deep fried fire dog was my fav, i think i prefer the all beef doggies. That being said: the jack daniels w/fennel & sage cheese de-licious! The duck, sauterne, foie & sel gris dog was INSANE! Totally over the top! Doug , himself, is at the counter and totally charming and enjoying his life as the "ENCASED MEAT " king. A PERFECT experience all around. YES, you WILL have to WAIT in line, and YES, it REALLY is worth it! Enjoy! I will be back upon my next return to Chicago
