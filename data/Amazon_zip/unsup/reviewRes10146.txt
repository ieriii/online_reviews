We were referred here by the chef at Gage, and what a great recommendation. The atmosphere was good, the wine was great, and the food even better. The branzino was easily the best I ever had. It literally melted in my mouth - I don't think I even had to chew during the main course. The primi and secondi were also outstanding, and the dessert was something to write home about.  Just when we thought the night couldn't get any better, Chicago's number one son, MJ, came in and sat next to us at the bar.  I highly recommend this little Italian delight. Even if you aren't fortunate enough to rub elbows with His Airness, the food will make you forget all about it.
