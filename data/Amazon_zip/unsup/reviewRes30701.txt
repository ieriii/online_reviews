First time I came here as a vegan I practically skipped out of that place. To know there was somewhere to eat prepared foods rather than cook everyone at home from scratch was nice. I was semi deprived of flavor at the time and I think I may have over reacted. Though... the greek salad with tofu instead of feta... delish. Second time i went there as a vegetarian, the mac and cheese almost choked me. As a mac and cheese fanatic, this was tough on me. Halfway through my meal I felt sick. The textures were all wrong. I think I'd feel better eating things naturally vegetarian, rather than meat substitute meals.
