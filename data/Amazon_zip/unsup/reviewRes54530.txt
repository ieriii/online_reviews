Chicago Diner has been a mainstay for vegetarianism since 1983. If that aint hardcore i dunno what is. Their menu is now mostly vegan which is a nice switch from a few years ago. They are huge supporters of the community and Chef Jo cranks out the yum. They still serve eggs and dairy particularly on their breakfast menu.
