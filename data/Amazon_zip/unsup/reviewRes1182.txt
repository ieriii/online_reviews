I finally made the trek to the meat mecca with two of my favorite Yelpers. Yes, I stood in line. Yes, it was crowded. And? It was worth every minute on the bus and in line! I had one of the daily specials: Spicy Jamaican Jerk Pork Sausage with Spicy Mango Dijonnaise, Roasted Plantains and Crescenza Cheese. With cheese fries, of course. Oh my. Doug rules. He even save me a few pennies by reminding that there are free refills on the soda. Smaller size, it is, Doug. Thanks. My heart finally stopped racing. I'm ready to go back.
