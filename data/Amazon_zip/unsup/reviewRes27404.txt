I was not all that impressed with Peaquod's. Its OK but only really OK. The caramelized crust is good but not amazing. I don't really like the sausage they use (flavorless and put on in big globs on top). It does have a decent laid back old school neighborhood bar vibe.  I had recently been to Buddy's in Detroit which absolutely kills this place and that might be part of my disappointment. Does Detroit really crush us in deep dish? WTF?!
