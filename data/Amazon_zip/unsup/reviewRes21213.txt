This place has been a long time favorite of mine. I don't know what my buddy Jacob J. is talking about when he says "its small" because the actual hot dog is rather thick. The poppy seed bun gets compacted when shoved in to that stupid box they use making it appear smaller than it is. The fries are crinkle cut and there's nothing especially fantastic about them. I have, however, grown attached to the tart green tomato over the years. I've never seen any place else serve this with their hot dog and it gives it that unique touch. The Whoopercheesie (double cheese burger) is guaranteed to satisfy any appetite and while there is nothing spectacularly special about it, I do enjoy it from time to time when I've had enough hot dog. I've also had their Supershrimp which are actually pretty good considering this place is not known for seafood. The shrimp are large and great when consumed hot and fresh out the fryer. Superdawg is NOT cheap by any means so get ready to shell out more than you normally would for a hot dog or burger. It is a unique experience and a cool option for a date or a night out cruising around with your buddies because of their real drive-in service. They opened up another location further north on Milwaukee for the suburb folks and their food is just as good with the same drive-in service WITH a dining area and the same decor.
