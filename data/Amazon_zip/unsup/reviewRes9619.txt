I enjoyed the rabbit very much as well as the sweet take on "foie gras," but overall my wife and I think we have had better value other places that are comparable (one sixtyblue, Cafe Absinthe). The wine pairings were excellent, but overall, it didn't deliver that special "something" that makes you feel the extra $50-75 was well spent. It could have been that even making reservations on OpenTable three weeks in advance, they were not able to move us from a high-top table with no place comfortable to rest one's feet to somewhere closer to the ground. Part of it was surely my wife's dishes; the crab entree is not quite what you would expect, less crab cake and more softshell legs. It could have been the dessert. The rhubarb with strawberries and beignets is straightforward, but the thick mascarpone with the beet dessert is too heavy to round out the meal. I had a good time, but I'm not sure if we'll be back or not.
