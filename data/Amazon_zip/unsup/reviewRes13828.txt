After taking in a matinee show, we headed to 90 Miles Cuban Cafe to sit in the sun (well, the shade but outside nonetheless) and order some good Cuban sandwiches. I ordered the veggie sandwich and a guava/cheese empanada. I thought both were excellent. The sandwich was busting full of yummy veggies. I could only eat one half and even that was a struggle. I highly recommend that those with smaller tummies, try to find someone to split an order. I also splurged with the guava/cheese empanada, which was equally as awesome. Each bite had the right combination of flavor and texture. I was glad to have something with a different flavor profile to accompany the veggie sandwich. The service was great. I went to grab a water bottle from the cooler but was quickly informed by the staff that they had tap water readily available outside. Unfortunately they were out of ice and in the hot sun, the water turned quickly warm.  The outdoor seating isn't anything spectacular but was sort of perfect at the same time. One of the best parts about it was that it was off to the side, not really near the entrance. This eliminated patrons from walking through to place their orders and left those of us seated peacefully off to the side. It's the little things, ya know.
