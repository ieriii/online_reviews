Haven't eaten here in a while so my fiance, being the awesome lady that she is, waited in line to pick up Doug's to go for my birthday. The "small" order of cheese fries is probably bigger than a large order at most of your other hot dog joints. They were delicious and generously slathered in cheese. I also ordered the celeb sausage of the day (Mole Smoked Chicken Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise and Queso Enchilada) and the Spicy Jamaican Jerk Pork Sausage with Jerk Mayonnaise, Smoked Gouda Cheese and Roasted Plantains. The Mole Chicken sausage was very good, but the true standout was the Jamaican Jerk Sausage. The sweetness from the plantains blended perfectly with the spice in the sausage and the slight smoky richness of the gouda.  Any questions about Doug retaining the title of Sausage King of Chicago can be put to rest. Sorry Abe Froman...
