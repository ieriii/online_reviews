The Publican is one of my favourite places into the entire city. I am a repeat customer and have had the fortunate experience to get to know many of the staff. For truly impeccable service, ask for Max or Seth as your gastronomic guide for the evening. Aside from the quality of the food, the beer list is one to be rivaled. If you are one to want to sit at a bar and wait for a table if you don't have a reservation, this place is not for you. The bar tables in the waiting area are high tops and are for standing only. Can't decide on a beer for the extended list? There is a beer expert on staff and will help you decide on particular potent potables that fit exactly what you are looking for. Specific food items to order: the mussels (plump, and in a light, slightly zesty broth, they rival those of the Hopleaf), the sardines (especially when prepared with grape leaves and yogurt), any of the crudo that they are rotating (slightly citrusy and olive oily), hams, charcuterie plate (the head cheese has come a LOOOOOONG way from that of which my grandparents used to gross me out with), pork belly (most tender in the city), sweetbreads (delightfully crispy and light) and the country ribs (salty and sweet at the same time). For dessert, get the waffle, it's light, slightly crispy and not too sweet. p.s... for all the ladies, be sure to check out Nick, the hottie host who is a dead ringer for Adrian Grenier.
