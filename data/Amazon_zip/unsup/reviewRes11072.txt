Coming here on a Saturday at 1pm proved to test my patience. At an hour wait, I was expecting something existential by the time I got to my seat. The restaurant is rather large and has large group booth seating in the back. There are only two bathrooms in the back. Be forewarn if you have been whiling around the neighborhood for that past hour and need to go because there will definitely be a line of girls awkwardly waiting in the kitchen's hallway. On the back page of the menu, there are $13-$15 Chef specials that include some duck breast benedict and other slightly simpler fare like egg benedict, but kicked up a notch with some raw spinach. Personally, two eggs (in any style) on an english muffin should never be more than $10. What is up with this weird better-than-thou pricing? I got a breakfast burrito that was stuffed with essentially a four-egg omelette and diced half of an avocado. A slice of cheese was slightly melted on top of the burrito casing. Overall, just the salsa that was served on the side was yummy. It was just lacking. It needed some herbs. Then, my husband and friend both got hot apple ciders that they serve in a tall glass and a straw. Don't they know how hot the liquid is and how impossible it is to hold the glass without burning yourself? I actually burnt my tongue because my hubby asked me to try it. And without knowing that it was hot, I sipped from the straw... and well you figure it out. Hot drinks never get straws. They get handles on a mug. From the long lines and one hour wait, this place seems overrated.
