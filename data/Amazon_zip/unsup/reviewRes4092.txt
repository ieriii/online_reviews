Where is the sixth star!?! this place needs it !!! I would have to agree with previous review, best meal of my life, no exaggeration. Everything about it was amazing ! Yes, booking is tough but get over it, its worth it and part of the fun. We were shopping in Wicker Park earlier in the day and when a clerk asked us what we were doing for dinner I said Schwa and she chirped "You got in!?" LOL. Best time to call is Saturday late aft, they are on the phone confirming other reservations so someone might pick up. Each course was unreal, my favourite was the Smores. For a tasting menu portions were generous, my girlfriend was full after the fourth course ( uh-oh but more for me :) She prevailed and we both waddled out of there full. Staff is great, not super friendly but no attitude either, they slowly warm up over the course of the night.  Definitely hitting it again when I am in Chicago.
