The first time I visited this place, I loved the food, and the service was good. So, for my birthday, my partner and I decided to get together with several friends of ours there. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. Our waitress mixed up our orders, and the manager-looking-guy came out and yelled at us that the mistakes were made because we did not tell our waitress our orders in the right way (e.g., from left to right). This guy even insulted one of my friends who was trying to explain what happened in a reasonable manner. He basically told her to shut up. We were all shocked how horrible we were treated. There is no way we will ever go back to the restaurant.
