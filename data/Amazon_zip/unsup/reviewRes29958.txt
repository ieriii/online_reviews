I used to come here quite regularly when they were open til 3 or 4AM. But, it seems after the smoking ban they didn't get as much late night foot traffic and thus modified their hours. Oh, well. I still try to stop by whenever I'm in the neighborhood. This place is a cool place to hang out at any time of day -- for breakfast, for a coffee, for a late night glass of wine. The food is pretty good. It's nothing AMAZING, but it's decent for a cafe. Chill atmosphere, dim lighting. I recommend this place for just hanging out with a couple friends or if you have to study or read.
