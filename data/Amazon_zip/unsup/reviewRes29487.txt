Meat Free since the 80's and they still haven't gotten it right. Yes, I speak blasphemy. Yet, I went here expecting AMAZING vegan food. What I received was a poorly orchestrated meal with OK service and an entree that lacked A. Nutritional Value and B. Variety/Creativity/Spice.  I ordered the Buffalo Salad @ 10.99 which is essentially Vegan ranch dressing, a spring lettuce mix, and burned (overcooked) tofu smothered in BBQ/Buffalo sauce.  Normally, when I order salad at a vegan restaurant, specifically an entree salad, I expect to have not only lettuce, but also a mix of carrots, beets, onions, fennel, seeds or other legumes. Vegans really should know about the importance of vegetables more than ANYONE else, yet, I am mistaken. My mom ordered the Black Bean Burger and needless to say, she was unimpressed. I also ordered a side of Macaroni and Cheese which (AT BEST) tasted like a Vegan version of the 99 cents Kraft Mac N Cheese found at nearly every supermarket/convenience store. This place simply serves up Vegan junk food (and it is not even very tasty). I highly suggest patronizing other Vegan restaurants that are capable of providing more nutritious or even tastier vegan junk food. HOWEVER... The Chicago Diner is responsible for serving up some of THE BEST vegan cake, I have ever had. I shouldn't be surprised, cake is the epitome of junk food BUT they do it best. And the best part of all, I don't have to drive from River East to Belmont for a slice, they also serve it at Whole Foods South Loop for a similar price.
