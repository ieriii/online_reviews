I've been to this place a few times. Once for lunch buffet and twice for dinner. At night there was quite a long wait time however lunch buffet on a friday was easy to get a seat. The food was generally good. Not my favorite place for indian food in the city but conveniently located to other fun things downtown unlike devan street. I would definitely go back.
