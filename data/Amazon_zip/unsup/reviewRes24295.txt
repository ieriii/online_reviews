We visited Geja's for our anniversary. I decided to check it out since everyone raves about how romantic it is. For the most part I found that romantic meant that it was dimly lit and had a guy playing the guitar...but I definitely love the cozy ambiance of the place. The narrow walkway to the bathroom kind of made me feel like I was in someones house in Greece or Italy. If you are indeed going to be romantic, be sure to ask for one of the private booths. They are kind of secluded so it really gives you that special touch. We ended up at a regular table and I kind of felt cheated. On to the food...the cheeses that we had with the first course were absolutely wonderful. When choosing which meats to get, I would suggest sticking with the seafood if you are anything like me. We chose the option that had chicken, seafood and beef but we are so anti-salmonella that we stressed the whole time over whether or not the meat was actually done! Not romantic at all! The accompanying veggies were a great touch and the various dipping sauces really completed the meal. The dessert platter has something for every sweet lover...they even allow you to roast marshmallows which was an epic fail for my husband and I. The service is impeccable and they even take the time to ensure that you are well educated on cooking your vittles. Overall, we had a really enjoyable time. I cant say that we will be returning again though. Its just one of those places where you go for the experience just to say I came, I saw, I conquered aka been there, done that.
