La Pasadita has by far the best steak burrito's in town. i actually travel to come to this place when burrito places are a dime a dozen and on every street corner. If you are REAL hungry as I normally am, order the Super Burrito. The servers are very nice, but often times "too busy" and forget things or don't check up on you after serving your dish. but hey, its a fast food burrito joint, no Chez Paul.
