So metal. Great burgers, great beer selection and an ample amount of flatscreens showing concerts from some of your favorite bands. I'm assuming you like metal. Waitresses are attentive and there are great specials on Tuesday (1/2 price burgers) & Thursday (1/2 price drafts). Get there early on Tuesday or you'll be waiting for a while to get a seat. Only con that comes to mind is at times the music is a bit loud so hearing an intellectual conversation on post bourgeois society can be trying.
