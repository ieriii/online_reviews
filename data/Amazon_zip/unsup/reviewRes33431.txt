We went here because my mom got a gift certificate. And I'm so happy that she did! The food was AMAZING. Everything tasted so fresh, like they just go out the back and pick the ingredients from their own garden. It was a party in my mouth! And it didn't take long for the food to arrive at our table, either. I would definitely go here again and would definitely recommend it to others. My only complaint was that the atmosphere was a bit lacking. The music was a bit odd for this kind of restaurant. They had some kind of classic rock soundtrack going, with AC/DC and Kiss. And the tables were pretty close together. But I don't care about that as much as I care about the food!
