One of the greatest sausage emporiums in Chi-City! Even though the sausages are not made at store-level, I give Doug Sohn major props for complimenting the flavors well with his condiments! My not much of an adventurer eater when it comes to meat, but my fiance is. He will try any and all game sausages! The lines are always ridiculously long, but totally worth the wait! If you're going on a Saturday, get there 30-45 minutes prior to when you're planning on eating.
