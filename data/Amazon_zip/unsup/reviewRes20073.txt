Fantastic.  Bayless is 3 for 3, I love Topolobompo, Frontera Grill and now Xoco. I've now had lunch there and breakfast there, and they were both fantastic. Great food, and sauces as I would have expected. Also a good selection of beers, and a full espresso bar.  Just fantastic, you just have to time it right so the lines aren't too bad. I recommend going very early on a Saturday for breakfast, or having a later lunch, otherwise you're in for a long wait, but it's worth it.
