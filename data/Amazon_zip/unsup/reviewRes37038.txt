Yeah, thumbs WAY down for this place. It's sad to see how far Fox & Obel has deteriorated over the past year... certainly no surprise why they are fighting to stay in business. I remembered this place as being really delicious high end prepared foods and gourmet items. It is still trying to cater to that market, but it fails on many fronts: - Price: everything here is at least 2x the price of the next closest high end grocery store (for the love of god - i went to Whole Foods afterwards and thought it was a bargain!) - Quality: I was appalled at the terrible quality of their produce. Things were blatantly going bad and still left out for sale. Even the quality of their prepared foods has withered... mayonnaise soaked salads and oil-laden vegetable sides - no thank you. - Variety: while you can find approximately 18 different varieties of capers at Fox & Obel, don't ask for basic fresh herbs and spices. I went in with a list of like 10 basic items that I needed to get, and I think they had 4 of them. I bought a couple of those Groupons, thinking it would be easy to blow $100 here... turns out I'm going to have a cupboard full of gourmet marinades, since that's about all you can buy here these days!
