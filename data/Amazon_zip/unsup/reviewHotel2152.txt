The best characteristic about this hotel is it's location. It also has beautiful classic architecture, and the hotel lobby is lovely. It's funny... I can always distinguish Kimpton hotels from the decor. Very eclectic and modern, but still has that institutional feel to it. I think it's a good value for the money, and wold recommend it to visiting friends and tourists.  The bathroom was pretty decent in size... I'm all about nice bathrooms!
