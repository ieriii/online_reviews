I think this was the best meal we had on our trip. XOCO was definitely a wonderful experience. There was a 25 minute wait when we arrived around 11:30am, but it was more than worth it. We were seated outside; luckily, the weather wasn't too hot/humid yet. Now onto the star of the show: the food. Cubana- My favorite torta! It was filled with beans, pork, avocado and chipotle mustard. It was absolutely delicious! The torta was pressed a little so it was easy to eat even though it was jam packed with delicious ingredients. Definitely a winner. Pepito- Short rib beef with beans and jalapenos. I did not like this sandwich as much. Something about the short rib beef that I didn't like--maybe it was the caramelized onions. I don't usually like to mix sweet with salty. Aztec hot chocolate- Very rich with a kick of spice. It is not your mother's hot chocolate. If you get this one, don't expect something sweet- expect something made from bittersweet chocolate and an aftertaste of cayenne. Churro- THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL. I was already full from the tortas and hot chocolate, but my stomach instantly expanded for the churros. They were hot out of the fryer and sprinkled with the perfect amount of sugar and cinnamon. The churro was crispy on the outside soft on the inside and 100% delicious. I'm drooling just thinking about it now. I think XOCO was my favorite place on our trip. I will definitely miss it. Rick Bayless, open one in San Francisco!
