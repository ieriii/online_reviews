SO SO GOOD! What is there to say that hasn't been said already. I have the fois gras dog which was indescribably tasty. I heard a couple behind me complaining about price and yes $9 bucks for a hotdog may seem a little hefty, but its not in this case.Don't let your self being fooled into thinking all dogs are created equal, the encased creations are beautiful gourmet meals served in a convenient bun. Also if you want to go more traditional they do have a Chicago Dog for less than $2 bucks which is also mighty tasty.
