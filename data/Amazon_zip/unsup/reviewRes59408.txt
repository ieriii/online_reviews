My wife and I are big Chicago deep-dish fans. Our current favorite is Gino'a East, but we typically try a new deep-dish place each time we're in Chicago. This time it was Giordano's. Overall, we were not impressed. Like Gino's East, Giordano's does not take any reservations. So the wait to get to your table is anywhere from 1 - 2 hours on a weekend night. We waited for 90 minutes. They do allow you to pre-order your pizza, which was a nice feature that allowed the pizza to be served within minutes of our seating. Waiting aside, what we really care about is this pizza. The crust of this pizza has less of a corn flavor than Gino's, which some people prefer. However, the sauce and overall flavor of Giordano's was disappointing. The sauce tasted like something out of a can. We ordered a pepporoni and sausage pizza, and we had 2 slices that had almost no sausage on them. The service was lax at best, with our waiter checking in about once every 20 minutes or so. The provide a bottle of water on the table, but this seems to be a reason for them to not check back in for any other beverages. Summary, if we're going to put in this kind of wait-time for food, it better be a special experience. Giordano's did not deliver.
