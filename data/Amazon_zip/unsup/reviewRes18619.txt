I was very sad to see Feed the Beast close because I really liked going there. The restaurant sat closed for months until one day, the Bad Apple took its place.  I'm down for burger joints as I'm a huge fan of red meat. Their burgers are great and cooked properly (read: nice and bloody per my request). What is even more delightful, surprisingly, are their french fries. I like fries just fine, but am not a fry junkie. I am a fry junkie when I go to the Bad Apple. You can get the fries seasoned with any of the following: garlic, Creole, Old Bay, curry or....get this....truffle. Truffle? Yes, truffle. I don't even understand how they season fries with truffle, but they do and you'll want about ten orders of them.  Beer. If you're a beer fan, you'll be a fan of their very extensive beer.  The price is right for this place and you'll come back repeatedly. Enjoy.
