Best meal of my life. Period. Yes, it's a total bitch to get reservations here. If you were putting out food this good, you'd have a pretty hard time accommodating all the requests coming your way too. Sure, the chefs serving you are rushing around like mad men, but the service never suffers for it. They're so laid back and cool (Atmosphere playing as I walk in? Hells yes!), and when will you ever get a chance to hear a dish explained by the dude that just made it? That's what I thought. All of those other things just shouldn't even matter after you're done with your meal. It's the most intelligent, well thought-out menu I've ever seen. From the Henricks gin to the sweetbreads coated with some yummy caramel-ey crunchy shell served with popcorn to the Chimay beer cheese soup, every single dish seriously took my tastebuds to a whole new level. And that quail egg ravioli? Shut your face. It is so worth the pain and the wait to eat here.
