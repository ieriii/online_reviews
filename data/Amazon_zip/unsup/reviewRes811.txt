.., sometimes the best way to get to know an animal, is to put it in your mouth. I get slightly envious, but fall more in love with a city that has a personality only Chicago can provide. Hot Doug's is an experience all it's own. The menu itself is a tasty educational treat that'll leave you wanting more. Many thanks to Misha Media for treating me while we were in town!!! We got here right at lunch & the line wasn't too far down the sidewalk, but there was indeed a line. No worries though, it does move on along. All the more time to salivate & build an appetite. Unless you know what you already want, Doug's menu will keep you undecided for everything sounds good. The prices are ridiculously reasonable so I suggest to try more than 1 dog. CASH ONLY!!! Just a heads up so you don't wait in line for nothing. I went along & got one of their specials which was a Cognac & Bacon Pheasant sausage w/ Chevre Cream, Wild Boar pate & Truffle Balsamic drizzle. Accompanied with an order of cheese fries & a corndog. WOW, what a dog! The flavor in that sausage was excellent, great combo of all things tasty, that Truffle Balsamic drizzle was like liquid crack. The Wild Boar Pate was diced up & sprinkled on top, I thought it was cheese at first because they have the same consistency, but you can pick up a hint of that boar. The cheese fries were heavenly, had that ooey gooey cheese that I love & the corndog was great as well. Had outdoor seating feeling the windy city doing it's thing. Added more to the experience. Hot Doug rang us up himself as well, we'll definately come back. Great food & good times, check it out!
