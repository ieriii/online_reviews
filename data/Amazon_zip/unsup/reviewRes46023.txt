It's like the Cheesecake Factory but not. (shorter menu with less emphasis on cheesecake). The food is still great. Our waitress was awesome, despite having been there for more than 13 hours! However, they have this insane 2-pronged seating process that makes the whole thing more complicated than needed. First you wait for an hour in a crowded stuffy vestibule. Then your pager flashes and you give it to the hostess. then you wait another 15 minutes at the bottom of the escalators where you hope that no one trips or else there will be a pile up. After a while, someone else, not a hostess, seat you. Kind of silly really.
