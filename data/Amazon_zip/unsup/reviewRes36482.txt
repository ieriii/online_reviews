This is one of my favorite places to go with my husband ... I love sushi and curries. However my husband does not enjoy sushi. -sigh- You can get a big variety of yummy rolls for good prices. And the thai food is good as well. Ask about any specials because last time we were there John got one of the best Thai curry dishes I've ever tasted. Service is okay. Nice but nothing outstanding. Call for a reservation just to be safe.
