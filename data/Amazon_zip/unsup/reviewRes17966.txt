Finally got a chance to go to this place. With not many great Italian options in the Lincoln Square area, this one is truly an oasis in Ravenswood (and its BYOB!). Food is fantastic but a bit pricey; however there is a ton of it per serving. Only complaint is the awful bathrooms. And now they have TWO high chairs so they are becoming more family friendly than previously thought; just go on a weeknight with the kids instead of a weekend.
