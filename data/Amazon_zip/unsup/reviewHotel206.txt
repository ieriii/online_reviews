This hotel is in the perfect location--next to the John Hancock building and one block from Michigan Avenue. We booked this hotel through http://Priceline.com and got a fantastic deal for a weekend in June! We arrived during a torrential downpour and the valet and doormen were right there to assist us with our bags. We arrived a couple of hours before check-in and were told our room wasn't ready (we were sopping wet and had to hurry to make it to the Cubs game), but the couple behind us got into their room. We didn't think too much of the front desk staff, not the friendliest. The doormen and valets were excellent, however! We were very surprised at our room! We loved that it was a suite with a frig and microwave. It had a TV in the living room and bedroom. We had a great view on the 24th floor, too. For an even better view, go up to the pool on the 30th floor. You can see for miles and miles up there! My husband loved the Precor ellipticals in the fitness room. No free breakfast and even a Nutrigrain breakfast bar cost $2! We didn't go to the restaurant or bar, so I can't comment on that.  I would highly recommend this hotel, and we have stayed at quite a few downtown hotels!
