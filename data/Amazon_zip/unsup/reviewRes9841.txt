Absolutely fantastic. Not ONE complaint! A very memorable meal. To begin, our waiter Alberto was very attentive and knowledgeable. He gave us excellent suggestions. The patio is as outstanding as people say. The food came out at the perfect pace. I feel sometimes with small plates, you get served too fast, but this was just right. Now the nitty gritty... The bead basket- mmmmmm. The olive oil is a bit sweet and the aged balsamic is honestly so good for such a basic Caprese Salad- standard, but the mozzarella was especially fresh Beef Carpaccio- first time having the dish, so I can't compare to others. It was tasy. I enjoyed the mustard sauce. Black Truffle Ravioli- This was a special and was fantastic. My mouth waters thinking about it. Alberto recommend this. It sounded heavy, but was not at all. We got an appetizer portion. Wish we got the full. Black Spagetti- unreal red sauce...very interesting pasta, abundant seafood Sea Bass- cooked perfectly. brought out the entire fish before de-boning it. Brocolini- very small portion; nothing special Cheesecake- very different than the average cheesscake. crumbly crust. Hazelnut- heaven. no words I can't wait to come back to try more on the menu!
