Many dishes were had on my recent trip here. I definitely ordered more then my stomach could handle. The best thing I ordered: Goat Cheese Grits. Om nom nom. Creamy goat cheese swirled in with hot grits. Tip: It's hiding as a side dish on their brunch menu. Just order it. I also ordered the House Poutine: elk ragout, curd cheese, & gravy over fries. It was a super rich concoction, maybe a bit too rich for me. It was good but I probably wouldn't order it again. By the time my "The Gage" burger came out, my stomach was already at 80% capacity. Argh, thanks a lot poutine and delicious grits. The burger was beefy goodness and the melted onion marmalade/local camembert cheese toppings were delicious. To top it all off, a freshly baked roll holding it all together. I think this is the first time I couldn't finish a burger, but I'm glad I didn't. It made for an awesome meal the next day. The service was great, with a friendly server and drinks promptly refilled. Our table on the other hand was a bit small and a fork or spoon went over board a couple times. Haha, our neighbors were having the same issue. There's also a nice bar area with dogfish beer on tap. Me likey.  I'll be back for sure, for the goat cheese grits and maybe some brunch.
