Haha, after reading a few of the reviews, I have to say to the person requesting the pizza not to be cut into square (yes, they're squares, not puzzle pieces)...does it really matter *that much* how it's cut? ;) Anyhow...I've been ordering from this place for years now and they always have great service, and while the pizza may not be anything special, I've found it's best if you actually order the ingredients on top of the cheese (it really does make a difference, and I usually don't mind under-the-cheese style!). The dining experience isn't very exciting, the decor makes you feel like you're out with Grandma or something, but it's still a great little neighborhood place to stop in and have a hot meal...or to order in if you're trying to stay out of the below zero temps! Prices are decent. Delivery is fast, friendly and reliable. If you're dining in, it's generally nice and quiet, and they do have a parking lot. Overall, I'm a fan! :)
