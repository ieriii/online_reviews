dont get me wrong the dog is good, just OVERPRICED!!! its a cool little drive in, you drive up to one of the speaker menus wait... they take your order cool, so i look at the menu and see the prices i felt like driving right back out!!! yes the hotdog is good, but i dont think spending 20 bucks on 3 hotdogs,3 fries and 2 drinks, is right. im usually able to get that under 10 bucks at my usual hotdog joints. the fries are ok, the dogs are better then good, but the prices are a little to much. one visit is enough for me...
