This place has great food, everybody knows that. What a lot of people may not know is how good their brunch is as well! I rarely get impressed by buffet brunches, but I gotta give this brunch some props For $45 a head, this pricing is well justified. There are basically five main areas - the bloody mary / bar area, the fresh cold seafood bar, the omelet and waffle station, the grand buffet & carvery area, and the sweets table - all of them outstanding. There are lots to choose from, sure, but you can't equate quantity with quality, and this place definitely understands the importance of quality. Everything here is top notch. The cold seafood bar has a wide selection of fresh cocktail tiger shrimps, crab legs, raw oysters, sushi / rolls, seafood salad & ceviche. Moving onto the omelet & waffle station - this place has one of the best waffle I've ever had. It was cooked with just the right amount of batter & heat. A short break later, we started tackling the grand buffet & carvery area. Lobster bisque is a great starter, then chase it with some roasted beef tenderloin, corned beef hash with a sunny side egg on top, crab cakes, and carmelized bacon. The broccoli was actually pretty darn good as well because they cooked it with an alfredo sauce and lobster. If you still have room at this point, you gotta hit up the sweets table...and by table I mean a whole separate private room full of 25+ kinds of desserts. It's like a mini Willy Wonka sweets factory. Come here hungry, but also come here not dressed like a slob. The Schaumburg location may be more casual, but the downtown crowd looks a bit more dressy, even on a Sunday. I wouldn't recommend bringing loud, obnoxious kids to this place as you'll certainly get lots of looks from others.
