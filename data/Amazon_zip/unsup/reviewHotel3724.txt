Where to begin. After reading some reviews we actually wanted to stay on the highest floor (under the club) so that we can be loud or at least listen to some music on the ipod dock the hotel PROVIDES. So one minute into a song we get a knock on the door about it being loud. It was 9pm. So we decide to go party upstairs and realized we have to go down to the lobby to take a separate elevator to go to the club. Thats fine but at least tell us instead of us trying to figure out if the elevator is broken or instead of trying the stairs etc it was so stupid for a while. Club was very cool though and staff excellent. We tried the tequila from Entourage. Not my fave but shots were free. Also we went to the restaurant Argent and had an awesome chat with the waitress who gave us great tourist advice. They took the term cake in crab cake a little too literally, I felt I was eating a birthday cake. The sushi was very good. We were happy the hotel/resto/club carry sugar free redbull and they even have discrete redbull art written on the elevator doors. The room was very nice. Sadly we didnt get any of the two upgrades we had requested a month earlier but the room was ok. The rainfall shower is AMAZING. Probably my fave part. Keep in mind the only ice machine is on the 5th floor. A maid told us they have free ice delivery but to request it in the morning. We didnt know this until check out. What a downer. All in all, staff were great, valet guys are awesome and helpful. The rest is nowhere near deserving any luxurious term. We will stick to our usual Conrad or Hard Rock Hotel.
