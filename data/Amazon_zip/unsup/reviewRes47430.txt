In recent months, I've become a regular here, primarily for the burgers. Tonight I went with a friend who I convinced to try something new, and was very surprised. We started out splitting a Mac n Cheese as an appetizer, and it was some of the best I've ever had! I decided to switch from my usual burger and try the Godfather meatball sandwich, and it rocked my world! Three big meatballs on a long pretzel hoagie bun, with a wonderful sauce and melted cheese on top. The meatballs had a little spice to them, which was a very pleasant surprise. Overall an excellent meal. I would definitely recommend everyone try this place!
