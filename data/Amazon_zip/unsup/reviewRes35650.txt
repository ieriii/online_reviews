There are very few addictions in this world I would ever be openly admitted to. Sun Wah's Roast Duck is definitely something that I am not ashamed to expose! There is something so magical and scrumptious about well seasoned, perfectly roasted poultry! Sun Wah consistently does that well. The Supper Club I recently founded voted and decided that of all the places in Chicago to kick off our inaugural dinner - Sun Wah was the place to do it and here's why: 1) They have the space for a large party - especially if your head count changes last minute. Their new space is awesome! They started out in a Honda Civic and upgraded to a Hummer Limo! Even though the space is way bigger, it still gets packed! To me, this is a good sign as it indicates a high turn over of food. 2) Food items are consistently good - everything from the BBQ items hanging in the window to the obscure seasonal Stir Fried Snow Pea Greens, to the steamed Black Bean & Garlic Chilean Sea Bass. 3) Prices are totally reasonable for the quality and the amount of food you're getting (in this recession era we're in, they are not skimping out unlike some others!) Now, I have heard and read about the service. It can be spotty and unpredictable, but never terrible! If I recall, this place is family owned and operated. The person slicing my Peking Duck is either a family member or someone with the restaurant for a long enough time to be considered family. The place is BIG, so there is a LOT of ground to cover, and even the 19 kids and Counting family can't cover it all with perfection! If you're ordering a bowl of $5.00 noodles and expect perfection in service, you should consider staying home and cooking yourself - just sayin'.
