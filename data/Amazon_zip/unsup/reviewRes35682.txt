They seem to have deteriorated considerably in quality of service. On the weekend evenings they are extremely busy and will run out of duck. I don't know how it happens, but I guess counting duck is impossible, since they take your order of beijing/peking duck and 20 min later inform you that they are out of duck. It would have been a lot better if they kept track of inventory and told us before we order it and wait 20 min. I know they're crazy busy, but that's just bad management, how do you not realize that you are out of your most popular food item until 20 min after someone orders it??? Their waitstaff doesn't seem to be communicating with each other since I tried ordering something else with our waitress and she said yes they have it, are you sure? yes. And then another waitress comes to our table, sorry we're out of it. Who do I believe? Seriously either slow down your table turnovers and manage the restaurant better. This is not the SunWahBBq of old that I used to love so much. Their fame and popularity have given them excuse to slack off.
