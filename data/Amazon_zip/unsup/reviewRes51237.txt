This place is great. I've been there twice - once for breakfast and once for dinner. Big menu with lots of good options for vegetarians or fish eaters. Everything was really good - food, service and atmosphere. I loved my omlette with cheese grits and biscuit. I had a fish entree for dinner that was excellent and came with really good sides. The service was good and quick.
