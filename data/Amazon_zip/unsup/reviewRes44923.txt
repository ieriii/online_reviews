So with much hype, I ventured here for their deep dish. The menu said a small 10" serves 1-2 people. Well, that's an understatement. It's good for 3-4 people of avg size. The pizza was really cheesy but the dough was just blah. I was expecting more pizzaz from all the hype on their deep dish. I just felt like I was getting a mouthful of dough towards the crust. It just didn't live up the the rumors for the price I paid. You do get a lot for your money but...its a lot of boring food. If that's what you're after, this is the right place for you.
