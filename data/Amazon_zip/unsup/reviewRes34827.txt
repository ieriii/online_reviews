Oh my! They are not messing around with those mega rolls. I have been wanting to try Sushi X for a while now. They deliver but there is a $3 charge so I got off my lazy butt and picked it up. First thing I noticed was the heaviness of the bag. I just thought they put in a lot of soy sauce. When I got home I discovered that the mega roll consisted of 10 huge pieces filled with large chunks of sushi! I was sold. Flavor, quality, and quantity were good for the price. I recommend the double stack. Next time I will go and dine in especially since it is BYOB.
