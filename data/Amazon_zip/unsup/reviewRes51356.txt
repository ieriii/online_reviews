So there has been lots of hype over the years from my friends and also fellow Yelpers on the awesomeness of Garcia's. After a night of hard drinking at Garcia's, we decided to grab a late night bite and run over to Garcia's which has a full bar on one side and serves cocktails. Coming into Garcia's at Friday 1:30am was not too bad, except that the tables were a little bit too close to each other. Our party of five sat at a table, but then we were asked to move after our water and chips were delivered because another group of thirteen came through. You would imagine they would just try to seat them elsewhere since we had gotten there first! I ordered some flautas, quesadillas and a mango margarita. On the liquor side, I'd say that I was buzzed from Daily Bar & Grill, but Garcia's got me to the right side of drunk. The margarita is strong and I smelled of it after I finished it. My friend ordered a beer and was doing his thing too. Where Garcia's kind of doesn't quite do it for me is in the food. My friend ordered a chicken burrito and hell it was giant as hell with a lot of sauce over it, served wet. He was able to take down about half of it. My flautas came with tons of sour cream and guac, but they only served flautas with chicken. All in all not a bad flauta (it's really hard to mess that dish up), but the quesadillas were not very good. They are made with corn tortillas and were extremely greasy. All ten of my fingers were soaked from the orange drip of Mexican eats, but I couldn't say it was all too delicious. Mad props for late night action, selling good cocktails, but please work on improving the food and seating room.
