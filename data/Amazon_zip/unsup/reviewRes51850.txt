I have been going to Geno's for several years. The food has always been very good but the service has been spotty. Friday afternoon this week my party and I walked out. After being "handled" by a very rude host we were finally seated. Then 5-6 minutes went by with no acknowledgement fro any of the many staff people who walked by our table we gave up and left. A place like this, I assume, will continue to be busy because of their reputation, and I'm sure they won't miss my business, but I will not be back.
