My husband and I regularly attended Glenn's Diner on Montrose Ave. Not anymore. Not because of the food but because of the way we were treated. We had never been to crab night so we decided to go with a friend of ours. First we were not told on Crab night you cannot BYOB. OK, so order a bottle of wine and we get a glass. When we told the waitress we wanted a bottle she got the bottle but no more glasses. My friend and I ordered the crab special and my husband ordered fish because he cannot eat crab. When we all got our meals it looked good and my husband said I love coleslaw, can I have a bite Well of course, right, NOPE. The Crab Police were on patrol and we were told, very rudely, that no sharing was allow of anything. I get it, its all you can eat crab you don't want to lose money, but to come up to us with an attitude after one bite of coleslaw and be rude, NO Way. When my Husband expressed his disapproval to the way we were treated, the Crab Police(owner/manager) came back and asked if we had a problem with his restaurant. We never did, but now we do. Later he apologized, but I think that was a little too late.I enjoy Glenn's food but I do not want to pay that kind of money to have bad service and be bullied.
