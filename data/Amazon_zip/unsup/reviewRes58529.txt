One reviewer already called it italian tapas - portions not as small, but still need to order at least three. Crispy Pork Belly - was worth driving all the way from Delaware - two thin long pieces of pork with fat - crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside.Truffle egg toast - whole egg (almost poached) in the piece of bread. Didn't really taste any truffle, but still good. Our waiter was very nice. There are high top tables on one side and regular tables on the other side.
