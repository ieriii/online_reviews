My wife and I took dinner with an out of town guest and his pad thai had a really bad taste/odor and upon investigation involving both of the owners it turned out they had used an unclean pan. Instead of saying sorry the owner came by initially after I brought to the attention our waiter and told me "A lot of people order the pad thai and they have never complained". We were reprimanded in front of our guest, which was weird. I used to like this place but the behavior of the owner during that visit was very rude & ignorant and brought obvious the issues with the management of this place. She did not know how to handle a simple situation. I suggest if you do have an incident here do not deal with owner Guen she is very prissy defensive not ideal for dealing with customer service issues but instead ask to talk to the other co-owner who is the cook in the back she will actually listen to what you have to say as she is the one who found out the reason for the taste difference is they used the wrong pan to cook the noodle. The staff always seems overworked and comes across tired, hurried and very unhappy. Do not risk potentially ruining a night out and spend your money at any of the other nearby edgewater restaurants.
