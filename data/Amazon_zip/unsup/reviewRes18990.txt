Ok, they get bumped to 4 starts. Went there again in the evening and had another good experience. The fried cheese curds are worth the extra star. Seriously, you have to try these things. They melt in your mouth and the only way I can describe them is "heavenly." Had another excellent burger too (The Pat La Frieda). My only complaint is they still seem to have some temperature control issues. My fries could have been a little warmer and my beer a little colder. Otherwise this will be one of my regular haunts. Keep up the good work guys!
