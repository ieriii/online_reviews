A few months ago, I might have given four or five stars, but I've been pretty disappointed with Pequod's lately. I'm more of a fan of the thin crust pizzas here, although the "carmelized" cheese (aka burnt) on the deep-dish is interesting. That said, my two most recent orders were for a simple thin-crust sausage pizza. I used to be obsessed with the sausage they used because it was big hunks of REAL fennel-loaded Italian sausage, rather than those little round pellets of kibble that pass for sausage at the bulk of pizza places. But my last two pizzas just don't taste the same as the pizza I once loved. I thought my last order in which the sausage and spices on the pizza tasted a little off was a fluke, so I gave it another try. I'm not sure if they've switched sausage or altered the spices in the sauce or what, but it just isn't as good as it used to be. Also, I opened the box to find the cheese so runny that half of the ingredients of the pizza had slid to one side, which is annoying to say the least. I figure I've been a good enough customer and they've been reliable in the past so I plan to give them one more shot, although I'll stay away from the sausage. If my next pizza has the same iffy flavor as my past two, I'm thinking a decrease in stars might be in order. Caveat: When you order over the phone and pay with a credit card, they tend to write your entire card number, security code and ZIP code on the yellow carbon receipt stapled to the bag or box, so you might want to be sure to shred that baby before you throw it out.
