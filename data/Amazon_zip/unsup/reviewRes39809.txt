Not like this place needs a nother review! I've never had the sushi or been to the ajoining sushi restaurant, but I've been going to San Soo Gab San before it was hip. Like almost everyone has chimed in about, their service doesn't deserve top praise. And like most people, I go for the fire and the meat. I miss San Soo Gab San because of the delicious sides and salty, sesame oil and bean sauce. I don't dare visit another Korean BBQ restaurant since my move to Portland, because I don't want to be disappointed. San Soo Gab San spoiled me.
