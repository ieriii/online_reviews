I came here last night with a more seasoned greek islands expert than me, didnt know that was possible. We had saganaki, this salad with no lettuce which included Feta, cucumbers, tomatoes and onions. I dont like tomatoes but they were soooo fresh and delicious that I actually ate them. We also had this chicken that was to die for and some fried zucchini, and gyro that was sliced thin and well done which was the best gyro Ive ever had in my life.
