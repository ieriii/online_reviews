Slices! I have been on a pseudo-hunt for the best pizza slice in Chicago, while not an official hunt I have tried many places. Currently this ranks at the top of my list. When you can get fresh slices, it is SO good, so cheesy and the crust is crunchy yet mushy inside. Even the not-so fresh slices are good, but this is definitely not the place where the pizza has been sitting out for hours or days under a heat lamp. They are usually pretty busy at lunch time so the chances are good you'll get a fresh slice.  I go for the thin crust, so I can't speak for their stuffed. I am impressed by their slice selection, last time I was there I counted 12 different kinds, including both thin and stuffed crust.  There is parking out front which is nice as well. Usually if I'm mildly hungry and in the neighborhood, I make this my go-to spot. Delicious!
