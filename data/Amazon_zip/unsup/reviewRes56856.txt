For some reason I can't get enough of this place. While the food is good, the aesthetic is better. DEFINITELY sit upstairs-- you're missing out if you don't. Downstairs is certainly pretty, but a bit formal, and upstairs offers a a small patio and an incredibly comfortable lounge area. The only thing to be wary of is that due to the size and relative intimacy of the place, one obnoxious person can (and likely will) ruin the evening for anyone trying to have good conversation in the restaurant....
