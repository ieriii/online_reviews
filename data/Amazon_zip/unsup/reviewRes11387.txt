I like this place a lot. It's one of those places you always take people to who are from out of town. They brew their own beer, which is alright and have excellent pizza. For some reason it always tastes better when you eat there versus ordering out. Maybe it's the great atmosphere, not sure. It's a Wicker Park staple.
