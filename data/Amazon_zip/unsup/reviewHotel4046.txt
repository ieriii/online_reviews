Oh dear. As many a teacher has written in a pupil's exercise book(s), "Could do better". This is a large property that finds its Front Desk and other services becoming overloaded all too easily - a housekeeping issue took over a day to resolve. And there is a design "issue" with the West Tower - there are either an insufficient number of elevators, or they run much too slowly ... 10 minute waits are simply not acceptable! My recommendation : look for something else .... !
