Be prepared for a long wait (it took 45 minutes for me to get a table at lunch Friday, and I was a party of one!). The pizzas take about 45 minutes to cook anyway, so they encourage you to pre-order when you give your hostess your name; that way the food will be ready soon after you're seated.  Their stuffed spinach and cheese pizza was tasty. The crust was light and buttery, the cheese was oh-so-gooey, the tomato sauce was rich and sharp, and the spinach was, well, chopped spinach. :) I've found that in other restaurants, deep-dish pizzas are too big for one person. But Giordano's lunch menu has an individual stuffed pizza perfectly sized for one.  Yay.
