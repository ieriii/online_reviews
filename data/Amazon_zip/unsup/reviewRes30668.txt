The best place ever. The sauces were fantastic. Filipino-Asian Fusion-fine dining orgasm. My mother, who normally eats something close to a modified vegan diet, ate all of her giant braised pork rib. I nearly died of happiness with my pork belly. They made this amazing string bean "appetizer" (it's still the size of a regular plate)--this is the first time ever that my mind has had to fully engage and focus on my food in order to comprehend the deliciousness. Something close to a perfect restaurants--the food was beyond fantastic (there are truly no words for my praise), and the portions were massive, unlike a lot of upscale places that serve bite-sized portions. I was stuffed by the end. One caveat is that it is the price; while the price is great for the amount and quality of the food, it's still not wildly affordable. I came here for my graduation dinner with my friend and our families, so it was definitely worth the splurge.
