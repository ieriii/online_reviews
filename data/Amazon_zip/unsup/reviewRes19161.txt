This was a restaurant on my list of places to go while visiting Chicago. There are so many places, but wanted to go here because I heard they have Poutine in the menu. So, I came here with a friend who lives just down the street. They are also know for their gourmet burgers. So, of course I ordered the Poutine and a burger topped with braised oxtail and goat cheese. Poutine would be hard to screw up... How can you not love fries smothered with fresh cheese curds and hot gravy. The burger on the hand was not great! I felt it was a little dry... I love my burger to be juicy and have my arms drenched. This was not the case, but this was only one of many wonderful sounding burgers on the menu. I would go back and maybe try a classic one and of course... The Poutine!
