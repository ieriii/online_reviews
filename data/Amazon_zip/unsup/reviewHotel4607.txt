Stayed here on a "staycation" for a few days after picking up a deal on Priceline. I've lived in the city for 14 years now and can say I had never heard of Hotel Felix until after my "winning" bid, so I was a bit weary. Is Hotel Felix a 4-star hotel? Perhaps a stretch. Having said this, however, I've bid on and won other 4-star hotels on Priceline in the past, and Hotel Felix was nicer than many of the other 4-star rated hotels I've reserved. This is a decent little hotel. Modern, clean, with friendly staff, and a decent location. No, it's not on the Magnificent Mile, and I don't like that priceline groups River North & Mag Mile together, increasing the odds you'll end up in River North over Michigan Ave with a low bid offer, but hey, that's the risk you take, and its River North location is great for proximity to family tourist destinations such as Rainforest Cafe, Ed Debevic's, Hard Rock Cafe, etc. Free Wifi was a bonus, rooms, though small, were quite nice. Ordered room service for dinner one night, and the food, especially the gourmet burger, was absolutely delicious. I know the hotel is small, but with a family, the only other missing piece was a pool, but hey, you can't have everything, especially for the price. Are there other better choices? Sure. Would I recommend Hotel Felix to anyone asking? Absolutely.
