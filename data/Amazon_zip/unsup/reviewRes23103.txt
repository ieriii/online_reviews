This place ain't half bad. The burrito I had for once didn't have any rice and that was fine by me. They have maduros(the ripe plantains) that were good. It seemed like food my family would make only with a little less flavor. Latin/Hispanic restaurants usually dull the favors down for the masses. So all in all I would give this place another try. The staff here is really nice too. I know what your thinking...why did you order a burrito at a costa rican restaurant. I also had casado that was good.
