Went here last night and had such an amazing experience! Now I have a habit of checking out menus online before I go to a place and one of the specials was a goat-cheese gnocchi.....I was so excited about it! Well, the specials had changed by the night we got there - but friend mentioned it to the owner. He comes back ten minutes later and says they have a few gnocchi left and can throw it together with some spinach & tomatoes. Yes please! It was incredibly good - and really so nice of the owner. He also recommended a beautiful bottle of chianti, that we really enjoyed. The neat thing about this place is their anti-pasto type bar, which is in the main room. We ordered the assortment, cause there were so many good things to try; sweet potatoes, faro w/grilled peaches and the eggplant were our favorites. And we ended with the lemon panna cotta, which was just perfect. So exceptional service, delicious food....we'll be back!
