Great to do once at least. The other fondue place is good but it is a chain and the ambiance does not compare.  Downside: The tables, not the the booths, are very close together so if you have a fussy date she might get all fussy. There was a couple sitting next to us and they asked to be moved to a booth. The wait was FOREVER. They try to ease the pain with some amazing cheese and crackers though which helped. The place in general is very crowed and cramped. Why 4 stars?  The food, the light strums of the acoustic guitar player, and the atmosphere, while being crowded it is still appealing because it is all dark wood and in the basement and reminds you of a cozy labyrinth. If you can get a booth though and if it is cold stay away from the door.
