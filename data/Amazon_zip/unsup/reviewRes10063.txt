Went here on a Friday night with a group of 7. They told us the wait was going to be 2 hours, but we were seated in 1 hr, which was great, except when I pointed out that we were going to have 7 instead of 6 they never got us a 7th chair. The hostess who seated us said as soon as the other 2 people at our table left, we'd have those chairs also, but then they seated another couple right away, so my friend stood during the meal. Either way, the pizza was great - we tried 2 reds and a white. I really loved the white (with tomatoes and mushrooms) - very simple and garlic-y, but delicious! I also had the Swingin' Single (light and refresing) and Worry'in Ale (not my favorite) to drink. Others in my group had the Hefe and really loved it. The atmosphere was fun - tons of people and the music was good, but a little bit too loud (I could barely hear my friend sitting next to me). I'd definitely go back again for the pizza. PS Why would anyone put mashed potatoes on a pizza? So strange... but I guess there's a lot of variety!?
