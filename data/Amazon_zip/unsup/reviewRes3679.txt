This place is really unique and I'm so happy it is close to my work. I ordered the Bud's Buffalos Suicide style and my ass is still on fire. The chicken is drenched in buffalo sauce and topped off with about a thousand jalepenos. I gave a little to one of my co-workers and he started crying. ( He's a pus can't handle the heat)  A half order is enough to feed at least 3 people, which for 8.95 is a steal. I also have to say the delivery driver should be put into the Delivery Driver Hall of Fame.  The fries are what made this place lose a star. They just seemed like there were cooked yesterday. I will for sure be going back however, which I'm sure my ass is none to happy about.
