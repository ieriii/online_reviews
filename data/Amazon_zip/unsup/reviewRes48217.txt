All of the food we experienced this evening at The Publican was amazing, and I give the food 5 stars hands down. There are two reasons I didn't give this place 5 stars, and each only took away a half star each. First is the noise level! This place is EXTREMELY almost to the point of being annoying (and I am an extremely loud individual)! There is nothing in the decor of the restaurant to dampen the noise level. Secondly was the very slow service. The waitress (and her "shadow") we very pleasant and knowledgeable, however, they seem to disappear many time throughout the meal. On to the food. First of all my wife is a strict vegetarian, and The Publican was more than accommodating, preparing a mixed vegetable plate filled with an array of wonderful side dishes. The rest of us started with the pork rinds as an appetizer and then shared the Farm Chicken, Fried Oysters, and Suckling Pig for the entrees! I am not generally a pork rind fan, but I must admit the vinegar and cayenne really added a wonderful flavor to these pork rinds. As for the entrees It is very hard to determine which was the best. All of them were absolutely amazing. If I had to choose between the 3 I would have to give the nod to the Farm Chicken, although I recommend all 3. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse with carmel and sea salt........out of this world! Very rich, but a great way to end the meal. Great place!
