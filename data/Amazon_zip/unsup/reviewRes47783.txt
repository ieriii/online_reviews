This place is sort of different approach to the Brazilian style steakhouse, and very well done. While the meat presentation is very much the same as the traditional Brazilian style, the salad bar is much more ecclectic and elegant if you will. What they offer are a wide variety of salads presented on a small platter (as opposed to the typical buffet buckets), as well as breads, cheeses, and a couple of soups. The curry pumpkin soup was outstanding. At the table, the service and atmosphere were top notch. The decor is modern but very comfortable, our waiter was very personable and accommodating. The wine flights are a nice option if you are in the mood for a little wine tasting. Finally, the meats were excellent. Personal favorite was the lamb, everything else I had was outstanding, except maybe the lemongrass steak, which was a little dry and overdone. Overall, highly recommended!
