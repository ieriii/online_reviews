I love piece. However, I only gave them 2stars due to the fact that its too dark inside and parking is a big issue in wicker park. I live in the suburbs and we dont have to pay for parking (thats like charging for water). So when you are in wicker park, lincoln park parking is a huge problem. Im sure Piece makes enough money to buy a parking lot. Instead they offer valet after 5pm which is ok, but everyone knows how valet drivers treat your car. So no thanks. However, pizza and beer its outstanding. Oh and me and my friend went there we order two pizzas we finished one and requested to take the other one togo. We bought two $20 pizzas and spend another 20 on beer. The waitress took away our pizza to put it in a to go box and as she walked she tripped and our Full pizza was on the floor. She came back and told us about the accident as if we didnt see it and said "im so sorry, ill give you guys 20% off your bill" so im thinking nice you know we wont have to pay for the full pizza thatfell on the ground. Well to my surprise she came back charged us 60+ dollars then gave us 20% off that so we still payed $50. What kind of legit business charges someone something that they didnt even eat. I asked the waitress that why am I been charged for the ful pizza if i didnt even eat it, yet ask to take it to go and she slip on the floor with it and she simply said Im sorry but it goes on our records that they pizza was made. So someone has to pay for it. Well Im sorry but why do I have to pay for it, if you were the one that slip on the ground with it. Point been i payed $50. for 3 beers and a pizza. I dont wish bad upon no one but ever since ive been back to piece she is no longer working there so I would give them more stars.
