okay... this was seriously, seriously delicious and totally awesome. My bf and I went for Valentine's day last night, we enjoyed a 6 course prefix menu with drink pairings, worth every penny. Here's what we had: (BTW the night/menu was dubbed 'i just dined in your arms tonight'- a valentine's day rock ballad inspired extravaganza- I mean really, that's f'n great, the songs playing would coincide with the course you were eating, genuis!) first course- fluke tartar, rose hips and cactus pear paired with a drink called rosie's hips, a nice cocktail light with a touch of citrus. second course- in house made (of course) yam gnocchi with a creamy taleggio cheese sauce, shaved truffles and chives. Paired with a robust chardonnay from burgundy. third course-foie gras, pie streusel crumbles, preserved bing cherries paired with a a cocktail that was served in a beaker, it was pink and a touch sweet. fourth course- skate wing lightly breaded, ham hock chunks in a smoky sauce with hazelnuts paired with a nice pinot noir. fifth course- braised short rib, vegetable confit and coddled egg, paired with an amazing grenache that would blow your socks off. sixth course- pink cotton candy, ginger brulee and caramel glass paired with an 11 year old dessert wine. I'm a big critic but everything including the entire staff was really great, they're totally educated in the food and was just as excited as you to be there experiencing it. It's very contemporary, aesthetically pleasing small artsy plates that are totally unpretentious and totally amazing. Go!!
