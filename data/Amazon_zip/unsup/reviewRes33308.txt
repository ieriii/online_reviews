Dinner for 2: Vegetarian Platter - Falafel (best ever), rice, hummus, pita, and Jeruselum salad...$6 Talapia - Sundried tomatoes, rice, hummus, pita, and Jeruselum salad...$7 Small container that I got to fill to the brim from their very unique salad bar...$4 Paying $5 for a $15 Groupon here, having this whole meal ring up to be only $3.75, leaving a very nice tip, and having leftovers for lunch the next day...priceless.
