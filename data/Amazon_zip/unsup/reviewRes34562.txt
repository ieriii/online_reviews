"Oh man, I can't believe there is such a long line for this place...I'd much rather go to some dirty-dank-hole-in-the-wall-far-off-the-beaten-path-crap-shack for breakfast than to a place where I have to wait 45 minutes for prompt service, a prime location, and tasty food!!!" Duh, there is a line for Yolk because A) the location B) the lack of other breakfast spots in the vacinity and C) the food ain't half bad! Seriously it's like going to Disney World and complaining about having to wait in line to get on Magic Mountain, give me a break where do you think you are rural Montana? You should be happy that some small business owner in this city is actually making money in this piss poor economy! So, yes I'm a fan of Yolk as you can tell. I like the waffles, fresh juice, the coffee is good because they give you a bunch of flavored creamers to add into it, the potatoes are tasty. This is a solid breakfast place, not life-changing or anything but good and worth the wait in my opinion.
