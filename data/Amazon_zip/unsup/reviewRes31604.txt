A friend and I decided to try Sunda for brunch. Excellent choice! I've been to Sunda for Dim Sum in the Dark so I was familiar with the atmosphere and the food. On to the brunch: we munched on Southeastern Chop Chop Salad, Crispy Salmon salad and tempura shrimp rolls. All divine. The greatest treat of them all was the strawberry-passionfruit mimosa. I'm not ashamed to write I had 3. Um, it was a long week.
