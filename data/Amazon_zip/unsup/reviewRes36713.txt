Ok so I see there are quite a few reviews on this place but thought I should add mine none the less. I was highly impressed with everything this place had to offer. From the decor and music right down to the food. I went on a date and maybe that helped too because I really enjoyed the person I was with. We shared a dragon maki roll as our appetizer. One of the best I've had in the city! I then went on to have the Pad-See-Ew with beef. VERY flavorful and tasty! They add carrots, peas and baby corn which I have never had in the dish before. They have a great selection of sushi, Japanese and Thai cuisine. Parking is meter but shouldn't be a problem. Pleanty in the area.
