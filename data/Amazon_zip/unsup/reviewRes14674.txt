I'm drooling just thinking about writing this review! Easily my favorite place to eat in the city. I have been a loyal Sabatino's customer for over 5 years now and I don't plan on that changing anytime soon! The decor? Hmmm...definitely old school. Really, really dim lighting and some interesting holiday decorations (including creepy Santa/Mrs. Claus dolls at Christmas), but they have some great private booths if you're looking for romantical, and some giant curved booths if you're with a larger party. The staff is always super friendly and welcoming and it kinda feels like you're having a big Italian meal at your Auntie Sophia's house - everyone is family and it feels like home. The food? Please see the drooling comment above. It's amazing Italian food. I love the spinach gnocchi so much that I'd weep if it ever went away. It's always cooked to potato-ey perfection and it's complemented by salty, heavenly prosciutto, crisp asparagus tips and a rich, creamy alfredo sauce. It's heaven on earth ladies and gentlemen. My friends have tried a plethora of other entrees and are always happy campers, but me? I'm loyal to that gnocchi til the bitter end! The entree sizes are huge, and even if they weren't, you get homemade pizza bread and crusty italian bread on your table, plus each entree comes with soup AND salad. Try the stracciatella soup, you won't be disappointed! Oh, still hungry you say? (you glutton, you!) Order the bananas foster - I dare you. They make it at your table and if the smell of the melted butter and cinnamon isn't enough to make you swoon, then we definitely can't be friends. Top all this Italian goodness off with reasonable prices, easy parking, quick access to 90/94 and the sweet gentlemen that walk around serenading customers with violins and you have ITALIAN HEAVEN ON EARTH. Go to Sabatino's, you won't regret it!
