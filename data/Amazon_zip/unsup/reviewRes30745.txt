I never write reviews. I've been to restaurants that run the gamut from great to mediocre but I'm lazy. I figure I'll just let other people write the review :). I have to make an exception for Nana in case there are people out there who like me, saw this restaurant on DDD and have been meaning to try it. My gf and I went to Nana's for dinner. We made a reservation but despite that, had to wait over an hour for a table. That in itself wasn't too bad - it's Chicago, I expect to wait for a table at 'nicer' restaurants. What we didn't bargain for was the horrible service. The hostess ignored us when we came in while she chatted on the phone for about 15 mins. Then when she got off the phone, started speaking to the larger party behind us even though we were right in front of her podium. Okaaayy. When we finally had her attention, she was rude , dismissive and didn't seem to know what she was doing. She kept disappearing for long periods of time and no one was getting seated even though you could see empty tables in the restaurant. When we finally got seated (without any apologies), it was another long wait to get the attention of our server. It took about 30 mins to get her to our table. We ordered everything at once (drinks, apps, dinner) because we were afraid we would never see her again. For entrees, she had the veggie pot pie and I had the pork shoulder. I thought her food tasted a bit better than mine but both were nothing special. We were supposed to meet friends after dinner but the whole experience left us in a bad mood (and took so long) that we just went home afterwards. To summarize, Nana is an overpriced place with mediocre food and horrible service. From reading other reviews, it seems their brunch service might be better but i have no intention of ever returning to this restaurant.
