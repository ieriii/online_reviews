Mother's Day is usually pretty hectic just about everywhere, so I'll give them a break on the false alarm delivery of other people's food to our table and lack of numerous items on the menu. It happens, and the food definitely made up for what was missing. Everything is designed to share, though the burger doesn't come in a sharing format. The risotto was excellent (inside joke: elmo agrees!) though having the egg swirled in table side turned at least one person off from trying it. More for me! The pizza (D.O.C.) was pretty good, though it wasn't anything super special. I really, really liked the focaccia and bruschetta. Meat and cheese plates are decently portioned, and quite tasty, but I'd opt for the mozzarella and tomatoes instead if I had to double up. One thing I didn't like was the pasta dish with meatballs. The meatballs were pretty small and reminded me of Chef Boyardee. The flavor wasn't offensive, but the meatballs were far too salty. Service was pleasant, seating was efficient and prompt, and the bill wasn't outrageous despite the crazy amount of food ordered and consumed.
