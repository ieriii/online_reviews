Met up with a few friends for a Saturday brunch/hangover relief at Caf 28. This place has been on my radar for quite some time, so I was happy to finally give it a try. The restaurant as a whole had a much more intimate feel than I expected. There was no wait and we were seated right away.  I ordered the crab cake benedict, which was one of the better ones that I have had. I would definitely come back for dinner - I've looked at their menu on-line and it looks fantastic.
