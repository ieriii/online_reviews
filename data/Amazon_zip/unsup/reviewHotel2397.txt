Very elegant hotel in the South Loop of Chicago, right off the Harrison subway exit on the Red Line. Very good location, with easy access public transportation. Our room was big and clean, with a wonderful view. We actually had two views, one of Lake Michigan , the other of downtown. I would request a corner room, we stayed in room 1169 if you would like to request that room. The only downfall is you have to pay an extra fee for access to the gym. It was $15/day and when I peeked in there wasn't anything spectacular. The pool is an indoor lap pool with two jacuzzi spa but it has a nice outside area where you can lay out. The service was friendly and fast and the hotel bar is fully equipped. I would definitely recommend this hotel to visitors of Chicago who want a convenient hotel. It was walking distance from Buckingham Fountain and right across Grant Park.
