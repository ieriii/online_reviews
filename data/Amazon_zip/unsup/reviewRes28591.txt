We were cold, wet and starving. And there it stood like a magnificent beacon in the dark night - Pasta Bowl. It beckoned us to enter its doors and become enveloped in its narrow, kitchen-in-the-dining-area space, and so we did. And we did it again. And again. And again. The gnocchi aurora's smoky mozz makes my palms sweat (that's a good thing) and the just-tossed pasta sauce on any dish is worth venturing from all corners of the city for. Service can be slow at times, but who cares. Get a drink (nicely priced, by the way) and settle in for huge portions that will keep your wallet as full as you.
