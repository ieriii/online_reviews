I suppose having the cities largest beer selection is good. I suppose I'm glad they have peach lambic for the non-beer drinkers. I guess it's a 'cool' bar and the food is good.  Except that I find the beer selection to be a bit daunting...one couldn't possibly see all they have to offer on the menu in a reasonable amount of time...you really do have to be a beer lover to enjoy their selection of alcohol...and it's not 'cool' to stand all night in a smoky bar (cigars, too...yuck) and pay top dollar for beer and eat mediocre food in back, also for top dollar. $22 pork chop that was over seasoned and $24 salmon that was too fancy for it's own good but sure didn't taste like it...oh and it took 55 minutes to come out without any explanation from the waitress who was avoiding our table. She knew something was wrong and when I asked what was up she said "they got slammed"...which I would have believed if I were in one of the parties that came in AFTER me and ordered AFTER me...I got my food AFTER all of them finished eating. Don't make me feel unreasonable for questioning a nearly hour long wait for food, on a Tuesday... I know you're wondering how I know how long it took and I will tell you...I had taken a phone call just after we ordered and when it started seeming like it was taking a while I checked the time of the call.  I'm guessing most of the 5 star reviews are for the bar and beer only. Now, a place that does what Hopleaf does and gets it right on all accounts is the Three Floyd's Brewery and restaurant in Munster, Indiana...they are what I want Hopleaf to be...fantastic, reasonably priced, interesting food and great beer that's brewed 50 feet away. Alas, they are not... 3 stars I guess, for having potential to be better next time...
