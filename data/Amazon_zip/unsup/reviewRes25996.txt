Went here on a Saturday night@ around 6:30 and was not happy with the very tight seating arrangements. We were placed in a corner with barely any room to move and we could here every word of the couples conversation who were sitting next to us. The dark basement setting was far from romantic, more silence of the lamb atmosphere. The food vs cost ratio was not worth it. All your doing is deep frying different meats in a pot of oil. No taste! For $150 I could think of a lot nicer places. This place is making a huge profit for what you get, never again.
