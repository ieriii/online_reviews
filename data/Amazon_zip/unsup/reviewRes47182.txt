Awesome yet over priced food (unless you go on a Tuesday). I have been here twice; Once on Tuesday for the half off burgers, and another time to catch up with friends. The first time wasn't too bad, service was slow but cheap burgers made up for it. The second time convinced me to never go back. We were mostly ignored, under supplied (no condiments, lack of silverware) and ripped off. We think the waitress was trying to pull a fast one on us. First she added drinks we didn't order to our bill and then when she split our checks, she forgot to include $20 out of the $41 out of the cash we provided. She ignored our table for most of the time and when I walked up to the bar, I was ignored by both bartenders (they only had two customers). The waitress also gave us attitude when we kept sending the bill back to be adjusted for their mistakes. Needless to say, no matter how awesome the food is, customer service is what will bring the customers back and this place does not have it.
