yumm. this place is delicious! i love the space - it's super cozy and warm on a cold winter night. got the empanadas and they were so good. the outside was so flaky and good and the innards were even better. the ropa vieja was good, but the guava and cheese was even better, so smooth and creamy with sweetness creeping in. and the goat cheese was even better than that! i had the lechon sandwich and it was so good. the pork was juicy and tender, with the perfectly occasional fatty bit and the plantains were such a nice touch. even the bread was toasty and soft. i also had a bite of the media noche sandwich and the bread of that was sweet and delicious. the yucca fries were also good, though too crunchy for me. their house hot sauce is also really great and has a really strong kick. and lastly, there was dessert - bread pudding! i have to get bread pudding if it's on the menu. it was pretty good. not amazing but the sauce was definitely good. it was a little denser than i usually like it. if it were just a little more porous, that would have been great. but still good and a satisfying dessert. our waiter was really friendly, maybe overly so, but attentive and nice so i appreciated that. the only thing is that everything is really garlicky. obviously nothing wrong with that but if you're sensitive to garlic or have reflux or something, it's probably something to be aware of. i live really close to this place and can't believe i've only now tried it. i'll definitely be back!
