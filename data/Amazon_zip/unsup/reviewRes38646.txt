Fantastic. I will say that its hard not to like the pizza. In my opinion I think the only real big difference that sets real Chicago deep dish vs. imitators in other states is the amount of ingredients packed in the actual pizza pie. I always feel there is twice the amount of cheese, veggies, meat in the pizzas in Chicago which naturally makes it awesome.
