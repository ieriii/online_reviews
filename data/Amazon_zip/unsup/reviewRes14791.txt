I have been to this place three times now and it is fantastic!  The yuca relleno is to die for as are the crispy garlic smothered plantain chips...Yum! My friends have also had the bistec meal (complete with black beans, white rice and sweet plantains) and one of the pork sandwiches and we were pleased by all. The menu boasts traditional cuban fare at reasonable prices.  They are also open for breakfast serving omelettes, espresso and authentic cuban coffee. The best part about this place is the personable owner working behind the counter every day. He welcomes feedback and is always pleasant. Seeing him makes me happy that this place is doing so well.
