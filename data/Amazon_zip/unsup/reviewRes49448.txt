Gotta say I love this place. I've been here about three times over the last week and its a great place to meet people from a drink. The staff is outstanding (especially Jimmy at the bar!!). While other places close to place like Pops for Champagne are crowded and loud, I can always find a place to sit and relax, even on a Saturday night. The place is known for its wine and also cheese. They offer excellant flights consisting of four wines per flight in sparkling, wine and red. I'm not a wine expert but I've enjoyed everything I had there. All the flights are reasonable ($12-$18) and you can of course get it by the glass. Strongly recommend this to meet friends or an outstanding first date.
