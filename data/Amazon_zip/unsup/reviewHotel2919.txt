I have big expectation out of hotels. Especially Sheraton hotels. I have been staying at Sheraton hotels in most of my conferences. They have not done me wrong. This one in particular was as good as the other hotels. However, the little things annoy me a little. For one thing, my door is located perpendicular right next to another room. Why the heck would you do that? I can hear every time someone come in and out of that room, and it would wake me up in the middle of the night. I should really not deduct a star for one particular room because not all the rooms are that way. I guess I'm getting soft... Or I just like Sheraton hotels that much... =P
