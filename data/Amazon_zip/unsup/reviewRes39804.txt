Great Kalbi with a healthy side of racism!  First off, I'm Korean guy and this is a Korean restaurant. I would be wary of bringing your spouse/fiancee/girlfriend if she is white (haven't tested it with other races). We arrived there at the same time as another white/asian couple, and about five minutes later, a korean couple and another white-asian couple arrived. we weren't given menus until the korean couple were well into their first course, which was about 15 minutes after we sat down.  And for some reason the other mixed couples were served well before us as well (we postulated it was because they were asian girl/white guy matches, but who knows).  Anywho, Kalbi was good though the service made it harder to swallow. Those poor ladies-- they work their dang asses off until 5 am handing out 15 little mini plates of food to each table in addition to the regular courses. I can see why they're cranky but still, we're not in Korea anymore, and you should have some measure of social maturity. I can't wait until their kids marry white/black/hispanic and then they have to deal with their mixed progeny. We'll probably go back. Maybe not so late though.
