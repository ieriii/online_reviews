I stopped in the Mercat for drinks this week. It was my first visit, and it's beautiful. From the host to the servers, the staff is engaging and welcoming. The drinks recommended were carefully crafted and delicious, and even though they had already closed they gave us wine samples. When requesting a dessert menu, before I even ordered from it they brought a dessert to try. Perfect for a date or a group, cannot wait to go back. Dante and Doug waited on us and they were fantastic. This place definitely has the 'wow' factor:)
