I heard many great things about Shaw's so perhaps my expectations were high? I subscribe to and made reservations via http://opentable.com many weeks in advance for our first dinner here. Good food, the portions could have been more generous considering the prices which are moderate to expensive. I ordered a seafood sampler appetizer and swordfish, both were good not great. The appetizer had teeny tiny pieces offering a sampling of shrimp, crab and oysters. This arrived on a HUGE platter of ice which shrunk the six pieces giving the impression that someone in the kitchen forgot something... The swordfish was a bit overcooked though it was accompanied by a tasty sauce and veggies perfectly al dente. I finished off with creme brulee. The custard was mushy not smooth and the entire dessert was ice cold which was surprising. I think the temperature limited the flavors making this dessert fall flat on the palate. The service was minimal and when present, felt rushed. We had an uncomfortable distraction when a waiter shouted "asshole" en espanol to his fellow waitstaff member in the dining room. I mentioned that this disrespectful behavior disapointed us to Bruce the Maitre D' who so graciously gave my boyfriend his card when we were seated, but he failed to apologize to us when we gave him our negative yet constructive feedback. We left feeling that the waitstaff and front of house lack regard for their diners' experience. I'm looking forward to the many great alternatives to Shaw's for seafood in Chicago.
