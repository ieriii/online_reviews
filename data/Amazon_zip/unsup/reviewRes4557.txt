So I only go to the Green Mill on Sundays for their Poetry Slam / Open Mic night. I trek all the way from the Loop to meet my girlfriend Kim as we listen to some really amazing or CRAPPY poetry. The good thing about this is that the crowd decides whats good and bad. LOVE IT. It is a great way to unwind after a busy week and weekend. The host Mike, is hilarious, although sometimes a little frightening when he does monologues. The room reminds me of the old days, and I can imagine people of color singing on stage (if only those walls could speak!). I have not been there for live music, which I think follows the poetry slam - I have work in the morning! I love this place, and will continue to come back every Sunday. I give everyone who reads props, as it can be a tough crowd! Drink prices are reasonable. Service is great. Come before 7 to grab a table or booth - which is fun because if it gets busy you have to share your table or booth! There is a $6 cover, which is totally worth it.
