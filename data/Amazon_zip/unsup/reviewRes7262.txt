We leave 3 blocks, and my oh my what great find Sapori Trattoria was!! Their home made pasta, was the most amazing pasta I have ever eaten. I'm not joking. It awesome.  My husband had the lobster ravioli and could not stop drooling. I had a chicken dish that melted in my mouth. The outdoor seating was also very comfortable and the indoor seemed very cozy and full of character. We cannot wait to go back, and bring my parents the next time they visit Chicago. Don't Miss out!
