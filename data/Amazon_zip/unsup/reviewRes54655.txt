If it were possible, this score would be a 3.75. Two years ago, that number would have been 4.75. My wife and I returned to Shaws with memories of an awesome dinner (on the casual side), and were pleased with this visit, but mildly disappointed. There was a cool little blues band playing, which was loud, lively, and fun. Not sure how often they have live music, but it was great (it was loud because we chose a table near the band).I started with a great martini...dirty and delicious. My wife was a little tipsy after one Cosmo, so it must've been pretty good.The food was only OK. I had a spicy oyster shot and loved it. Their oysters in general are really good...lots of variety and quite fresh. We ordered the market-price crab legs, too, just like two years ago. Here's the major difference. Two years ago, the platter of small crab legs was fresh, perfectly cooked and SO SO good. This time, it was a different, much larger variety of crab, which was fine, but portions of the legs were not-so-fresh tasting. Still OK, but not up to Shaw's reputation or prices.Service was very good - attentive and friendly but not hovering.Will we go back? Yes, but we have lots of other places to try first. Maybe in a couple years....
