Every time we am in town with guests, we love going upstairs and having  drinks and appetizers.  It's wonderful !  It's like being in another world....a beautiful, relaxing place that's away from the busy, hectic big-city pace.  It's cheaper than a flight to a remote island.  My wife and I love it here !  Our favorite appetizer is the shrimp on sugar cane sticks.
