We came here again with our usual friends. Our friends Bruce and Karen are fanatical RJ Grunts followers, and every time we meet with them for dinner, they of course want to eat at RJ Grunts. I should say Bruce wants to eat at RJ Grunts. It is almost a cult for him. I think what stands out for me is the awesome service. The wait staff is so friendly and attentive, and the food comes very quickly. Kudos to the staff. The food is excellent, I always have a burger. Had the green chili burger this time. But of course this is one sick overcrowded restaurant. I walk from the salad bar praying that I will not bump into someone and lose my salad on somebody's head. And the restrooms are International Space Station - sized. That's all just part of the RJ Grunts experience.
