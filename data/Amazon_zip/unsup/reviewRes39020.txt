I am in search of a pizza spot since I moved. I ordered pizza the other day based on reviews from Yelp. Its OK it doesn't compare to Villa Palermo in Rogers Park. I am going to keep on checking out spots in the area. My wife liked it, but I think she was really hungry. And sometimes when your really hungry anything is good.
