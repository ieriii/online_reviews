waited two hours on a hot day for duck fat fries and "encased meats." doug is as charming as ever, but i guess i'm just not a sausage enthusiast. that's right - sausage. 99% of the things on the menu are sausages, not hot dogs. only hot dog on the menu is a chicago-style, and you can find one just as good at any of the other chicago hot dog haunts without waiting two hours. and if someone hadn't told me i was eating duck fat fries, i wouldn't have known it. good, but not the best fries i've had on earth. i'm glad i went once for the experience, but i won't be back. but to be fair, if sausages are really your thing, you will like this place.
