I heart Mayan Palace for many reasons. #1) Tues and Thurs, Margaritas are half off! Dangerous, but so worth it. Only negative is you can't upgrade your tequila. #2) The staff is so nice, and they remember you. #3) Food is that what you think when you think dive Mexican, but keep in mind they do have cheap ingredients so your tummy doesn't always feel the best after here. #4) You know Spanish by the time you leave, oh wait, that might be the pitcher of margaritas kicking in ( I swear there is grain alcohol or something crazy in there) #5) You never spend more than $30 on dinner, drinks, and a tip.
