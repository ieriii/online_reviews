Hopleaf how I LOVE YOU!! You have such an eclectic beer menu, you have such a good vibe, your food is so good, your wait, eh, not so good sometimes, but definitely worth the wait! Ive been coming here for several years now, my boyfriend introduced me to this place, and we always come back and get the exact same thing! The mussels for two. They are honestly so good! We usually go with the seasonal broth and this past Friday it was some white wine chorizo deliciousness. The only complaint about our recent visit, is that there didn't seem to be as much broth covering the mussels as there usually is? The fries were delicious per usual as was the aioli! We also had the sausage platter and the rabbit for a starter and both were very tasty!! The food is always fresh and well prepared here. I just love it! I would try to get there as early as possibly on a Friday or Saturday night as the wait does tend to get pretty long! But, like i said before, it is definitely worth the wait! The bar upstairs is cash only so be prepared!
