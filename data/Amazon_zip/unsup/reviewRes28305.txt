This is the best pizza in Chicago no question.  It's a must that you have the fresh garlic on the pizza especially with onion and green pepper. It can get pretty busy on Friday and Saturday from 7-11pm. Draft beer selection is decent. The quality of the pizza makes it good place to watch a game. They have 2 stories with TV's on both. Service is good. If it's too busy on friday or saturday go next to Flounders, they will let you order pizza from Peqoud's as long as you order drinks. They even have a server come over from Peqoud's to serve you. Just a tip
