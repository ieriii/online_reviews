Great selection of premium products - meats, cheeses, wine, beer, chocolate, coffee, and anything in between. The pastries are to die for, I always bring a large fruit tart from F&O when visiting friends. They also make the best ever freshly squeezed OJ! And here is the best part - F&O have an excellent bistro in the back with gourmet menu at very reasonable prices. Call your date, pick a bottle of CC cab from the store and enjoy it with the petite fillet! (a few steakhouses can match that quality but none can beat the prices) The cafe on Illinois street also serves fantastic food. Their's is one of the best burgers I've had.
