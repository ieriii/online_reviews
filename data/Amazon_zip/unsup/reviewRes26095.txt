Hands down, my favorite deep dish in Chicago, or anywhere. The place itself is huge and often you will still find yourself waiting to seat. Who cares, get a beer and realize you're about to eat the best pizza ever. Delivery is fast. Price is not ideal, but I get what I pay for..... I actually have some in the fridge for later as we speak
