My husband took me here for my birthday and the food was delicious. We are not big eaters so we ordered the manchego cheese starter with honey and homemade cracker (per my request) and he loved it! We also ordered the braised beef with plaintains. A little salty but so good, we ordered another. We both had two drinks and our bill was only around $60! They brought out a cake and ice cream for my bday and not being a big chocolate cake fan - i loved it! Tasted more like a rum cake...mmmm. Our waitress was wonderful. We did express our diversion to cilantro and was not heard. Apparently they put it in everything. We attempted the shrimp ceviche but it was sprinkled all over after we asked to leave it out. They kindly took it off our bill. This always surprises me, since I know alot of people do not like cilantro.
