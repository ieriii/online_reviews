Man, anyone who says this place is expensive is out of their mind and cheap. Where else can you get a complete, reasonable healthy meal for 10 bucks in Chicago, the land of hot dogs? The food here is great. I try to have falafel in every city I visit and I am happy to report that Sultans is one of the best I have ever had (Sorry East Side Pocket in Providence RI, Sultans is better). The only reason I am not giving Sultans 5 stars is because it can be a little inconsistent with the meat items. Sometimes the Chicken and Lamb are perfect, moist and well trimmed of nasty fat/grisly bits,but sometimes it feels like that's all I got, Fat and Grissel, Blah! But 95% of the time it is awesome...
