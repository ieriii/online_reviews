Unlike most BYOB restaurants in Chicago (which tend to be small, hole-in-the-wall type places), Coast has a funky, modern and hip atmosphere. The food is really good, reasonably priced and the service is exceptional. A great place to come with a larger group - especially if you're looking to impress out of towners! Try the sweet potato roll - it was to die for!
