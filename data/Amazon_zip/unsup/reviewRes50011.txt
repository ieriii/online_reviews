I still absolutely love the Fifty/50. I had accidentally left my card there on Monday evening and didn't realize it until Friday -- I checked the last transaction and it was Fifty/50 -- popped in to see if they still had it and they did! Yay! Also went a couple of weeks ago with my sister, my best friend and her baby. They had high chairs for her little girl -- high chairs at a bar!! Awesome -- seriously, it was so nice that they had high chairs! We drank mimosas (delicious!) and I had a couple of the sliders (still my favorite). The food is awesome! As an added bonus they put up a SECOND 60" TV outside -- now Sox fans and Cubs fans can watch their respective games in peace! SWEET. :)  I always have a fantastic time here -- the staff is so friendly too. Many of them have been there since the place opened -- doesn't seem like they have a lot of turnover which means the people who work there are happy. Happy employees usually equates to happy customers -- and I am very, very happy when I'm at The Fifty/50! :)
