Pros: The service was excellent; the New York Strip was cooked to perfection; the bread was good. Cons: The steak was horrible -- stringy, chewy, gristly. I did not finish it nor did I bring it home in a doggy bag. It was perhaps the most unpleasant steak I have ever eaten. It tasted like it had been frozen, thawed, and frozen again.  Maybe I got a freak steak; maybe not. In either case, I'm never going back.
