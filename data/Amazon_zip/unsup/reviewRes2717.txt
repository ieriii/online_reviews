TRUly mediocre. I wish I could have dined here in the days where Rick Tramonto was still at the helm (TRU stands for TRamonto Unlimited, afterall), but alas, our experience here was forgettable. The decor looked dated and tired, without the grand opulence and just falling short of the minimalistic elegance that some higher end restaurants have. Our waiter appeared to have woken from a pre-dinner service nap, stumbling over the obligatory menu overview and appearing quite confused when we asked about selections on the wine list. We ended up getting the 9-course tasting menu and the caviar staircase - the staircase itself was beautiful, but I can honestly say that my palate does not appreciate fine caviar enough to justify the obscene amount of money we dropped on it. Later, we heard our waiter, who had apparently woken up and learned his script after taking our orders, tell another table of 5 that the staircase was meant to be shared by a larger group, and they had a half portion size that was not offered on the menu for half the price. Would that have been nice a tid-bit for my dining companion and I?? Yes!!! As for the tasting itself, there was not a single dish out of the nine that was memorable, and most were generally uninspired. My pork belly was hard as a rock, the veal was on the bland side, and as for a salmon and sorrel dish? Can't we be a little more inventive than that? Isn't a tasting menu supposed to showcase a chef's creativity and skills? The dishes where the chef did flex his creative muscles did not "wow" as expected - the suspended foie gras changed the texture of a creamy, decadent piece of meat to something resembling (and tasting of) canned tuna. All in all, nothing was terrible, but at the same time nothing was amazing. In a city that offers so many world-class dining options, we won't be back to Tru anytime soon.
