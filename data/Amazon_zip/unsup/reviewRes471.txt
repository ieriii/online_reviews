Well, I am not going to go into all the details, or give my entire menu, since it was a couple years ago, but all I will say is perfection! I went the first week of may 2006, which was Alinea's 1year anniversary week...they only offered the 28course Tour which showcased the best of the previous year...Everything was perfect, the "high end" wine pairing was flawless, the 50$ glass of champagne before dinner was excellent...everything...though I mostly remember through the pictures that I took, the one course (probably by far the simplest), is what I always talk about... Made on the custom designed anti-griddle, it was frozen mango puree topped with bonito flakes and 30yr balsamic....MMMM....Droole... anyways 2 people 28 courses each, 5:30pm-11:30pm, tour of the kitchen chat with grant, plus generous tip...$1800 AND WORTH EVERY DAMN PENNY!!!!! see some photos that I will be posting
