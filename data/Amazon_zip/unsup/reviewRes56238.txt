Simply It is the perfect neighborhood restaurant. Mr Nguyen and his family will make you feel welcome. The food is always delicious and healthy. If you're into carry out, they do a great job packing and orders are always ready quickly. And it's rare that I don't walk out with more than I ordered -- some special treat that Mr Nguyen has eagerly added to my bag. Definitely stop in for a bubble tea or tapioca fruit smoothie on a warm summer day or a hot bowl of chicken soup or pho in the winter. And don't forget bahn mi for any lunch.My wife and I have been living around the corner for a few years and this is our go to spot for a delicious healthy meal. Definitely give it a try and support this great neighborhood establishment. And if you're really lucky, you'll visit shortly after Mr Nguyen's mother has cooked up a fresh batch of steamed sticky rice and you'll get to share in authentic cuisine and hospitality.
