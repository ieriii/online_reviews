We booked a block of rooms for our wedding this July at the Carleton. The hotel was very pretty and our room was spacious and had lots of character. Dana, who I worked with to book the rooms, was very helpful and returned my calls promptly. The best part was that by 10 of our guests booking their rooms at the Carleton, we got our room free!  The only reason I didn't rate this a five is because I felt that the rooms are overpriced for the service, location and what the hotel can offer.
