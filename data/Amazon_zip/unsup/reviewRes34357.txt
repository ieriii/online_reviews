The falafel sandwich is decent, cheap, and huge for a mere $3. Jerusalem Salad and hummus are included along with the falafel in pita, so there's no need to order either of those additionally. The hummus was rather bland, the Jerusalem Salad a bit as well, and so was the Lentil Soup. They do, however, have some interesting beverage choices like a Middle Eastern fruit punch and Jamaican ginger beer.
