I had just completed my first 5K and part of the incentive for its completion was the promise of brunch. After a futile attempt at going to Socca (if your hours say 10:30am you should be open at that time, right?), we walked over to Mia Francesa and I'm so glad we did. Because the place had just opened, we were welcomed to a fairly empty restaurant where we were promptly seated. We were still waiting for two other friends to arrive so we settled in, ordered some mimosas and ate some fresh bread. Now, the food. I ordered the pollo e ouvo, which is a chicken and bacon hash. It was very tasty. I think the potatoes were my favorite part of this dish as they were extra crispy and seasoned perfectly. The other vegetables were also nice and tender, and my eggs were fluffy. I also ordered the blush mimosa which was refreshing and very much needed. Excellent food and service, would definitely come back. The owner even came over and chatted with us.
