I had an overall great time at Publican. I met a few friends there after work. We shared a few plates, and although I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone who's starving (at least not without a hard hit to the wallet), it's a perfect place to feel comfortably full. Though the portion sizes are on the smaller side, the food will blow you away. The truffle fries and the strawberry salad were both wonderful, as were the oysters. If you're eating with a sizeable number of friends, the oysters are a great option. Paul Kahan's design concept for this restaurant is inspiring. You'll find communal tables as with Avec. Publican, however, is a little more rustic - the booths are even created to look like stables. It's all done with an upscale touch, and it really did contribute to a fantastic dining experience.  It's a popular place, so I would not recommend going without a reservation. I can't wait to go back.
