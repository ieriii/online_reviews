I really wanted to love deep dish as much as the next person. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but one small bite at a time. Maybe it would have been better had our waitor listened to my needs instead of imposing his. Although we'd been walking for hours and waited 45 minutes just to be seated --I knew we should have stuck to a small pizza for us 3 girls. The waitor comes and we had all agreed on an order of bread sticks and a small deep dish. He flat out tells me that a small won't be enough food for us. I tell him I'm pretty sure it will be, and he insisted we get the medium. I was a little peeved by that point, but my sister whispers "maybe he knows something we don't?" and she agreed for the medium. Sure enough it was way too much food. Being three petite Miami women who survive off sushi and ceviche, we could hardly finish one slice!  Look I don't mind suggestions, especially when I'm a tourist. Tell me what's good, tell me what I should order to try new flavors.. BUT DON'T TELL ME HOW MUCH I CAN EAT! We wasted half of a medium pizza. We couldn't take it back to the hotel and it was just terrible to throw food out like that. We tried to eat as much as possible so to not waste the food.. this was maybe 2.30pm and I couldn't eat until 9am the next morning. The pizza is so rich, the cheese and crust just expand in your stomach.. so people, if you're not used to eating food this heavy.. stick to the small! I will be back in Chicago (my new favorite city) for new years and I will order a small with my group and have HALF a slice regardless what the waitor says :) ..and probably go somewhere other than Gino's based on SERVICE alone.
