Yeah, hipsters may hate on a sports bar like Fifty/50 but who takes them seriously anyway? This was my spot for the World Cup 2010 (even though the IN thing was to watch it at SmallBar next door) No doubt, its where the soccer fans are, but it was always too crowded and I have no such patience and as such I would rather sit comfortably watching it at Fifty/50. After all, what matters is not where, but who you're with, and I was with great company. Also, I liked the food here. The burgers, sweet potato fries, the breakfast. All solid choices. Beverage selection also great. Yes they have plenty more beer selection at SmallBar but I'm not a beer person and again, I'm not comparing the two. Outside of World Cup season, I probably won't have much reason to frequent a sports bar, but you'll find me at next door watching soccer games every now and then.
