I went once and had an amazing date. Eventually convinced the girl to marry me. Thanks Schwa guys, for being part of the woo-ing. But I didn't review this place after that. Anyone can get things right once. I went back a second time the other week with a group of four and it blew my mind. Even better than the first time. Ridiculous. The weakest course was the drink that was the first course. Maybe trying to set the bar low? Anyway, everything after that was perfect. The music is loud. Typically rap. The service is good, though quite informal. So maybe it's not right for some crowds. However, for those of us that don't do pretention but like a damn good meal. Schwa fits that hole. One of our party was pregnant. A few courses, she couldn't eat the standard dishes. What they whipped up for her might have even been better than what the rest of us got. And they were completely and utterly wonderful about the whole process. My only complaint is the difficulty in getting them to call you back to get a reservation. It took four months. I always want to take company here but can't plan far enough in advance or I'd be there 4 or 6 times a year. In conclusion, go. Unless you're a dick. Then don't.
