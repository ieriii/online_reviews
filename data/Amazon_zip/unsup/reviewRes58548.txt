Don't Bring the Kids!Went there early on a Saturday night. 4 adults, 2 kids. We were at a table against the wall (which is where we sat the kids). Things seemed to be going well, everyone was chatting and the kids were playing with action figures. Well...the owner comes over and says, Children, when the trees outside can hear you then you are being too loud. Then he walked away. What???Not sure what spurred this comment by the owner because - believe me - we are the first people to be conscious of our kids and to make sure they are behaving. Dinner was good, but we weren't even asked if we wanted coffee or dessert. How rude! The kids were definitely NOT being too loud. In fact, everyone in the place was chatty - it wasn't a quiet restaurant.Definitely won't make a return trip.
