I went here with a girlfriend and felt immediately at home with the decor! So cute!! The food was delicious and, as someone else pointed out, the portions are not completely huge like at most places. For 1 App, 2 entrees and 2 gls. wine, it was about $100. A little pricey, but everything was very good and the service was awesome!! We asked the waiter a LOT of questions about the menu and he did an excellent job of describing and explaining everything for us. The only complaint I would have is that a took forever to get our wine. All that being said, I would totally go back!!
