wow, yummy! this place affirms my love for gastropubs and their delightful mixture of complex drinks and tasty, interesting food. i came with an empty stomach and left full and satisfied. i'm sure the one-hour wait didn't hurt ;) food: - meatballs and polenta: the ultimate saucy, savory comfort food. - beef tartar: in some strange, twilight-zone way, the taste evoked mcdonald's cheeseburger! but in the best way possible. - boar sloppy joes: i was so entranced by that pickled jalopeno that i barely noticed anything else on the plate. i even got seconds of that jalopeno! i do think this comes with too many fries tho, would substitute salad next time (yes, i know how wimpy that sounds, but i just didn't love their fries). - venison pate: mmm yum - overall, all the dishes came lathered in sauce, which i love. the more sauce, the better! drinks: - dante's paradise: loved it and its fruity, smoky grapefruit aftertaste - forgot the name but it was on tap and started with a P, in the second column...haha yes it's vague, but i wanted to give it a shoutout as it was a verrrrry good slightly sweet caramelly dark beer. although i only tried two drinks, i am definitely coming back for more...and more...and more! just have to be sneaky and try to come at an off-hour to avoid the wait.
