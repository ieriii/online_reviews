Now let me preface this with the fact that I'm from Southern California and grew up 10 minutes from Little Saigon, AND, at the time of this meal, had just been back 1 week from my 2 week trip to Vietnam. And yes, I am ethnically Vietnamese. So.. I was brought here by my aunt's boyfriend (both were visiting from Wisconsin). He seemed really out to impress me, telling me he had lived right here by Argyle and knew all this stuff about the neighborhood (I had just moved to Chicago 2 months ago). Sure, sure, I nodded. Then we walked up to Tank noodle and waited in line. We went inside and I admit I was pretty excited. Anyone who knows anything about pho places knows that the food quality is inversely proportional to how clean the floor is.. and this floor was DIRTY! So, we sat down to eat and I ordered the oxtail pho. I'd been craving this since I used to have oxtail pho monthly growing up.. very fond memories of waking up on a Saturday morning, walking into the hallway, and hearing the kitchen fan on and seeing a big stockpot full of oxtail being simmered. MMMM... So how was the pho? SO DISAPPOINTING! The broth didn't taste right, the oxtail was tiny, not that tender. For someone who "lived" right here in Chicago and knew all about it, he didn't know very much about good pho. Dude, when my aunt and this guy broke up, I could have pinpointed the exact moment of my disapproval of him.. "He turned out to be a jerk? I knew it.. he took me to Tank noodle." I've been back once since then, craving pho at 9:50 pm is tough when no other restaurants are open except Tank noodle. I had the regular pho this time.. it wasn't as bad as my first experience, but 777 and Hai Yen are much better (though if you want full reign of your hoisin sauce and sriracha, I recommend 777).
