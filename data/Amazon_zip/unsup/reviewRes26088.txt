Very good affordable Vietnamese in a comfortable, contemporary setting. The owner of this restaurant is very friendly and attentive. He is from Saigon, so there is less of a French influence at this restaurant that you might find at others. That said everything we ordered was flavorful and made with excellent ingredients. I had the Vietnamese coffee(yum-condensed milk) spring rolls(standard, but dipping sauce was very tasty), and celophane crab noodles(probably could have used a little more flavor, but were simple and tasted fine, with bigs chunks of crab). My husband had a special soup(seafood pot perhaps?) cooked in a crock pot and served at the table with great fresh seafood. He ordered noodles and they came free of charge with the soup. We were both very pleased and would return without hesitation.
