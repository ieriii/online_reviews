We first stumbled upon Noon O Kabab when we were in the Albany Park area viewing condos, which stirred up the ol' appetites. I could not have been more in the mood for Persian. Since then, we've been back several times, most recently this past Saturday evening. The restaurant was almost full, but it still felt homey instead of crowded. Our service was great and the food was, as always, delicious! We've been ordering a lot of the same the past few times we've gone (dolmehs for apps, ghormeh sabzi for me, combo kababs for the fella.) This time, we ordered the olovieh, a Persian potato salad. It was interesting, but I think my heart belongs to the dolmehs. For entrees, I had to go kabab...meat on a stick (minus the stick)? Sign me up! I got a ground chicken and a ground lamb, both enjoyable. I'm also not a huge rice fan, but the dill rice they're accompanied with is freakishly good. My husband got the ground sirloin, and I have to say, I liked that one the best. Normally, we go across the street to get our baklava fix, but we were just too stuffed this time around.
