If "legendary" deep dish pizza is cold, congealed cheese and crust that tastes like chalk, then count me out. That's what I got on the personal pizza that I was brought. I wanted a slice of the real thing, but somehow they've never heard of slices and invited me to order a small, which feeds four. Sorry, I'd rather feed just one.  I send back the first hard-tack pie and insisted on a fresh one. The next one was warm, gooey, flaky, and decent (though far from mind-blowing). In other words, it's the sort of pie that I should have received IN THE FIRST PLACE. They still had the gall to charge me full price even after wasting my time with that disgusting first pie. I guess that's what I get for eating at a tourist trap.
