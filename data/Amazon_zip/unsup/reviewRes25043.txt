Great place! Good food, drinks and service. Definitely try the seasonal sangrias. We had these roasted pepper things that were surprisingly delicious ( i normally do not like peppers) that we had to get a second order. Bacon wrapped dates are always a good pic. We also had spinach salad wrapped in ham and i think there were figs too. Overall a good experience. I think they're supposed to have an outdoor patio for the summer. There are some tourists since they are in the Blackstone Hotel and next to the Hilton. Otherwise, a good crowd.
