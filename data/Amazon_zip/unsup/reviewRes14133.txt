Order the soft pretzel. Order the beef stew. Order a pint of the Skara Brae scottish ale. Die and go to heaven. Thank me later. Seriously, the meal I had here was awesome. Not only is the pretzel huge and perfectly soft, but the cheesy soup/dip they serve it with is basically my dream come true. Follow that with their delicious beef stew paired with fresh carrots, french beans, and their super creamy mashed potatoes-my tastebuds were gettin' down! Pair the stew with a pint of their Skara Brae and you have the perfect meal. Add in the dim lighting and fabulous decor and you get 5 stars.
