I CRAVE the breakfast here! A good friend recommended that we eat here while vacationing in Chicago. Boy was I glad we went! Pretty much the perfect breakfast spot. The potatos we beyond amazing...perhaps the best breakfast potatos i've ever had. Eggs were cook well, sausage patties were very good quality, and refreshing orange/mango mimosas. We also tried the pretzal pancakes which were VERY good too! If I ever get a chance to go back to Chicago, Bongo Room will be at the top of my list!
