I LOVE SSGS... I was introduced to this fine dining establishment around a year ago after a long night out with a few friends... yes, i wrote quite rightly that I came to eat here very late at night (or early in the morning) at about 3 or 4 AM (it is open 24hr/365days).. having been to Asia I felt very much in an authentic and surreal moment and the food (neverending kimbap and kimchi and all sorts of delicious fermented appetizers included in your meal....oh yeah and BULGOGI!!) and the service definitley matched that... The ambience is a little "old school" but we always go in huge groups (6-15 people) and its always a great time! We love the lady that always works the moonlight shift... she is DA BEST yes it is a far drive from where I usually go out (and I live in noble square!!) BUT WOW this place is totally worth it!
