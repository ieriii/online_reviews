This review is only for the chocolate cafe con leche and the churros! YUMMMMMM! The churros are really good! $1 each! They obviously sprinkle cinnamon and sugar, but they also sprinkle some chocolate on it too! The churros are made to order so expect to wait about 3 to 5 minutes for them. Definitely worth it!  The chocolate cafe con leche was ok. I wanted a real mexican hot chocolate but maybe I ordered the wrong thing. None of the other items on the menu sounded like a regular mexican chocolate. Anyway knocked a star off because of the chocolate. I'll definitely go back! The food looked sooo delicious!  A huge plus to the workers also. I went there in the middle of the lunch rush! Even though they were very busy, the staff were all very nice and polite. They are welcoming and very professional. I would go back just for the service.
