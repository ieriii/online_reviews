Pros: - classy decor, clean - Southern charm mixed with rustic touches - location in the Gold Coast, right off of division - friendly as can be service without being obtrusive - I must have had my water refilled five times over the course of my meal. Everyone from the table runner to the manager checked in to make sure we were having a spectacular meal - authentic, tasty BBQ - they have monstrous Southern Pride smokers in their kitchen, and Lee Ann's passion for her craft and experience is evident. There are gorgeous smoke rings on her fall-off-the-bone tender St. Louis ribs, her pulled pork is heavenly, and you have four choices of finger-licking sauces as well. Kobe brisket is solid as well, but her pulled meats and ribs are truly superb. - delicious sides - you can't go wrong with their cornbread, served in heaping portions. I OD on their house-made pickles and chips every time I come. - good price-for-value: entrees are enormous; SO and I couldn't finish a q3 together (with leftovers to take home too!), although our server said that there are people who can Cons: - on the pricer end for BBQ, but it's tasty and portions are huge!! Summary: - finger-licking goodness with authentic BBQ in the Gold Coast served with abundant Southern hospitality. - good price-for-value - romantic enough for a date (as long as your date doesn't mind the messiness of BBQ), would be good for groups as well.
