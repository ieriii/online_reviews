I had a gift certificate to Lettuce Entertain You so my sister and I decided to try Wildfire. The interior was really cozy and festive for the holidays. We both had the special - three cutlets of filet mignon crusted in a flavor of our choice. I had the parmesan, blue cheese and peppercorn. The steak was delicious. Also had a nice sauvingon blanc from NZ and a zingy key lime tart cake. All in all a good place.
