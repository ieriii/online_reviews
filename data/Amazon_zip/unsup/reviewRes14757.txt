When I first pulled up to this place I didn't want to go in because I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. The owners are so friendly and the food is just great and priced right! One of my favorite things is to go to Miami and eat Cuban food, now I just take a short drive and fulfill my cravings. The first time my husband and I went we ordered a ton of food and it was all good, no complaints here. The space is tiny so carry out is a great option, there are only a few bar chairs for seating, so don't expect to go with a huge group and eat there.
