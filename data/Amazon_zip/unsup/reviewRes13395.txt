awesome. awesome. awesome. marty, our server, was terrific. friendly, helpful, professional, and his knowledge about the beers served was impressive. i had the anti-hero chicken sandwich. omg. out of this world - caramelized onion & apple compote, double cream brie cheese, arugula, house-made mustard my husband had the fish 'n chips. he said it was 'good.' very rarely does any meal get rate better than an 'okay,' so it was excellent - pale ale battered atlantic scrod, frites, roasted red pepper remoulade, honey jalapeno slaw the fries. omg. i tasted the fries (frites), they were seasoned and cooked to perfection. we're wanting to make another visit before we head back to california!!! btw, the beer was excellent, as well.... :)
