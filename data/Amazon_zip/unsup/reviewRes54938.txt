Oui! Oui! This joint is off the chain. This was my first encounter with French food and I have to say I'm glad it was with Bonsoiree. The restaurant is comfortable and the staff is super friendly. The menus are prearranged which is a great way to try multiple specialties. Everything from the flavor to the presentation was grade A. This is a great date restaurant. Check it out!
