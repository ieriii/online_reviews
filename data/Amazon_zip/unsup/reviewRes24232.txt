I love this place. My wife and I ate here every Saturday for lunch one summer. They make crepes like no others I have had.. they differ from French crepes which I love as well. I love the more savory ones though we often treated ourselves to the sweet ones too... The staff is very attentive and very friendly and to be honest, the waitresses are burning hot (my wife agrees). It is casual and nice and clean place. It is also very affordable. High marks from me!
