I've very little relatively negative things to say about this place, it does a lot of things right. As much as I'd much rather give it 4.5 stars, it deserves more of a 5 than a 4. I've had many different place's Korean style chicken, I was more inclined to compare this to Ssaboo in Niles, IL (which in my review noted that it is pretty terrible). This blew a lot of my expectations away. What's great about this place is you get different parts of the chicken, not just the wings and legs but breast and thigh too. My friend and I went and split the chicken deal with two sauces, Sassy Seoul and the BBQ (not the Bud's, that'll have to wait until the next visit!), I was far more impressed with the Sassy Seoul although my friend very much enjoyed the BBQ. The fries are, well, pretty generic but I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary, the Myon Kimchi was great: not sour, not too fresh but still clean and tasty while not being too spicy. The chicken was great, pretty moist and plenty of meat on the bone. The marinate was also very flavorful and certainly unique, I haven't had any Korean fried chicken that tasted like this. It's a very relaxed environment, friendly to pretty much anyone of any age and any race. It's great to see traditional bowls be given a more modern or western twist to appeal to everyone, which is I think lacking in a lot more traditional Korean restaurants. Pricing really isn't too bad either, I definitely say you'll get your money's worth. Parking certainly wasn't a problem at 4PM on a weekday. The staff wasn't too interactive with guests (...except with women...seemingly...) but still had a great time. They do have wi-fi but it's protected (and didn't have the password available, which was a little annoying but not necessary). Definitely some place worth checking out if you're in the area!
