Apparently coming to Chi-City means having to stop at Gino's East for a deep dish pizza. So of course I abide by the tourist code and filled into a ridiculously long line to try one of these. After about 30 minutes of standing OUTSIDE in line, we were granted access inside. Walking through the restaurant, I couldn't decide if the setting was charming or icky. Apparently, they've allowed patrons to draw ALL OVER their walls with crayons. I kept thinking, "cute!" Then I thought, "clean your restaurant." Our waiter came and again I was in a dilemma of not being able to decide if he was being rude, or if my sensitive Westcoast attitude wanted more warmth from him. I suppose he was perfectly fine, and did his job. Pizza was really good. I don't know if the best deep dish I've ever had, but I was into it. It came out poppin' fresh out of the oven. Gooey and the crust almost tasted like traditional pie crust, rather than doughy and bready. I was able to ingest 2 slices before tapping out (a small comes with 4 slices). OH, and if you come here, be ready to spend some time. 1) the wait will probably last 30 minutes at least, and 2) pizzas take about another 30-40 minutes to make (which they warn you about upfront). If you're a tourist, go try. Though, I couldn't imagine that most locals turn into regulars.
