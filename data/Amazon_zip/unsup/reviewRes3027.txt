My sister and I went to Tru last night expecting a mind-blowing culinary experience. We left Tru confused and full of shame for spending BIG bucks on such a disappointing self-indulgent meal. The gnocchi appetizer I had tasted like watered down Arthur (moms - you know what I'm talking about) macaroni and cheese - not kidding. For my entree, I ordered beef short ribs. While the meat was extremely tender and delicious, the portion was shockingly tiny. The "small vegetables" that accompanied the short ribs were almost microscopic; so small that I couldn't tell what they were. The dessert - some kind of almond cake - was truly horrible. I can honestly say that it was the worst dessert I have ever had at a restaurant. The "cake" was not presented as a slice, but rather, scrapings that looked and tasted like the crumbs from a week-old cake made from an Easy Bake Oven. There was a little swirl of cherry sauce and a teaspoon of ice cream that I guess were there to moisten the dry scrapings that were on my plate. On the bright side, the wine was spectacular and my sister liked most of the items from her Tasting Menu. If you're into stuffy, formal, over-priced food (and don't like to eat much) - this is the place for you!
