I've never been to another Brazilian Steakhouse, so I don't know how this compares, but I do know that I love it. I don't get much on their salad bar, but their mushroom risotto is to die for! I've learned to only take a little bit of it though, to make sure I have room for the delicious meats they bring around. the bacon-wrapped chicken is my favorite, & the parmesan-crusted pork is delicious as well. I eat lunch early (11 or 11:30), so there's never a wait, & the food is always fresh.
