I have been here several times and I have never had anything but a great experience. Yes, at times it is packed, but that is because it is a great place with great food and not only a HUGE selection of beer, but a ton of great beers. Every time I go I will order one or two of my usual and then I randomly pick 2 new ones from the beer menu. Now of course you aren't going to like every beer that you order if you do it that way because there are so many different types that you are bound to get a kind of beer that you aren't fond of. If you aren't feeling as adventurous just as one of the bartenders, who are extremely knowledgeable and are great at steering you in the right direction.The only part of me that wants to give this place anything less than 5 starts is the part that doesn't want anyone else to realize how great this place is and to have them show up and take the last seat, but the employees here have always been great so I have to give them what they deserve.
