Heavy food with little inspiration and the place is dirty. The staff here runs the gamut of emotions from A-B with a little more smug attitude than befits the food and location. People rave about this place but I just don't get it. They have this 'meatloaf' like thing, I think it was made with lentils, that had to strain the table with its weight --- it looked, smelled and tasted like some futuristic extruded paste of processed food product. And their seitan is rubbery and devoid of any personality.
