The absolute best falafel sandwich you'll ever have in life. I know I should try other things on the menu - I'm sure they're just as good - but I just can't stray. And for $4? Come on. The vegan cookies they have on the counter are always delicious, too, and a good way to end the meal. Go. Eat falafel. You will not be disappointed.
