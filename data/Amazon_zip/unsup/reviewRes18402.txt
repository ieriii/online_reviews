I'm about to commit blasphemy. I think the Bad Apple's burgers are better than Kuma's, and you can actually get a seat! Seriously, the meat quality is better (I find Kuma's burgers terribly salty) and cooked to perfection, and you can get just as many weird things on top. Service has always been fine, drink selection is awesome, food is always good. I love that not a lot of people know how good TBA is yet...it means it's not very crowded. :)
