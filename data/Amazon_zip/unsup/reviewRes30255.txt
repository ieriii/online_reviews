I've been here for brunch on weekends. It's not one of your fancy brunch spots with eclectic cuisine, but the food is good, the portions are big, service is efficient and you won't have to wait an hour to be seated. There's a nice neighborhood feel to the restaurant that is comforting in the Gold Coast area.
