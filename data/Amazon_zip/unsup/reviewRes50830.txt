Took my wife for a nice holiday lunch and had read allot about the Fried Chicken...so we got the Family Style Boarding House lunch. It might be the best deal in town, the portions were enormous and all excellent. We ate left overs for 2 days. The Chicken is great the mashed and Gravy excellent , the Greens we some of the best I have had. Made me realize I dont use near enough vinegar in mine own. Some of our favorite things were the little things, the cornbread and honey butter and the best raspberry preserves I have ever eaten was served with the Biscuits. There was also a wonderful pepper jam that must be mentioned. We has some great Sweet tea also. I have read about some of the service issues and maybe it was because we were there at lunch and it was not very crowded but the service was perfect, our server was great very friendly and informative it really could not have been any better unless he paid the bill. It was some of the better service I have had at any restaurant any where!
