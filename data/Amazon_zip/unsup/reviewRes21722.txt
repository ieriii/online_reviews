I love hot dogs. I LOVE hot dogs. This place has great hot dogs (except they don't carry celery salt, wtf?) and great fries...it's a sweet little place to go if you're looking for a quick bite to eat. I will admit, the prices are a little steep for what it is, but you're also paying for the experience. Even if you've been to a drive-thru before, you should check this one out. I never cared to go here, in fact the place always kinda freaked me out as a kid - but my boyfriend convinced me to come here and now I'm hooked. It gets 5 stars because I've NEVER had a bad experience here so far.
