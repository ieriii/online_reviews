This place was delicious. Make sure to get the antipasti sampler, as you get a gigantic plate of every antipasti they offer. I had one of the specials, a lobster and saffron risotto - god god, rich deliciousness. They seem to have an awesome dinner crowd, as we had a reservation for some absurdly early old-person dinnertime, like 5:30 or 6, and they were almost full even then.  I didn't love the space - kind of a lot of tables crammed into one small space, which made for a very loud dinner. But the food, the wine and the service were all top notch.
