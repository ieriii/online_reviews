The best vegan restaurant I've been too, and satisfying enough for those who are meat eaters. Make sure you order a vegan shake for a meal starter - it'll probably kill your appetite but so what -- soooo good. I always have the vegan reuben sandwich and it's an incredibly fantastic "fake." The vegan macaroni and cheese is rich and delicious as well as a side. The wait staff are terrific, the atmosphere is fun, and if you go during the dinner hour expect at least a little wait. But so worth it.
