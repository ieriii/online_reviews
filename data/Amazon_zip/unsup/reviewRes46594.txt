My husband and I had one of those LEYE gift certificates for $25 that you get free when you buy $100 at the holidays, and we just came across again when we were deciding where to have dinner a couple weekends ago. We were going to be near RJ Grunts doing a few errands and thought we'd give it a shot. Everyone raves about the salad bar. Me, I'm not bothering with a salad at a place known for bugers. I thought my bacon cheeseburger was great (sizeable, too- I left about 1/3)! My husband got the Tuna Melt. Oh, shoot....Lent.....yeah, too late. Already ordered the burger :) He enjoyed his meal, but the highlight was the milkshake at the end. Mmmm. The waiter split it in two glasses, much to my hubby's dismay :) Definitely try a shake!  Small bar area, but you can get a drink while you wait for a table. $8 valet.
