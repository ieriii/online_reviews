after hearing so much about the patio at piccolo sogno, i had high expectations and prepared myself to be disappointed. but when i arrived, i found that it really was as beautiful and nice as everyone says. the ambience is perfect especially for a romantic evening. there is nice lighting and the greenery makes it feel super cozy... not like you're in the middle of a bunch of concrete and warehouses. on to the food... the moment i arrived i smelled truffles so i decided to order a stracci dish with asparagus, mushrooms and truffle oil. it was delicious and seriously rich... i had to take half of it home. my husband had a gnocchi dish with tomatoes and basil. the gnocchi itself was perfect but we didn't love the sauce. oh and we started with the fried zucchini blossoms. i've usually had these with goat cheese, but they made them with mozzarella and they tasted like a really good mozzarella stick. they have a great wine list. we ordered a really reasonably priced prosecco that was great. we had good service but i heard the people next to us having some issues with not getting their wine, etc. the place was super-busy so i'm not surprised that they had a couple of hiccups. piccolo sogno is perfect for a special occasion or if you're just feeling like dining al fresco. however, it's tough to get reservations in the summer so you'll need to plan in advance. good to eat: fried zucchini blossoms and stracci dish (these probably change seasonally though)
