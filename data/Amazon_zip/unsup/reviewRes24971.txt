Wow. That pretty much sums it up for me. This was such an unexpected place for us to begin our Saturday evening, but turned out to be a great choice. The byob made it even cheaper than it already was, and the portions are huge! We lugged in a few six-packs, and were delighted when they put down our names on the list, and then switched the store sign to 'Closed'. Last ones in! (and eventually out, as it turns out). The vibe is relaxed and the music festive. We started with some guac and ceviche, and once the entrees arrived, wondered if we should have. The flavors combinations are fantastic, and everyone was too busy chomping to speak for the next few minutes. I got the veggie burrito, with both mushrooms and spinach, and it was outrageously good. Didn't come close to finishing it, but whatever. My friends settled for various other winners on the menu. Service was friendly, and we left happy and full. Yummy!
