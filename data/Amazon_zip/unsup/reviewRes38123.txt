You like pizza? Wait, I mean do you LOVE pizza!? Are you the sort who will burn the top of your mouth just to get the permanent sensation of succulent cheese with mild Italian spices for the rest of the evening? Are the type of person who can go through a whole pizza by yourself, but take forever to do as to savor every tasty bite? And finally, do you like to eat the remaining cheese off either the take away box or patter it is served on as it is the best part? Well, then, my friend, this is the place for you. It is a bit seedy, dark and the dcor has much be said about old time style, but put that aside, my friend and sit at a ratted booth and get yourself a pizza. Oh, not just any pizza, but a deep dish, cheesy and sauce covered slice where the flavor can be registered from space! Ok, here is the skinny: Ever full sodas and drinks Buckets of inexpensive beer Near transportation, Water tower and great shopping And of course deep steaming dish pizza So I have to tell you, my friend, that is not a thing wrong with Giordan's Pizza except that there is not one in San Francisco. Oh ya, one more thing, Uno's blows unsavory chunks and their dough is frozen and artificially raised. Bla!
