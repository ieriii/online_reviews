i have a huge secret and personal story that involves this place and is too personal to share on the internet. There are maybe 2 people on this planet that know this story, its true, sad and life changing and all I can say is that it sort of ended with a meal here and if my life were a movie it would've ended here with a slow fade out as the music bed volume would inversely crescendo. its amazing how many touching moments begin and end with food. is this some kind of metaphor for how we try to feed our souls with the remnants of other beasts not fast enough to escape the butcher's knives? probably not, but it really is a deep story. good meat and potatoes. eat here. forget the ketchup. ...i know, i know..but if you really wanted some info, there's 175 other reviews to tell you the same thing;p
