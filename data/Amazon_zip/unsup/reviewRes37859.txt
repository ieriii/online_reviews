HMMM maybe I'm just not a fan of stuffed pizza anymore.. but I remember it being better when I had this a few years ago. There just wasn't much flavor, it all just tasted like cheese and crust.. even though we had broccoli, sausage, and jalapenos on it. They were stingy on the toppings and the jalapenos were the pickled kind, so it was sour and not spicy ew. That said, it is CHOCK FULL OF CHEESE. CHEESE ON CHEESE ON CHEESE. Which is nice, because I dig cheese. Except I didn't order a cheese pizza. PS a small stuffed probably feeds 3-4 people, not 1-2. Wait's like maybe 30 mins.. def preorder that pizza if you wanna eat anytime soon.
