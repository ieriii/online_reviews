My husband treated me to Fogo de Chao for my birthday. If you are a meat lover - look no farther. It is the absolutely best place in the entire city of Chicago. The staff working together to serve each of the tables, you get full attention.The way they serve their meat is unique. The meat is fresh and is many to choose from. Great food, expenxive - but it is well worth the occasional visit. You won't be disappointed. All the good comes with a high price tag :-)
