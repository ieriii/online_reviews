can you say grand ghetto cafe...this is the place where people who dont go out to eat often think is a fancy meal....this place is garbo...if you are into no specialties and awful service cause the place seats 1000 people than this is your place to be...thats not a knock on the wait staff but the restaurant is way too big for its own good... heres why it gets 2 stars instead of 1...the views are pretty awesome from the restaurant...and the dessert menu is pretty good..you have to order it with your dinner or lunch though..because its made to order... heres why it gets 2 stars instead of 5...the food is bad...the menu is like 40 pages..it has every option in the world on it..and then they get mad when you dont know what you want...the wait is unreal for this place..not only do you wait downstairs for 45 minutes for not good food..but then they call your name and you go up this ridiculous escalator to only wait again for another 10 minutes you want my recommendation...if you are into garbo food...at least go to cheesecake factory in hancock..same owners..same food..less crowded
