Ok I've been in my new hood 2 & 1/2 years so it's about time I give props to Cafe 28! They have DELICIOUS food & it isn't too pricey for the quality. Everything comes out fresh & the jalepeno mashed potatoes are to die for! I even frequent for lunch because their chopped salad is a good size and the garlic dressing is delicious. Also if you are like me & hate to give Starbucks your money their Cuban coffee will give you a great jolt and it's only $2. p.s. Great patio if it ever warms up!
