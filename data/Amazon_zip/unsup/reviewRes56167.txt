The food is good here, but I worked at this restaurant for a significant amount of time (over 40 hours a week for 5 months). The owner did not pay us our full salaries. He often hires girls without green cards so he can take advantage of them. He hopes the girls that work there will be too scared to question him and knows they have little legal discourse. When I finally demanded the $1300 in back pay he owed me, Bell fired me. He harrasses and steals from his employees and I genuinely hope you will not patronize this restaurant. Yes, the food is tasty, but as for basic human rights-supporting this restaurant is supporting a man who takes extreme advantage of his employees and pads his pocket with their hard earned wages. Please don't help a dishonest and thieving man make money on the backs of those he considers weaker than himself.
