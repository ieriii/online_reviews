Bridgeport has needed a spot like this for years. Great, organic, food with a latin theme. Good coffee, excellent loose leaf tea, friendly servers and above all else, delicious food. It's a bit small, which means there is a wait, but the wait is worth it.Coffee: A bit on the weak side for my taste (my taste being Turkish coffee), but well flavored and not old.Tea: A very tasty, loose leaf black.Nanadict: A great take on eggs benedict. Tha papusas are an excellent substitute for english muffins and the home fries were some of the best I've ever had.Stuffed French Toast: Delicious, marscarpone and agave nectar stuffed french toast. Beautifully fork tender.
