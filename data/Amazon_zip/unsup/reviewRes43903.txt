Haven't been there lately. But we tried this place, with a friend's recommendation, a few months back. It was on a weekday night. The place was fairly empty (about 4-5 tables worth of customer at the time). Guess what! They directed us to the bar to wait for an open table. An opened table? Nearly half the restaurant was opened!  To make matters worse. They left us at the bar for a full 20-min. A waiter roams by here. Another waiter roams here. We asked if we can be seated, and they keep telling us soon. Soon? There are opened tables. How much sooner an soon be? We eventually left the restaurant, since obviously no one from the restaurant cared or wanted our business. It's a shame. I still can't figure out from this day whether it was because they didn't like the way we look, didn't think we can afford the food, had too much money and didn't care for new addition to their customer list. or just plainly despised us for no apparent reasons.  We vowed never to go back. We've never had anything remotely closed to this ever happened to us. I lived in NYC for a number of years, and something like this never happened to me. It's a shame. Because we go by River North all the time. It's too bad that they didn't care for our "repeat" business potential.  Shame on Kinzie Chop House. Beware!
