Great stuff ... I was this place on travel channel on a couple of their shows .... So good! I enjoyed it a lot. The best part is the unique game hotdogs, these are hotdogs you probably won't find anywhere else, everything from kangaroo to rattlesnake hotdogs. I myself had the kangaroo, when i was there, and boy was it worth the wait. Doug, himself, was there and greated me with a warm welcome, just like he did on the tv! TRY THE FRIES!!!!! So if you are in the mood for something out of the ordinary, DEFINATELY GO HERE!!!
