I'm sorry but I'm not a fan of this place. I do not like the style of pizza that they serve in Naples. I like more cheese and I don't like my crust to be burnt. Seriously, when you get your pizza, the bottom of it and the top of the crust is just black and I hate that. We had the fried zucchini and that was okay but I really did hate my Margherita pizza. I would have rather went to Pizza Hut over this place because at least they don't burn your crust there. It seems like a nice place to go and have some wine and appetizers and chat with your friends though. It is just not my style of pizza that I like to eat. I'm sure I would like to go again sometime and just try to see if the pizza if any better but I doubt it because my friend's pizza was burnt too. I guess it just depends on what kind of pizza you like if you would want to go here. I like more of a thicker crust pizza with more cheese so this is not a good place for me to go if I'm wanting really good filling pizza. Now if you like really thin crust that is burnt with big air bubbles in the crust sometimes and not a lot of sauce or cheese then this is the place for you to go. I suspect people from Naples probably think of pizza as more of an appetizer and maybe that is why it is so light. Pizza was not invented in Italy though, it was invented in New York by Italian Americans, so I think we do it better over here than they do in Europe. I was shocked though when I watched The Girls Next Door a long time ago and they said they liked the Olive Garden's food more than what they were getting in Italy. I would like to go over there and see what I think too, but I do know I don't like their pizza. They do have a nice little selection of desserts though and I maybe would want to try some of their wines sometime but I'm just not sure if I want to have burnt pizza placed in front of me again. Plus I thought the service that night was pretty slow and it really agitated me because I wanted to leave sooner.
