After much anticipation, I finally had the opportunity to dine at Graham Elliott last night and it exceeded my expectations. For a Monday night, it wasn't completely empty, but enough people that it was lively without being too loud. I went for the husband's birthday with a party of 4. Between us we ordered 4 appetizers, 4 main courses and 2 deserts. The portion sizes are small(er) than other places, but I left feeling content and not disgustingly full. The good thing about being with a group was that we shared and were able to taste a whole bunch of food. The husband really wanted the mac n cheese, but alas, that was on their winter menu. The summer menu will come out late May / early June per our waitress. Given everything I tasted, if I was to go back I would order: - Pea bisque - Beef carpaccio (or maybe the sashimi) - Wagyu beef - Halibut - Chocolate We were also able to get a tour of the kitchen since it was a slow night which was a real treat - all you have to do is ask. What a neat experience, can't wait to go back!
