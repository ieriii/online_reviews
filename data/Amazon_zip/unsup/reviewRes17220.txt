Loooove it! The buffet is great. The food is a bit americanized but still very yummy. We've taken tons of clients here for lunch and never been disappointed. The naan is so so good, and the chicken makhani is lovely and smooth. The mutter paneer is delectable - MAN I love that cheese! The gulab jamon is excellent. I could eat a hundred of those little suckers. It's a beautifully decorated place, and the service is quietly obsequious, which I love. My only complaint would be the price - it's pretty high for lunch or takeout.
