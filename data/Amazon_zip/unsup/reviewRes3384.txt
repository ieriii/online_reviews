Your above average wing joint. The wings are big. they were super fried and covered in their sauce. They were tasty. So what... I am giving 3 stars based on my meal of wings, crappy over-priced white rice (should be free) and mediocre store bought kimchee (also should be free). I am Korean and I am kind of embarrassed that people think crisp somehow represents Korean food. I saw the bibimbop they serve and it looks bush-league. Where's the stone bowl?! The burnt rice at the bottom is the best part!! If you want above average wings go to crisp. If you want authentic Korean food, you be brave and you go to a restaurant that has a staff that hardly speaks English (cho sun ok). You'll probably even spend the same amount. Crisp.....ya it's lakeview but it's so NOT Korean.
