as a chitown visitor, i ended up grabbing eats from two of rick's places within two hours of each other. hell, i walked off most of my cool meals around the city so there was no guilt. my flight was departing that evening so after enjoying frontera fresco eats (the line was nothing compared to other days an employee told me) while sitting on the river walk taking it all in one more time, what could be more perfect to end my chitown trip? JET TO XOCO BABY!  i didn't realize how close i was to n. clark...then when i peeked into the large window showcasing yummy tarts being made, it was over. but when i saw the sign that said "no take out", i was indecisive...should i try to sit or skip it & hang here next time...DO IT BABY!  cool to see rick there & the staff is super nice & so efficient... unfortunately, i couldn't do a sandwich having had a few things from fresco & carrying a macy's bag full of rick's eats (oinker) so i opted for chips & guac/window tart/shortbread cookie. the people sitting next to me on the stools were savoring their sandwiches & i knew this was the thing to get next time. you will love the window tart & shortbread cookie that satisfies any sweet tooth. mission accomplished...i DID IT BABY!  i heart xoco...
