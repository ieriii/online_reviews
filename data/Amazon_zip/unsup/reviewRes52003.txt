I stopped by last week for my fix of Chicago pizza and it was great. The pizza was stuffed like I've never seen before. It takes about 45 minutes for the pizza to come out of the oven, so I ordered some buffalo wings and a salad to hold me off. The buffalo wings were pretty good too. The waiter was super attentive and brought us everything we needed.
