This place was very nice. For Brazilian steakhouses I usually go to Brazzaz which was good, but when I stepped into de Brazil the ambiance was amazing. The appetizer selection was dope containing about 50 selections, and the meat that was served was deliciously seasoned every last piece of it. I couldn't believe this place has been here the whole time I've been in Chicago and this was my first time going. The service was also just as amazing, in that the manager came out to our table seeing I was stuffed like a pig and my plate was empty, and had the servers come serve me and my date any meats we wanted the most. Overall good eating and I will be back there very soon!!!
