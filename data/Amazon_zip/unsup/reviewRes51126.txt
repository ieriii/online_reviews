I've only been here for brunch, but Wishbone has never let me down yet. It's great for a savory, Southern breakfast. Every omelette or scramble I've had has been delicious, and the biscuits and grits are wonderful. I've had bad experiences with biscuits & gravy before but if i'm going to give it another try in the future, you bet it'll be at Wishbone. I need to come back here and try their non-brunch options sometime too.
