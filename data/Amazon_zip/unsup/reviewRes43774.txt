This one is really hard to rate. The ambience is pretty darn cute and the food is good, however, the service kind of sucks. I do not like the way they seat you/take your food orders. You wait in a line, order your food and then sit down. It is confusing and rushed. I did enjoy my chilaquiles very much though, but i highly doubt they are healthy in any way. and parking blows over here.
