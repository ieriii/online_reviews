I dined at RJ Grunts after the Zoo Lights and it was great! We had a party of 11, which is really big for such a small restaurant, so we put our name in and then wandered through the lights. About an hour later they were able to fit us at two separate tables, which was fine since we had an adult table and kids table. Everyone loved their food and the portions are HUGE so come hungry! They also have a fantastic salad bar, I am not usually one for ordering salads at restaurants, but it looked too good to resist! Service was great, food was great, and atmosphere is fun for the family!
