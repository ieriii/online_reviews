This is probably one of the best bars anywhere. I would have given it five stars, but the service was a bit slow, and the level of pretense, which I normally relish when I come here, almost outdid the cocktails the last time. The Violet Hour is chock full of people who have rich parents who are paying for grad school, others who inherited a fortune, as well as a few purists who love the delicious cocktails.... all adding to the fun. Try to go when you can avoid the long waits (not at 9 or 10 p.m. on Friday). Once inside, the decor will leave you expecting Harry Potter to come flying out of the bathroom on a broomstick. I have not seen him yet, but don't want to rule it out. After you settle in, provided that you can get a decent seat in the main room or at the bar (the back room is more of a chore because it is not as comfy or private), you will be in for an enjoyable night of creative drinks. Violet Hour is not an Irish Pub or the local Hooters. If you prefer those kind of places, you may want to try somewhere else.
