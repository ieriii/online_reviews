The stretch of North Clark Street in Andersonville is becoming a better and better place to eat, with the hearty but uninteresting swedish meatballs of yesteryear and phoned-in Italian now competing with a new brand of dining experience that caters to the neighborhood's increasingly well-heeled and culinarily-attuned residents. Anteprima's substantial menu of regional Italian dishes literally ups the ante. Homemade pastas-including pappardelle with a boar ragu and orecchiette with housemade sausage-abound and are available in half portions, which makes an appropriate starter for mains like whole roasted bronzino, chianti-braised pork, and "brick-grilled" cornish hen. Rotating specials have been known to include killer sformatos, proprietary headcheese, and more. With a restaurant as consistently popular as this one, service occasionally falters, but the wait for your food can be tempered by a creative cocktail, such as the Cyn-cyn. Hats off to any establishment that showcases Cynar, a bittersweet Italian aperitif made from artichokes that sports nifty Art Deco label and a reputation as an aphrodisiac.
