wanted to try other pizza restaurants and stumbled across this place... it's a decent size bar/pizza restaurant.. service was nice.. but there is couple of things i didn't like.. 1.. some of the tables is cramped pretty close to each other.. so close that it feels like we are sharing tables with other people lol... 2 .. the tables is kind of small once the pizza come out.. it took like 3/5 of the table up.. we ordered a red medium pizza since we saw how big the large was on the table next to us.. the medium was enough for 2 people to share.. we had chicken, sausage, and mushrooms for our toppings.. it was pretty good for being a thin crust.. there is a decent amount of toppings for you to choose from too and it all sounds pretty good.. the price is not bad either.. i will come back whenever i feel like eating thin crust pizza again!
