Absolutely love this place. When visiting a friend in Chicago he took me by this legendary bar and I am forever grateful. Before even entering you're greeted by a gorgeous green and gold lit shimmering sign welcoming you to another time. Don't walk away when you're met by a big biker type asking a $5 cover; pay it, its worth it just to get in the door.  Once inside you're transported back to 1920; there's a jazz trio on stage, a lovely red-tinged decor, and just the feel you're in somewhere special. As some have noted here there is a shortage of seating near the music, so go early if you want to grab a seat. If you're in Chicago and can, definitely put this spot on your list.
