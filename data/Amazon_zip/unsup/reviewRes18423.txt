On the night before Snowpocalypse, me and my husband met our two friends at the Bad Apple. I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, AND I FINALLY GOT MY CHANCE. We started off with the fried cheese curds, which were super stretchy and had a light breading. There was ranch dippin sauce with the curds, which sent it's deliciousness off the delicious charts. Huge beer list. It's it's own book. I went for what was on tap. I ordered the Algalash White beer and then the Mystic (oh man I could have that name wrong, sorry) beer for the second round. Both were good and reasonably priced...$4.50 - $6 a beer. Tasty too. I love beer. I ordered the Earthly as my main course, which is truffled goat cheese, spinach and thinly sliced portabella mushrooms on a super soft rosemary bun. OMG, HEAVEN. The goat cheese pleased me greatly. This was such a good sammich. I don't usually like portabella mushrooms (people don't know how to prepare them and they taste like dirt), but this was divine. I upgraded my fries to the TRUFFLE OIL setting, which was incredible. I was a little sad they didn't have any kind of dessert, but oh well. I would come back here if I was in the area, for sure.
