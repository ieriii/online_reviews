This is not somewhere you just go for dinner. Alinea offers an unforgettable experience that is more like going to a culinary theater.  Dinner was 4 hours long. We had 25 courses which included oxtail, halibut, cotton candy, and sorbet (like Dippin' Dots but in unique flavors like mango and cayenne pepper that melt in your mouth - they made you guess what the 7 different flavors were). All the dishes were presented in some unique apparatus. There was a bacon dish where the bacon hung like a hammock. There was a bubblegum flavored syrup that you drank out of a giant test tube. Each course had a unique twist that you can't find anywhere else.  The atmosphere and the service were also excellent. They also offer wine pairings with each course. The only downside is that it's really expensive (as other reviewers mentioned). The "tour" which is 25 courses is $225 (plus wine, tax, tip) while the "tasting" is 12 courses for $145. Also, I made the reservations two months in advance. We all thought it was worth it (and I'm not just saying that cause I feel stupid having spent that much on dinner!).
