La Pasadita....Papa Likes. If you are looking for some freaking serious Mexican food, this is the place to get it going. It's a little confusing when you get there, because there are 3 locations and although I'm not quite sure what the difference is between them, the one I went to was fantastico. I ordered the torta con carne asada y tres tacos and the food was slamming. The service was a little suspect, but my buddy assured me that I was there on an off day....so I'll let it slide this time La Pasadita. A great lunch spot and if you are trying to get some real deal Holyfield mexican food, this is the spot. Boom (in spanish)!
