After three attempted trips to Revolution, with only two successes, I feel comfortable that this place has enough of a following that they don't need my little Yelp to push business in the door. Regardless, it seems necessary to sing the praises of Revolution. Good beer selection, and the most adorable 5 ounce pours for $2, would be plenty to get me excited about the place, but having a killer menu doesn't hurt. Owned by the same veg-friendly folks who brought you Handlebar, Revolution's menu has enough delicious and creative vegetarian options that we aren't stuck eating (just) fried carbs and cheese. Meat-eaters have the lion's share of the menu, including some bacon popcorn thing that everyone seems really stoked about, but Revolution can easily accommodate anyone in your party. Speaking of your party, I'd recommend keeping it small and off-peak. That one attempt where we didn't make it to Revolution was about 8pm on a Friday and our party of three was quoted an hour and a half to two hours for a table. Even fighting through to the bar seemed like a pipe dream, so I was forced to try again another day. Even so, I've yet to be disappointed.
