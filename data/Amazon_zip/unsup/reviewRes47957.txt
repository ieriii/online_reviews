Was in town visiting Chicago with friends for a wedding. Brought a large party of people to this bar on Friday night on a recommendation from a friend. Got there early and was assured access to the roof top area. Long story short after being repeatedly lied to by the 'bouncer' regarding access to the roof we gave up. It was insulting as we've all come from big cities and are used to the game to get into a small area/rooftop bar but this was one big slap in the face- especially when our group was spending a considerable amount of money with this restaurant/bar. The manager- Vince Vecchio apologized and assured me that we would be taken care of right before leaving for the night. Nothing ever happened, we never saw the roof and the entire group including several locals were completely disenchanted and have no desire to go back. Horrible service and trying to be much more chic than they are. Don't waste your time or money.
