Worth the wait! Really delicious and well-made and presented Mexican sandwiches. I would expect no-less from Mr Bayless. LOTS of great meat and veg options for tortas to satisfy any palate, AND lots of dessert options too! The Mexican drinking chocolate is not-to-miss. It made my heart happy! We had a Rick Bayless sighting there too - he was cooking!
