So, while I clearly understand this place is no longer the "in" I will still let you all know what I think; as I'm sure there is a Sarah Jessica Parker, River north girl out there, who would love nothing more than to be whisked away here on a date with their douche bag trader bf. So, ladies, before you put on the La Mer, hold the phone. you get two stars because the ambiance is nice, however borderline a bit trying to hard to be sterile. Second, the popcorn was probably the favorite part of the meal. You do have a nice wine list. The food, however, good lord. The spousal unit and I decided to enjoy one of their tasting menu's. I think it was the 5 course. When they say tasting, they certainly are not lying. I think my salad might have been two bites total. The Cesar was decent, however my romaine could have been a bit more crunchy. The soup had zero flavor going on, whatsoever. The skate monk was decent, would have preferred more of that. My chicken at home in parchment paper is better than the chicken I consumed. Dessert, not memorable.  I would comeback for drinks because of the aesthetic, but I would never in my life spend $100 bucks for dinner on a random weeknight. There are SO many better places in the city for that price bracket. Sorry SJP's...go somewhere else! and wear spanx....
