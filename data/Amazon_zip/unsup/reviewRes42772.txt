I really, really liked my experience at Gilt. I went with a few friends for dinner and we all loved the food, and the service was fantastic. It's a small space and dimly lit, good place for a date without it being snobby. The menu was short and sweet, with a lot of familiar and other daring options. Starters: Bone Marrow- the dish looked intimidating upon arrival, but it was luxurious and hearty. Surprisingly mild and perfect slathered on the crusty bread. Burratta and Heirloom tomatoes- Fresh and light. Very clean and the tomatoes couldn't be sweeter. Foie Gras and mustard- Perfectly seasoned, foie gras done right. Too bad they don't give you a lid with the jar it comes it, and not to mention a super generous amount of it! Entree: Pork meatballs with polenta- omg, seriously! It's just so good. If you go with this one, have someone you're with split a pasta with you. It goes well with it. Orrecchiette with sage- delight! Truffle Pappardelle- Better than the Orrecchiette. Rabbit Buccatini- THE BEST! It's magically delicious. If you've been saying, I've been meaning to go there, JUST GO! The service is great, the atmosphere is chill, and the food is delightful. I loved it.
