Twas not bad, but I had higher expectations. I prefer Lou's and Pizano's to this place by a landslide. I got this to go and that does make a difference compared to a za that is hot off the press. If there was one near by, I would order again as it was good, but I wouldnt go out of my way to eat here. I prefered the thin crust to the pan. The carmelized cheese/crust was top notch, but the crust was also very think and spongy. Not bad.
