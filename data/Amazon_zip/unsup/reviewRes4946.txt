When you come to a city like Chicago, you'd like to end up with a dining experience that you can talk about with the folks back home. Sorry ... deep dish pizza is not noteworthy. The Purple Pig is. Wine, cheese ... and pig ... done with style. The trendy spot just off Michigan Avenue, offers shared tables, eclectic selections, and shoulder to shoulder crowds. It's fun. Here are three things I like about the Pig: 1) Different Food: I tried the Chorizo stuffed olives (yum) but passed on the pig's ear and the bone marrow spread. There are lots of other adventuresome ... but not that adventuresome ... treats too. Prosciutto Bread Balls anyone? 2) Good Different Food: For all the adventure built into the menu, you don't have to be an over the top gourmand to eat here. 3) Energy: When the crowd presses into the compact but airy space, you are imersed in the talking, laughing and general carrying on. Its exactly the way you'd cast a boisterous crowd in a big city restaurant find. The flip side of all this is that there is likely to be a wait unless you arrive early. At least the experience should be worth the wait.
