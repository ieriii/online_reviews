Another month, another oyster fest. This time the oysters were even better than last time! They were creamy, juicy and varied in size; no innuendos intended. Compliments to the person doing the shucking between 3-4; adductor muscles were completely removed from the shell 80% of the time. Slurping from the shell was so easy, a dash of lemon juice and champagne sauce and it was good to go. Signature champagne sauce came out frozen a few times, but that's alright. The ice nicely cooled my oysters. I hate to judge the next group of patrons next to me, after all its not me eating it but dang, they're pouring the sea water out! The very water the oysters used to survive, O-M-G. They must like it dry...yuck! I had 56 last time, this time I had 48 due to the increase in size. I look forward to next month, and a possible brunch.
