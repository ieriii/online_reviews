This is a perfect hotel to go to if you're in town for business.  That's exactly what took me there... I was attending a convention, right @ the McCormick Convention Center. Staying at this hotel was perfect. No need for a cab or even walk outside, just down the elevator, walk a couple of hallways and there I was.  View from the suite was the beautiful Chicago skyline. Everything is just a cab ride away (Michigan Ave. & Millennium Park were only 10 minutes away).  According to one of my coworkers, the hotel gym is awesome!  To eat (right at the hotel, other than room service), there's Forno, a small cafe, and there's also M/X restaurant & bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/). Rooms are big, comfy big beds, my only complaint would be the super small fridge for a 2 bedroom suite. We were obviously holding meetings there, we needed supplies (water, drinks, etc) to entertain our clients... But we made it work. Service was really good, but I do recommend you order room service with time, it takes about half an hour more than they say it will. They obviously have wireless service, shipping service, screens at their lobby with flight information, and computers to print boarding passes. Like I said, it's a great place to stay for business.
