Before I went to Chicago, I was hell bent on trying some real Chicago pizza. Giordano's was our first stop when we arrived late one Friday night and they turned us away :(. Our last day in Chicago my friend Cailyn N. decided we couldn't leave without trying real deep dish so we headed to Giordano's in the rain. We walked up to the less than friendly hostess who hastily took our name and snapped that it would be a 45 minute wait. Blahhh. I hope this was going to be worth the wait and the money. It wasn't. The food was less than memorable and just, too much. The pizza was super thick and didn't even taste good enough to justify the amount of food there was. I was honestly very disappointed. And then, a co-worker who lives in Chicago told me he's not a fan of the deep dish either. Instead they prefer the thin crust and flavors of New York City style pizza.
