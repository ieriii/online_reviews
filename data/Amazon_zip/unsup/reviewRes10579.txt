I drove pass this restaurant for many years and finally had dinner there one evening on a friends recommendation, glad I did. I had an excellent Dinner, the grill salmon, fried potatoes and asparagus with a glass of sparkling mascato and calamari as a appetizer. And the wait staff was very attentive and not over bearing which is a big plus in my book. Only negative, if you want to call it that is that they have there on parking lot but, valet park your car, I could of did that myself. Nevertheless I had a very enjoyable evening. I recommend you go there, you won't be disappointed.
