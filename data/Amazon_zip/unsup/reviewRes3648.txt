So I gave Crisp another try--AT Crisp. I decided to bump it up to 4 stars, as my Buddah Bowl was mega delicious. I can only imagine how good the wings and apps would be fresh out of the fryer. If you want something different, come to Crisp (especially if you just get done watching an episode of Anthony Bourdain and you are craving a big bowl of Asian deliciousness).
