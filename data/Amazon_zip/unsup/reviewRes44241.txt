Stoped in on a walk last night...the sign indicating they had French Macaroons lured me in. I ordered one of each of the flavors they had and have to say the flavors were incredibly rich and fabulous, unfortunately the texture did not deliver. This were much chewer and harder than the macaroons I've had in the past. I was looking for something that would basically melt in your mouth and this was not it. Would defiantly go back, but not for the macaroons....they had very cute iced cutout sugar cookies in 50+ designs!
