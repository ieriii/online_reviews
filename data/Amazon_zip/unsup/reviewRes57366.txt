This place clearly does not need another review. However, I'll add my two cents because this is the best sushi I've had in Chicago so far. I eat sushi everywhere I go, and I recognize that sushi is not the highlight of the restaurant scene in Chicago. But Coast is definitely an exception to that rule. I usually lean towards more sashimi than rolls because the fish is so good at Coast. They do, however, have their fair share of more complicated rolls. Both ends of the spectrum are great. After eating great sushi for several years, I'm rarely surprised. Coast surprised me. I always thought red tuna was always superior to white tuna. That was before I had some melt-in-your-mouth white tuna at Coast. Maybe I got lucky that day, but it's a testament to the quality of fish Coast gets, and probably the skill of the sushi chef too. Service = good.BYOB = good.Delivery service = good.All told.
