I lived above this place for a year and it was a favorite of mine, my family, and boyfriend. I still travel back to Lakeview to eat here. On the weekends, the wait can be over an hour but that is a testament to the quality of the food. I have been here for dinner before but I mostly come for brunch. I love Southern food (being from the south and all) and I was not disappointed. I have had the biscuits and gravy (great!), the cheese grits (awesome), but the best meal EVER is the Yankee Scrambled Eggs. The eggs are scrambled with cream cheese and green onions. You also get an amazing cornbread muffin (don't miss this!), bacon, and the most amazing house potatoes! i normally get it with an iced mocha with skim milk. My boyfriend has gotten the pancakes which he also liked but his favorite is also the Yankee Scrambled and a smoothie. He likes that the smoothies are made with orange juice instead of milk. Their menu is extensive so there is something for everyone. Their blood mary's are a house favorite and if you need the hair of the dog the next morning, this is the place for you! The seats at the bar are first come, first serve so hit up the bar area if you are over 21 and there are only two or three in the group. The food also comes out super quick and the staff is exceptionally awesome and attentive. I'm a fan for life! Wishbone was also rated one of the best 75 breakfast places in Chicago and it deserves it!
