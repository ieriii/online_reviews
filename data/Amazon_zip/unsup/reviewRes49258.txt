Not just your average cupcakes. The cupcakes they served at the Yelp Elite Squad event on Thursday were amazing. I had a pumpkin and a red velvet and the frosting literally melted in my mouth. I didn't try any of the tarts since the cupcakes were so big, but sounds like I should have based on the other reviews.
