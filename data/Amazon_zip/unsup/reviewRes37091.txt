I am one of those people who could spend hours browsing grocery stores. Even when I am on vacation, one of my favorite things to do is peruse the local grocery store even if I have no intention to buy something. Fox & Obel is the perfect place for that. Can I afford to do all my grocery shopping here? No. Can rich people? Yes. However, I do occasionally buy something a little out of the ordinary here. Like baked goods, some fancy candy bar, or yummy cheese. The real reason I am a frequent customer is for their cafe. They have delicious sandwiches, salads, and soups (and sweet treats if you have the room). The portions are very generous and the entire menu is affordable for a foodie type of place. My favorite is to come here for lunch during the week or if I am catching a movie at AMC 21. My favorites include: Pear Salad, Tomato Basil Soup, Roast Beef & Blue Brie, and Turkey, Cranberry & Brie. I would highly suggest picking up lunch in the cafe and roaming the aisles if you have some time to spare.
