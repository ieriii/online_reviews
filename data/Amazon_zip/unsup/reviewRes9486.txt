I won brunch. I had by far the best drink and brunch entree chosen of my group of four. We started with the bacon buns which contained big bacon chunks in the center. I drank an afternoon delight which was bubbly and fruity in a non-girly tasting way. I ate the croque madame which had a seriously cheesy, crispy shell as a bread substitute. All of the pork eaters at my table agreed that my sandwich was better than the lamb eggs benedict and the oatmeal. We had the waffle as a dessert- make sure you eat it quickly or otherwise the sauce will cause the waffle to become super soft, which isn't necessarily bad. We made reservations the previous week but still had a pretty late brunch so it wasn't crowded and we could be seated in the atrium area which let in all of the beautiful sunshine even though it was getting colder by the minute outside. We were well attended by our server. I'm surprised at other people's reviews since everyone at my table seemed to really be enjoying the food... maybe we were lucky? I'd try my luck here again for brunch anytime and I'd be even more excited to try dinner.
