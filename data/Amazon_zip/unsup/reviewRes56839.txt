Can't really write a review, since I haven't been to this place for 6 years, but last I remembered that it was an amazing experience. The food was amazing and the ambiance looked fresh and clean. I didn't get to sit at the bottom level, but the bar lounge upstairs was very trendy and cool. Made me feel like I was VIP.I need to go back. They need one here in So Cal.
