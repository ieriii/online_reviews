I haven't been this satisfied by an el cheapo meal in a long time. The chili shrimp, 2x Pork, Chili Fish, and Tony's Chicken were great and this is arguably the best Chinese meal in town for the price. One caveat: I love spicy food and this place tends to overdo it for those who aren't willing to wake up with a Delhi -Belly the next day. BYOB. I actually have gone to this place several days in a row when I get cravings. Bring your friends. They have a couple of lazy susan tables. 5 stars for price/quality ratio and BYOB.
