Mexican food is a staple of my diet. There's little else that comforts me more than the combination of beans and cheese. But this place doesn't really leave me all nice and cozy inside. The portions are average sized and the food tends to be on the blander side. The margaritas are huge and strong and half priced on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The atmosphere can be hit or miss and the chips elicit but a "meh" response. Not bad, not good, just there. You know the kind of place. At any rate, I think they might be trying too hard to be better than an average Mexican taquerria and in trying, they've lost their soul. Oh well, I'll be back for the 'ritas!
