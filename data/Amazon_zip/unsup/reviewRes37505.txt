if you're looking for a gourmet food market in the city, look no further than Fox & Obel. It's made up of a grocery and a cafe. Overall, Yes to the food market; so-so to the cafe. Everything at the market is of superb quality, and you'll likely find that obscure fruit you've read about in some foodie magazine. I love their bakery! Their french baguette is the best in the city, serious! And it's almost impossible to walk by the pastry area without drooling a little - the fruit tarts are amazing! and in the summer, the penna cotta with cassis is so good it's worth the workout just to have it. The ready-made food section has great selections of items, most are a bit too pricey, but they *are* quite tasty. The cafe is usually packed on the weekends for brunch, I'd say the brunch quality has dropped somewhat since a year or two ago. Try Truffled eggs Benedict - probably the tastiest of all the brunch items. Pass on the pancake and waffles. Also, skip the lobster club, for the money you pay, you shouldn't have to look around for the lobster bits!
