The long lines and anticipation of a great meal are worth it. This place has great staples and out of this world specials. While you are there definitely get an order of the duck fat fries, they're really good. On an additional note, Doug and his crew provide excellent customer service. My only gripe is that the place is pretty small and this definitely isn't on the top of my list for ambience. Still, it's eclectic and you may not notice because you'll be enjoying your food too much.
