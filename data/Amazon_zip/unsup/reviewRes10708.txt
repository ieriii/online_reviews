I'm not a fan of waiting in a packed bar for long periods of time, but Piece is packed for a reason. Luckily, I was in the company of rather tall and lively English friends sharing pints of particularly hoppy beverages. The hoppier the better for our dear Dr. Ox and Trapper Tim, and $4 well drinks for the lady Charlie and me.  Piece is fun. I almost felt like I was back on a college campus (jeez, how old am I??) with boisterous booths and plenty of bustling energy. Our server was a stitch, jumping right in with our raucous table's fancies, never missing a beat. Great at suggesting bubblies that were less hoppy, too (once Trapper had enough of the hops). I wonder if our server's face hurt as much as mine did from the laughter.... The pizza was grand. Literally! We ordered mediums each of a spinach, tomato and goat cheese pizza, and a "manly" pizza that consisted of various meats, jalapenos and anchovies (gag -- no offense, dudes!). They were gi-normous! We had to make sure those were medium pizzas, which indeed they were. Yummy, crackly crust. Mmmm. And plenty to take home for a good ol' American breakfast! ;) I hear there is live band karaoke at Piece, too. Shall we go back and have a sing? Go grab a piece of the pie at Piece. You won't be sorry.
