this is a great place to take a date, have a girls lunch, entertain someone from out of town. the inside is clean and bright. the hummus and dill rice are delicious and so were the pomengrante wings. the wings are good, but very messy and i felt awkward eating them in a restaraunt with white cloth napkins and stark white tablecloths. i would recommend getting them for carryout so you can get wing sauce all over your face in the privacy of your own home. overall, good food and a safe bet for entertaining some friends or family.
