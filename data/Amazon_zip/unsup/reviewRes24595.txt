This place isn't really a hidden gem since everyone I know loves it and comes as often as they can. Judging by the high number of yelp reviews it is safe to assume the secret is out. Still, I love this place and think it offers some of the best ethnic food in Chicago. Amazing service, unique menu offerings and low prices make it a definite must. The casados are really great and of course the shakes are ridiculous (particularly the avena or guanabana flavors). It is cash only and can get a bit crowded on the weekends so beware. Perfect for large groups though since it is BYOB and highly condusive to sharing / eating family style.
