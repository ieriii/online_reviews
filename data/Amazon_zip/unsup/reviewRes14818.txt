When we went to Revolution, we lived right around the corner. It was so packed for so long it took us forever to get there! It is a great spot for Logan Square, I love when new restaurants open up here. The food was awesome, the decor is also really cool. The beer is good, I am no beer connoisseur so I can't really offer specifics on that:) It was REALLY loud though, that is one drawback. I am not sure if it is the acoustics of the place or what, but oh well. I will definitely go back, the food is really different compared to most bar type places, definitely a step up! They did a great job with this place!
