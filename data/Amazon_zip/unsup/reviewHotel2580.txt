I was not impressed with this bar. I thought the the decor was a little cheesy. Interesting artwork of the nude women, but I don't see how it compliments the rest of the decor. Our server was rather pushy... she literally came back to us about every five minutes. It was a little too night club-ish for me. Lacks any sophistication and is trying a little too hard to be posh. I don't think I will be going back.
