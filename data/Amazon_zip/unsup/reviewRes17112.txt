I don't get Violet Hour's appeal really. I would give it 2.5 stars if I really could. It's a cute atmosphere for an intimate night with a few friends, but it was too segmented for me. You sit in these huge chairs that do create a nice conversation area for whomever you came with, but you have no interaction with anyone else in the bar. I also wasn't a huge fan of the drink selection either though they were accommodating and made me a drink not on their list. All and all, it's just a little too pretentious for me with the fancy drink list, fragmented seating, long lines, expensive drinks and unmarked door. For me this place won't become a regular spot. I would prefer going to almost any other lounge, it would definitely save some $$ too!
