Wilde bar & restaurant is a nice addition to the broadway/east lakeview area. The interior is really cozy, and even has a fireplace surrounded by armchairs.  What I really love about this place is their food and the fact that they serve late night food on the weekends. My friends and I had dinner and our fat selves ordered more food - the hot wings and fries - around midnight. The fries were so-so, a little soggy, but the wings were hot and meaty! The other time I went, I had the burger (which was pretty damn good -- I would say it's as good as the burgers at Select Cut Steakhouse), and my hubs had the fish and chips. OMG - the fish and chips here were the best I've ever had!! It was fried to perfection, with enough beer in the batter, filled with generous portions of fish! So yummy. They have a fairly extensive wine list, featuring the sauvignon blanc from one of my fav. wineries (organic too!) in Napa, Frog's Leap. They also have Stella & Fat Tire on tap, which is always a plus. The downside is that they don't take reservations on the weekends, and it's extremely hard to get a table on Thurs nights ( at least when I went).  Overall, I love this much-needed bar/gastropub to the area, and I can't wait to go back (unless I have to wait 1+ hours for a table). ************EDIT************** March 21, 2008 Went back for lunch, had the corned beef & cabbage, and chicken & curry, and it really validated my appreciation for this bar AND irish food! The flavors for each entree were so distinct and flavorful -- with scallions, taters, butternut squash, almonds, golden raisins in my chicken curry (READ: chicken wasn't thick, rubbery), and the corned beef had this peppercorn-type white sauce, which was so good. I can't wait to try the chicken pot pie & mac n cheese next time! ******EDIT AGAIN They started saving brunch at Wilde, and they open up their front doors for patio seating!! The brunch is good priced, and they even have brunch favs including french toast and eggs! They also have good coffee, and a mean bread pudding. I absolutely heart Wilde.
