I love Calo, great big portion size, nice selection of food and good service for a cheap price. We take all our friends when they visit, and all have been thoroughly impressed. We like to go mid week as the salad and soups aren't as special as we'd like although they do come as a free extra! Definately worth a visit , especially for the Ribs!
