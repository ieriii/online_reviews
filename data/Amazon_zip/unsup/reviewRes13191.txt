Great beer. Great food. Great Service. I only went to have a beer but ended up having the bacon fat popcorn - amazing. Popcorn with a bit of bacon flavor, topped off with bacon and slivers of cheese. Amazing. I also recommend the chocolate bread pudding with home-made caramel. All of the beers I tried were wonderful.
