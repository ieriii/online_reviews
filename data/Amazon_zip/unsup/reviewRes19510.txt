Oh Coast, how I have a love hate relationship with you.  LOVE: Ambiance. BYOB. Date nights - you can actually hear each other and have a conversation! Girls Nights - some wine, some sushi. Some more wine, some more sushi.. totally acceptable! Funky, friendly wait staff. Delicious, consistent, quality, fresh sushi!!! White Dragon Roll - crunchy tempura shrimp, soft filling, creamy drizzle Spicy Sweet Potato Roll - tastes like thanksgiving sweet potato casserole with brown sugar... yum Classic California - you can't ever go wrong here Jalapeo Popper - little kick to go with your meal! HATE: I am seriously obsessed and have to have it at least every 5 days. So good that my girls and I legitimately have email chains about it. While it isn't ridiculously expensive once in a while, its the most expensive delivery/take out meal I've had. If only I loved Potbelly as much as Coast I could buy a new pair of heels every month! Hands down my first go-to restaurant for out of towners. Or girls nights. Or date nights. :)
