Won't be going back to this place. Ambiance is okay, nothing to write home about. That wasn't the deal breaker though. Went there with my wife and we ordered a reasonable number of tapas plates for two. Well, not only was the service extremely slow, but it turns out that we were waiting for our last 2 dishes forever. By the time I spoke to our waitress about it, she goes to investigate and comes back telling me that the order was never put in. She said if we wanted to wait, they would prepare it but it would take another 20 minutes. Well by that time, I was totally ready to get out of there. Perhaps I would've thought differently if the food was good, but it wasn't even that, not to mention the exorbitant prices. Never again.
