As a meat lover, I don't think it's fair to review the food I had. I didn't really like my Seitan Sausage, weird biscuits, or dark brown and hard to chew pancakes. But what do I know. Being objective to the fact that this stuff probably tasted like cardboard to me because I like things that have died, I'm going to tell you about the one really good thing I had there. A sip of my friends cookie dough milkshake. Wow, wow, wow, wow. Worth the six bucks in my opinion.
