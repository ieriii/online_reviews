I love Garcia's. -- went here for dine-in for the first time today, but have ordered takeout many times before. The Ffee chips with 2 varieties of salsa kicks butt. The burritos suazo (with cheese) is enough for two meals! The tostadas are great too. A little pricier but the steak in the burritos is good. Big portions, Other Mexican restaurants may have little better taste but for large good tasting portions Garcia's can not be beat. They've left things out of my orders a few times, and I discover this only when I get home, not wanting to go back and fix things, I settle. But that's why they get three stars.
