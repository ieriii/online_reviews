Everyone says this place is very romantic, which it would be if it weren't always packed (therefore noisy). With all the tables jammed in there, I found it impossible to navigate the restaurant without tripping over someone or something. I can see what the hype is about, but I can't imagine paying full price for the experience (we went during Restaurant Week). Everything was tasty, so no complaints there, and the service was great, but I feel sorry for the poor suckers who pay full price.
