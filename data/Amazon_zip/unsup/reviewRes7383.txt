Mi piace MOLTO Sapori Trattoria! Tutti i piati erano buonissimi - Li ho mangiato due volte! Ogni volta il cibo era fantastico!! This place was a surprise and a secret I never knew about. The service is excellent and the food is truly exceptional and fresh - I would rate it a 9.5 out of 10 for American Italian food. Went there last for my Birthday and really liked how they personalized the menu's with my name - that was great! I've had their Egplant Parmigiana, l'insalata mista (mixed salad) and Pasta with seafood - all were perfect and the Salad was one of the best I've had in Chicago in a long time. Didn't have the Pizza but it looked good as it passed our table. Bravissimo Sapori for a consistent meal, great service and fairly priced. The dining room is lively and it was always a great time. The only thing I found comical was that I started to speak Italian to the owner, but I don't think he speaks or understands Italian, so I canned it quickly. I don't care, he is a great Chef and puts out one hell of a spread. I highly reccomend this restaurant to anyone local or from out of town. You will NOT be disappointed. A presto! Michele
