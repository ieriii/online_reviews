So I had what I thought was an ingenious idea and decided to check this out during NATO Monday since I had the opportunity to work from home. Apparently hundreds of other people employed in the loop worked from home that day had the same damn idea, so we still had to wait over an hour during lunch time. I admit I hated the fact that I looked to be apart apart of the sheepish Chicago ant-mentality of shamelessly waiting in long lines for trendy basic food spot, but I wasn't disappointed when we finally got a seat. The dogs were amazing. Even more impressive was the fact that the fries were great, when normally spots like this skimp on their quality. And Doug was cool as hell, you can tell he definitely cares about his customers through his interaction. My homie wanted 3 dogs but was slightly short, Doug just told him to give him whatever he had. He also suggested I get the smaller drink rather than the large in order to save money since there were free refills. Doug, you made a fan out of me. But don't expect me to come out on a Saturday. No way in hell.
