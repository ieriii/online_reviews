Totally different place. I am told it is to resemble a speak-easy and I have no idea what they looked like. But there is a 10-ft wooden door to open with a painting of birds on it. Then you walk through two thick, blue curtained doorways , even taller than the door. It is really dim in there and the first thing I noticed was a white dresser to the right with the host. The big open square space has really intimate seating with the same color blue as the curtains for high backed chairs and a little white table. The bar is very large and has everything you need for their complex drink menu. We had a booth along the wall, somewhat enclosed with curtains again. Two candles on the table and a glass bottle of water with little glasses to go with it.  There is a lot of stuff on the drink menu and EVERYTHING sounds good, but I don't think they are all good. I first had the Pimms Cup because I watch Boardwalk Empire and they talked about it in an episode. It was delicious!  I tried the Jimmy Roosevelt. Too much bitters for me so the server actually offered to swap me out! That is rare to come by. I told her it was ok several times but she insisted and brought me another Pimms Cup.  The other thing that is great about here is the music. They were playing 90's alternative very softly, bands like Pavement. I didn't know who it was and I asked the server and she checked for me. Very nice girl! I also love the doors to the bathrooms, on my way there I was surprised to see even more tables and another bar in the middle room, and I believe there is a back room as well. We went on a Monday night so we had no wait, by the way. I give it 4.5 stars!
