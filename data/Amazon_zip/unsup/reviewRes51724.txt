This will be a review for Garcia's margaritas and decor. My girlfriend, a margarita enthusiast, ordered the classic frozen lime. I thought it was similar to slurping some of our slushy gray snow residue.  My mango margarita was more of a double-edged sword. I can't gripe when a drink is served with too much of the happy sauce. You'd think the tendency would be to skimp on that stuff. Maybe it was Garcia's plan to get me shnickered. Anyway, it was yellow and orange, so there must've been some mango in there, somewhere. They were proudly airing a live ultimate fighting event. So, if you like your menudo with a side of double armed suplex, then this is your spot. Overall, I did like the decor. It was warm and friendly.  It is conveniently located near my favorite lodging facility, a little-known attraction in Lincoln Square.
