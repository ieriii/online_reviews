This review is for the cafe only*. Had heard decent things about the food here, and I was in a sammie mood, so I ordered the chicken panini, which came with french fries. The fries were tasty, but it's kind of hard to mess up frenchies. Tasty was the grilled panini bread, but the sammie overall was skimpy on chicken. AND the inside of the sammie wasn't even warm! Uh, isn't that the point of a panini? Disappointing! There's $10 down the drain. Manfriend's mushroom pasta with added chicken was bland and overpriced for the offering too ($16). Cold mushrooms + warm pasta = what? Temperature confusion. *On a side note, I do want to come back to check out the plethora of grocery items and cupcakes/brownies/goodies from the bakery! There's a lot for your eyes to look at.
