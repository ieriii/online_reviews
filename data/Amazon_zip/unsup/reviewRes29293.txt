I definitely get what people are saying about the service here - it's not always an A+, certainly, but on a pass/fail scale, most nights I'd give a passing grade. Very good food, fairly fast seating even on a busy weekend night AND, when it's just packed, I love that we can leave a phone number and walk to the never-crowded bar next door to sit and relax and have a drink while we wait, and they call about 10 minutes before we'll be seated so we can pay our tab/finish our drinks and head back to the restaurant. It's a favorite BYOB spot (bonus: no corkage fee!) among our friends.
