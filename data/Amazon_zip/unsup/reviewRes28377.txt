My girlfriend and I have been here at least 5 times now. It's our "favorite" because we can both always agree on the food, the atmosphere, and leave at least a little drunk. The foiellipops are bizarre and excellent at the same time. The beef stroganoff is as good a twist on a beef dish as I've seen yet. I had the fried chicken the other night and the rootbeer bbq sauce is really worth a try. While I may be among the dissenting here, I love anchovies and their caeser actually has a great anchovy on top. Unless you're in the north of Spain, that's quite a feat. Also, try the lamb, and you can't go wrong with the scallops. The dessert menu is slightly behind Perennial's creativity, but this place is a precursor to going out on the town, not going home to pass out, so skip it.
