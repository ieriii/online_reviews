Background: I brought my family in for dinner on a Tuesday evening without reservations. We were told it was a 2 hour wait but we were seated after 30 minutes. I would recommend getting reservations as I think we were just really lucky.   Food: We ordered the ceviche tasting which had 3 types of ceviche, all different enough from one another that the sampler was a good choice. The shrimp and calamari one was my favorite but my 8 yr old daugher liked the tuna with mango. All of them were very fresh and delicious. For our main course we had the Tuesday special which was goat, which I was interested to try since its not common in the US. I was not disappointed. The preparation made me wonder why more people don't eat goat! We also got the duck in mole, which my wife really liked, and I thought as far as mole's go it was very good. For dessert we had an upside-down pear cake, which was very interesting. The hot chocolate was amazing too. Service: Our server was on top of it for the whole experience and made sure we knew how each dish was prepared. Ambiance: I felt like our table was stuck in the middle of everything, which was kind of weird. Overall: I would go back again in a heartbeat. It was authentic Mexican food in all places Chicago.
