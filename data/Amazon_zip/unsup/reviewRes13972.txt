Went here with some friends after breakfast on Roscoe at Kitschn. Of course I was stuffed from breakfast but I wanted to have cocktails with my friends. Ordered the 8$ Bloody Mary, wow! Spicy!!! This drink was a meal in itself. There was a stick of celery, a carrot stick, a slice of honey dew melon and a skewer with about 4 or 5 delicious shrimp! YUMMY!!!! I ordered the crab cake appetizer, delicious. My friend ordered a catfish special that came with soup and salad. The portion for the entree was huge. Will definitely go back for more bloody Mary's!
