Have been going on and off for more than 25 years!!! I can honestly say it was the last time. Kirby is rude, demening and wanted to be stroked a $50 for a table because we were walk ins while more than 6 tables were empty..."If you want to help me I can help you". We waited for an hour and a half watching the tables lay empty. Was twice told we would be seated in "a couple of miniutes"...Kirby was proud to say over and over how he's worked there for 14 years. He hasn't learned much in that time. The place has gotten dirtier and slower, and downright snooty...Take your business elsewhere.
