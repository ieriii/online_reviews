Even though the yelp specials ad states there are $5 cocktails no such beast exists. We asked the server about it who called over the manager. I showed him the ad which stated there were $5 cocktails. He said the restaurant doesn't write the ads and they would email yelp to get it taken down, however it's still up there. I'm not a sucker for the ol' bait and switch and don't u be either.
