Lets start with three stars. -1 for the incredibly cramped parking area. +1 because its not their fault we came for dinner on a Saturday at 7pm. +1 for the amazing smell you encounter when you step through the door. -1 for finding out you have to order two meats in order to grill at the table. -1 for the kinda mean waitress that we had seat us. +2 for when another (sweet) waitress unloaded about 2 dozen bowls of panchan (at the time I had no idea what these were, think tapas but with pickled things and salads) on the table. +1 for the (sweet) waitress thanking us profusely when we helped her make room for all the curious bowls. +1 for the joy of daring your friends to eat some of this stuff. I enjoyed it, but I can pretty much stomach anything. Anyways, they were all pretty tame (veggies) although some very spicy. +1 for literally getting our food less than 2 minutes after ordering -1 for the mean waitress returning and impatiently putting the rest of the meat on the grill. +1 for the nice waitress providing constant refills of water. -3 for the incredibly intense diarrhea i had hours after eating here.    Incredibly. Intense. Diarrhea. DON'T, I repeat DON'T use the tongs you put the meat on the grill with to take off the cooked meat. Use your chopsticks for that. Trust me. In conclusion, if my math is right this place gets 4 stars. The food is tasty and fun, though the service can be spotty It does seem however there are a few more nice waitresses than angry ones. And don't forget about the tongs. Please don't forget about the tongs. Your butt will thank me.
