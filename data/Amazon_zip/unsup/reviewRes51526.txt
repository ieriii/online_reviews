Since moving away from a Chipotle I've needed a new replacement "Chipotle Thursdays" in my arsenal. I quickly found that Garcia's could do the trick. Their enchiladas are drowning in some pretty good sauce and their $5 burrito surprised me. That al pastor had such a great flavor - nicely browned on the grill and yummy. So, I decided that the Garcia's burrito would suffice as my go-to quick burrito - just add in some cheese. Lately (and I mean within the last two months) it seems like my burrito is sopped up with grease and that meat - it's just nowhere near the same as it was. It's like longer strips of pork and has no grill-heated and browned yumminess that it used to have. I'm not sure what happened but I want my old burrito back! So, burrito Thursday has gone un-burritoed for a while now. Maybe I'll give Garcia's another try soon and hope it's back to what it was. On a side note, that burrito is gigantic. I cut that baby in half when I get home and I save the other half for a delish lunch the next day. Through the magic of some microwaving and some toaster oven action, you can get that burrito tasty again and it hits the spot.
