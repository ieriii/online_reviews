I didn't know saturday had a morning, atleast not since the days of the great 80's saturday morning cartoons. My friends dragged me out of bed hella early to come check this place out. I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes out of curiosity as well as the hash browns - which the waitress asked if I wanted cheese on them - hell yes! - The pancakes were divine, the vanilla cream ontop was the perfect compliment - I would come here again for those alone. The hash browns were perfectly seasoned and covered in the right amount of real cheese. This place is well worth waking up early on a saturday (or waiting in line if you get there later!)
