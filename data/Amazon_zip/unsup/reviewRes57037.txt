Piece has my favorite pizza in the city, their margherita pizza with fresh basil, and their chocolate dessert pizza are amazing! The pizza always seems like it is made with fresh ingredients and is never too greasy, I love the texture of the thin crust here too. It is a great atmosphere for watching a sports game, and the beers brewed in house are a nice change from what you find at every other bar. I am a big fan of their wheat beer in particular.
