We went here on a Friday. Yes the wait is long, but the cocktails make it worth it. Step out of your comfort zone when ordering cocktails, all the whiskey and bourbon drinks were pretty damn tasty. 5 stars for the cocktails, 3 stars for the food. I'm vegetarian though, so my perspective is skewed. My meat eating friends thought the food was awesome.
