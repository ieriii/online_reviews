A friend and I checked out this place over the weekend and overall enjoyed it a lot.  The good: The huevos rancheros was so yum! Our fave dish. The english muffin sandwich was quite good as well. Loved the ambience of the place and the servers were wearing pjs! The bad: Their biscuits and gravy with duck confit wasn't bad but was a bit salty plus we wished the biscuits were fluffier and light instead of it being so dense. Also, if I knew that the small orange juice was really that small (looked like a glorifed shot glass), I would have saved my money since it cost almost $5.
