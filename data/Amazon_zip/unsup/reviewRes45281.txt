I really want to enjoy this restaurant. It's very quaint and has wonderful potential in a great location. I tried it about a year ago and while I enjoyed the sliced steak entree, my friend was completely disappointed with his pasta choice. So after a year, last night we decided to give it another try at my request. This time, it was me that came away completely disappointed. I agree with everyone's comments about the service - it was simply poor and completely lacking - we even dined late so they were not that busy by the time we sat down to eat. This time, I tried the pasta and it was just bad. I had the orecchiette pasta with spicy house made lamb. I've had a similar dish at some of my other favorite italian joints that I've really enjoyed but the execution on this was terrible. Heavy, starchy pasta, greasy sausage with no real sauce or broth and a few dandelion weeds. It was hands down the worst pasta dish I've ever had in a restaurant before and I eat out a LOT. There are so many GREAT restaurants in the city and even in Andersonville that I do really wonder why Anteprima seems to be busy all the time? Maybe I made a bad menu choice - but two strikes and I'm done.
