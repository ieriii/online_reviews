This place has a great atmosphere on a weekend! It was packed at 10:15 on Saturday. They have great drinks and wine list as well as many beers for selection. The food I had was good as well. The fries were great and I could not get enough of them! I also had their home made pretzel which was tasty. The only thing is that there was no sign on the door so I was not sure if the place I was entering was longman and Eagle.
