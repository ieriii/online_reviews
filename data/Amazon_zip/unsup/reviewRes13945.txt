Revolution Brewery is as good as it gets as far as microbreweries are concerned. The decor is hip, the service is great, and the food is excellent. Had some lunch there over the weekend and ordered the popcorn cooked in bacon fat with pecorino cheese and sage for the table. That was probably one of the best things I've ever tasted. Who ever came up with this recipe should win some sort of award!! I also ordered the Moroccan chicken salad which was ultra satisfying and delicious! It had grilled chicken, apricots, spinach, couscous, pistaccios, and a curry vinaigrette. Seriously the best salad I've had in a while. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals as well as their drinks - Their pale ale was especially yummy!! Wish I had another couple of days in the city because I'd probably try and convince my husband to take me back there before we headed home.
