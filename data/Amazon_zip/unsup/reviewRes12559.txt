Went there Tuesday nite and it was as good as ever! Cafe 28 has that hard to find combination of wonderful food and gracious service. Lisa was our server...she's the best. We Goat cheese appetizer...served with marinara and garlic toast...mmm! Coconut glazed shrimp with curried rice...sheer heaven Duck breast in a pasillo portabello sauce...I salivate just thinking about it Almond crusted halibut...exquisite To go with all this, came jalepeno mashed potatoes and green beans. We added some sweet potatoes and fried plantains. For the finale, we had warm chocolate pudding with hazlenut gelato and Cafe Cubano with whipped cream. To drink we had a wonderful tamprenillo. We had someone with us who had never been there before. She can't wait to go back. Cafe 28...thank you for being there!
