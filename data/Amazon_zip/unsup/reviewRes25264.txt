I went here with a group for a friend's going away party. We didn't want to spend time arguing about what to order, but we had one friend who doesn't eat pork or beef (and the rest of love red meat), so we hesitated getting the chef's choice. The waiter assured us that the chef would accomadate and, indeed, for every red meat dish that they brought out, they brought my friend his own fish or vegetarian dish. While it was more than we typically spend, we got so much food that we all felt that it was an excellent deal (and soooo delicious). The space was fun and fancy (but not formal). The sangria was unique and tasty. Definately worth a repeat visit.
