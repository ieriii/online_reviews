Being a fan of middle eastern cuisine I decided to give this place a try. I went with a group of 4 people on a Saturday night around 8pm. As soon as we arrived, we were seated within 5 minutes. The great thing was that they have an attached parking lot (which was convenient given the snow). However, there is tons of street parking around as well. The one thing about this place that struck me initially is that it is in the middle of no where. As soon as you sit down, the waiter brought us pita and home made feta cheese (which was creamy and delicious). The ambiance was nice but not necessarily upscale. The menu was very large and caters to different tastes. The meats include lamb, chicken, beef, fish, and cornish hen. There is a wide selection for vegetarians as well. We ordered 2 appetizers, both of which were delicious. The subtle spices are very authentic but not overwhelming for the average diner. The entrees were well sized and delicious as well. No complaints whatsoever. The desserts however were lacking (no biggie as we were forcing these down after all the food we had previously). Expect to spend about 25-30 a person if you have drinks, appetizers, entree, and dessert. The entrees themselves are about 14 dollars. Overall, the service was great, the ambiance was ok, and the food was tasty. I like the fact that it's not too overcrowded and you can be seated quickly. The distance is less than desired from downtown but the abundance of parking is a plus. I would definitely come back.
