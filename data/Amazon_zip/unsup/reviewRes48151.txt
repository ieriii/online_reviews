If you are in the mood for pork, here is your place. We tried several dishes recommended by our waiter Seth, who took great pride in making solid suggestions to us. When we came in, we were seated immediately (unlike the party in front of us who were waiting on some people) and Seth greeted us like we were old friends. The food was not rushed (if you are expecting immediate service, its not your place- its more European, where you order a bunch of plates and they come as they come). You enjoy your drinks, the atmosphere, and of course food that is delicious. The ham chop was fabulous, the pork rinds were crunchy and the mussels (while not the biggest ones I've eaten) are in a sauce that is so good, you want to lick the bowl. That ham chop, though, oh my. Best I've ever had. It had a smoky bacon and ham taste that I could eat right now. Be careful. It's addicting.
