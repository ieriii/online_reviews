It was too beautiful last Sunday to stay inside so when it came down to getting a great meal with the great weather I couldn't wait to get a Filet at Ruth's Chris. It was probably at least my 10th time there and they have never disappointed me. I have toured nearly all the great restaurants in Chicago in the past 10 years and Ruth's Chris has the best Filet Mignon and the best shrimp (barbecue), PERIOD. The garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were perfect fits. And the fresh squeezed lemonade was the best lemonade ever. I can't wait to go again!
