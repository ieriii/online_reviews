I'm from Los Angeles so perhaps my expectations are unrealistically high... The good news: the staff is very helpful, the location is ideal and the rooms are decent. However! They nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING and I'm talking E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G! I'm surprised there's not a $2.00 fee to look out the window. They charge you $5.00 to watch last week's Saturday Night Live, a show that aired for FREE. The upcharges are obnoxious. I wouldn't stay here again - it's a total ripoff.
