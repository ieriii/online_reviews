I reviewed my reviews and can't believe I'd never reviewed this place. This is my favorite place to stay in Chicago.  It is absolutely stately. I feel like I'm staying with "history and elegance" every time I'm here. I get a nice corporate rate. You can't beat the location, so close to the El. The other reviews do a nice job of describing the beauty. Finally, please pay attention to this simple tip: Get your Hilton Honors number before you stay here and be sure you present it before you check in, everytime. The points add up quick in a high dollar place like this. Once you get Diamond status, you are comp'd to the Executive Level, where you get free breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres. You get your own elevator (down stairs) that goes express to the upper levels. The view of the lake is phenomenal from the breakfast room. This is a grande dame from another era, still breathing life into the Loop. Stay here once, regardless of the cost.
