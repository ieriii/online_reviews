I heard great reviews of this place from friends and figured I must give it a try. After my first bite, I couldn't wait for another... and another and another. Waiting in line is not a big deal because all you do is lose yourself in dreams of your next amazing hot dog. IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE YET, GET UP AND GO!
