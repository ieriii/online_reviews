Wow, what a pleasant surprise. We went for brunch and found that there was a large selection of Breakfast AND Lunch items. The restaurant itself seems a little conflicting as one of their big things is lots of CEREAL and the other is their SEAFOOD. Strange combination of things you do well. But regardless, had one of the best cobb salads I have ever had along with some absolutely delicious clam chowder. It was crowded but not too noisy. Service was friendly. It's not very big.
