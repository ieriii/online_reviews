This is one of our favorites. They have a pool which is great for the kids, all the rooms are suites with dividing doors to the living room which has the sofa bed, a tv in each of the 2 rooms. It is such a great location and can't beat the price for the service. You can walk everywhere or grab a taxi with their doorman to go anywhere. We have been back 3 times, and will go again. They have the American Girl doll package, if you have just one daughter is worth it. Having 4, we just go and buy what the girls choose. A fun trip!
