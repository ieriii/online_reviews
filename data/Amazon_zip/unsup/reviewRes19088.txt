I can honestly say I was beyond pleasantly surprised when we dined here. I saw some interesting concoctions on the menu, so I didn't know what to make of it. Well I am here to tell you, GO! The first thing that attracted me was the decor. It was very comfortable, yet eye catching with the interesting paintings. The lighting was great because it was intimate, but yet bright enough where you can see your food and the person/people you are with. NOW! Onto the food...we started with the pickle and olive salad. Well, I love pickles, and I love olives, so this was like heaven on earth. The topper on this dish was feta cheese...awesome. Who would have thought to make this combination? It was quite different, but worked very well...and was so yummy! We also had the Brie fondue...I could have eaten it with a spoon as soup instead of dipping it with bread. So great. It was nice and hot and went perfectly with the crostinis they served with it.  For an entree, we each got the Amish chicken. I would give this a 6. I mean, chicken is chicken. It had a nice flavor, but didn't even come close to the appetizers. The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and we never had an empty drink.  The only MINUS was the noise level. It is definitely not a place you can have an intimate quiet conversation, but it's a fun place you can go to with a group of people. I highly recommend this to anyone!
