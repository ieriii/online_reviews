This was my second visit to Mercat and I think my first was a bit better. The first time I had gone, I think my experience was better because I had a bigger budget to play with. My fiance and I were able to try ANYTHING we wanted- the second time, I went with a gal pal and we didn't have as much to spend- so we picked quite a few of the "traditional" tapas that were a little less expensive and fancy, and unfortunately, they tasted that way. The best things about BOTH meals- the bacon wrapped dates must be had, the complimentary brushetta (super moist) and the platter of 3 meats- all very good. For the rest of the small plates, I didn't find the portions matching up to the price. I will pay good money for good food, but most of the entrees were just- maybe a 7 out of 10, and probably $3-$5 more per plate than I considered fair for the plates. I will say that if you do have the ability to spend the extra money, the "fancier" plates definitely give you a better bang for your buck, taste wise. Props to our server- unfortunately I can't remember her name, but I was expecting service to be more snotty to go with the ambiance, and she was great. I'll be looking for a new tapas place.
