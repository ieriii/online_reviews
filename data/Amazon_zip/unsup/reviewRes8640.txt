Mmmmm, such good food!! IT never stops here. At first I was thinking "wow, it takes forever before they come around with the meat" I was eating each piece they gave me before they brought over more and then waiting, because they give you a small slice off of the large metal-rotisserie-thing-a-ma-bob at a time. It just starts out like that, but then it gets better and next thing you know, you're racing against the servers and trying to finish before they bring you more, but nope... it's just too much! You have to turn your coaster over to the red side for a break. You get a coaster and when it's on the green side the servers come around with more meat, but when its on red, they leave you alone.  It was a very cool atmosphere and the food was delicious! The salad bar was HUGE and it looked good, but I didn't come for salad, so I laid off. My favorite was the chicken wrapped in bacon! Mmmm... heart attack.
