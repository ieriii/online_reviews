1. Got to walk down the super shady one-way corridor to the secret back room, which was AWESOME. The back room was definitely where it's at... pretty much a big party. Keep that in mind though if you are looking for a quiet/romantic evening you would probably want to request a table up front. 2. Our party of 14 received excellent service! No problems splitting the bill 14-ways and the ability to accommodate large groups always gets a bonus star in my book. 3. Food was excellent, I think everyone at our table enjoyed their dish. I loved my "mar y tierra"=strip steak and a dozen tequila shrimp (on a skewer), served with rice, beans, and guac. DELISH! And reasonably priced at $15. 4. LEGIT margaritas. Everyone had about 3 rounds and we all got progressively louder and happier as the meal went on... The lime, mango, and strawberry flavors were all good. I would definitely go back on a Tuesday or Thursday for half-priced margaritas!
