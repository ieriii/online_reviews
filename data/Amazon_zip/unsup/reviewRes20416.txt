Best sushi in the city!!!! seriously!!!!! I go to Japonais and Samba but this place is the best. It is truly amazing what they do with all their menu items not just the sushi, which is remarkable! Even the Apps, entrees and deserts are amazing! I go at least once a week cause i need my fix and eating bad sushi is just unacceptable but i take a lot of newbies here and it will convert even the most close minded sushi hater! Plus BYOB!!!!
