This is my favorite place to have a great drink in the entire city. I am not talking about a beer with friends but a great drink. That is what these guys do, they take their drinks seriously. Want an unbelievable cocktail with house made bitters, fresh ingredients and a staff that is incredibly knowledgeable and friendly? Come here. This place isn't for everyone and that is the point. That is why they don't have a sign outside. You come here to enjoy yourself, have amazing drinks, listen to great music and not have to worry about someone taking Facebook photos of themselves on their camera phone. I like dive bars, Milwaukee St. bars and I even like going to the bars/clubs on Rush/Diversey and River North. When I want a serious drink in a relaxed place though I come here. If you want an average drink in a regular bar go somewhere else. This is not the place to come with a large group of people (i.e. 6 or more.) It is a great place to take a first date or when you are looking to impress a girl. But make sure the other person can appreciate a good cocktail/whiskey/etc. If you are bringing a girl here who regularly drinks cosmos, is just out of college, or wears Uggs with sweatpants and big sunglasses, the whole experience will be lost on her. Treat the guys working the door the right way and you will have the time of your life. The drink prices are very reasonable for the quality you get! The average price is $12 and for the same price at a club/bar you'd get a watered down version with crap ingredients made by someone who doesn't really know how to make the drink. The finger food is really good and the menu changes with the season, I wish they would leave the peanut butter/bacon/banana sandwiches alone though. Luckily there is some great late night food nearby.
