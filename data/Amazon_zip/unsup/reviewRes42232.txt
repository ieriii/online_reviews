Gilt bar offers great atmosphere - an effortless, timeless cool. I love the bare bulbs, the large candles, and the rustic tables. I like being in here. The cocktails taste fine - but the ones I had were weak! After three cocktails at 13 bucks each I better start feeling the effects of the alcohol - not so at Gilt. Foodwise it's been a mixed experience for me. The pasta is home made which is refreshing - but the dish I got was smothered in a pureed sausage sauce that had a gritty, sandy texture and bitter flavor - I had to stop after a few bites. It was disgusting. The fries just tasted like fries from any old restaurant - except they were all really short little stubs which was annoying. The salads that I've had have been great, and the Ham and Cheese Fondue was ok but nothing to write home about. There are much better places in this neighborhood to get cocktails, and I don't think I'd have the courage to eat here again after the awkward pasta experience. There is something to be said about the atmosphere at Gilt, but the food and drink were a disappointment overall.
