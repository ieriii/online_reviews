Great location, near the Western Brown line stop, fabulous pricing, beautiful decor, attentive and polite service. Excellent variety of food, but the tofu with white pepper sauce is so good, I might never try anything else! I love this place and it's on my "frequent flyer" list. A great location for BYOB because there's a liquor store right next door. In an area of the city with "two Thai's to a block," this is my go-to.
