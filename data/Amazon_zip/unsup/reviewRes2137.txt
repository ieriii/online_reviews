Hot Doug's is an essential Chicago landmark, not to be missed unless you are a Vegan. There are limited Vegetarian options, but I am told the veggie dog is great. I take all of my friends and visitors to Hot Doug's whenever I can. I count the Rattlesnake dog with caramelized onions and sweet curry mustard I had there as one of the best eating experiences of my life. I have never been disappointed by anything I've ever ordered and was ecstatic when my wife and friends took me out to Hot Doug's for a birthday lunch - She even got me an awesome Hot dog t-shirt and buttons with images of all the types of meats and wild game you can get there. While the specialty dogs may initially seem a tad expensive for 'just a sausage'... they are so good, Doug could easily charge more... but he doesn't because he clearly likes what he does and loves his customers. It's really a bargain. Particularly in nice weather, there is likely to be a line, but it is well worth the wait and you are likely to meet fun and friendly people and once the doors open, things move along very well. It's worth it - Hot Doug's isn't just a meal, its an experience. And the staff there are fun and pleasant people who work with a quickness which must be seen to be believed. Be sure to drop a couple extra dollars in the tip jar at the counter and know that they deserve it. To top it all off, Doug is an exemplary local business owner who regularly supports the local community and nonprofit organizations. Hot Doug's earns and deserves your patronage.
