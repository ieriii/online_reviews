I grew up close to La Villa and it was our Friday night take-out dinner staple for about ten years. I have very warm and fuzzy feelings about this place. This is very dependable, consistent thin-crust pizza. The mostacholi and roast beef sandwich are also decent. Sadly, the garlic bread isn't as good as it used to be.
