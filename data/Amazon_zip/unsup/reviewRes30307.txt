No Taste. I am a vegetarian and have lived here awhile, really excited to try this place. I'm only giving them 2 stars (rather than just 1) because of the selection. There is a ton of vegetarian options that sound really good. Kinda makes you feel like you're somewhere... you're not. The staff seemed to consist mainly of tragically sullen waif boys. After about 15mins or so one of these vintage-Kate Moss wannabees finally came over and tragically gave us our glasses of luke warm water. Thanks! If you could just keep your 90s melancholy aura out of my water, that'd be great.  The food sucked. I got pineapple curry fried rice with raisins, snowpeas and tofu and it had no taste. It was hard to believe something that sounded so ... I don't know, TASTY could be so bland. Another person in my party got an asian dish of some sort and didn't eat 2/3 of it because it was so tasteless. Totally disappointed. I can't believe this place sucked so bad. BAD service, Bad Attitutes, Bad water, and Bad food? Can somebody tell me, does this place have something else going on. Do they really make their $$ filming art noir perfume commercials out back? seriously confused about what's so great.
