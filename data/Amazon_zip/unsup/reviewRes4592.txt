Bone marrow, turkey leg confit and milk braised pork shoulder w/ mashed potatoes. Yup, probably the most amount of meat I've had in one sitting. You will notice a lot of their dishes were inspired by an Italian, Mediterranean, and New Orleans flare which could be attributed to the chefs. Urban dining at it's best! All the dishes are meant to be shared so beware! They have a large communal table with high bar stools for larger parties. The space is kind of tight as I felt the frequent bump from employees and patrons trying to get to and from the kitchen. The bone marrow was very rich. We got 4 bones and luckily, there were 4 of us so we each got one. The turkey leg was cooked to perfection where the meat easily fell off the bone as we cut it it with the knife. All the flavors from the lentils, treviso, endive and agro dolce blended together nicely with a hit of sweetness. Without a doubt, the winning dish was the milk braised pork shoulder. It was almost like eating butter that melted in your mouth. I was a bit apprehensive. Pork braised in milk overnight? Is that sanitary? The creamy sauce gave the pork a curry-esque feel to it. Everything just melts in your mouth. It was amazing. My advice is to come right when they open to avoid a massive wait.
