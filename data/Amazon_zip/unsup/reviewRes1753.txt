O to the M to the G. Finally made it to this mecca of hot dog joints on a cold October morning. Showed up at 12pm on a Saturday (bad idea)...waited for 1.5 hours in shorts (just came from a run to lessen the absurd amount of calories I was about to devour). By the way, great crowd of people to wait in line with-friendly, hilarious & hungry. The group behind us brought a six pack of beer-very smart people...I'll be stealing that idea on my next Doug run. In my tummy!...ordered the Dave Kingman (Sante Fe chicken sausage-little bit of a kick to it!), the B.L.T. (who knew bacon sausage even existed?!), and a corndog. I loved the corndog-great breading & perfectly deep fried. (Can't beat it for $1.50!) The B.L.T. had the perfect mix of coleslaw & cherry tomatoes but I didn't really get that "bacony" taste. The duck fat fries were yummy...perfect ratio of crunch to soggy! Doug was even there to take our order!
