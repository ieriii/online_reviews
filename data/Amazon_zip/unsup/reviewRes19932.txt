Yep, I too bought in to the Bayless hype. But I am really really glad I did. We got some take-out here, and it was yummy. I got the short rib sandwich, rich, warming, and pretty tasty. My companion got the short rib soup (guess we went a little gaga for short ribs this night) which was SO GOOD. I think the soups are the thing here. I mean my sandwich was good, but no where near the level of the soup. And of course, since it was a chilly evening, I got the thick hot chocolate and churros, which reminded me of being in Barcelona. Basically like drinking a melted truffle.  Eggs and produce are locally sourced. It's a quick food type place, but there is a host to welcome you and to give you instructions on how things go if you should need them. As others have mentioned this is a smart tactic to keep things going smoothly.
