I LOVE THIS PLACE. The food is alway fresh and delicious..consistant Large portions , could be smaller and cut the price for less for one person too much so share. The whitefish is very good..well actually everything is good They seem to love pomagrate...pomagrate mushrooms were not my favorite but everything else is good. especially the hot kashkaabadam goon eggplant dish. service is very good and atmosphere teriffic not generally seated upon each other so little more intinate.
