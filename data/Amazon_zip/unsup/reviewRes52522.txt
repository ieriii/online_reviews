Will never come here again. Came here on a Friday night, had an 8:30 reservation and was not seated until 9:30. Walk-ins were seated ahead of us. We were offered no apologies and nothing for waiting. The manager kept talking me in circles and making my whole experience worse. Once we sat down the waiter made it a point to let us know 4 or 5 times that it wasn't his fault we had to wait. I understood it wasn't his fault and had no intention of blaming him. He just added to the frustration of the night. The food was fine but not worth the wait. There are too many Brazilian Steak Restaurants in the area to deal with this place. Save your money and go somewhere better.
