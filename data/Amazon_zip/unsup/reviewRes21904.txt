this is a staple restaurant for my church group of friends. their chips and salsa welcome your apetite. the mole sauce is fixed to scrumptiousness. their servers are always on top of things. i swear they have eyes on the back of their heads. one time i needed a napkin to wipe my hands and before i could even make eye contact with a server, he already had a napkin in my hand.
