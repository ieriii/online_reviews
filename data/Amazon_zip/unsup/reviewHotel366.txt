I've put off writing this review, only because I didn't want to admit that I actually stayed here, but I have, and I agree with what most everyone before me has said. Dumpy rooms, extremely slow elevators (although on my first trip down the elevator DID try to speed my trip up by coming to a complete stop and then dropping a floor or so), and uncomfortable bed/furniture. I'm not even sure it's worth staying here for the location, at least not if you're planning on evening activities. The lack of activity on this part of Michigan Avenue after dark makes it feel very unsafe and uncomfortable. The next time I'm in Chicago I'll cough up a bit more dough and stay in a slightly more upscale joint.
