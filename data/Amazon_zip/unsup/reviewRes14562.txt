After much hype and a one hour wait, which we naturally killed drinking beers as close to the bar as we could get (no seats left, argh), my friend and I sat down to dinner at Revolution Brewing Co. Atmosphere: This place was hoppin, lots of cool, young, attractive folks, and hip older folks too. Beer: Meh. I realize it's a new spot and they are still developing their beer menu, but that kind of seems like something they should have done before they opened. I'm not talking just about the limited selection, but the flavors of their brews are a bit flat , unimaginative, and, frankly, lack the wow factor. Food: I'm a vegetarian and ordered the Goat Cheese Croquette Salad ... it was okay .. good, but nothing special. The Tempeh Reuben sandwich, however, was excellent. Totally surprising, since I don't even like sauerkraut, but the clash of the rye, Russian dressing, cheese, and tempeh flavors, nestling around the sauerkraut is pretty near perfect. Also, the Garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes = amazing. So, though I went there expecting fine beer, decent food, and a fun atmosphere, I was met with yes a fun atmosphere (a bit frustrating if you don't like waiting but, I mean, just have a drink and all is forgiven), outstanding food, and unexceptional beer. Overall, it's okay. Expect to wait, expect okay beer, and awesome food, and you won't be disappointed.
