Great food for not a lot of cashdollars. Apologies for actually using that descriptor. Crisp does give you a lot of food so be hungry. They have a pretty good variety. I usually get a bbq bowl full of rice and veggies.  I like that you are encourage to mignle with fellow partons as you wait for you order. There isn't a ton of seating so I usually go with carry out.
