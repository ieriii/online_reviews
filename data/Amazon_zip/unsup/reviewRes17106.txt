Went for the lunch buffet. Friend had a Groupon. Still struck me as expensive. Compared to Chicago Curry house, where you can find a 20% neighborhood coupon, $16 for a lunch buffet seemed really expensive unless you're really hungry, considering: .The curries seemed much more watery (or maybe CCH is heavier?) .The chicken in the chicken tikka is nowhere as tender .The roast chicken they bring to the table is extremely dry .I had to be bothered to ask for more naan since they seem stingy and brought a 2 person serving for 4 people
