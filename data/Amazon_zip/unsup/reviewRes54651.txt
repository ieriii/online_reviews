As a favorite restaurant of my husband's and mine, we make it a point when we are traveling to Chicago (we live in the Twin Cities) to stop in and have the lobster bisque. My husband raves about the bisque to everyone and anyone he sees. It really is the best around. Minneapolis has nothing that even compares. For my husband's birthday, I wrote a letter to Shaw's asking if it were possible to ship some lobster bisque to St. Paul, MN. It has never been done before, but Nannetta Wade, from Shaw's, worked with the chef and made a test batch to see if it could be frozen and still keep it's fresh flavor. It worked. My husband was ecstatic and told me it was the best birthday gift ever. I've never had a restaurant go above and beyond like Shaw's did. Their customer service is supurb and I will continue to rave about Shaw's wherever I go! Their clam chowder is delicious, too!! As well as their oysters! I could go on and on about Shaw's. Very good ambience as well.
