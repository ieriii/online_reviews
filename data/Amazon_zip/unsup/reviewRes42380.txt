I love NY style pizza and Barnaby's, but his place does deep dish like an artist. A buttery, crispy crust, light-fluffy dough, hint of sweet in the fresh tomato sauce and real, gooey cheese. We've ordered their pizza for almost 7 years after our softball and football games and taken it to our local bar that doesn't serve food. We have never had a bad pizza from Art of Pizza. It took us almost 5 years to try their deep dish and it was a shame because it's just so good. AOP has been rated as the best in the city, which is legitimate depending how hungry you were when you rated, but this is consistently good pizza. They just expanded to double the size or more so it must be known.
