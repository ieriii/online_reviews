A very pleasant little outdoor bar area in the back let us start the evening with $3 bourbons and $2 PBRs, and there were tons more $3 whiskeys available inside. (Prices are similar to Char No. 4 in Brooklyn, my gold standard for a wide selection of cheap brown spirit.) The service was friendly and the room hopping, and the food quite good--though far from transcendent. We liked small plates better than the more "eh" wild boar sloppy joe. Next time, I may get drinks here and then try Lula, which keeps being recommended.
