The hubby and I went there yesterday (my first time) this places opens at 5 pm for dinner, we stand in line not a long wait to get inside only to be told they couldnt seat us till 5:30 if we wanted to eat inside it would be 5:45 . I asked if there was no one seated in the resturant (sic) then why such a long wait? I was told, "We don't seat everybody at the same time." R U F'ing Kidding me? So they sending everybody to the bar to wait?!?!?!? I truly hate that we recieved a gift certificate from there as a wedding present, I won't be using it!
