Ok, it's been 3 years since my last review of Garcia's.......and let's see....what has changed??? Um, just the interior.......which is was much needed! More spacious, nice bathrooms, looks great!  The chips n salsa are still the best......the steak tacos are still delicious as always!! I have been going ot Garcia's for years and still will continue! Like I said....no matter how much I drink.......there is always room for Garcia's! Nothing better than tacos at 2am!  So if ya strike out at the bar with the ladies.....no need to fear......Garcia's will cheer you up!!!!!
