Yelpers, thank you thank you for your recommendations. Purple Pig, thank you for being you. I did my research here before taking my family to lunch at The Purple Pig, so I knew just what to order for our table from the rave recommendations. I might be more adventurous to try other things next time, but for my first trip to The Purple Pig, we got: -Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette -Butternut Squash with Pumpkin Seeds, Brown Butter & Ricotta Salata  -Prosciutto Bread Balls -Whipped Feta with Cucumbers smear -Milk Braised Pork Shoulder -Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki (ALL of these were EXCELLENT) Without wanting to be redundant after all the other reviews, please know this list of options are a slam dunk (imo), and the only thing I would ask is that there be more bread along with the smear (they'll give it if you ask) and that the bread is not charred on the edges. The Chicken and the Pork Shoulder were my favorites of these items. We went on a Saturday at noon. There were four of us and there was no wait. After the items I mentioned above, we ordered two desserts: -The Iris (donut with ricotta cheese and chocolate inside) -Olive oil ice cream in a brioche The ice cream was too much like vanilla on french bread. The Iris on the other hand was To Die For!! We should have just gotten two of those. Please note that it was just us four girls, and that you may want to order more food for four hungry guys. Please also note that I wanted to be accommodating for everyone's tastes, so I did not go for any of the dishes that were more unusual (though I kept threatening my sister that I was going to order bone marrow and pig ears). Maybe next time. Everyone enjoyed the style of plate-sharing (which is what we do anyway). The service was excellent. And with the four of us only drinking water, no wine, our bill was only $57. Awesome. My family was very impressed with every aspect of this lunch. Success!!
