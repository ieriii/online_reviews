Great selection of different specialty hot dogs... I had a pork sausage style dog with sweet mustard and cherry goat cheese. Amazing. I also tried the duck fat fries which were great. Limited hours which stinks... we had to wait in line a good 30 - 45 minutes (20 of which were outside in the cold). Friendly service and great price. The don't serve alcohol... would have loved a cold beer to wash down my hot dog!
