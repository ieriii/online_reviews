The wait at this restaurant is always ridiculously long and filled with tourists. I ordered chili fish filet, spicy beef tendon, ma po tofu, and pea tips. The food was mediocre, but I am mostly outraged that I got ripped off on the garlic snow pea tips, which is one of the most expensive Chinese vegetables. At first the waitress told us that the restaurant did not have any left and then she came back and said they did have snow pea tips. Instead of bringing out snow pea tips, the chef served us baby snow pea SPROUTS, which you can find in a grocery store for like $2. Of course, they charged $12.95 for a heap of grass. I did not bother arguing over the dish since I brought guests with me. I am never coming back to this restaurant again.
