It was pretty difficult to get a reservation, but well worth the effort. It was easily the best meal of my life. I don't know what the people who write the negative reviews are talking about. The music was not too loud and the chefs were perfectly nice. I suspect that some people come to Schwa expecting something like Tru. If you want a stuffy, quiet, overpriced meal then don't go. But if you want an edgy, fun, pricey (but worth it) meal, then start trying to get a reservation right now.
