came here during my short trip in chicago back in April. It was awesome. Let's start with the truffle oil and parm cheese popcorn. dude, i'm usually not a fan of cold popcorn, but damn was that good.  I had the started out with the sweet bread..yummy. then moved on to the wagyu beef..yummy yummy. I'm not a big desserts guy, but i do have a soft spot for strawberry short cake, and what do you know, there it was on the menu, a deconstructed strawberry short cake. i never had anything deconstructed before. i'm usually the one doing the deconstructing...but it was yummy yummy yummy. overall, great place, good atmosphere, and excellent food.
