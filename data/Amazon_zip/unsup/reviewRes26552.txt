I pass by this place about every week, but just stopped in for the first time a few days ago (maybe I was still bitter from analyzing "If man will strike, strike through the mask" and other MD quotes as a high schooler). Now I wish that I would have gone here sooner! They don't skimp with the toppings, and I was a bit skeptical about the crust at first, but it was really good! The garlic bread was pretty good, as well. Definitely worth trying, if you haven't already!
