Wow, I can't believe I'm updating this again, and dropping more stars. A couple of nights ago we ordered a deep dish pizza for delivery. Things were bad from the start. The person who took our order didn't repeat it back to my husband. We ended up with a medium pizza, instead of the large we ordered. However, in their favor, they charged us the price of a medium. Things were even worse once we opened up the box. The pizza arrived within the 1 hour we were quoted. However, the pizza was stone cold, and it also looked like it had been dropped. The crust had fallen off many of the pieces, and some of the toppings had completely slid off the pizza. It was so cold, we had to cook it in the oven for about 12 minutes to get it to a good temperature. It was very bland, and basically we felt like the kitchen staff half-assed it. When I called to complain, the manager decided to only charge us half price, and put a credit back on our card.I hate to say it, but the inconsistency of Pequod's will definitely make me hesitate before I order from them again. We've now had several mediocre deep pizzas with a only few great ones sprinkled amongst the pizzas we've had delivered from Pequod's over the past year or so. Something has definitely changed, and not for the better.
