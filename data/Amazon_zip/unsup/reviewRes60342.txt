Stay away! I started my Yelp account just so I could post this review. My boyfriend and I decided to try a new place in our neighborhood & were really hoping this would be a good choice for sushi in walking distance. It's always packed, so we had hope. The maitre d' was very nice & we had a drink in their lovely bar while we waited for a table. The servers were friendly and prompt. We were in a good mood, so we splurged on a $50 bottle of Moet. The nigiri was promising, but when we got to our rolls they were mushy and somewhat tasteless. The place does not know how to make rice! While we were underwhelmed by the food, we were still having a decent time, but it was completely ruined by some little Asian man in heavy-rimmed glasses approaching our table shortly after we paid. He asked us to leave - he had people waiting and wanted the table. We were still finishing our champagne after dropping over $200 (including a very healthy tip)!!! I've never been so insulted or incensed by such poor customer service.There are so many better places to go in this city for sushi - trust me. I've seen review upon review about their terrible service. And the fact that their food is mediocre and overpriced ensures I will never return. For those of you who are just trying sushi and think this place is good, please keep looking!
