Great steak, service and ambiance. I have to admit that I've never been to the main dining room, prefering to stay in the piano bar area. It's more entertaining. I've been several times and enjoy the consistently well cooked meat and the sides. The salads and deserts are good too. Everything is top notch and consistent. Gibson's should take lessons!
