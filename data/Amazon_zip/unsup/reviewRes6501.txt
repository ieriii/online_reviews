This is on par with a Houston's, a step above Chili's chain. It's a grocery store though for wine, which is so sad. The crab cakes were pretty good, though heavy on the mayo. The onion bread was served cold, and uninspired. The bar is simple, not creative. I had a side of mushrooms as well, and it wish I could have my $6 back. Enjoy this if you're middle of the road seeking a middle of the road experience.
