Why is this place so overrated? Their pho is absolutely disgusting! If you want a prime pho experience, be patient and keep on looking in all the Viet Towns of the US of A (because I still am), or have one of your Vietnamese friend's mom cook you some (if you're that lucky). The broth is not cooked long enough, the noodles are slimy; no flavor whatsoever, and adding in the hot sauce and hoisin does NOT help. Their sweet red bean beverage is a disgrace, and makes pot look so shameful. The milkshake glass comes with frozen ice, a scoop of pot from a can, and milk. $3.50 for that? I don't think so. Their pho bowls used to be around $5, but increased due to their 'popularity.' I am still confused in how this place gained its positive reputation. Beats me. This place is crawling with only non-Vietnamese customers (kind of tells you how 'authentic' this place is). Don't get sucked in.
