Bad service, below average food, crowded, and zero soundproofing (about 105bB on Sat night!). I had the pasta w/shimp. It was fair. My husband had ravioli - Again fair. We shared a tomato salad which was three slices of tomato with shredded cheese on the top (like you get a Jewel) and a dash of fresh basil. To say it was simple would be an understatement.  We were there a couple years ago and swore we wouldn't be back. We decided to give it another shot... And THIS time we really mean it.... Will not be back.  This is Chicago!! Great Italian food is everywhere, w/ the service and ambiance to goo with it. Don't waste money at Anteprima.
