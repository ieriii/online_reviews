This place is great for lunch, and just far enough west of Milwaukee/Damen that you can find a parking space near the store on a Saturday afternoon. I like the chicken shawarma sandwich, but I ask them to leave off the Jerusalem salad. To me, those are two clashing flavors and textures. I get hummus on the sandwich instead. I also like their falafel sandwich, and their baba ghannouj, although I usually get that to go, as the sandwich is plenty large for my meal. Good luck finding a seat inside if you go at the usual lunchtime. They have outdoor seating in the warm-weather months, but otherwise the dining room is almost always full. Of course, that's the sign of a successful restaurant, and we can hardly hold that against them.
