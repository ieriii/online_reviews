I think I've reviewed everything up on Argyle by now...but hey, what can I say, great food for cheap! The bbq options are the best way to go, my faves are the roast duck and the soy chicken. Also love how the rice plates come with half a salted duck egg, brings me right back home :) I usually stick with the bbq or noodle/congee options, all of which are fab and usually under $6. Great place to go on Northside when Chinatown is just too far away.
