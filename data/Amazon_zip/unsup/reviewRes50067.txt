How anyone is giving this place five stars amazes me! My fiance has had this one on his list for over a year now for places to go and we decided to give it a shot. They just got a new spot across the street and while it was a nice looking little place, it was incredibly loud and amazingly had almost no one in it. We sat down at the table and were promptly served water and our bottle of wine was opened. They were out of the plantain appetizer we ordered because supposedly they weren't good enough to serve (although they were on our entrees??) and so he recommended the empanadas which you buy one at a time and were hardly worth the money seeing as they were basically only a fried rice ball. We seemed to wait forever for our appetizer, while we had to sit and stare at what looked like salsas (which I actually believe were steak accompaniments) without anything to eat it with. Neither of us were thrilled with our entrees either - which for a paella quoted at 40 min. came out in about 10 and because it was hot and I was hungry I ate it - Blake had strong feelings about it otherwise. All in all - if you want Argentinian style dining do Tango Sur - far far far superior to this disappointment.
