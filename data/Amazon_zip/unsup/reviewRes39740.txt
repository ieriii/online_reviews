Dolsot bibim bap at 3am: this is where you get it in Chicago, complete with the array of side dishes. The food is tasty, affordable, and available at almost all hours. The barbecue can cost over $15, but most of the other meals cost $10 or less. I've introduced several friends to Korean food here with a good experience each time. If you're taking a date for a Korean dinner at 6pm, perhaps you'll look elsewhere for elegant decor and a smiling wait staff. After a night of dancing, though, you can count on my lobby to head here.
