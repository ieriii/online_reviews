fogo 2 go is a pretty solid pizza choice- and in any other town, it would probably have a higher rating, but in chicago, where pizza is an art form, fogo 2 go is pretty a-ok. i've never had a bad pizza there, but i've never had a spectacular experience. there are some positives- their ingredients are fresh and i liked their tomato sauce, but nothing blew me away. last time i was there, i tried the quatro formaggio. maybe something simpler next time...it just felt excessive and god forbid i say it- too cheesy. i had a bite of my friend's pepperoni and it was tasty...maybe i'll go that route next time. overall, definitely several steps up from dominoes and a solid choice if you're in the neighborhood.
