We wound up here for an early dinner a bit by chance. Some friends had locked themselves out of their car, missed a play, and we were nearby so they invited us out for drinks.  There were so many awesome things about the Publican. I loved that the booths had doors so you felt a little more like you were in a private room with your friends. I think it was supposed to mirror a pig pen, but it was a really fun touch. Everyone tried a number of different beers, including a thick coffee brew that was odd and delicious. Our friends had ordered a flight of prosciutto before we arrived so we started with a little taste of that. As foodies, they went on to order sweet breads and other things I'd never tasted. All of it was good. I got a pasta dish that had squid ink pasta (black pasta - fun!) and prawns - very tasty. My husband ordered a cheese tray that as delicious too. And for dessert we had fancy waffles - I think I remember there being duck involved. Food coma city. Our waitress was a total doll too. I would recommend going early. We didn't have to wait for a table, but by the time we left the place was PACKED.
