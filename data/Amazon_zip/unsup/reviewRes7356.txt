A great pick if looking for a nicer sit down BBQ joint. The food was great, not outstanding. The best BBQ I've had in Chicago was Smoque. What's missing at Smoque however is the atmosphere. Our waiter John - amazing knowledge of the food and the chef and her passions. The bourbon mixed drinks refreshing but whoa powerful. We had the kobe beef and st. Louis ribs. I'm a pork ribs fan and they were delicious. The kobe a little dry but flavorful. Braised greens......who knew they could be so flavorful...I couldn't stop eating them. Had to pass on dessert, although if I had room the rhubarb cobbler looked amazing. No wait - made a reservation and we were seated immediately! Try it out
