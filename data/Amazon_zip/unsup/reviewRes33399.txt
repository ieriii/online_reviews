Just stopped by here to today because I didn't know what else to eat. I'm glad I stopped by hear because it's exactly what I needed. Just grabbed a falaffel and soup and boy did it go down good. Much quieter in the late afternoon and very cozy. As in my previous review I just want to emphasize that this place is cheap then cheap. You can get a nice filling meal for less then bucks and the food is great. I can't say anymore then that.
