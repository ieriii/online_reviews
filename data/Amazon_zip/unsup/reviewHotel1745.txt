As a positive the hotel itself is in a decent location, located in the financial district. Keep in mind that a lot of places roll the carpet up at 9pm because of this location. There is a bar next door to the hotel but it was not open on Sunday...or at least the Sunday I was there. The rooms are very small, the decor is nice and everything was very clean. They do not have a restaurant onsite but to offer limited room service. The rooms are equipped with stocked mini bar and snacks. Wifi is available as well. All and all a very decent stay especially suited for people who will be out exploring all day.
