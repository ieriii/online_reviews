Hello, I am writing a review of the Wilde restaurant. I went to the Wilde restaurant on Friday and it was okay. There was a line but it was not too long. I had a beer. The beer was a little too cold, but it tasted good. Way to go Wilde!We got a table that was small, but cozy. There was also a big menu. I don't know about Shepherds pie, but I did not see any shepherds! Ha ha. I had a burger, it was a tough burger. Janet had pasta--yuck! Garlic. But yum for the salads, delicious! Bacon and cheese, I guess are not a salad, but tasty!The bathroom towel paper zooms! I dried my hands.So the food was okay. Wilde restaurant is a very big place, dark and full of oak wood! There are books, Oscar Wilde wrote books, and a fireplace. No fire, though, spring is here! Ha. Janet liked the dessert, it was very full of apples, like a cobbler. Not named cobbler, though, but the same and yum! I guess we will go back maybe, because of the apples and the salad, but I don't know. Wilde restaurant, you are two stars. Maybe next time three!
