I would NEVER eat here again. My friend and I went for lunch one afternoon, and witnessed the most disgusting sight I have ever seen! As we were waiting on our food to arrive, I went to use the restroom, as I passed by where they serve the food, the bus boy was smashing a cockroach with the bottom of the bottle of disinfectant used to clean the tables!!!! Gross. We waited for our food ( we probably should have left) and when it arrived it was average. The crepe was overcooked and tough. The waitress was less than attentive, but i am not surprised considering the owner was shouting at her for answering the phone.. he was so rude to her, and we could tell the girl was visibly upset, not that it phased him!!Also, it was a very hot afternoon, so we asked the waitress if it would be possible to turn he air-con to a cooler temperature. We were then confronted by the owner, who told us that if we wanted that, we should leave! It amazes me how someone with that lack of customer service should be able to run a business. From this experience, i would never eat in either locations of Icosium Kafe, the food isn't good, the staff are treated bad and most importantly, they have cockroaches!!!I wish i could give Zero Stars to Icosium Kafe!!
