This is a pork, oysters and beer restaurant, and it does all three of them VERY well. I'm talking about very tasty slices of ham, a dozen oysters to choose from, and om nom nom so much beer. The interior makes me feel like I'm in a crowded eating hall/barn in Maine and it is a very good fit for the kind of food that they serve. My own negative thing to say was that we ordered trout once and because fish does not belong to the set of {pork, oysters, beer}, it wasn't very memorable. Stick to the rule of three.
