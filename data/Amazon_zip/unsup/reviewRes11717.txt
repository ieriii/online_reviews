the house-brewed beers are always cold and the pizza is always massive and tasty. you really cant go wrong with a visit to piece, well, unless its a weekend night and you want a table. i've been there when the wait was up to four hours. granted, you can always stand around and chug the microbrews till you don't care how hungry you are.  give piece a try...just plan on waiting or go early in the week to avoid the crowd. but go.  not hungry for pizza? (then again when are you not hungry for pizza?) stop in saturday nights for live band karaoke. its always a riot.
