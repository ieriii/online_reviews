A friend and I went here for Saturday brunch. I didn't know what time the place opened but we lucked out and got there at 10:15 AM, and turns out they open at 10:30. So we had to wait in line outside for 15 minutes but it turned out for the best because the line quickly got longer and we would have had a much longer wait had we not arrived so early. I had heard good things about Frontera and of course was familiar with Rick Bayless from TV. I sometimes suffer from an inability to properly manage my expectations, causing me to be disappointed in a place that was ok because I was expecting spectacular. Frontera, however, did not disappoint. The atmosphere was nice, a bit loud once the place got packed but not so loud that it hindered conversation. I ordered a meal that was basically scrambled eggs with gulf shrimp, avocado, etc. with black beans, and verde salsa. All of it was fantastic and the bottled hot sauce that sits on the table was also fantastic. I should have bought some to bring home with me.  My friend ordered the white corn pancakes. She liked them very much. I tried a bite of just the pancake without the topping or syrup and it was one of the best pancakes I've ever had.  I got the impression that I could have gotten a different thing off the menu each time and be happy with the choice. Everything looked so good. Def coming here again. My advice - get here early or late to avoid long waits.
