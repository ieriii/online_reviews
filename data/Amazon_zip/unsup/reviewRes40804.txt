Yes, another update. But me, eat pho somewhere else? Pho-get about it! (end bad punnage, I promise). So, the big news is that Tank invested in shiny new menus. Get ready to be more overwhelmed than ever, as the pho bible just got thicker - more color photos, more descriptions and seemingly more food options! If you come on a Saturday (as I did today), you'll probably encounter a short wait. Don't let the jam-packed eatery fool you as the longest wait I've ever encountered was ten minutes. I love that Tank's a restaurant that'll accept you just as you are - I arrived in yoga pants and a tee post-gym and not an eyelash was batted. God, it smells so delicious in here. And on that note, I'm now going down for a disco nap with this happy, full tummy. Tank for life!
