It has all been said already... but I love Frontera Grill! Hands down the best Mexican food I have ever had. We the the trio ceviche appetizer to start, which we liked but maybe because I had read so many rave reviews, it wasn't as mind blowing as I thought it would be. My boyfriend had the best dish of the night and it made the entire trip worth it... duck with mole sauce. WOW. That mole sauce is incredible. I had the wood grilled pork and that was delicious as well. And the black bean soup that came with it was amazing. Yum... I miss you already Chicago!
