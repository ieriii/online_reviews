I love this place! They had a small, but decent selection of beer on tap. With my yummy beer, I had their small vegetarian deep dish pizza. The pizza was about 23-24bucks-not cheap for a small pizza-but it fed three of us generously. The wait for my pizza took a bit long (about 45mins), but still, this place has the best Chicago style pizza I've ever had. So good in fact, I don't think i could have my local Zachery's again.
