I just had the best scallops ever. Just had dinner with two friends. Was able to park close by but there is valet parking. Mindy at the bar was friendly and attentive. I love to sit in the main seating area near the open kitchen. Not really a bad seat in the house though. Great atmosphere with a nice bar area and tables throughout. Wait staff was patient and helpful when I couldn't decide what to eat. Got really lucky at dinner though because I ordered the teriyaki salmon but got the scallops. They looked and smelled great though so despite the offer to correct my order I kept them. Outstanding. Perfectly lightly battered and pan seared over a bed of spinach with a light sauce made a delicious combination. I was too full to eat dessert but they sure looked great. I hear the key lime pie is great.
