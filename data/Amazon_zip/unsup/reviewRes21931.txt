rick bayless is pretty much a culinary genius as he has put a classy, new-age spin on mexican street fare. i'd give it 5 stars if i didn't find it a little overpriced for a restaurant with no waiter service. the churros are phenomenal! my friend and i split the pibil torta and an order of chips and guacamole. the habanero salsa on the pibil is mouth wateringly spicy--i couldn't get enough of it. when i went it was on a thursday night and i waited about 45 for a table, which isn't so bad considering the quality of the food (and the fact that it's a bayless restaurant). you've got to try the aztec hot chocolate.
