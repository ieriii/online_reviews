This has to be one of the most romantic spots in the city! My girlfriend and I have been here a few times and have always loved this place. I have to give it to the fondue entrepreneurs to have you cook your own food and pay the same price that you would normally pay in a restaurant. How genius!  I would recommend to get the Prince Geja's Combination which includes everything available on the menu like sea scallops, shrimp, beef tenderloin, lobster tail, and chicken. The wine selection here is pretty good but if you have a special bottle of wine you can bring it in but they will charge a corkage fee. One of the most decadent items that they have is the desert. You have to love the fruit dipped in melted chocolate! This place is definitely one to keep in mind to take your girl out for a romantic night.
