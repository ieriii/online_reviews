Not so impressed. The ambiance was casual yet sophisticated. They had outdoor seating and large communal tables and some individual tables inside. We had reservations for 2 and was a little disappointed that there was no individual table for the two of us inside. They seated us at the corner of a communal table. We asked to be seated outside since there was only table available outside. It was either that or an hour wait for an indoor seating... Ridiculous for someone with reservations. I suppose I need to call ahead and request an individual table. We were greeted by a really nice server. She was very patient & explained the menu thoroughly. Most of the food is served as small plates. So order plenty to share! Here are the highlights: Spicy pork rinds- great way to start a meal. Spicy, crispy, & cheesy. Pork belly- the best dish of the night Yellowtail-good but not mind blowing Leeks- you can pass Asparagus vinaigrette- excellent flavor Strawberry shortcake- good but I've had better Overall, pleasant dining experience but not very memorable. I guess I expected more from this popular establishment. One good thing about this place is the beer selection. If you love beer, this is the place.
