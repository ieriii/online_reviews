Damn to my niece for turning me on to Davanti. It's all I've been thinking about. I'm dreaming about the giant ravioli and the foccacia. My mind keeps wandering to the marscapone polenta with ragu. Everything was so darn good and probably just filled with tons of calories. They may have healthier options but we didn't have any. You better believe I'll be back.
