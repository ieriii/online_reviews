Two words. Meat Parade. I get the meat sweats after every visit and I keep coming back for more.  The first time i ate at Fogo de Chao, I laughed at the guy who said "when you have had enough meat, turn your coaster to red". 10 minutes later i was flipping it back to red because I had a meat pile that looked like a wartime slaughter on my plate. 3 plates later, I was hallucinating and shaking with the meat sweats. I was hooked! If you are one of the unlucky souls that cannot handle that much carnage, the salad bar is excellent as well.
