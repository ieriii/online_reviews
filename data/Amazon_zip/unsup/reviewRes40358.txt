I was first introduced to the late night Mexican phenomenon back in college after my first "night out." So I can appreciate a good burrito or a taco and enchilada after 2AM. But for almost 8 years living here in Chicago, I was unaware of what I like to call, "The Deeta," until about a year ago when I bought a book called, "Street and San Man's Guide to Cheap Eats in Chicago." A truly worthwhile purchase, if only for it's best burrito listing of La Pasa. Since then, I'll only go to Dita for my burritos and tacos. I never realized how much all the other ones I had been going to all over the city where almost exactly the same. Packed joints, all people trying to get the same weak steak burrito with sour cream, refried beans, some lettuce and tomato. Dude! The Dita hits home with serious steak, marinated in whatever they soak it in, cilantro and onions. You want sour cream and tomato - extra homeboy. Lettuce? There isn't any on the block (just kidding - you can get it at the restaurant version down the street if you want). Burrito's big and filled with meat - more meat than any other joint in town. And then I discovered the tacos with steamed beef! It's hard for me to not walk out of there with one burrito and like six of what I like to call, "Mexican Sliders." Why do I call 'em that? Because they go down that fast, they're so good! And if they had a Crave Case of 25, I'd put it down in one sitting. Good thing they don't. So it's a little dirty, so it closes at like 2 or 3. I don't care. They cook it up for this fool. After years of being tired of the same old burrito joint here in Chicago, I'm ashamed and proud to say that I finally discovered The Dita. I won't go anywhere else for that type of food. Gracias!
