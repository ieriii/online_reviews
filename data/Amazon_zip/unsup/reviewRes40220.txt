this place is great! i mean the food is so delicous and so juicy.there is 2 sections to the resturant. the sushi section and the regular food section. i suggest not to where fancy clothes unless u wanna smell like ribs or steak. i mean its cooked at ur table right infornt of u. i say its a true korean place.
