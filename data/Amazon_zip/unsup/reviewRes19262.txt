I moved to Lincoln Square a month ago and have eaten here 3 times since then. Twice with friends from out of town, and just this past Tuesday with friends in town. Great atmosphere, great food. If you want a good burger at an actual decent price, this is your place. The staff is almost always amazing/entertaining. I enjoy sitting in the front at the bar tables as opposed to the back room at the... what would you call them? normal tables? Let's go with that. Of the 3 burgers I tried (Black & Blue, The Frenchie, and The Slow Burn) the Slow Burn is hands down the best. If you like your meat a little pink, go with medium. I tried medium rare last night and it was pretty damn rare in the middle - learned my lesson. Their meat is hormone free, etc. etc. etc. for health nuts - oh and they have 2 veggie burger options for your veg friends. GREAT beer list too! 2 brothers is a personal fav. Have fun! OH... and I almost forgot - their truffle oil fries are insane. Get those... you won't be sorry.
