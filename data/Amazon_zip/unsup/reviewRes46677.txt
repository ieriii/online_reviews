You can see why Rich Melman became a success after you eat at RJ Grunt's. The food is solidly good, with large portions and fresh flavor. Of course, the salad bar is wonderful, but how could it not be, considering it's advertised at being "famous"? I also had the tuna melt (s), and it was fantastic as well. My boyfriend raved about the French Dip and fries. In fact, we even ate our leftovers for dinner the next night, something we rarely do.
