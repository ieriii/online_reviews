Really enjoyed my Chicago Diner experience! My only complaint was the half hour wait (in the cold) to get in and how it was rather unclear what the system was for getting on the list. But once we were in, the service was attentive and friendly, the menu was great, so nice to have all those veggie choices, and the food was very good. Despite the crowds trying to get in we didn't feel rushed at all.
