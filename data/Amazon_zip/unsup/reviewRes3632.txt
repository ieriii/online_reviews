Mochimaker told me about this place and the fact that they serve Korean burritos. Being a fan of Momofuku Ssam (although less so now that they don't serve burritos in the evening) I had to see if Crisp compares to David Chang's empire. The Seoul Sensation burrito was basically bibimbap in a tortilla, although with a smaller selection of vegetables and no gochuchang. I appreciated the moderate portion of rice inside: enough for taste, not for filler. The burrito came with some sort of spicy creamy dressing. Whatever. Also, the day I ate here, a sign was taped to the wall near the door explaining that they now have kimchi. I asked and received a giant bowl (about half a quart) on the house. That was funny.
