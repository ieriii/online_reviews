We went here for Easter lunch, with reservations, and it was worth it. Still the same good food from its last location on Argyle and cheap! Beef chow fun and sweet and sour pork were really good. Although the whole chicken was cold, not sure if it's supposed to be like that. The new location looks really modernized with the open feel and exposed ducts (similar to WonTon Gourmet). It definitely doesn't look dingy like the last location.
