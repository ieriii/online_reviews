Some friends of ours were relocating to Chicago, so they came for a visit to check out the city & find a place. By chance, their apartment finding service guy happened to mention the Art of Pizza as a great place to get a pizza--- they passed on the word to us, and we checked it out together that very night. We went and told the guy we heard they had the best pizza in the city--- he said they did, and pointed to the various magazine clippings framed on their counter. This place was even voted best pizza by Newsweek for crying out loud (in what I believe was a national "contest," not just Chicago). The guy said the pizza that receives all the rave reviews was the stuffed pizza, so we ordered that. It was really good but takes awhile, so from now on, we always call it in ahead of time and then pick it up. (Which isn't a problem as the place has its own decent sized parking lot--- a detail no one's mentioned yet!) 1-2 slices is seriously enough to stuff me silly. We like to pick up a large stuffed from here when we have visitors in town who aren't up for going out but want a good, authentic to Chicago meal, and no one's been disappointed yet. Even though it is super scrumptious, I wouldn't recommend this as an every week kind of thing--- too filling, so more of a once in awhile or when you're really hungry kind of thing. Also, I was driving by this place the other night and happened to see some changes. As a previous reviewer forecasted, they did indeed expand the restaurant; it's longer & has taken over most (if not all, couldn't tell) of the dinky little strip mall. So, there's now much more seating than before if you choose to dine in.
