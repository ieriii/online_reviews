I came to Cafe 28 on a Saturday afternoon, and we waited for our server to arrive. She was probably busy, maybe she was given a big section, so that"s okay. We both ordered coffee and i ordered the stuffed french toast $8.95 and my father ordered the Huevos Rancheros $9 . Price wise a little expensive, but I'm a frequent diner at Over Easy and McHenry's so I'm spoiled in the sense that I'm used to great service and very tasty food for the price. I think if your going to spend $30 (for two) for your breakfast that's not too much to ask for. So, our server was BAD. I really hate to ask for things but come on...can you not pass me up when refilling everyone's coffee cup pretty please?? The Huevos Rancheros were BAD, i'm sorry Golden Nugget has better. Not good CUBAN food. The refried beans were so salty..for the price..NOT GOOD. My french toast was edible, but again ..not for the price. Then she forgot my platanos ...I had to ask for them and she gave us more cafe with no sugar or cream...ughhh. Overall my experience at Cafe 28 was TERRIBLE..the only good quality was the good coffee, when and if you get it any.
