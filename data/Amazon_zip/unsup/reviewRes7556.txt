So, I have to begin by saying that we didn't have any coupons for this restaurant and we went on a Saturday night. Now that I see all these amazing deals they have on weekdays and other coupons, etc., I'm realizing we probably would have liked it more if we had had some sort of deal/coupon. That's because the main issue I had with the food was that, while it was definitely pretty good, most of it was way over-priced. Even the basic pasta dishes started at around 19.99! I had the fish special of the day and while it was definitely tasty, it wasn't very different from something I can make at home-and it was almost 30 bucks. So, my advice would be--make sure you get a good coupon before you go! I do have to add though that if it was just based on service, I would give 5 stars. We had a reservation so we only had to wait five minutes or so to get seated and all of the members of the waitstaff we interacted with were absolutely wonderful, especially our server. She was friendly, attentive, gave great suggestions.
