The food at Mia Francesca is always fresh and seasonally appropriate. I really enjoy that they have an adventurous and exciting menu that is truly a departure from most Italian restaurants. I have never had a bad meal (they also make a mean Manhattan). The only thing that kept Mia Francesca from 'five stars' is the inconsistency in service. I would love a little more attentive service, especially in a restaurant of this size. However, I will keep going back to Mia Francesca again and again.
