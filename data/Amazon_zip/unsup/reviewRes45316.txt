Went here with a group for a friends birthday. Really cool vibes and atmosphere. Cocktails are really good, we tried nearly all of them and passed them around the table. All was well until I took a bite of my chicken salad only to be greeted by an inch long bone. It cut into my gun line and hurt pretty bad. We notified the waiter and he had the manager come over and apologize. He gave me a free drink, and comped out $20 from out $400 bill. It just didn't seem like enough. I'm sitting in bed the morning after and my mouth still hurts. Probs won't return
