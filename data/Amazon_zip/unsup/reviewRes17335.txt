The drinks here are absolutely top notch. The Sazerac was my personal favorite. The ambience is very trendy and moody, with low lights and a fire place. It also kind of attracts pretentious jerks, but that's par for the course. Despite the actual experience inside the bar being an A, the major drawback is seating availability. I came at 6:15 and was seated immediately but it was already filling up by then. Don't plan to come here later in the night unless you're prepared to wait. A lot.
