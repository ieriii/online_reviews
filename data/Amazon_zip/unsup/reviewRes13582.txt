Last night was my first, of what I hope will be many more, visits to Glenn's Diner on Montrose Ave. Started with one of their signature Bloody Mary's while waiting on the rest of our group to arrive. It was packed full of goodies, besides the skewer of fresh shrimp!! It had just the right amount of spice and was almost an appetizer in itself. Our friends raved about the New England style clam chowder, however, their praises were insufficient. Absolutely some of the best chowder I have ever had!! Finally, the entree' I selected was the pan fried catfish on a bed of cornbread stuffing. Incredible. We shared the Bananas Foster for dessert--just like everything else, exceptional. The best part of the evening was the impeccable service from our waiter Make sure you have reservations and come hungry. You will not be disappointed.
