Pho Tank is just plain goodness. It's no frills, not so small hole-in-the-wall type of place you go on a Sunday after a hard Saturday. Don't expect a five star dining experience, most people don't speak English, don't even expect to find parking! On a busy day you might even get seated with random strangers...but this is the charm in "The Tank" My boyfriend and I usually go in and order the 40 (regular combo) and a bubble tea each. It's always served hot, huge generous portions and always delicious. YOU NEED to try the coconut/lychee bubble tea, it's amazing. I'm from Hawaii where there is seriously a phoe restaurant in every corner! I can say this place is among the best. Seriously. Now go eat Pho.
