Went here for a late dinner and was very impressed. A small venue means that it is very crowded especially in the winter when the outside patio is closed but the wait wasn't too bad and the bottle of wine helped pass the time. The food was delicious. The only part of the meal I didnt truly enjoy was the tuna appetizer. However the fried prosciutto balls were amazing and the chicken dish w/ the yogurt was equally great. However the dish that took the cake was the pork shoulder. I was able to cut through it with a spoon and the meat just melted in your mouth. A small drawback is that because it is so crowded and the seating is communal is that you sometimes have to talk quite loudly in order to talk during dinner. Even with that though, will be making many return trips here.
