Oh piece pizza, why are you so far from me? Piece is my mine and my roomates favorite spot for beer and pizza! Their brewed beer is great, they have a beer to love for any beer drinker and have as well the perfect pizza to go along with it! Always busy, so make sure to get there early any night so your not waiting an hour for a table. Great crowd and atmosphere, If I was living closer I would be there every week! Love Love Love.
