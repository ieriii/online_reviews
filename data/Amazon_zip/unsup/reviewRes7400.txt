I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review! My husband and I took some friends here as a thank you for helping with our wedding. It was a rainy cold Sunday in November and the place was half full. Needless to say the service was amazing! (but not overwhelming) The Kobe beef brisket was even more amazing, tender and juicy still : ) We got a sampler platter for an app with different sauces, all were great. When we finished dinner, the manager came over and asked how everything was. We started chatting and before you know it, we were getting a tour of the kitchen and the smokers- and let me tell you- spotless!!!! Thanks Q- we will be back : )
