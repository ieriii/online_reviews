Caro Mio! How I adore you! Why have you been hiding from me all these years of living in Uptown? Ok, well, clearly you aren't the one hiding with all of these fantastic reviews. I'm just happy I was lucky enough to be invited to a good friend's bachelorette party here last week. Fortunately my lady friends are classy broads and chose this awesome establishment. Last week we came in with a party of ten and were treated very well. We were nearly secluded in our own private dining area in the back (sorry to those few other random couples who were sidled up next to us - I know you got an earful!) The service was delicious and the food was amazing. Yes, I said the service was delicious - our server was quite the flirt and was very nice on the eyes. The food he brought us was really stand out. I enjoyed the linguine with clams very much (a little heavy on the garlic, but that never bothers me). The other dishes that were being passed were all tasty as well. I will be coming back here very soon since it is close to my neighborhood, the service is great, they are BYOB (no corkage fee!), and even though I ate my weight in linguine I am still craving more!
