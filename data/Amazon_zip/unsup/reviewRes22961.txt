Incredibly vegetarian friendly and equally incredible prices. I got the vegetarian burrito and threw down a mere 4.95. I checked with the owner and the beans, rice, chips and tortillas are all vegetarian friendly. You know how sometimes you believe that and others seem less sincere...? I feel confident about this place-- he took a lot of pride in his ability to assure me of the lardlessness of the goods and the lack of chicken broth in the rice--even w/out prompting for specifics.  They even have a vegan friendly item on the menu--labeled as such. My carnivorous party enjoyed their huge meals that could easily be shared by two and the guacamole was yummy. Plus, I was ear hustling at the table next to us and heard that they deliver... so if you're feeling lazy, don't let that stop you from trying the deliciousness that is Irazu Costa Rican Restaurant.
