Good Pizza. Poor Service. Ordered a slice for dinner and a salad to start thinking there would be a wait for the pizza. Unfortunately after the expected wait they came out together. No drink refill. No concern for the untouched salad when she finally came around to clear. It took two trips to the bar to work out my bill. Frustrating.
