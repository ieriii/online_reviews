Went to the bad apple and had a great time!! If you plan to go I would make reservations because it can get very busy for good reason!..If you do have to wait you will be very happy with the bar. There is a great selection of craft beers for a good price. For dinner I had the Black and Blue burger with the truffle fries..which was mouth watering!! Best burger and fries i have had in the city. I also really enjoyed this place because they also have games like jenga in the back dining area which was fun after we all had a couple rounds, I will definitely be back!!
