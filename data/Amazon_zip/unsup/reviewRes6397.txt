Really nice dinner. The wine prices are fantastic and no corkage on Sundays even better. Small plates were quite big in fact. Everything from pate to corn salad, steak and linguini were all excellent. Crispy pork belly was a bit stiff. Star of the night besides the Nebbiolo was the linguini with sea urchin an crab. Would have been happy to pay double for that. Excellent expeience!
