I like this place. It's very charming and cozy. You can sit at the bar and watch the cooks make the pasta, or you can sit at the other high top tables. The food is very reasonably priced, so if you're looking for a casual but not slumming it meal in Lincoln Park, The Pasta Bowl is a good pick. I love their capellini pomodoro-- angel hair pasta, marinara, lots of fresh basil, and chunks of melty mozzerella. Mmmm. So simple, so good. Sometimes I add in meatballs, which are well-seasoned and filling. I also recommend their soups, particularly the potato. I've tried several of their pastas with cream sauces and I just can't do it. I am a comfort and rich food fiend, but it's just too much. So I'll stick with my cappelini pomodoro and potato soup. :)
