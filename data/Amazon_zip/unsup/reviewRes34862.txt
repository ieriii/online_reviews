3 stars for eat-in, 4 stars for takeouts/delivery. 3 stars because the service wasn't good. We ordered hot tea and came out barely lukewarm. After asking our waitress 3x to heat up the water, we gave up on the tea. Since there are no nigiri/sashimi, the rolls were pretty good. The price is not cheap. 4 stars for the variety/originality of the maki rolls and of course the convenience of delivery.
