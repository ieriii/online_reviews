I went to Green Mill on a Sunday to watch the poetry slam. The man who started all poetry slams was hosting it and the event was great. The Rutabaga Band was playing and did a stellar job. The atmosphere was excellent, the poetry was pretty good, the energy was pumping. The place was warm inside, definitely great for the freezing cold night. Several things not cool. 1. This place ONLY takes American Express. What. The. Hell. Luckily, there is an ATM across the street that dispenses tens. But seriously- what busy bar, tavern, whatever this place calls itself ONLY takes Amex? A million points lost for this. I heard a ton of other people's incredulity about this too so I know I'm not the only one. 2. I don't know if it's just the aura of the place, but something provokes women to hover in the bathrooms. TWICE I went in to do my business and both times the toilet seat was sprayed with piss. I'm not a germophobe in the slightest, okay. But that's just gross. I know that's not the club's fault, but it's a warning to those who want to go there. There were even notes written on the walls of the stalls commanding women to stop peeing on the seats. 3. Selection. All I can say is Feh. I stuck to wine. There was nothing there that tittilated me in the slightest. It's a good thing this place is such an old impressive space with good music and interesting clientele, because if they were average, then poor selection, pee on the seats, and limited credit card acceptance would have them bankrupt in a jif. I still plan on going for the slams- for the band mostly. It's a crowd of beautiful people, and I hear they change out the bands, so I hope the other bands are just as good. And this time I'll remember to bring cash.
