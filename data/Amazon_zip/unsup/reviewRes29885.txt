I've been going to this place for years. The food is great and very fresh! The servers are always friendly. I often go for the the chilaquiles. Sometimes I go for the turkey and brie sandwich, which is perfect. The soups are chunky and awesome. My hands-down FAV bacon in town, and I eat a lot of bacon. Word. They have a really nice wine selection, and the selection seems to revolve. Oh yeah, and the coffee is always perfect! A giant coffee grinder sits in the front window, which I think says something. I like sitting in the front room where the art is always changing, and you can watch sidewalk traffic file by, including a parade of small dogs and strollers. The whole place has an arty Greenwich Village vibe... or maybe Europeanish. Interesting locals, and friendly patrons fill the tables. Not unusual to see people playing scrabble, both iPad2 and analogue. Refinement and fun, rolled into one!
