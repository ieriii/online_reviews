I was a little hesitant about what the noise level would be seeing as how its practically on the expressway. But from the moment you open the doors, you're submerged in beautiful decorations, rich colors, and the salsa music. We got there too late to try the menu, but I had the ginger mojito which is still one of the best drinks I've had since.
