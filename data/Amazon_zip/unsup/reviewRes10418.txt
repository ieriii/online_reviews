I was looking forward to a graduation dinner here that was preplanned with reservations almost 3 months in advance. Unfortunately the weather wasn't nice enough to sit outside, which is first come first serve with or without reservations. Our reservations for 9 were at 7:30, again 3 months in advance and we called several times the week of to make sure it was still going to be okay. We didn't get seated until after 8 p.m. That behavior would never fly anywhere else in the city, and if it were to happen, most restaurants would at least comp dessert, an appetizer or one of our 3 cars that we had sitting out in valet. I would never wait that long to eat there again unless it was to enjoy a glass of wine on their patio; honestly the only reason we were going here. The food was good, as expected. It wasn't tapas but definitely smaller portions for an Italian restaurant. The wine menu was large but they didn't carry a Pinot Grigio, which I found odd for an Italian restaurant. I would go back, but not anytime soon. This place has been open for a while and it wasn't a weekend, they should have their act together by now. For a similar taste with better service, I suggest Osteria Via Stato in River North.
