The best bar in town. They have about twenty different species of beer, ON TAP. Triple Karmeliet (sorry Kevin A.--I don't taste the ham) is so tasty on tap that I can no longer drink it from the bottle. Kwak is another winner. $5, 9 percent alcohol--two of these gets me drunker than 6 bottles of anything else and it doesn't even taste like rubbing alcohol. This place is so class thats its turned me into a beer snob. They do it right period. And I haven't gushed about the food yet. The mussels are like butter (if the beer doesn't do it first, these are totes an aphrodisiac, by the way)! And where else can you get such a gamey menu, pates , sausage plates, duck! everything is perfect outmatches The Publican for sure. well played Hopleaf!!!
