I love this place. It is beautiful, accommodating and has delicious, compassionate food. It's in my favorite hood. I will never visit Chicago without coming here. What's not to love? That stated, chi diner has seemed to have kind of an identity problem the last few times I've visited and kind of tried to be everything to everyone. I think they'd be just a touch better off having a smaller, more refined menu with a few less processed ingredients. I know it sounds a bit snobby, but as much as I love vegan comfort foods, if I'm at an all-veg joint, especially one with this much history, I want to see more fresh food innovation than decoration of vegan convenience foods. But I guess that's not really what a diner is about. Vegans: Go here.
