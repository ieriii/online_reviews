Noon o kabab is the best mediterranean food out there. As soon as you are seated they bring you warm pita alongside a plate of onions, radish, and feta. Yum! The different meat kababs are so juicy and delicious. You can also get shrimp and veggie kababs, but the meat ones are the best. If you ask your waiter/waitress, he/she is more than happy to give you reccomendations. Overall, this is the best place to go for grilled meat and amazing pita. I can't wait for my next noon o kabab excursion!
