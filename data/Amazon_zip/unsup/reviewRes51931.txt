I don't know what the hype is about Gino's East's deep-dish pizza. To tell you the truth, I was not impressed. I ordered a medium sized cheese and spinach deep dish pizza and ate it, but did not really think much of it. Ya it was decent tasting, but there was way too much tomato sauce and not enough cheese. The crust was bland and not so tasty. I took one bite of the crust and after that let it be on the side of my plate.  The pizza takes over 40 minutues in the oven to cook, so if you are ordering a deep-dish, make sure you have some time to spare.  Just a note: The atmosphere of the pizzeria is very cool. You are allowed to graffiti on the walls (except the bathroom). There is writing everywhere! Make your mark on this well known pizza establishment.
