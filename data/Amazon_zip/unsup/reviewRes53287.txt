This was so wonderful! It was a delight, creative, memorable and interesting. Make sure to dress up. It's hard to tell where to go in due to the lack of signage. It rates just slightly above my L2O experience. I loved that we had a menu to take home of our experience because we didn't know what we were going to eat until the servers brought it out.
