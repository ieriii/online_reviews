It is finished! Two things taken out in one day - my 100th review and a trip to Hot Dougs! The lines are insane and there is no denying that but when can the anticipation be justified by the end result ... when you dig into those encased delights of Hot Dougs. I did see the online menu for their specials of the day and immediately decided between two dogs - the Jalapeno Pork Sausage and the Mandarin Orange Teriyaki Chicken Sausage. I went for the Teriyaki one and an order of the duck fat fries. I manged to score a small table and ate to my hearts content. Perhaps I didn't need to eat all of the fries but it is not that often that I will get a chance to have duck fat fries ... and yes they are very good. I waited in line with a couple who drove from South Bend that day just to give this place a try. They sat close to me and I'm pretty sure they were happy to have made the trip ... except for driving back with a food coma!
