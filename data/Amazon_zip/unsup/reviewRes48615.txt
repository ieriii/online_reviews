Have to give points for service as we got here early, told our waiter we had a deadline to get out for the Bulls game, and service ended up being timed perfectly so that no course was rushed, but we were out with time to spare.  The space is pretty different from places I'm used to going, and having lived in Germany, it does remind me of some sort of bizzaro German beer hall, but not a place I would describe as cozy. The booth/cubbyholes were weird, but I liked them, whereas other hated them. I can see how they would turn into a total pain in the ass as the place gets busier and opening their doors blocks the aisles, probably slowing down service. The space was interesting, at least. I felt like I was eating in the future!  The food overall was solid, I'd give good marks to the pickles, pork rib and steak tartare and awesome marks to the fried pork skins app and the whole chicken.... mmm so good.  The beer list seemed pretty interesting. I saw some of my favorites on there, but I steered away from them to try something new, a Rochefort 10 which was pretty good. The wine ordered by the rest of the table seemed to impress too. Overall we missed the "wow" factor that would have made this a 5-star review for me, but I would definitely return in the future (to feel like I'm eating in the future).
