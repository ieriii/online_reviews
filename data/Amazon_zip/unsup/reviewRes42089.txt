Wow. I am quite impressed with this place. I was visiting from NY and had dinner here on a recommendation of a co-worker. Really good spot. Friendly service, cool ambiance, and great music selection. We had cocktails and wine, an app, an entree (each), a side dish and dessert, so we definitely experienced what Gilt has to offer. The prices are surprisingly reasonable, not as much as you may expect from this place. The app (sourdough, fig jam, creamy cheese) was very tasty. They are generous with their portions for sure. The side dish (brussel sprouts with pork belly) was outrageous. I could've easily had that alone. My entree (salmon) was cooked to perfection - really good. My buddy had the pork belly which was tasty as well (I had a piece). We each had ice cream for dessert (he had pistachio, I had cookie dough) and, once again, they served a very large portion (3 massive scoops, along with a small container of hot chocolate syrup) and it only cost $3. The cockails were also tasty, creative and well presented. The only strike would be that the bus boys rushed us a bit to finish our food, which we of course did no such thing since we took our sweet time. As well the friendly waitress forgot about our food/order, but between our cocktails and wine and app, and the fact that the waitress gave us dessert for free, they get a pass on that. I'm looking forward to returning here.
