i went to costa rica and came back with the strongest cravings for the amazing meals i had there.thankfully, i don't have to go very far to satisfy them. i also don't have to go very far to purchase my favorite condiment of all time: salsa lizano.the wait staff is incredibly nice and accommodating. the one time my order was semi-incorrect, they handled it so well, i kind of want to lie and say they messed up every time (kidding).drinking their horchata is like suckling milk from heaven's teat. nbd.
