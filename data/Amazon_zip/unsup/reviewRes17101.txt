I really fell in love with the atmosphere here!!!!! Loved the entire, romantic theme. The drinks were on the expensive side but they were very strong and delicious!!!! The waitress was very friendly as well as the people at the door. I'm simply in love with Violet Hour. Definitely check this place out!!!!
