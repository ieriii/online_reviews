I just loved it ... everything about it! I recently had a green Bloody Mary and as someone that usually doesn't enjoy alcohol, I found myself wanting to order all the alcoholic beverages on the menu. On my second visit, we had an extremely informative server. He was very helpful with making vegetarian suggestions. Be sure to order the guacamole, and the platanos con crema are to die for! Make sure you get there really early, or make your reservations *way* in advance. If you do have to wait, hang out in the bar area, find a little spot by a ledge, and flag down a server. You don't have to wait by the bar to get a drink, the servers will be happy to bring you one, along with an appetizer to enjoy while waiting for your table.
