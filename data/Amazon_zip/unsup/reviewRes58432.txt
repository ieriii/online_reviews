If you're into totally RUDE people, go to Glenn's Diner. I took a business associate to Glenn's as we had just finished a nearby meeting. The tables outside were full, so we went inside. After being inside for a minute or so a female employee came up to us. In a very reproachfull tone, she said the door you came in is for staff only. For future reference please use the other door. I said ok.After another minute or so a server asked if we would like to sit inside or outside. I said outside but that I didn't think any tables were available. He said he was about to bring change to one table so they would likely be leaving soon. I asked if we should wait in or out; he said do whatever you want. We proceeded to wait outside and when the next group got up, we sat down.Five minutes or so passed and the same server came with menus. He seemed quite annoyed with us and told us we would prefer to clear the table before you just sit down. So for future reference please wait. I asked if he preferred that we leave. He seemed quite indifferent, so we left.Many of the reviews indicate that the food is great, but I'll never know as I would never return. Both of these communications from Glenn's staff could have been delivered in a cheerful, customer-friendly way. From the number of other one-star reviews indicating bad encounters, I guess they don't give a hoot.
