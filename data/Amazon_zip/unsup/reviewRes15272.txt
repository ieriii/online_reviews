This is a fun place to stop by. Pretty glamorous. When I went it was very crowded, but that was the opening so maybe it has cleared up by now. The beer is ok. I had a burger that I thought was great, but the fries were so so. They are fresh cut, but they didn't taste that good. I think it is a place that is worth trying, and has potential to become a staple, if they strive for more excellent beer.
