Update: We had Simply It cater our wedding, and guests loved it! The crew was professional and the food was delicious. -------- If you haven't already, you should definitely try SIMPLY IT in Lincoln Park. It's an amazing BYOB Vietnamese restaurant and the owner is one of the most adorable, kindest men. Everything on the menu is delish! I've literally tried almost everything. Simply It currently has some family meal deals going on. Check them out at the restaurant - fixed meals for 2, 4, 6, 8, or even 10 peeps. You get so much for you money! http://tinyurl.com/saves
