We came for the churros. We ate many churros. Our churros were handed to us in a paper sack that smelled strongly of cornmeal. I was terrified. Churros should not be healthy! There was over a minute of worrying while we waited for our fresh treats to cool down enough to shove into our mouths. They were fantastic. Certainly a fresh masa taste that was not completely covered up by cinnamon and sugar, but they completely satisfied my sweet tooth. I enhanced the experience by purchasing a cup of drinking chocolate (the Barcelona) which doubled as a churro dip. I am shivering in anticipation just remembering how tasty that was. Not a perfect review - boy ordered a cafe con leche that was way too bitter. Is that what the Near North breakfast crowd wants? Not a fan, la leche should be sweet. I will totally be back to try more food here.
