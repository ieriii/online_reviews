I love this place. I've always been happy with my food and the service! It's popular, so expect a wait. The place is tiny, so you have to wait in a tent they've set up in the back. I was expecting the worst (considering it was February), but the heat lamps helped keep the place cozy, servers were always checking on us, and at one point they passed out free cookies to help pass the time! The bi bim bop bowl was fantastic. One of my pieces of seitan, however, was really dry and tough. When I told the server, though, he brought me out a fresh piece in just a minute or two. If you have a large party or are heading over during the weekend dinner rush, be prepared. If you can't handle the wait, head somewhere else, but if you stick out I really think you'll be glad you did!
