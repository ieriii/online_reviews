I love me some milk and honey. Everytime i go it is tasty tasty. Yeah, sure there is a long line. and yeah, sure there are yuppies in abundance. but the food is delish and worth it, imo. and it is so cute in there too, esp with the fire place and all. If crowds bother you, try going during the week. way better. however, their pastries are def lacking. I'd head down to alliance or Letizias down the street for a better sweet treat.
