Belgium Beer at its Best On the hoppin' strip of Clark in Andersonville, the Hopleaf bar serves up a bevy of beers. Always packed (be it weekend or weekday), hordes of people treat their taste buds to a variety of beers. Specializing in Belgium beer, the Hopleaf doesn't offer the most helpful or friendly bar staff, but they sure know their beers! With an eclectic crow of costumers ranging from yuppies to the scruff-gruff, you'll feel at home in this wood decorated, cozy bar. Though I have never eaten at the restaurant in the back, I've heard nothing but good things. The Bottom Line: If you know your beers and don't mind a crow, give it a try!
