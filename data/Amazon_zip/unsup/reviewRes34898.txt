Sushi X has the best giant rolls ever. The rolls are definitely a 2 or 3 biter. Not only do they give giant portions, but they have an amazing happy hour from Sun-Thur from 5-7 PM where all rolls are half off. I always get 2 giant mega rolls and it totals anywhere from $12-$16. This place is a hidden gem and a hole in the wall. It is very tiny with limited seating. The only down side is that the staff is not that attentive and is terrible with refilling cups of water. Although the ambiance and service of the restaurant could be 10x better, the quality of the food and price makes me and my friends come here twice a week.
