There will always be a huge debate over who has the best Chicago style hot dog. The one here is a good representation with a bit of their own twist since they toss in the pickled tomato. It's a bit more expensive than say Gene & Jude's. But come on. Gene & Judes provides a rock solid dog, but the place itself is a true dive. Superdawg has got higher operating costs and over all provides a way better environment and a new experience to us youngsters. The drive-in. Some people love this experience. Me? I'm not much of a drive in kind of guy. I'm always afraid I'm going to get mustard laced onions all over the seat and that my car is going to smell. I'd much rather ride my bike here. To me, this is the best place to take a break when riding the North Branch Trail. That's what makes this place so great to me. I can go off in the early morning, crank out thirty to sixty miles, and on the way back I can grab an empty picnic table here and order up me some whoopskidawg and a shake from the speaker box. That's my kind of heaven right there folks. I may look goofy in my tight bike jersey, shorts and helmet. Weirder still when I try to get up and ride off with my stiff leg and back muscles. But you've never seen someone enjoying their Superdawg more...
