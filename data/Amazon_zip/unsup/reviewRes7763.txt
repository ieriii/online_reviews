On a beautiful sunny day last summer, Mr. N and I got married! Later that day, our families and guests all met at Fogo de Chao to indulge in a meat feast, because, let's be honest, could there be a better way to celebrate the union on the two biggest fat kids in the world? I think not. We'd been to eat here at lunch a few months before, just to see what it was like. Lunch there is great, for those who would rather fork over 30 dollars (as opposed to 50). We talked to a manager and made reservations for our party of 30 (small weddings RULE). Easy peasy! On the night, we had to wait a little for our tables, but it was a Saturday and the place was PACKED. We got to sit next to the big mural in the back room, which was beautiful. The service here is impeccable. Our server, Marcus was really patient and nice. It seems pretty hard to explain the concept to a big group of people who had never been there and were talking amongst themselves. He was so attentive and brought us a flan with "Congratulations" written on the plate for us. As for the food, what else can be said? Filet mignon wrapped in bacon! Parmesan pork! Lamb chops! What a dream! Our vegetarian friends were happy too. The salad bar is fantastic. Every time I eat there, I pile so many marinated mushrooms on my place. Then I return to the table and gorge myself on the cheese bread balls, parmesan polenta sticks and fried plantains. Remember to pace yourself so you don't explode during the meal. :)
