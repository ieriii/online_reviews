I loved Bad Apple as soon as I walked in. I was greeted with a smile and sat down promtly with much attention from the waiter. He was very knowledgeable about the beer list, which is impressive. He took the time to describe different types of brews so that we were able to make informed decisions. The service was what made me rate this so high. I loved watching how the wait staff helped eachother. Very team oriented and friendly! I cannot wait to go back and just sit at the bar. Looks like it would be a very good time!
