WOW! What a great dinner! I grew up in the city of Chicago, Have worked in the industry (restaurant) for nearly a decade, ....(so I know what I'm talking about)......and Davanti is exceptional. This is my first yelp review , so go easy on me........ To be honest, I let our peerless Waiter (Erik) choose our culinary adventure. So Im not sure what we had........but Ill try and recap the first courses, which involved luscious corn, mushrooms, goat cheese and bitter greens that were beyond amazing. Next up was an amazing taste of flavors of (beef or pork?....im ashamed I cant remember) But it matters not, it was a "special", served with "fries" like potatoes, braised meat (i think) and super tender...........So yummy! Finally, a pizza that was like a culinary orgasm! And desserts that were sweet but weren't excessive or cloying..... The Decor?, ....Sleek, sexy and hip..... The staff? LOVELY to look at. Really, the place deserves four and a half stars.......its close to perfect.....on my next visit ill talk about the wine list! All in all, a killer experience! Great food! Great service! Great ambiance! What else does a true Chicago boy go out for?
