This place has great Sushi and entrees. Staff is very friendly! I didn't give it a 5 only because the place is way to noisy during dinner especially on the weekends. It is hard to have a conversation with your guests at the table. The Sushi is a bit over priced compared to other great sushi places, but I still would recommend it.
