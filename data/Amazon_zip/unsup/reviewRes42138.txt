Art of Pizza should get 3.5 stars. It was a good pizza, but could have been just slightly better. For delivery, I ordered a stuffed sausage, pepperoni, green pepper, and onion. The pizza was delivered hot and ready to eat. On the positive side, the sauce was excellent (one of the best I've tasted) and the cheese was great. The outer crust was pretty good as well. Overall, I enjoyed the pizza. However, the big negatives were the meat toppings. As I mentioned, I ordered sausage and pepperoni. I thought that they forgot to add these toppings. The sausage was in tiny bites the size of a small Advil pill. And there weren't many of them. If I didn't order it, I wouldn't have thought that there was sausage on it.  At least give me marble sized bites. In addition, the pepperoni was small and thin. Not very many pepperoni slices either. I couldn't taste the sausage or pepperoni. The green pepper and onion were in ample supply (and good), but not the meats. If the meats were more prominent, I would have given it 4, maybe even 5 stars. One last negative (this would be a more personal negative)...I thought that the bottom crust was a little too thick....a little too doughy, but it had some good crispness to it. It didn't take away from the pizza. As I said, I really enjoyed this pizza, but the lack of sizable meat toppings brought it down a little. Otherwise, it could be an excellent pizza.
