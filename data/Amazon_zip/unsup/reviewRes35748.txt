Best duck I've ever had, hands down. I savored each morsel of it like it was my last meal. As for the bbq pork (char siu), I'd give it 4 stars if I could b/c I've had better (I'm ever so loyal to your char siu, Royal Chinese BBQ). Overall, this place is delicious. I can't wait to return again b/c I've yet to try their salted chicken. I love me some salted chicken. Come November, I'd also take them up on their sign I saw last year that said something to the effect of "will cook your thanksgiving turkey for you." I would totally bring a 10 lb bird there and tell them to Peking the thing for me. I'm sure that would be pure bliss.
