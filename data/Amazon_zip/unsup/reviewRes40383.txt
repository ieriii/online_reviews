2 Steak tacos, cilantro and onions only. $4.03 That's all you need to know. Don't forget extra hot sauce. I remember on several occaisions making this place my breakfast lunch and dinner. Simple, cheap and magic. Just make sure you go to the small one on the East side of Ashland as there are three of them.. on the same block.. right next to each other. The tacos are always better at the smaller, scary one.
