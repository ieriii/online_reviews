I have been to Wishbone maybe two dozen times and never had bad service. The food is always great, especially the crunchy french toast. However, be warned that bad parenting prevails and the place is constantly crawling with toddlers and spilled juice. So if you want brunch with the kiddies take them to Wishbone. Brunch with adults would be better elsewhere.
