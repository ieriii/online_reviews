I really like it here. The food is always great, make sure to get the bacan fat popcorn!!! It is sssoooo good! And course the beer is great! My only compliants are the niose level, it is always so loud in there! And the hostesses are always so rude. the waitstaff and bartenders are always very pleasant.
