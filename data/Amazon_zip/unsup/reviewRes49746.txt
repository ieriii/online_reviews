I've been going to Bin 36 for a while now. It's a great place to get a drink after work or on the weekend. In the past it used to be crowded with a good mix of people. Lately though, it's been dead. Not sure if it's just not cool anymore (not that I'm looking for a Hub 51/Bull & Bear environment) but I don't understand why it's so dead. I've only had wine and maybe an appetizer so I can't really comment on how the food has been. When I went in last Saturday, it had a not very pleasant smell -- a mix between cheese and cleaning supplies. Hope things turn around for them...
