Friendly neighborhood BYOB restaurant serving satisfying Vietnames food at reasonable prices. The Sate Shrimp, Crab Pasta, and Lemon Grass Beef appetizer are the best dishes on the menu. While the food is not as good as some of the places on Argyle, or the homeland itself, Simply It is a nice alternative if you are in the neighborhood.
