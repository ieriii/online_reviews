Excellent food, comfortable atmosphere, friendly & unpretentious wait staff. Did I mention excellent food? Everything ordered was delicious to the last bite. The small plates didn't fill us up and the waiter was really good about checking back to see how we were doing and if we wanted more selections. No reservation - we walked in at 5:15 and had a seat (I'm sure the wait is longer as it gets closer to the trendy dinner hour). In contrast, the Girl and the Goat required a three week reservation, we weren't seated until we were all there (one person stuck in traffic), we were rushed by the wait staff and had a fairly miserable experience.
