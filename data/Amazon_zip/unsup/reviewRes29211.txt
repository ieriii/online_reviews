I really really wanted to rate Opart Thai much higher, but I just can't. I wanted to like the place, but I just don't. Maybe I'll give it another shot, but probably not for some time. To be concise, here are the positives and the negatives of my visit. Plus: + BYO + Cozy and comfortable interior + Delicious pot stickers + Tasty Thai iced tea Minus: - Had to order from takeout menus and couldn't hear the waitress's explanation why we couldn't have regular menus. - Waitress sat us, and disappeared. Our tummies were rumbling and we hadn't even gotten a chance to order yet. - Waitress continued to be inattentive the rest of the visit. - Tried something new and it tasted terrible. I had maybe five bites and I couldn't stomach it anymore. I don't recall the dish, but it was served with a "gravy" that tasted off. I went home hungry. - My date had a similar issue with his barbecue pork dish. He ate it, but was disappointed with the sauce. He said it lacked flavor. Most likely, we just ordered poorly and ended up with duds. I'd like to give it another try and order one of my usual go-to Thai dishes (love me some Pad Woon Sen), but this experience just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Pun 100% intended.
