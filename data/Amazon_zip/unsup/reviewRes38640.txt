If Yelp ever offers 4.5 stars, I will apply it here. As many others have stated the Duck Reuben rocks- so say my 23 year old daughter. I sampled my wife's Brisket, which really should be labeled Corn Beef for accuracy sake. It was awesome. I had the Japanese Eggplant which was tasty, but not omg. I had the beans/pancetta side dish and that was just okay. I sampled my wife's Stilton MacNcheese which was very good, as were my daughter's fries. I will definitely come back, waiting to be super-wowed the next time so I can update this great place to 5 stars.
