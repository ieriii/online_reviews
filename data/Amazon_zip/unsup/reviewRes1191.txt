Hot Doug's has almost 600 reviews so I'm going to make this short and sweet. Yes, you must go here and pop your HD cherry. I went this past Saturday for a Valentine's lunch. Waited over 40 minutes and I didn't mind at all. The duck fat fries are fabulous. I had duck fat coating my mouth that whole day. Gross, right? No, the fries are goooood! I had a chicken sausage with the works AKA, the Dave Kingman Italian style. My hubs had andoullie sausage with the works AKA, the Salma Hayek. Like the sign says, this dog is hot, hot, hot! I will be going back to try a few specials. I can't keep my mind off those duck fat fries! Keep in mind, it is cash only and there is no ATM on the premises.
