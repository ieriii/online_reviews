A foodie's delight would be my description of Longman and Eagle. Excellent service, excellent presentation, excellent menu decisions, excellent bar....get the picture, this place is excellent. Started off with Buffalo Frog's leg served with aerated Blue Cheese and the Veal Sweatbreads served with crab fondue and mushroom puree. Wow, the flavors of both dishes were explosive, dynamic and enlightening. It's been a while since I've seen frog's legs on a menu and these were prepared perfectly. The sweetbreads were inspired. For my entree I went with the server's recommendation of the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe served with sage, pickled jalapeno and beer fat fries. I can't say I've had wild boar before, but I cannot wait to have it again. It was succulent, tender and was prepared using a slow cooking method that pulled the natural flavors out without tasting gamy. For dessert the warm Gruyere donuts with maple syrup, Parmesan and whipped citrus goat cheese carried the rich, comfort food theme through to the very end. I seldom have dessert, but this savory blend left me longing for more. This was a highlight of dining for me in Chicago. If I have one 'complaint' about L&E it's that they have not opened a 2nd location in my hometown of Charlotte. Can someone get on that please? Thank you L&E for a truly memorable dinner and experience!
