Saw this place on Chicago's Best. Four of us went last night to celebrate a birthday. The idea of this place is great.. I really really wanted to like it. THE PROBLEM.. There is a weird smell. Not sure if its the food.. some sort of spice.. but I couldnt get over it. All of my food seemed to taste like it because the smell was soo powerful. I ordered the empanadas. They were really good.. make sure to get those and try them with the sauces. I also got the combination platter with the skirt steak and the pork loin. When I got my food, instead of pork there was baby octopus on my plate. I freaked out and almost fell out of my chair. Wow.. those things are gross looking. Once everything was fixed I couldnt get the picture of those gross things out of my head and it was hard to enjoy my food. But maybe it was because not only did everything seem to taste like the weird smell in the place, but the steak and pork were rubbery and just weird. O.. and the sangria is a waste of time. Im pretty sure there isnt a drop of alcohol in it and they put chopped apples on top.. its not the greatest. I gave 2 stars because of the empanadas and they came out with a piece of flan with a candle in it for my fiancee's bday and the whole restaurant sang to him. (The flan was good). I dont know.. maybe Ill go back... maybe I wont. Just a weird experience.
