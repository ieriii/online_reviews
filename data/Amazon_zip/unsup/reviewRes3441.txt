I pass it all of the time and I'm always curious about it. I I came home the other day and had some time to spare before dinner. I looked up Crisp, both the website and the Yelp reviews (of course). I was excited with the 4 star rating and ecstatic reviews, but of course also wondering "Could it really be THAT good?" Anyway, I tried the Not So Common Crisp sandwich minus mayo, with the BBQ sauce. I got the meal which included a side of fries and a can of pop. I was actually ecstatic at their diet pop selection. Might seem like a small detail, and trust me, I'm a diet coke fan, but I just feel like everywhere ONLY has diet coke. Not Crisp! Diet Sunkist, Diet Root Beer, Diet 7-Up, Diet Dr. Pepper! Finally! Anyway, I got home and I took a bite, and... oh my gosh. Definitely the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The chicken, as other reviewers say, is amazing. It's perfectly moist and crispy. The BBQ sauce, to die for. The perfect blend of sweet and spicy. It was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to go back and try their other things. Next time I'll probably try the Sassy Seoul sauce (though it will be hard not to get the BBQ again). One thing - I got the fries basically because I just wanted to try them. I'm actually not a huge french fry fan but I figured it made sense to get the meal for $2.00 more. Well, the fries could feed about 4 people (the small fry). They are huge. I didn't even eat 1/4 of them after the filling sandwich. They were good, similar to McDonalds, maybe a little less cooked... But they're not necessary. There are way too many unless you're splitting them with someone. Anyway, the fabulous chicken sandwich with a diet orange crush made my day! I will be back. One thing to remember: It's cash only, but they do have an ATM inside.
