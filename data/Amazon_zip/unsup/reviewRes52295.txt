When I was a kid, I loved Gino's pizza. As a teenager, I loved Gino's pizza. As a "mature" adult, I love Gino's pizza! When we moved away from Chicago, I never thought I'd get another good pizza. That changed when my Mom's friend (who lived across the street from Gino's) would bring us a frozen Gino's pizza on the plane (this was pre-9/11 of course) and my life felt complete. In September of 08, my siblings and I flew to Chicago with our Mom to bury my Grandma's ashes next to my Grandpa. We each got to pick a place to eat and guess where I picked?? Yeppers, Gino's! After not having a Gino's pizza in probably 10 years, I was happy to see that nothing had changed. I couldn't even talk while eating my pizza because I was trying to savor the whole experience since I don't know when I'll get back to Chicago. When I first started to review this location, I stumbled upon the Lincoln St location reviews. Whew, glad I never went there! BYOB? Paper plates? Plastic utensils? Are we in the 5th grade cafeteria? What's that all about? I thought I was in the Twilight Zone until I looked at the address & saw it wasn't Superior St. Thank God the aliens hadn't taken over my Gino's and turned it into a cheesy pizza place. If you were disappointed by the Gino's on Lincoln, give the Superior St location a shot, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. They have more than one floor of seating and although it may take a while to get your pie, it's totally worth it!! Just so all you haters know, I've been to Lou's and thought the pizza was good but nothing beats my Gino's. For all you Zonies, you can get frozen Gino's Pizza at AJ's (a division of Bashas) now. 16th Street & Glendale??? My Mom said her friend told her about it and it's the best frozen pizza she's ever had!
