Ahhhh, India House. I love this place so much.  I believe the lunch buffet is the best deal they have, so that is when I go for the most part. The staff is extremely attentive. So attentive in fact, that my sister, cousin and I play a little game to see how low we can get our water glass before they refill it. Trust me when I say that it is RARE to be able to get your water glass completely empty. That is impressive. But if you want to fully enjoy their buffet, I advise against playing this game. Just take my word for it. I have been here once for dinner where I actually ordered off the menu and I had Chicken Chili Masala. Now, I have always been a fan of Chicken Tikka Masala, as it is one of my favorite Indian dishes, so I thought I would get a little crazy. Oh. My. God. It was so worth it. It was phenomenal. The Chicken Chili Masala was so good that I was raving about it for weeks on end. My mouth still waters at the thought of this dish! This place is totally worth the trip. The quality of the food is out of this world. The balancing of spices, aromas and decor is nothing short of a dream.  Oh, and I ALWAYS take my friends here who have never tried Indian food for the lunch buffet. I feel that when you are introducing people to new flavors, it is good for them to try multiple things to see what they do and don't like... That way *one dish* isn't the determining factor of their decision.
