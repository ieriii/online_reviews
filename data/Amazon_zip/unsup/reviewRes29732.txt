I came here for brunch on a Sunday. I got there around 11am, and was shocked that there was no wait for two. Whee!!! The waitress and hostess were both so nice and sweet. The prices are a little steeper than I would have guessed, but for the location..reasonable. I was a little disappointed that there were no endless mimosas, BUT they had great "eye opening" alcoholic drinks. At first glance, I thought their prices for the drinks were a little steep too, but once the waitress came out with them, I couldn't believe how great a deal in both quality and quantity they were! I got the salmon sandwich, which was great. My only complaint was that it was a little too greased up for my taste.
