I think that I liked the experience more than I did the food, not that there were any complaints in that department. It was all extremely good. But the service? They had bases covered that I didn't even know existed. Sometimes, a little too covered. I was escorted to and from the restroom and I could have done without making a whole production out of it. When we finished eating, though, a hostess was standing by the exit with my coat and bag and how she remembered which were my things or knew that we were getting ready to leave remains a mystery but it was pretty cool. Plus, they had a little baggie of cookies and lollipops for me to take home. It's a special place.
