Fresh, cheap, and quick. The Big Bowl is $6.95 and it's at least a half gallon of pho; a monstrous, steaming bowl of fresh veggies, herbs, and meat. A plate comes on the side for you to add more herbs, spice, and sprouts. I also like the pork skin spring rolls. The room itself is light on ambiance. Service is cordial, but it's usually crowded so there isn't a whole lot of small talk, and that's fine-the star here is the fresh food on the cheap.
