Tucked away in North Center where the trailblazers seem to be setting up culinary shop, you can find a particularly zesty family-owned gem, the sizzling Caf 28. Serving up traditional Cuban and Mexican style dishes in a cozy, lofty space you'll find here that Latin hospitality and effervescent mojitos are measured with equal significance. The atmosphere is lovely and inviting with an array of vivid colors, exposed brick, hardwood and fresh cut sunflowers basking in a candlelight glow that I wasn't at all surprised to see a wide spectrum of diners here. Couples romancing it up on dates, groups of guys and gals, business folk, families and of course my motley crew made up by yours truly, the fab Kellie K. and lovely Lauren H. Caf 28 seems to fit any bill as long as you can hang and enjoy sangria and black beans.  Surprisingly our dishes were tastier than I expected. My preconceived notions were admittedly a bit off... one sniff of the heavenly scents of spice-rubbed steak, plantains and saffron had me waving a white flag in no time. Our ceviche app rocked my socks off despite it being served with a garnish of not-yet-ripe avocado. The entrees, though, were really what blew my top (good thing I wore a bra...), with Lauren's almond crusted halibut atop jalapeo mashed potatoes being my edible orgasm for the evening. Yes, Yes, Yes!! My Cuban roast pork with caramelized onions and mojo atop congri was no chopped liver (nasty.ew.puke.) and was definitely worthy of the drool I bestowed upon it. Clearly, Caf 28 pleasantly surprised in more ways than one... I can't wait to be back with my brunch brigade to give their honey jalapeo pork chops with eggs, tomatoes and toast a fair shake. Oh and don't forget my morning mojito. Salud!
