I've been to a couple of Tapas restaurants now and this one was the best so far. The welcome dish was excellent (to put it simply it was a lot like bruchsetta.  So a friend and I went here together. We each had the white and red sangria - both very good but not quite enough fruit in it like People lounge. The dishes were all very good. The dessert was amazing as well. I hope to go again and try everything.
