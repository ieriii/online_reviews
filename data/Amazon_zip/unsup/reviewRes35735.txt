The first time I tried this place for the duck feast, we were so smitten that we ended coming back a few more times within a month. I cannot give this place enough praises, but I'll try to stress a few points. 1. Cheap. A peking duck dinner with 3 courses can feed a group of 4 give or take. If you split that 4 ways, you might end up paying what you'd normally pay for lunch at say...a standard burger at some bar. Burger or a 3-course duck dinner where the skin gives bacon a run for its money? Hmm... 2. Great for groups. Aside from the price and ability to share a whole roasted duck, it's BYOB and has seating for large parties in it's (relatively) new location. 3. Authentic. I just did my Peking Duck quest in its birthplace. After trying duck at a few places in Beijing, one being the fancier DaDong restaurant too (one of the top 3 peking duck spots, though disputed just as much as a restaurant would be for deep dish here in Chicago), Sun Wah still gets high marks for actual presentation and overall deliciousness when I compare it with the Chinese counterparts. I actually thought Sun Wah's duck might be more moist and the skin more savory than the duck I had at DaDong. I guess I'll just have to pay another visit to Sun Wah just to make sure...
