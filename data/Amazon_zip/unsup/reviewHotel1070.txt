I have stayed at this hotel for over 60 nights... The hotel is great and the rooms are very nice.. Although the motif is not quite my style... Looks sort of the 70s style with yellowish walls and wood furniture. The views are great, the service is spectacular. Last time I stayed here was in February of 2011
