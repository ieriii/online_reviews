Have only been here once & would definitely go back. Our server was awesome; very attentive & pleasant. My salad was honestly the best I've ever had. It was the chicken & avocado....so amazing, the vinaigrette was to die for. It was a perfect blend of peanutty deliciousness. And of course the beignets. I've had the best of them in the French Quarter, & these do not fall short of what I expect from a beignet. Yum yum yum! P.S.- the only thing this restaurant has in common with The Cheesecake Factory is the extensive menu. I hate The Cheesecake Factory; my food here was impeccable.
