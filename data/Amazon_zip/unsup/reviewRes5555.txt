I love this place.my hubbie and I have gone every weekend for the last two months - always in the aftenoon for "linner" --- to avoid the crazy wait times for dinner. We try to be seated with Lucas. I love Lucas-he rocks!!! He decants our wine and gives us great suggestions on food/wine/dessert!! He is higher energy and remembers what we like. High quality food and service. I feel really happy being there. The wine is awesome. We tend to stick to our favorites: Bordeoux wine, salted beets, roasted butternut squash, cabbot cheddar, prosciutto, scallops, chicken kabobs, and bread pudding for dessert.  Yum, yum and yum!!
