My husband and I stopped by Alliance to grab a quick bite before being stuck in rush hour traffic for an hour to head home to the suburbs. We ordered quite a few things: 2 sandwiches (roast beef and tuna), macarons (chocolate and vanilla), a chocolate croissant, and a couple cups of coffee to keep us warm. We didn't know that there was a separate sitting place next door so we sat the ONLY seating available right when you enter the bakery. The sandwiches were quite delicious. The tuna salad sandwich was served on a croissant and it was not your typical tuna salad: it actually has herbs in it to enhance the flavor! We loved the macarons, the flavor combo were different and I can't remember exactly what filling went into the chocolate macaron and what went into the vanilla. We look forward to going there more and try their other stuff!!
