One of my friends told me that he pretends to be sick at work so he can leave early and come to Hot Doug's for lunch. True story. This was only my second visit to Hot Doug's (since I live about a 2 hour flight away), and this time I had the blue cheese pork sausage with creamy green apple sauce and crushed smoked almonds. You can't call this sort of genius a mere hot dog. This is molecular gastronomy on a bun. I also had the corndog. And and and.. the duck fat fries.. so heart-stoppingly delicious. One order is plenty for 2-3 people, but I recommend that everybody order their own and stuff themselves into a painful, painful delirium.  Bonus points for high-larious decor, including a history of sausage, complete with cave paintings. O, happiness, how you have come to us encased in membranes, sweet, sweet membranes...
