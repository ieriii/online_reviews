We came here last friday night when it was really rainy so luckily the line wasn't too long. We were seated relatively quickly. Seating here is relatively cramped, but this place is about the food, not the ambiance so it's A-OK. I got the mushroom torta and my husband had the pork belly noodle soup. I absolutely loved my sandwich. The mushrooms had so much flavor that I didn't even care that it didn't have meat in the sandwich. I love meat so that's saying something. Anyways, yum! My husband was a big fan of the soup and wants to come back on a Saturday so he can try the goat sandwich. Next time we venture back we will try the churros and hot chocolate as well. So tasty!
