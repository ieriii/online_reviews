We chose seafood dishes because it was a Lenten Friday, and so had their bouillbaisse (soup do bien), and a shrimp yellow curry dish (cari tom). Both dishes were delicous. Very cozy and chill atmosphere, definitely like you're dining in a boutique hotel. Tables are placed close together, but it wasn't overly oud.
