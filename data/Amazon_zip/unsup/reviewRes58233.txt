As a long time resident of Lakeview, I'm thrilled that Crisp has taken up residence in my neighborhood. I've been here many times and the food and service are consistently great. The staff, Jae (owner) and Jon, are really nice guys and very helpful. The wings are, in my humble opinion, the best in the city. They're huge, meaty, and the sauces are delicious. Five wings are probably enough to make most people full, but I usually order 10 pieces and split them between my two favorite sauces, Seoul Sassy and BBQ. The wings are a must have, but if you want to try something else, ask Jon at the counter because he knows the menu backwards and forwards, and will give you an honest recommendation based on your preferences. With Jon's help, I soon branched out and tried many of their other items. The Bad Boy Buddha bi bim bop is fantastic. The vegetables are fresh and plentiful, and if you're a meat-eater like me, I recommend trying it with beef. One of the complaints that I noticed from other reviewers was their surprise that this dish was not served hot. These reviewers don't realize that this is SUPPOSED to be served at ROOM temperature. Although I would probably recommend that Jae revise the menu to mention this in the description, as most people probably aren't that familiar with Korean cuisine. Jon also insisted that I order the smashed potatoes with shaved carrots mixed in, and simply described them as awesome.' He was right again, the potatoes were thick and creamy, and the carrots added a nice flavor and color to what normally looks very bland. By the way, as this is a fast food joint, I should mention that the fries are really good too, great texture and perfectly salted. Crisp is a unique and wonderful addition to Lakeview, and worth a visit even if you don't live here!
