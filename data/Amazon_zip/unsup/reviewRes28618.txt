There is deep dish pizza, and well there is Pequods. I love this pizza. I usually get a sausage and mushroom deep dish. The trademark of a Pequods pizza is the carmelized crust. I absolutely love it and this place is my first and foremost recommendation to all visitors to Chicago. Now there is plenty of pizza to choose from but the combination of sauce, great tasting sausage, and carmelized crust makes this one of the many reasons I miss Chicago.
