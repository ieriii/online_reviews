If I had five wishes granted to me, one of them might be that I lived around the corner from this restaurant so I could eat there more often. I've eaten and gotten take out from Noon a few times. I thought I'd write a review after my most recent take-out experience to share how good this place is. I haven't eaten at Noon for a few years (arggh my little kids) so when they paper bombed our 'hood I gave 'em a call. The baba ganoush appetizer, just perfect. The shrimp, filet, ground beef kebabs, delicious. The dill rice, great. The tiramisu, solid. One tip I'd make for the take-out crowd, get the baba ganoush, two kebabs and one rice that's perfect for two people. The rice portions are so big you only need one for 2-3 people.
