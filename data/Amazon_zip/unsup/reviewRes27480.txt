Hands-down my favorite Chicago pizza place. We have a lot of friends and family visit from out of town and take them to Pequod's every time. I absolutely love the caramelized crust, it's what makes the pizza. We usually get the appetizer sampler or the fried mushrooms to start- as far as friend mushrooms go these are great. Service is always friendly, and every time we've been in the owner is there and makes a point to welcome everyone who walks through the door. I like the bar atmosphere on the first level. I like to sit there if possible. On about our third visit we were seated upstairs- which I didn't even know existed- and it's huge! Still a nice atmosphere and family friendly.
