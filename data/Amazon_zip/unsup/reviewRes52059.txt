As I'd not yet tried a true Chicago style deep dish, on my recent trip to the windy city I was on the hunt for the real deal and after being recommended a few different spots (Uno & Due - butter crust, Giordano's - flour crust and Gino's - cornmeal crust) we settled on Gino's as they claim to be the "original" deep dish pie. We had a bit of a rocky start - we must have been the last people through the door before they closed (we arrived around 9:30pm) but we still had to wait about 15min for a table. Once seated, we were pretty much ignored by our server and we were just about to leave when she finally came by. However, things got much better from that point forward - we were told that each pizza takes about 45 min to bake in the oven, but I hadn't come this far to not try the famed deep dish pizza, so we ordered: Spinach Mozzarella Sticks - pretty much like a regular mozzarella stick but with spinach added, served with the same marinara sause they use on their pizzas, and ranch dip. They were tasty enough, and something to help fill the time until our pizza arrived. Cheese & Sausage Deep Dish - we ordered the small to share between the two of us, and when it finally arrived, we still were only able to make it through one piece each, this pizza is BIG!! It was also delicious! Crunchy cornmeal base, fresh marinara sauce and juicy sausage - you were given the option to either crumble the sausage on top or have a sausage patty cover the whole pizza so each bite has sausage in it - I'd recommend the sausage patty, 'cause man was it tasty! Overall, I thought the pizza was an experience like I'd never had before. Next trip back I'm going to have to try one of the other recommendations to have something to compare to!
