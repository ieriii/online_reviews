This is a very cute and romantic Italian restaurant. The staff is very friendly and it's nice and dark with candlelight. I came here for my anniversary and we had a lovely dinner. This is a BYOB establishment so that will save you a few dollars. Their portions are massive and you will leave full and happy. I had the cheese ravioli with Bolognese sauce. It was delicious but a tad bit salty. My man had the seafood pasta and that was really good too. It had anchovies in it, not a fan of those little guys. We also shared a Cannoli. I don't know how I ate dessert that night but I couldn't resist. Check out this cute little gem on Wilson you will fall in love!
