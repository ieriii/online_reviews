7/25 So we were a party of 6....waiting on two people from our party to show up. We explained we were not to sure when they would arrive but were indeed coming. We waited an hour and 45 minutes outside because we couldn't be seated with out the party. Normally. I would have left BUT because the birthday girl was on route I didn't want to change the plans. No one even offered us sitting at the bar and grabbing a drink. I was pretty frustrated. Check My other reviews....I'm a DRINKER....We would have gladly sat and had a few eats and drinks while we waited. It was actually really unfortunate, because the food and service when we FINALLY were seated was actually really good. I had the pesto chicken, and the rose beer. Both really good. Waitress also great. It's just a bummer that ALL I REALLY REMEMBER was that wait.
