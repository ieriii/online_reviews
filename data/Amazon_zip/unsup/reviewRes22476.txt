I am seriously considering renting a flat above just so I can live, breathe, and dream in the delicious aromas of this place 24/7. We finally made it down to Lao Sze Chuan after years of being distracted by other goodies such as Joy Yee and Hong Kee... let's just say if I could give this place 10 stars I would. The menu, first of all, is a BIBLE of truly authentic Szechuan food... I was about to high-five the waitress for not seeing a single General Tsao's chicken or Mongolian beef on the menu. We tried the fried green beans, spicy fried chicken, and the beef with black bean sauce. Aaaaand wow. We were blown away not only by how delicious all three dishes were, but also by the unabashed, in-your-face spice level of each one. I had a constant grin on my face in between chugging iced water and wiping the snot off my nose. This is what real Szechuan cuisine is, peeps! Be forewarned though: I usually order in English at Chinese restaurants to soothe the bf that I am not ordering anything potentially sketchy like fried cow penis (I would for giggles), but I had to switch over to Mandarin since both the waitress and bus boy could not fathom a simple phrase such as: "Iced water, please." No English? Chicken hearts it is. The bf also got a little miffed at the slow service, but I had to remind him that the more authentic a Chinese restaurant is, the more horrible the service (and the worse the decor) is going to be. Is there even a translation for "good service" in Chinese? If there is, I don't know it. I would pick dining at Lao Sze Chuan and their plastic table covers over the swanky lounge of a hoity-toity restaurant any day. This is definitely my new favorite restaurant in Chicago!
