Forty-five years of Chicago fine dining, and I just heard of this joint. So my lady and I head over here on a weeknight. We scuttle in a little too early--so more time to check out the bar and oeuvres. A great warm-up I say! Along with ample cheese blocks and crackers, we indulged in some tempering beverages. Her strawberry martini had a sugarcane and succulent strawberry to top. The cabernet went down smooth, oh yeah. So now you want to hear about the course itself. Okay. So it's fondue. You're going to fish in your meats, cheeses, veggies, in a broth, and then it's all a splash. The cheese sauce is infused with wines and spices. Let me tell ya about the cheese. It ain't that Packers fare your gonna chow on up north. Here's the thing, you're going to get a small portion, but big pieces. Same is true for the entrees. And when you've got your soggy tasty cut of the loin, sauted to perfection, now's the time to get adventurous. Just dip that into one of them sauces. If you run out, I bet you'll be full.
