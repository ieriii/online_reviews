BEST. INDIAN. EVER. SERIOUSLY. I thought the best was on Devon. And Devon is damn good. Still 5 star in their own right. But this place just took Indian off the scale! Now the prices are UP there too, but if you want immaculate Indian this is the place to splurge. It's dab smack in the middle of the loop on Grand street so no one can complain the neighborhood isn't their flavor; the loop is as general public friendly as you can get. The location is at an epicenter of Chicago and the only thing you may battle in this area is parking and tourists. Take the red line to Grand and bam you're here for $2.50. Tourists don't typically come to Chicago for Indian though so you're safe here. Down the street at Uno or the gazillion steakhouses is a different story. The ambiance is classy and the scent of incense is very calming and inviting. I would feel like I am sinning a tad if I didn't try to look nice coming in this place! Malai Kofta. Chicken Makhani. Garlic Naan. That's 3 of about 250 menu items to dominate in the future. All were perfect and plentiful enough to make repeat impressions for leftovers. The complimentary dipping curry and naan bits exponentially trump the whole chips and salsa opener Mexican food has tooting for it. After dinner coffee. Awesome. Must do. This place is the place to take anyone reluctant-to-Indian-food and have them sold on it's greatness. A+ for a place to bring a vegetarian for the broad range of options. Lamb, chicken (white or dark) and seafood too. It's romantic too so you can turn on the charm.
