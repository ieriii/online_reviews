Nuevo Leon is hands-down the best Mexican restaurant I've ever tried. It is authentic and delicious, the service is great and you can't beat the price. Try the carne asada and the cheese, which I think is just a platter of chihuahua cheese pan-fried with peppers. Also the soup, which comes complimentary. Very very good.
