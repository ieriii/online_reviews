Artopolis is a bakery, a wine bar, a deli, a bistro, and a gift shop all at the same time! Lunch and dinner are both lovely here, but this cafe's ideal for those post-gallery/art show meals when one person wants coffee and dessert, another person wants wine, and someone else wants french fries, which are served enticingly all wrapped up in paper and stuffed vertically into this cool spiral holder. There are days when I crave their Greek egg-rice soup, with tender chunks of chicken and soothing lemon finish. I also love their kefte sandwich with caponata and goat cheese; it's so hearty and peasant-like and delicious! When I'm feeling less pastoral, I order the artopita with emmenthal cheese and mushrooms. Baklava makes a sticky sweet goodness-finish. Their coffee is excellent, except depending on the server, you may get charged for refills. Which brings me to the service; it's on the lousy side. And as much as I walking up to the lofted seating area, I also know that servers do tend to forget about you up there (but  the view of the whole little bread-city is so great!) The owner is this charming man who greets you like a long-lost relative when you walk through the door, but he's usually only there on the weekend. But do go! Enjoy the soup, the frappes, the shrimp pizza, the baklava; admire the trinkets and Icons to the left of the bakery, and pick up a loaf of deliciousness on your way out. You will be pleased!
