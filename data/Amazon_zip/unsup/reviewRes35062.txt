Rock solid seafood house that is among the most consistent restaurant experiences in Chicago. The bay scallops are superb, as is the shrimp cocktail. Great variety of options on the menu, especially the assorted seafood combos and surf and turf type options.  Minus a point for being just a bit pricey for what it is-it just doesn't feel as "special" as most other places where you can easily drop 300 bucks a couple with a bottle of wine. Still, it's a reliable standby and recommended.
