My boyfriend searched for "romantic dinner" and this is what came up. Thanks for the suggestion as we probably wouldn't have found this otherwise! The atmosphere is nice for a date without being too stuffy or overly romantic, but could also work well for a medium sized group (there lots of tables of 4-6 people celebrating birthdays). The service was attentive and the courses were well paced. Everything we had was delicious (drinks, appetizer, and entree). I'd be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't like this place as it has options for tame and adventurous eaters. I would say this might not be the best choice for vegetarians as there were maybe 1-2 veggie options (both fish) on the menu. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone else though, we let full and completely happy with our meal!
