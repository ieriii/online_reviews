I used to live pretty close to the Art of Pizza. So I have ordered several times and also dined in a few times. Their pizza is above average, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it. I would say the variety of Italian foods is the best part of Art of Pizza. You can order all kinds of pastas. I have had their baked mostaccioli and lasagna. We have ordered both the thin crust and pan pizzas. I prefer the pan pizza, because I think it has more cheese and flavor than the thin crust. The best part of Art of Pizza is the price. I find that a lot of pizza joints in Chicago can end up costing $40+ for delivery. I typically spend $25-30 at Art of Pizza, which is great in my book!
