This place is awesome! I had a groupon and my boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night. Very romantic and dim lit. Even with our groupon, dinner for two and a bottle of wine was pricey. Worth every penny because we were full and the the experience of cooking your own food, I will say save this place for a special occasion. If I was to go back it would be for an anniversary or birthday. Great food, we got the prince Gejas combination, it was delicious and filling.
