What can I say? It's my most favorite restaurant in the city...great food, drinks, decor and atmosphere...reminds me of the Vietnamese restaurants in Paris...uh, only cleaner, nicer decorated, and much more upscale! You cannot go wrong in this place. Get there early and have a drink at the bar upstairs, you'll feel like you're somewhere in Southeast Asia. Then down to dinner and be sure to order the Spring Rolls wrapped in lettuce and mint leaves for appetizer and the Red Snapper for the main course. (The wife says:"forget the red snapper and go for the satay filet mignon!") And don't forget the Vietnamese coffee with your dessert!
