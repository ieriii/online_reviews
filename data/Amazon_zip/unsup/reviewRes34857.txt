OK, this place is awesome. Don't judge it by the outside--because it does fit the description of "hole in the wall," but the inside is very trendy, and there are silent cartoons playing on the wall. The food is just as good as OYSU (or whatever that place I can't pronounce is called on Grant and Wabash), 33% cheaper, and the portions are a good bit larger. The seaweed salad is huge, but that's partly due to the fact that they serve your seaweed on a bed of baby romaine. A little weird, but OK--I won't complain. It's a BYO so make sure you do that if you're so inclined, as the blue-tinged atmosphere is great for deep conversations over your favorite white wine. And guess what--the wait staff speaks American English. Clearly.
