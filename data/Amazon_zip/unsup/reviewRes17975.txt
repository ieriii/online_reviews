Homemade ketchup, some of the best cheese curds around (light batter, not heavy cornmeal), extensive beer list and excellent burgers. I frequent the Bad Apple over Kumas - everything is very reasonably priced, and I don't feel rushed eating here, plus no 2 hour wait. You can't go wrong with any of the burgers - all that I've tried taste wonderful, especially the Chupacabre (goat chili on top), Red Dragon, and The Rueben. Drool...makes me want to go right now.
