A week ago, I brought two friends visiting from out of town to Tank Noodle. This place did not let me down. First thing that we noticed on the way that all restaurants in the hood were empty. Tank noodles was packed. I good sign in my book. Fortunately we were seated immediately at the only available table. We ordered soup, fish and meet dishes. Everything was tasty and we enjoyed our dinner very much. Definitely will be back.
