Always on the hunt for good BBQ in Chicago, I was thrilled when a friend suggested we meet for lunch here on a Sunday. We were one of the very few tables in the place and our service was awesome. Attentive but not overly.  We both ordered the sample from the appetizer menu as my entree and split an order of mac n cheese. Now the mac n cheese was awesome. The sampler came with a small portion of the pulled pork, chicken, and kobe brisket along with a few slices of their cornbread. Maybe for a big dude, the portion would be small but I thought it was perfect. I also love that they don't automatically slather their meats with sauce and instead give you a choice of 3 different sauces. I personally hate sauce so I happily devoured everythings sans sauce. The place is a little pricey but I think there's good value there. The portion sizes that I saw at other tables looked large. My only complaint is that when I ordered a Diet Coke, they gave me a small glass bottle of it. Yes, I know it probably tastes better but I like my dt colas and like free refills. They don't have that here. However, they do have wonderfully square ice. The space itself is pretty nice and would be great for large groups and parties.
