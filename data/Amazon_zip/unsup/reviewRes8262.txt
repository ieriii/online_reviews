Went this time for lunch.  When this place is not at full capacity, they really kick up the service.  Every move I made was noticed.  If I unwrapped a sugar, they were there to take the wrapper.  They came by repeatedly to check on what we may want extra of or which gauchos we preferred to come by.  Every bit of extra attention was given.  The meal was again outstanding.  The salad bar is great, the meat is perfectly seasoned, just fantasticly cooked, could not be better.  Those little rolls are to die for and the polenta sticks are fantastc.   The great thing is that even though you get the same exact meal, you are saving yourself a few bucks by coming during lunch.
