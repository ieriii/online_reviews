Hello Meat? Yeah it's me, Leang calling. I just wanted to tell you how much I love you and that I promise to never become a vegetarian! Our reservation was at 7pm and we didn't get seated until closer to 8pm. I was up speaking with the hostess a couple of times. They didn't do much to compensate for that, especially when I told her that a couple of our friends had to be some place at 9pm. My response that I got was that once we were seated we'd be able to get our food quickly. I should have said that it's not like we wanted to rush. I can understand 15-20 mintues wait, but seriously almost an hour?? Anyways, we didn't have any drinks while waiting because we were originally told that it would only be 10-15 minutes of a wait. I undersatnd the whole concept of it all that it's basically a buffet style with the exception that the meat is brought around on a huge skewer where they slice it off for you. They come and go depending on the color of the red and green chip that they see. Since one of the people in our group is Brazilian they came by anyways. The salad bar had plenty of options that included shrimp and tuna. The salad bar in itself was kind of lacking since there weren't really any tomatoes that I saw or cucumbers and other items. They do have beans and rice that you can get, and they have bananas and mashed potatoes on the table. We did end our meal wih a couple of desserts. There was a papaya like mousse that was okay, but the coconut pie with ice cream was very good. I think I had gotten spoiled at Brazzaz and was sad that they didn't have roasted pineapples. Our server was nice and good with descriptions. I wish that I was more of a meat connoisseur and could distinguish each slice of meat that I had gotten but my favorite was the house special meat. It looks like the shape of a heart when they slice it for you. The filets are more my thing, and some of the meats had really good seasoning. Yes, it's no surprise that I had more meat than anyone else...
