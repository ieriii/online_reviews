This restaurant is like being w/ an extremely hot girl/guy with a nice body, but has a crappy personality. The service is horrible (more on this later), but the food is so good that you always end up coming back.  Their galbi is still one of my favorites of all time (yes, I am Korean)....and some people who don't know much about grilling don't realize that it's not just the quality of the meat, but the quality of the "heat". What does that mean? Well, most korean bbq's allow you to grill your own meat, but is usually on a gas grill or a psuedo-charcoal grill. This place uses real charcoal, which really adds some great smoky flavors. So yes, the ventilation can be a little bad and your clothes will smell like smoke, but that is b/c this is REAL bbq. Their jjigaes are good and their buddae jjigae is the best i've had in chicago. the service, however, is horrible and you just need to learn to accept that. They will not smile, refill your water, check up on you, or even acknowledge anything you say with a nod or an "okay". Is this acceptable? definitely not. But will i keep going there b/c the food is good? totally.  but how do you boost your ability to get good service? a few tips/tricks: * Order kalbi. if everyone just orders soups/jjigaes, you will be treated like scum. Make at least a couple orders of kalbi in addition to your soups. I think a 1/2 order of kalbi per person is a good minimum. * If you plan on ordering beer/soju, do it in the begininng. For some reason, ordering alcohol triggers something in their brain to treat you like a human being. So if you already plan on ordering drinks, do it in the beginning so that you get good service throughout the meal. *Keep the bar low. As with any hot girl/guy with a hot body and crappy personality, quit expecting the personality to magically change. it won't. and neither will their service. Just accept that it is bad and you will just find it amusing.
