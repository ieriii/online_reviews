Went here Saturday morning for brunch and thought it was great! I got the ham and cheese crepe and my husband got the egg, ricotta cheese, and merguez crepe. Both were served with potatoes and some fresh fruit as a garnish. I left satisfied and will definitely be back for the dessert crepes! My only complaint was that the prices shown on the restaurants website are not accurate. The website says that the crepes we got are $6 each when in reality they were $9.25 each.... kinda a big difference there.
