After the Accanto debacle, I informed my three friends to meet me here. It was as if the hospitality heavens open up and rain upon our heads. Complimentary appetizers, desserts, and digestifs ( ok , I'm using French to describe an Italian restaurant) Anywho, I felt like Oprah for a day. My friends and I will never forget that night. Thanks for the experience.
