Just had another of many dinners here this past week. I love the food. It is consistently good. But I will not be going back again soon. After all the times I've eaten here, I have to say that the service has never gotten better. The servers are not friendly and always annoyed when you ask questions. We have never been greeted at the door by a friendly face that seemed happy that we were there (again) to spend lots of money on their food and wine. What's with the attitude? The second issue that is going to keep me from going back is the deafening noise level. It is not "energetic" as some try to spin it. It is conversation un-friendly. It's time for restaurants to get customer-friendly aagain and start using noise-reducing surfaces to encourage conversation. Being with friends and enjoying good food is why we go out to eat. When I want a noisy "scene" I go to a club.
