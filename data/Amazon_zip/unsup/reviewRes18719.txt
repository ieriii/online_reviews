1. They have the best beer list in this neighborhood. Period. That alone earns Bad Apple five stars, as far as I'm concerned. 2. Their food is good. I'm a veg, and their veggie burgers are way better than what most places give you (a Gardenburger with some ketchup). The goat cheese fondue? Ridiculous. I could eat it every day of my life. Man oh man. 3. In my experience, the service here ranges from totally acceptable to really good. In a moderately priced bar/burger place, that's pretty much what I'm looking for. 4. The dcor is a little generic, but whatever - it's never crazy crowded, you can watch the game, and they have a nice (if sort of dark) patio. We don't live around the corner any more, but we happily make the trek down here to drink lots of beer and eat fondue. If we *did* live around the corner, we would be a lot drunker a lot more frequently.
