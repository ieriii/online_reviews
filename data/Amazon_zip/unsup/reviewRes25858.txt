SO glad John, with the Chicago Pizza Tour, decided to put Pequod's on the list during our visit! Out of all the place's we tried, I would have Pequod's any day! It's the only slice I actually finished. MMMM.... The burnt cheesy crust? Crazy good. Plus, it was the only place with Blue Moon on tap. Definitely made me happy after searching for it all day. I understand the whale, but is that a thong on it's head? Why? Maybe we'll go try out Burt's Place today, we'll see how/if it differs =) Thanks, Burt!
