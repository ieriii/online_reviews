I'm an avid omnivore and I tried this place out for the first time last week. My hunny and I were so happy with our experience. The food is sooo delicious, and I'm a HUGE fan of their shakes. It's incredible how tasty they are - and not one drop of cream/milk/ice cream! I highly recommend The Chicago Diner. I cannot way to go back again!
