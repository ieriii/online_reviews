Revised 02/2010 down from 5 *: Menu prices have risen and the food quality has dropped - both significantly. Beet and Fennel salad was weak and Sablefish was overcooked and very dry. They used to accommodate one person going with the 5 course and the other with the 8 course. Not so anymore.  Extremely disappointed overall. This was one of our staple fine-dining restaurants, but I don't think my wife and I will be going back anytime soon. Shin, you really need to step up your game. ----------------------------------------------------- Amazing French/American food at an even more amazing (affordable) price. This is a great place to have dinner for 2 for ~$100. The food is SO imaginative, tasty with excellent presentation. The BYOB policy makes things even better. I have done the 5 course menu a couple of times and loved it every time.  The wait staff is extremely attentive and accommodates special requests. Love this place.
