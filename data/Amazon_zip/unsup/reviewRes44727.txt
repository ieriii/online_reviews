From the vintage Chicago travel posters to the stuffed pizza model upon entering to the friendly waitstaff to the lively dining area with a Cubs game on several televisions - this was a fun experience and a very good dinner.  Having already tried Geno's East, Uno's, and Lou Malnati's by the time my family and I went to this Giordano's location (near the Hyatt Regency where we were staying), I have to admit I was a little "deep-dished-out (yes, it is possible)." Well, fortunately for me, this isn't technically "deep dish," it's Stuffed Pizza. "Semantics," I said - and dove into Giordano's Supreme with a 312 wheat draft beer (a local microbrew selection).  Crust was a bit crunchier than I'd like AND (I can't believe I'm saying this): the pie was almost too big. But the "toppings (I suppose you can't call them that here)" were very good and quite filling.  Good food, good beer, and a good time had by all. So, I suppose Chicago's deep dish version of the Pat's/Gino's Philly cheesesteak rivalry and the Anchor Bar/Duffs Buffalo chicken wing rivalry and the Sal's/Franks New Haven coal oven pizza rivalry will rage on commensurately. Truth be told, I enjoyed sampling all of them - Final Tally: 1st - Geno's East, 2nd - Malnati's, 3rd - Giordano's, 4th - Uno's (good, but hyper-franchised). All good, all worth trying, none disappointing! Enjoy. Next, I'm off to Beijing in August to compare rival Peking Duck restaurants!
