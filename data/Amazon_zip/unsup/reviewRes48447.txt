Went here for brunch and after dining at Blackbird and Avec, I expected more from the food. The atmosphere was unique (set up like a German beer hall) so it felt as if you were back at your college cafeteria. Very loud but that's the point I think. We decided to dine outside (small area but cozy). The famous pretzel was tasty but very salty and it came with mustard sauce that my husband loved and could probably have eaten that by itself. We ordered an omlette which once again, was good but not excellent. I think we were just spoiled with Avec and Blackbird and then thought, "this place must be just as good" and it was not. Very friendly staff though. :) If you want to try it out, just because it has a good name behind it, go for it. You will enjoy your meal, just not be blown away. Great place for a large group inside.
