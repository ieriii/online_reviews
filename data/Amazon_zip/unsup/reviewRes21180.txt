This was the most unpleasant experience I've had at a lunch spot in Chicago.  While we were waiting in the long line to order, the "hostess" came up and told us "she could seat us" in 10-15 minutes. And then she scurried off. While still waiting in the line, we tried to ask her if they accepted debit cards and she curtly said "I can seat you in 10-15 minutes." Uhhh? Que? Eventually we figured out they do take credit cards, and we ordered our food which was expensive but we expected that to a degree. Then the real treat came. The stellar hostess sat us at our seats: two bar stools facing a wall, on the corner. For the next 20 minutes we were bombarded with the cooks leaving the back and going to the cooking line up front. Every single time they bumped into my chair so hard that it nearly shook me out of my chair, and it knocked my purse off and onto the floor. Then they almost soaked my friend's suede coat in the huge pan of precooked/seasoned chicken they were carrying UNCOVERED to the front line (where they would presumably serve it to customers). We moved ourselves to different bar stools facing another wall and unpleasantly situated near the trash can. Notably, none of those cooks or that great hostess ever offered to help us find a better place to eat. They just kept bumpin' and ignorin'. Fantastic. The food did not live up to all the hype. The bread cut the top of my mouth because it was so hard. The salsa was good, but otherwise nothing exciting and definitely not worth the rigmarole we were put through. My friend didn't even finish her sandwich as she was so unimpressed. And my cookie was overcooked. Save your money and your nerves. Go somewhere else.
