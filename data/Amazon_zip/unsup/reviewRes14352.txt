All I can say is I'll be back. I'd heard of Glenn's Diner for a while but for some reason I thought it was a grilled cheese kind of place and had no idea until today that they are known for their fish. They have a big selection of fish dishes, appetizers, and pastas. I had sole and my friend had catfish. We loved our meals. Everything was fresh and delicious. I even liked the little potatos they put on the side of the fish which is generally something I ignore because they are cold, boring, and not worth the carbs. It is one of those places that has good food and can still be all things to all people--egg dishes, salads, diner food, and wonderful fish with all types of amazing sounding sauces.They also had a great selection of beers that I had never seen before. Prices were reasonable. The servers were friendly. The diners seemed like a laid back kind of crowd. I can see why it is so busy on weekends.
