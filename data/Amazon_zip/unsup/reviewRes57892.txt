We recently went for dinner. We went early, around 6, and there were not many people there but the place filled up before we had left. The waitstaff were very nice and offered suggestions. We tried an appetizer also that was very good. This was my first time eating Ethiopian and I am not totally hooked, but I think this place served very good food and the price seemed reasonable. Kid Friendly - Yes. The waitstaff all talked to our son. They assisted with the high chair and made sure he was enjoying himself. We went for my sons birthday and they found that out and gave him a free dessert of his choice. The place was pretty quiet when we got there and I was a bit worried about our son making noises - but overall everything worked out on this end!
