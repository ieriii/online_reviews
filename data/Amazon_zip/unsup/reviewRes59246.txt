I can't believe I got such a great Peking duck meal for $32. Three people can feast on the duck, soup and fried rice. Best meal deal in Chicago. However, the takeout service is atrocious. They mixed up our order pretty badly ... the person taking the order over the phone spoke English perfectly...the person behind the pickup counter didn't and was totally confused. It wasn't until we got home that we realized we only had three out of the five dishes we ordered. Five stars for the food. Zero for the service.
