This is the only place in the world where I can eat eggplant. My fav is the Salmon and Adass Polo and Kash-ke. The selection of wines is awesome too. The Riesling is gr8! They don't take reservations but if its a big group and you call in advance the staff will take care of you. Love this family owned restaurant they made us feel at home!
