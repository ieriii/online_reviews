My country friends decided they wanted to try a Chicago hot dog...so I figured why not, I'll show 'em this place. We did the drive in experience, the whole bring it out to the car then make my car a mess thing. The whole time remembering not to slam the car doors and oh don't forget there is a tray on that window. Yeah, that experience. I think you just have to go for the novelty of it and if you wanted to say, " hey, I was there" next time you see it on FoodTV or the Travel Channel.  I will say this. The food is always good, no matter what time of day it is. The service was great. Granted at 11PM on a Saturday night it wasn't that busy.  And seriously, is that not the greenest relish ever?! FYI...this place is cash only. Which can be kind of a bummer when you're on your way home from a day in the city.
