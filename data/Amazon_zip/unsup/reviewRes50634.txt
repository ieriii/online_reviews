Came here with my roommate and another one of our friends. Definately a place you would go on a date, it's that kind of vibe. That said, it was good. For an appetizer we got fried green tomatoes and they were really good. Lightly fried, not too much breading, they had these small, pickled shrimp on top that were quite tasty, and the sauce was also very tasty. Fresh ingredients go a long way. My friend got the roasted chicken for her entree, and I pretty much ate the 1/2 that she didn't. It was good, moist, meaty chicken, pretty much exactly what you'd want. My roommate and I both got the shrimp and grits. Aside from the portion size, which was small, it was excellent. Perfectly cooked shrimp, the tasso gravy was great, and the grits, oh my the grits! If I could mainline cheesy grits I would, and at Big Jones they were great. Out with friends, or on a date, this place is great! Redux: Went back, had the gumbo, had the fried green tomatoes again, so good. Big Jones is worth the trip.
