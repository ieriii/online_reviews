I started watching "Mexico: One Plate At A Time" over the summer and decided it was high time to go to find out what all the fuss is about! We started out with Topolo Margaritas which were very good, really smooth, tasted perfect. For appetizers we had guacamole (very good) and my bf had the Gazpacho Fronterizo.... WOW. That was amazing. I wish I had gotten a bowl for myself. It was so tasty and crisp, and thank god the recipe is online because I could easily have that with dinner every night. Main course: I had the Mixiotes de la Hortaliza which was spicier than I thought it would be (I'm not really into anything that hot) but it was really good. I actually had a few of my bf's tortillas with it, which helped soothe my hot mouth and were actually a good addition anyway. I mean, I would have eaten the tortillas by themselves...so warm and fresh, mmm! My bf had the goat special whose name I can't remember (and it's not on the website, but it was the Tuesday night special), and he really liked that as well. We were pretty stuffed after that so we didn't have dessert but the menu looked really good. My only complaint: we knew ahead of time that we would be waiting, which was fine. The problem is that there really wasn't anywhere TO wait. Your options are to stand in the foyer or hang out at the bar and hope someone leaves. But they serve food there so most people are in for the long haul, and there's not a lot of room to hover and wait for someone to get up; the waiters are trying to serve and the bathroom is on the other side. A better flow of traffic and a traditional bar (drinks only, tables to stand at) would help immensely. Heck, just buy up the rest of the block and expand all three restaurants.
