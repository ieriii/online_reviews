If you like really cheesy pizza, this is not the place to go. My friend and I showed up on a snowy weekday night. Little did we know that there was a game going on so the place was packed. The wait time? At least an hour. We quickly nixed that plan got take out since I lived pretty close by. I got the pizza home and there were under the crust, there was a solid inch of cheeseless sauce :( ... Did I mention I like cheesy pizza?
