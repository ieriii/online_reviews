Best pizza in Chicago, in my opinion. I've had New Haven style pizza in New Haven and it's better but not by much. Try the Clam and Bacon white pizza and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  The appetizer menu is limited but everything on it tastes great. The beers are really nice... you can grab a "growler" with your takeout order and swig it from the bottle like a mountain man on the walk home.  Seriously, if you hate Chicago-style pizza like I do, check into Piece and you'll want to kiss me. Full on the mouth. With clam and bacon breath.
