Great churrascaria in Chicago (Although haven't been to other in Chicago, including Fogo; but have been to many in Brazil, New York and other places). Excellent ambiance and serice, large wine list with acrobat in the cellar (you'll see), large salad bar (one of the best I'm told), and the meat is great. It is a bit pricey for dinner at $44/person. We had a 50% off coupon which made it a great deal. I would return with one of those or for lunch; not sure I'd pay full price. Would probably rate it higher if it wasn't a buffet...in general they make me sick (probably my fault).
