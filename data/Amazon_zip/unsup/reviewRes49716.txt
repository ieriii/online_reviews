Okay... This place is Tango Sur minus the wait, and minus the service issues. We walked in and our waiter, from the beginning, was awesome. He explained everything, offered suggestions, and we had an awesome meal. My boyfriend, not a steak eater at all, was talked into ordering the skirt steak. And......he loved it. I had the chicken, and it was also really great. We'd love to go back. Environment: comfortable Food: Very good Service: Excellent Hey, I still think Tango Sur has better food, but I'd definitely come back here to avoid the wait. Very good.
