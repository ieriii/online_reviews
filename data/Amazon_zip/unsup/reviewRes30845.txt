I first learned about Nana in an email from Tasting Table Chicago. It sounded like my kind of place! The only problem is there's no easy way via public transportation to get there. I first experienced Nana at Baconfest Chicago 2011. They had a bacon caramel chocolate candy bar that was TO DIE FOR! It was one of the best things there! After that, I knew I HAD to eat there. My boyfriend and I took a Zip Car and went there for brunch one day. They have a smaller menu but everything sounded amazing. They have a very unique dishes which I appreciated. Sadly they didn't have any of those bacon candy bars. They did tell us that they sometimes have them so be sure to ask! Service was great, there was no wait, and I loved the atmosphere. If it were closer I would definitely be back more often!
