I agree with Julie A. The food here is pretty tasty, but pricey. Although I should probably preface this with the fact that I like my hot dogs and cheeseburgers plain... no fancy stuff! Which means that the meat needs to taste good on it's own without being smothered in stuff. I love the fries and the shakes. The drive-in part is pretty cool... the kids tend to like it... as long as you can control the possible mess in your car. But... it is pretty expensive. I guess it's in part because of the "experience". Good place... just maybe not an everyday hot dog joint.
