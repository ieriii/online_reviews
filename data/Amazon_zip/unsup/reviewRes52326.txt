On our trip to Chicago, we needed pizza. We went to Gino's because my boyfriend had gone to Jordano's and wanted to compare Gino's. In my opinion, the pizza was very good. I had said I was only going to have one slice as it was pretty big in size. I had two large slices. There was a good amount of cheese and all of the great ingredients. We also ordered a Harvest Salad. I have had this salad at different places, but have never seen almost complete apples on the salad. I thought I needed an iron chef knife to cut the salad. The raspberry dressing was very good, but the incredibly large pieces of apple looked like they were prepared for a Sangria festival. I have to admit that I have to be bias as for the most part, many San Diego servers, waiters, ect are with some type of smile on their face. I have yet to see a cashier, waiter (expect at Dikta's) or server with some sense of happiness. I get the feeling that there are a lot of court-ordered volunteer position. I am sure that all of this staff that I ran into are getting a paycheck. They have got to have some customer service orientation. Gino's has the most depressed staff that I have ever seen. It does not hurt to smile or refresh my drink without me asking 50 times. I have given this a level of good (at the very least) customer service if you can ask me if I want refill or refill my drink without me having to do the Heimlich on myself.
