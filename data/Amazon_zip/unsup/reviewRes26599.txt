This place was very small and cozy, my partner and I got a great table by the window. That night, our waitress was extremely attentive and was always ready whenever we needed anything. When I got the menu I was rather shock to see that this so called "Simple" place was a tad bit expensive. Seriously $13 for a simple chicken dish (with literally 6 fine slices of chicken and tons of vegetables), what a jip! The only thing I saw for a reasonable price was the Pho, it was around $6.95, so we ended up getting it. I order the beef pho, and my partner got the chicken pho and it turned out really good. Last, I thought it was cool that they give u complimentary grapes with your check and I would probably go back if I was in the area.
