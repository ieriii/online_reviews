So let me start by saying I have always had great service here and I work as a server in Andersonville as well so I know how good service is and how bad service is and my server (a guy named Ray) was so rude to me and my friend when we came in for lunch. First my friend asked how much the bloody Mary was and he said "oh I couldn't tell you" and then she asked if he could find out and he said "sorry I can't". Wtf right? Then he brought me out the wrong martini - I had two sips before I realized this and when I flagged him over to tell him he said "well I can't switch it you've already dranken half of it" and walked away. What?!?! I had two sips - literally! So we had to get the hostess and tell her what happened so he takes my cocktail and then brings me the SAME martini that I didn't want but remade to me! He was incompetent and so rude! No idea how he has a job there still but if I was managing that place if get rid of a server who treated customers like he did.
