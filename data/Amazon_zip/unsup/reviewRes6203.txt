The atmosphere is great here. Definitely make reservations in advance as it get quite busy. The service has been great both visits. We've been here twice now and it's always been very good. My husband loves their steaks. Their servings are really big, so be careful not to fill up on their delicious wine selection and/or bread. I only rated Wildfire three stars because I like to eat with more variety and although their food is excellent, it's just not too exciting for my taste buds.
