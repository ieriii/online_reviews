Was here on Mother's day for a 7pm reservation and the place was not very crowded. The ambiance was on the romantic side possibly due to the occasion. SERVICE: average/below average (owner was very nice though) FOOD: meh. seafood risotto had a lot of seafood. lobster ravioli has NO lobster in it. it tasted like an Italian tamale. for a $22 dish called lobster ravioli i expect to see and taste lobster. PRICE: used a groupon (without the groupon I think this place was overpriced) EXPECT a traditional style Italian meal.....very slow and drawn out. It can easily take over 90 minutes for an app, salad, entree and desert for two people.
