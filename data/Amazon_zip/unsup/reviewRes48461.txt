I hate to buck the 4 star trend here but there was really very little that I enjoyed about Publican. The good - beer list, hamachi crudo and the oysters. The bad, everything else. To be specific, Service was rushed. How quickly can I turn this table? After dropping the check off, I am sure I saw our server walk by 7x eyeing whether I dropped my card, the crew asked more than once if we were waiting for desert or to pay and then proceeded to try to take away what were two very obviously filled wine glasses and then no sooner did I pull my card from the wallet our server was there with the check off the table and the other hand out waiting for me to place it in his hand. As for the food, I listed the okay above, however, the meat dishes, in my opinion were all pre-cooked and reheated. The outsides were warm, however, on just about everything we ate the centers were incredibly cool (first sign) and what was not cool, was incredibly dry (second sign), the kind of dry that you only get when you re-heat something in the microwave or oven. There are so many other places to drop over $200 in Chicago and many alot better for half that #.
