I've ordered food from Irazu either from the on-site guys, SeamlessWeb, or direct from Irazu for delivery. Not a fan of their burritos or sandwiches, but their tacos are fairly good - complete with the meat, lettuce and tomatoes - oh yeah, their salsa is also very good (IMNSHO), almost comparable to El Faro. I've consistently order nothing but tacos from this place, and its been consistent, quality-wise. My verdict is pending other items I need to try, but at least for delivery, they are very good - SeamlessWeb does well, albeit expensive ($-ouch), and direct delivery is greeted by a pleasant lady who took my order, and delivery regardless of ordering method was good too. If their other items are as consistent as their tacos, I may upgrade to 4/5. Plus, I actually have to go to this place and dine-in too. Pending further review and food items...
