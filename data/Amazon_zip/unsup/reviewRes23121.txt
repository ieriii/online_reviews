The steak sandwich with avocado is the meal of choice for me here. It's a sure thing and I don't think I have ever ordered anything else because it is just too darn good! We also had the empanadas as an appetizer and they were very tasty. An oatmeal shake is a must as well! Steak sandwich= $4.95 + .50 for avocado...can't beat that price!
