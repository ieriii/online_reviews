Honestly, not really worth all of the hype considering the amount of time it takes to just get into this joint. Yes, I still had a nice time--yes the drinks were stiff and good--yes it was neto looking inside--and YES it was just too damn cool... But seriously, I couldn't imagine taking a date here. It's such a chick hangout--with mostly chick drinks--and I don't mean any disrespect! I usually have a taste for the well mixed tom collins and the likes when I go out anyway--and after all I am a chick! But I really don't think your special man-friend would appreciate the nitpicking--or albeit, the wait in general! It takes about 15-20 min. for your drinks to get mixed--and then multiply that by about 3 drinks--plus the wait outside...I can sort of appreciate it--but I think it's just too much for a straight guy to handle! I will reiterate, I did enjoy the drinks very much. They weren't cheap--but they were very very good. I'm a practical gal however--and I appreciate swiftness when it comes to my booze. So..take your girls here, come here for a birthday or something--but skip the man-friend. It will be like taking him to Ikea on your first date!
