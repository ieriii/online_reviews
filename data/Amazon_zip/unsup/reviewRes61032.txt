Blackened Chicken is my dish here. Everything about the restaurant is just very good. The atmosphere, the food, the service, it all rocks. They even offer a 15% discount to people who bike there. There are three specific things that knock it down from 5 to 4 stars. 1. If you are going to want anything after they bring you your food (like ketchup) you have to really wave them down. They get busy and are continuously running around. 2. There is an odd break between lunch and dinner at 3-5pm on weekdays. If you forget about it and decide to eat a late lunch/early dinner you'd be disappointed. 3. Their full menu isn't served on weekends (I can't get my blackened chicken).
