While it wasn't quite what I expected, my family and I had a great time at the Hard Rock Hotel, and it was perfect for celebrating my son's 16th birthday. It was a guitar-loving teenager's dream to be able to check out a guitar and take to our room! I did expect the "rock star" theme to be more extreme than it was, as it was a bit subdued, yet tasteful. The entrance was small, dark and had loud music blaring, which was a bit odd, but yet made us feel like we were in for a good time. It was fun to go floor to floor to see which rock star was featured there and to see some memorabilia.  The room was stylishly decorated. However, it was quite dark in the hallway, and especially the bathroom which made it very difficult for my husband to shave and me to get ready in the morning. There is a very dimly-lit makeup mirror that did little to no good. The beds and pillows were very comfy. My main complaint in the room was the windows - they did very little to drown out the street noise and we were 22 stories high! Drawing the curtains did offer some help, but the blaring sirens that we heard throughout the night sounded like they were right in the room with us. Staff was friendly, concierge was extremely helpful, valet was professional. We had to wait well beyond check-in time for our room to be ready which was a pain, but they gave my husband some free drink tickets to use while we waited. Too bad the free drinks didn't help us as it was a family trip and we aren't big drinkers. Overall it was a good experience, made especially good by spending time with my awesome family.
