Can pizza be too-stuffed? Before coming here, I'd not have even known what that question meant. Now we can answer it with a firm "no, it can't. Please stuff it as much as possible." And they do. We only had a few hours in Chicago, so we went shopping, to the bean and Grant park, walked on the river/waterfront, and went to Navy Pier. This was our idea of the perfect place to stop for one meal in the city. We came because of the Yelp ratings we saw on our mobile app- we had no idea it was such a popular Chicago spot for visitors. We arrived at peak lunch hour and were seated right away (which is not a reason to give or take away stars, just a fact). Service was quick. We ordered a no cheese 10' veggie supreme stuffed crust. It was delish. He ordered a personal size cheese and pepperoni and really liked it, but we liked the veggie better. We also had the fried zucchini as an app. Everything was excellent. Nothing was greasy, which I was pleased with. This pizza was so filling, even with no cheese. We couldn't finish the whole 10'. We took the rest to go and ate it for dinner, cold. It was lovely that way as well.
