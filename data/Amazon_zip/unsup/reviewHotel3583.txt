I really wanted this hotel to be better than it was, but we were a little disappointed. Being such a Chicago landmark, I thought it was going to be as neat as the Intercontinental. The Drake has really old, impressive finishes and the workout room is super impressive (weird comment, I know, but there were wood arched ceilings in there and it was HUGE). But we were really hoping there would be a hot tub (which there wasn't), the fridge in our room was smelly, and they don't let you open the window. Plus we had room service knock on our room twice while we were there, which made us feel like they were trying to hurry us out. Overall, if I were going to pick an old Chicago hotel to stay in, I think I'd still pick the Intercontinental.
