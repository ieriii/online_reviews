Pizza is pretty authentic to what they serve in BR. Staff was nice and attentive. Also tried the coxinhas, very yumm! Don't come here thinking that you will have some "Chicago" style pizza. This may be why some reviewers gave it less than positive reviews. Do come here if you have an adventurous palate. Only gripe I have is it's kinda small but and no "olho de alho." My favorite pizza condiment in Brasil. p.s. The staff mentioned that they will accept orders for desert pizzas. So if you're feeling really adventurous ask if they can prepare a "Romeo e Julieta." Good stuff.
