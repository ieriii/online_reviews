Honestly, this place is little more than a glorified IHOP. The bananas foster crepes I had were tasty, though the crepes had more of that "reheated" look than "fresh off the griddle", and my companion complained that edges of her veggie wrap (the wrap itself) were dry. Overall, the food was okay, but definitely nothing to get excited about. I would never come here on a weekend; we came in around 10:30am on a Wednesday, and the majority of the place was empty. Service was fast and efficient.  The prices were expensive for what it is, but it is downtown. The decoration was probably its biggest plus: I loved the lighting fixtures and elegant metal sculptures adorning each table. The rest was cheerful and full of pleasing color, appropriate for a breakfast place .
