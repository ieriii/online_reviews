UPDATE: They earned a second star by having EXCELLENT post-visit customer service. (wait, you know it's bad when there's a follow-up). Wow, so fun.  Everybody in Chicago seems to be so gaga over this place and amped up to write good things (professional writers, not just yelpies) that they forget to look at the menu. It's boring, plain, more of the same. Really, I'm sick of it. Brioche Twinkie croutons? so ingenious. brilliant. waste of a good brioche. Stroganoff? Poor beef stew, at best. Campbells? this is better in a school cafeteria. jail. Skate? flavorless. pea tendril juice don't carry you through... Salmon with 'pancetta'? I swear those coils of thin, flattened bacon come from a fast food breakfast sandwich, not a fancy italian piggy. Now that you're smiling, please take my advice: don't make a reservation via Internet. 3 emails to confirm, 1 additional phone call confirmation - I arrived on time (+3 minutes) for my reservation, and was asked to wait 25 more minutes for my table. If you're going to harass me, promise that you'll have my table when I arrive. Also, 8:30 on a Sunday night ain't exactly boom-time. And DO NOT snicker with your co-hostess when your guests are upset. Amateurs. And turn the fucking music down, is this a bistro-disco? the wanna-gastro of '08. don't bother.
