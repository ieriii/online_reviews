I think I left about $4 of my Gage cocktail (Grey Goose Poire, apple cider, Aperol) in the glass because we were rushing. I'm very bummed about that. It was yummy. And $12.  Many other items on the menu (both drink and food) looked tempting...I wonder if I can convince mom to take me back there this week.
