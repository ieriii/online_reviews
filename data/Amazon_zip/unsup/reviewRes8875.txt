I was a bit torn on whether to give Noon O Kabab 3 or 4 stars. My challenge was that the food was fresh and well prepared, just not to my taste. I have enjoyed many a meal in the Middle Eastern category. The Persian variety must have been new to me. I found it very sweet and my tastes prefer the spicy - both in flavor and heat. My entree was the vegetarian Persian specialty. The staff was lovely and the ambiance equally so. While we were seated immediately, the restaurant was quickly packed with a wait. I can see how Noon O Kabab deserves its popularity. We found parking on the street fairly easily.
