YUM YUM YUM...ive been going to opart thai for about 8 years now and i love it there. its cozy, the food is always rockingand the service (even though they do get really busy sometimes) is friendly and fun. i have to mention that i see yuppies going in there and complaining (while their baby is crying) that their food is taking a little long. i want everyone who reads this review to realize that its a small joint and there are only a couple of servers there, which is perfectly fine for such a place. i love their dumplings, pad kraw prow and their curry...YUM
