Yolk is ummm..YUMMY!! Many people know that I love breakfast and this place did not disappoint. The atmosphere is open and very casual. I can see how it can be a great place for breakfast in the Spring and Summer.  It seems like a great place to spend more time than usual chatting, after you eaten breakfast, over coffee. I can't wait to go back and try a few other things on the menu.
