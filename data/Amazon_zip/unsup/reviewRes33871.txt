My friend and I were looking for a nice place for dinner while she was in town and we found Mia Francesca on Yelp. I can't say anymore than what the other reviews have stated. It's just a great restaurant to bring friends, family, or a date. The food was flavorful and the staff was attentive. I don't know much about wine, but their selection is decent. The space is a little small but that's Chicago for you. We split the Bruschetta. The mozzarella was amazing, but the tomatoes were a little bland. I ordered the tilapia, which was delicious. I'm actually not a fan of tilapia (don't ask me why I ordered it), but it was cooked to perfection and absolutely swimming with flavor (no pun intended). I was boring and got the creme brulee for dessert, but the Banana bread pudding my friend had was very good and not too strong on the banana. Overall, I recommend giving this place a chance and do make reservations!
