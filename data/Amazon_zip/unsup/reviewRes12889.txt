went for dinner about six weeks ago after a strange theatre experience around the corner.  food is kind of hit-or-miss.  my dish was plated beautifully, but lacked in flavor. the croquettes that a friend ordered were divine.  wine list is pretty good, and the dessert was nice. plus, we were a walk-in of 9 and they seated us quickly with no question.  some things on the menu are over priced in my opinion.  i think i'll keep cafe 28 in mind for northside brunching, but skip dins in the future.
