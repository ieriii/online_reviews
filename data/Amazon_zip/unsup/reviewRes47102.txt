I love, love, love this place!! I have been going to the Wrigleyville location for about the last 7 years. The meatloaf wrapped in bacon topped with mashed potatoes, spinach and sauteed onions initially won me over. Comfort organic - I love it. I have now been going to the Edgewater location since it opened and I think its doubly amazing!  Everyone who works there is always very pleasant. Because there is usually a full house, it does take a bit longer sometimes, but it is worth it. I use any and every excuse to go there. For appetizers, the korean calamari is great but the artichoke, goat cheese & pesto dip is amazing! The sweet potato fries are good too. The chicken breast and the pork chops are fantastic entrees but there are times where we will have everyone at the table ordering the meatloaf. One of my best friends swears by the mac and cheese as well. And if you have room, you should really try dessert. I have also become addicted to their brunch. I usually get the breakfast melt because everything just fits together so well . The montana omelet is great too. I have also tried the chorizo chilaquiles and the huevos (which I did not think I would like at all) and they were definitely tasty. One day, the woman next to me had one of their specials (I think it was crispy pork eggs benedict) and she was raving about it the entire meal. Their orange juice is freshly squeezed and delicious and sometimes I have to get the neal cassady coffee. They bring it to the table with this huge swimming pool cup full of strong maple coffee and a shot of whiskey that is perfect when you combine them.  Drinks are great there - it's fun just to go sit at the bar as well. And the bartenders are nice about making a concoction that is more to your liking. I just genuinely like this place. Great food and great atmosphere.
