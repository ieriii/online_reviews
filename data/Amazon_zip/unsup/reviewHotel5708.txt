I can see how some people may have had a negative experience at this hotel; it is definitely no frills -- negligible "lobby," smaller rooms with the bare essentials, no room service or view. But my experience was lovely for what I needed: a fabulous rate in a great location (half a block from Michigan Ave, right on the river), clean and contemporary rooms, and free bottled water!! Great for all the walking and sightseeing we did!  If you are fine with a no frills yet modern and comfortable room, this is a great hotel!!
