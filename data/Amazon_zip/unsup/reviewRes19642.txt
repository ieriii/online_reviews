I don't even know if another review for Coast is necessary seeing as how there are well over a hundred. Came on Sunday a little after six, and I was beyond happy that there was no wait. I was a bit afraid as this was a fairly regular complaint amongst everyone. Great ambiance, although I think the tables are a bit too close for comfort.  Food was delish! We had a few specialty rolls and each was interesting and a great combination. Corkage fee of $5 or if you ave. $15/person in your group, they waive the corkage fee. I'll definitely be back!
