Unphokin' believable!! Me and Tank are now BFP... best friend phoever!! I don't want to commit a faux pas so that's the last pho pun. Faux pas; pho pun... no? Not working for you? Eh, I tried. Someday I'll eat something other than pho. I promise. Someday but just not today... or tomorrow... and maybe not next week. Why try to fix what isn't broken? Tank's pho is simply amazing. Love in a bowl. Hot, steamy, meaty love in a bowl. I am nearly drooling now just thinking about it and I just ate it last night for dinner!! I had it over the weekend too... and sometime last week... and will again in the near future. Mind blowing broth, scrumptious meatballs, thin sliced beef, crispy sprouts, aromatic basil, hot peppers, soft noodles... The service is typical for Asian restaurants, in my opinion. Hit or miss. Mostly I have had good experiences with service here but have had one or two lacking experiences. They service has never been rude but has sometimes been rather slow; however, once you place your order the food is delivered incredibly quick and piping hot!! Tank is a definite HELLZ YEAH for those who love pho. For those who don't love pho, well, there's other stuff on the menu too so let me know how that goes. Bye bye pho now!!
