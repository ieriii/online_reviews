So we decided to check this place out for the first time today, and went for lunch around 1:15 p.m. It was almost empty, but looked nice inside. The menu looked decent, if somewhat limited, but when we ordered, one of us wanted to get the 3-course prix fixe, while the other only wanted an entree. Our waiter, who was very nice, told us that if anyone wanted the prix fixe, everyone at the table had to order it. That doesn't seem to make sense, but more to the point, that isn't written on the menu. We asked the waiter to ask the chef/owner about that, and after several requests, the chef/owner, a pale little man, came to our table, looking a bit put out that we were being so bothersome. He was rather snippy and condescending, and told us that this was his policy, and that it would be printed on the next iteration of the menus. He told us that if there were 10 people at our table, all 10 would have to order the prix fixe, or nobody could. Instead of being in any way accommodating, he basically told us that if we didn't play by his (unadvertised) rules, that was our problem. Pretty bad business sense, if you ask me, as we picked up, left a few bucks for the waiter, and told him we wouldn't be back. I don't care how good the food may be at this place, when the owner acts like a snippy little diva, he's not getting my business. There are too many good and friendly places in Andersonville to waste your time or money at this place!
