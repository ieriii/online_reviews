Food is what I would say is the best aspect of this place for me, just winning at the finish line over their vast beer selecton. The pommes frites, duck reuben, and CB&J particularly stand out for me. Beer selection is of course great here, but I've been more and more feeling pulled towards other beer bars when I want to drink something new. If smoking wasn't banned entirely on the back patio, I'd give it an additional star. They also hardly ever open the upstairs bar area anymore(easily my fav part of the place, and I'll dare say its underrated), which is a damn shame.
