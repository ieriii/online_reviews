Talk about meat city. I guess my ex and I went on a bad night. The pork was so dry I had to keep downing the red wine to not get cotton mouth. I never saw a fillet either. I'm still giving it 5 stars. It may have just been an off night. I still thoroughly enjoyed myself. The salad bar alone is enough to get full on. This ain't no Ponderosa salad bar either. It's a-ma-zing. I hear if you just want that, it's half price. As apposed to the $50 a person "entry" fee for the meat. I love it. Now I dated a Brasilian for quite some time, and I never had anything this good with him. Era alimento realmente bom. God bless BRASIL.
