We were visiting a friend of our and she recommended this place. I was concerned because I had my dog with me so I called the restaurant which had no problem with it as long as I was outside. I thought that was great on their part. Anyway we ordered the Empanadas , Pollo Sandwich, and Steak dinner. All were amazing. That plus 2 drinks were under 25 bucks, which is great in my eyes. Food and service were great. No empanadas were left for the pup, bummer.
