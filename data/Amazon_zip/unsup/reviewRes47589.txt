I have to give this place a 5 star. Great food! Gorgeous ambiance! Friendly staff and great service! I would even just go there for the salad bar..my favorite was the salmon ceviche. It was amazing, and of course the meat that comes around is really good too. Great for all occasions. Well worth the $$
