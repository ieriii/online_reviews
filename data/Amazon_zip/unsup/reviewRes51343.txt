This place is great. The burritos here were gigantic and a fantastic value. They were not too greasy and filled me up in just the right way. I cannot recommend the avocado burrito enough for people who are a fan of avocados; they literally put two whole fruits in it. I have two complaints: The margaritas were not cheap and kind of weak. I could be wrong but I am pretty sure they use a mix. Not a classy decision. Secondly, the decor and lighting gives the place a gloomy cafeteria vibe. This is not a place to have a romantic date.
