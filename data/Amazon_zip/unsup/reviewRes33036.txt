This place was great. The restaurant is very pretty. It was quiet (there were only a few tables of people dining on a Thursday night). The owner served us and made us feel quite welcome. The food was fantastic! I can't believe I've passed this place almost every day for years and never tried it out until last night. I think it's going to be one of my new favorite local restaurants!
