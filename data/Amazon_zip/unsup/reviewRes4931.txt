This was unexpectedly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Popped in here late yesterday afternoon and had the calamari, shaved brussels sprouts, cauliflower, prosciutto, skate wing and the feta and cucumber smear, and each thing was more ridiculously delicious than the last. I've never seen calamari done like this...it wasn't fried (was it raw?) and was mixed with couscous and nuts and something else. Could not stop eating it, is the point I'm trying to make here. This restaurant could make me rethink my NY superiority complex.
