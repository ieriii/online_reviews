Anteprima was one of the best meals that I have ever had, no exaggeration. I don't often go out to pricey dinners but I just may based off of the food here. I wish I could remember exactly what my date and I ordered but I can not and their website's current menu is not what we saw New Year's Eve.  We ordered off of their custom drink menu, shared an appetizer and each had an entree and everything was fantastic. My girlfriend and I are suckers for anything squash or sweet potato related and Anteprima's offerings were definetly worth the money. Food: 10 Atmosphere: 6 (It's cramped and noisy but most places are) Service: 7 (Nothing special)
