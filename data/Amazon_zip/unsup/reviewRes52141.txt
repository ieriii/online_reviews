I have recently moved to Chicago from California for school and I was soooo excited to try authentic Chicago style pizza after experiencing Little Star in San Francisco and Zachary's in Berkeley.... but GAH, after the super long wait in the rain at 2pm... I was expecting amazingness. However, I was super disappointed. We ordered the Gino's East Supreme (which came with pepperoni, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms) and a Chicken Pesto salad (chicken with walnut pesto sauce, greens, roasted red peppers and black olives) to share since we were told that wait for the pizza to cook would be about 40 minutes. The salad was good though the "greens" were just iceberg lettuce and some were kinda wilty. I liked how they didn't drench the salad with dressing and it was a good starter. It also came with garlic breadsticks which are always good. After what seemed like forever.... though I guess staring at the graffitied walls helped pass the time... our pizza finally came and it was sliced and served to us by our waiter. After eagerly digging in, I was sad to find it was not as good as I had expected. Too much dough, too much cheese, and not enough toppings at all. The ingredients didn't even taste fresh or of good quality like I had back at home in California. It was just bleh... Boo...I guess I'll have to get my deep dish fix whenever I visit back home!!
