Fantastico! We had a group of around 5 and everyone seemed to have some dietary requirement - not so much as a health concern, but an "I just had Italian," or some such. Two of the people in our party had ordered food from Calo many times. I only just moved near the area, so was anxious to discover different restaurants. We almost wound up at Hamburger Mary's, which I'd already been to and liked, but wasn't thrilled with going to again. Then I read on a sign across the street "Italian AND American food." I pointed this out because I could very well have had some Italian and those who didn't want that could order another dish on the menu, thanks to their brilliance in offering "American" along with Italian. From the moment we stepped in, it was warm, welcoming and very inviting. We sat at a nice round table that was comfortable and made it possible for everyone to be engaged. The menu selections were great -- from classic Italian dishes to specials. I chose the baby back rib special -- and for only $12.95 it was truly awesome. Started with soup or salad; could have pasta or baked potato. The pasta I ordered with meat sauce was extraordinary - full of flavor! The ribs were succulent and tender. The portions were so large I could easily get 2 more meals out of what I ordered. The bread they served was truly outstanding! There was some pizza type bread along with plain bread that was so good we had to get a refill.  The dining experience at this restaurant was one of the best I've ever had. The service was outstanding - they truly know what they are doing. They were attentive without being intrusive, the food is prepared deliciously and the ambiance was exemplary. I will definitely be back again soon and can't wait to try all of the items on the menu!
