Oh. My. Goodness. I've been hearing about this place for ages, and I finally ordered it last night. Holy cheese and deliciousness! We shared a large (ha!) stuffed, pepperoni pizza. Never in my entire life have I had ONE piece of pizza and been so full I felt icky. But the GOOD kind of icky where I desparately wanted to eat another piece because it was so cheesy and good! This pizza was phenomenal. Buttery crust, delicious cheese, perfectly spicy pepperoni.  And what a deal! I mean, a large will feed me and my bf for three meals, easy! PLUS if you spend $15 or more on delivery, they give you a free pop (and anyone who knows me, knows I love my free stuff, AKA wampum!!!) If you enjoy a thick slice of pie, pizza pie that is, you MUST try this place. It's so good, you'll make yourself sick;)  Totally worth it!
