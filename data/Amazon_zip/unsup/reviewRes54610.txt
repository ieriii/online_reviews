Best quick falafel, schwarma and hummus you will find on the near northside of Chicago.  The prices are ridiculously cheap. You could eat EASILY for two lunches for under 10 bucks. Haven't tried the kabobs yet but that's next on my list after I get over my schwarma, rice, and hummus lunch special fix.  Love it.
