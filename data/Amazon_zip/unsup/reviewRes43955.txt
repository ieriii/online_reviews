love this place! not a whole lot of seating, but the swivel stools they do have are right next to a big window, so it's great ppl-watching if you manage to snag a seat. if all the seats are full, take your treat to the park next door and watch a bare-handed soccer game or sit by the fountain. i've only tried the cookies here, but they're ALL good: choc. chip; choc. chip + cherry; choc. coookie w/marshmallow & peanut butter chips. also fresh-squeezed oj and grapefruit juice. service is friendly; just a great, happy place.
