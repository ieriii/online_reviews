Been here a couple times in the past month and I think I'll continue to go here when in the neighborhood, but I do not think I would make the journey to pilsen to eat here alone. It's good but not fantastic and the wait times can get a little ridiculous. It's traditional mexican, lower quality ingredients prepared well and priced to move. The guacamole is super super green and basically just avocados, it's good once you mix in some salsa. The fajitas are good and the homemade tortillas it's served with are great. The fact that they serve a free appetizer with the meal besides chips and salsa still kind of baffle me. One time it was chicken soup and the other some kind of bean pork tortilla app.  Again for the price and tastiness of the food it's pretty good, but it's not amazing. I'm sure I'll be here again sometime in the future.
