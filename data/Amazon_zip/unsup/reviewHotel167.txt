Great location for a cozy hotel at a fraction of the price of the hotels within a block or two. Older, smaller rooms, but I liked it and I appreciated the delightful people who work the front desk...when looking to visit Chicago or for a "staycation" for those in the suburbs over a special weekend for shopping or downtown sights.
