i had the chicago style veggie pizza and it was good, but i wasn't completely sold. i didn't really like the cornmeal crust and i wish there were more vegetables. i also tried some things off the appetizer platter. - fried ravioli - good, but i felt guilty eating it - spinach stick - ok, but also very rich - calamari - good - bruschetta - i really liked it and loved how light it was. it also helps that i'm a tomato fan and it is full of tomatoes if i'm back in chi, i'll go to giordano's instead.
