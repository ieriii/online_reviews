I cannot give this place a better recommendation than to paraphrase Mae West and say the worse it ever gets is really good and that when it's really good it's even better (confusing, but I'm still in a food coma after eating yet another delicious meal here). Being a good ole Chicago boy I likes my meats, and the steaks are simply excellent. If you're in the mood for carb's the bowtie pasta is great, with it's cream sauce and tasty-as-hell grilled chicken (there's also a bit of tomato and basil garnish to brighten it all up a bit). I would also recommend the steak risotto- a personal fave: I order this fairly regularly and it rates highly on the yumbo meter (once in a blue moon it's a little dry, but that's about the worst I can say about this place).  A tasty bread basket comes with great French bread and an even better raisin bread that just begs to be slathered with the herb butter that accompanies it (yeah, yeah, yeah...bread and butter, 'so what, you may say'...well try it and you'll see it's really de-lish!). The rooms- both the dining area as well as the bar- are comfortable and have a really nice vibe...kinda like a pair of jeans with a well cut blazer. And the staff is always great: friendly without being intrusive. Go. Eat. Enjoy.
