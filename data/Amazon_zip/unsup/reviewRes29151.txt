We first visited here on the recommendation of a hotel maitre d (before we moved to chicago). The wait was 2 hours and my husband didn't want to wait, but I insisted b/c it must be good if there were that many people waiting, right?! Well, that being said, this is now my husband's favorite restaurant in the city.  We have been here numerous times, and the food has never disappointed (nor have the margaritas). We have tried most everything on the menu and it is difficult to choose a favorite. I cannot say enough about this place. Just pick what you think you might like and Rick Bayless and his team will not disappoint.
