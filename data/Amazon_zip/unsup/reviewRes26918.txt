I heard a lot of things about Pequod's. Good things. Sad to say, I will not be repeating those good things.  I like to try to make my reviews long and as insightful as possible. However, I don't know what to say about their pizza. It just wasn't that good. For a pan pizza, there was surprisingly little going on. Lots of dough. A little cheese, a little sauce. The meat was unflavored and bland. The spinach the same. There's really not much else to say. It's just an average pie.
