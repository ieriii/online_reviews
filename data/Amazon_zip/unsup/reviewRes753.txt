A unique experience.... Went here recently after reading a yelp friends review along with the fact that my girlfriend really wanted to go here. The wait wasn't bad, about 25-30 minutes. Now i had the pleasure of trying a few sausages there. The sal tessio and the keira knightly (fire dog i believe) was great, the elvis was good (although had with chili/beans, and cheese and the beans mess it up to me), didn't like the andouille sausage. Now for the duck fat fries, they were ok not great, as a matter of fact, i think the regular cheese fries are better. Only thing i would say is that you gotta have peppers (among at least 4 toppings i think are missing from here) for sausages and i think that 4 is a little bit early to be closing (but hey maybe thats what make this place great: it's own rules).
