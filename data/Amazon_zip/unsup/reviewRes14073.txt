So we ended up at Revolution this past weekend because we were effectively shut down by Kuma's (we had some under 21 in the group and it was nearing 10pm). We had to wait a little bit since we had 9 in our party, but the wait wasn't too long. While waiting, I ordered up a Cross of Gold. Very enjoyable beer. Others in the party had some other beers. One thing that I noticed is that their brews reminded me of other beers. The Cross of Gold was eerily reminiscent of Blue Moon...but better.  We sat down at the table and knew right away that we were going to order up some of the bacon fat popcorn. Sure, it hurt my heart just looking at it, but it was delicious. Of course, after eating that, you'd think that I would play it safe and go with something a bit more...healthy. Wrong. Their special for that night was this monstrosity of heart attack inducing deliciousness. Home-cured ham, pulled pork, bacon, cheddar, pepperjack and cheese curds. Yes, my heart hurt for a bit, but it was worth it. Soooo good.  Be forewarned...I am about to say something that could be deemed blasphemous to some, but I stand by my words. The wife ordered up a burger with blue cheese and mushrooms. I forget what it was called. I asked for a bite. This burger could be better than Kuma's. The meat...the toppings...the bun...All were paired very well. That burger was so juicy. If I didn't have the heart attack on a plate in front of me, I would have eaten more! I think we will give another go to Revolution (though we have an ever growing list of places to eat!)
