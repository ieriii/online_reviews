Serious props for Big Jones! The existence of this place does so much for local area dining - not only because it brings variety to Andersonville, but because the food is always amazing. I've eaten here about 4 times - a mixture between brunch and dinner - and every time the food and service has been great. The cocktails are delicious (although I have to admit they are overpriced for the serving size, esp. compared to the rest of the menu), and the desserts are fresh, and worth leaving room for (and waiting the extra 20 minutes for the red velvet cake). Most recently I had the jerked skirt steak - served with fresh green beans and tempura hearts of palm. This was delicious - cooked to perfection, wonderfully seasoned and made everyone else at the table jealous. Finish off your dinner with the Calas and you won't be sorry!
