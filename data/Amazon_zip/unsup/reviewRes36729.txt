Breakfast is one of my favorite things and this is my favorite breakfast place in Chicago, hands down. I've been here countless times and no matter what I get (omelettes, pancakes, skillets, or something off their daily special menu), it's always been great. I like their fresh squeezed juices too. Waits are usually 30 minutes so try to get there early or go to the new location. Even though there is a wait, I still prefer the cozy feel of the original location.
