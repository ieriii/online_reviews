Indie cafe has proved to serve the best sushi and Thai food consistently for the past three years I have lived in Chicago. Though I have tried to expand my knowledge of Thai/sushi restaurants time and again, I keep coming back to Indie because nothing beats it! Their dine-in experience is top notch, offering a classy and upbeat atmosphere with great service, and their delivery is unsurpassed--delivering hot food and fresh sushi in a timely manner. I highly recommend!As for the lone one-star review below: There is no way a shard of glass was in a sushi roll, seeing as everything is hand rolled and would CUT the person rolling it. Also, it is packed immediately behind the sushi bar. Nice try on the free meals though! Furthermore, if I claimed to have glass in my food at a restaurant that chipped my tooth, I wouldn't go back there, but instead bring in my dental bill which they of course would cover with their insurance.
