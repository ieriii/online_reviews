If you have the means, and you are actually looking at yelp reviews to decide, stop. Just go. It's an experience. I'm only reviewing to give a word of advice on the wine pairing. We got it, and it definitely boosted our experience, but we were not aware that almost half of the wines were desert wines. Not my favorite. In fact, I get massive headaches. If we had known this ahead of time, I'm sure we would have asked for an abbreviated pairing without the desert wines. I bet they would have done that for us. If not, you really can't go wrong ordering a bottle of champagne to sip throughout the meal. Small sidenote: If anyone went there this fall and took pictures of their food, would you mind sending me a message? I'm trying to make something for my boyfriend for valentine's day, and we were too embarrassed to take a picture of every single course. I'm kicking myself for that.
