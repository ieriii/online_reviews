Apparently this place is pretty popular. There are already a shit ton of reviews, and I have to agree. The food here is freakin outstanding. The red beans and rice, YUM! Salsa, check. Cheese empanadas, delightful. But my review is going to focus mostly on the oatmeal milkshake. You can mix it with fruit, or chocolate (my recommendation). As one of the people at my table put it, "If I could get naked and spread this shake across my body, I would." Everyone at the table agreed.  That is all.
