I've now been to Big Jones twice and have sampled their brunch AND their dinner. Man, this is one of my new favorite places! My brunch (which was months ago) was delicious - I had the Cajun Pancakes and my friend had an omelette. The topper? for dessert we had the "personal size red velvet cake". They bake them one at a time and you have to give them about 15 minutes notice. Delicious. On that delicious meal, I chose Big Jones to bring an out of town friend. This time, I was trying the dinner. Just wonderful - great service, great food. I'll defintely be back.
