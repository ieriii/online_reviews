This place is brilliant! Food, Beer selection, service is perfect. I really like decor as well. Oyster is so fresh and tasty. I love big, fatty Oyster more than like Kumamoto but it's OK for that. Also, Serrano ham......So good! I really impressed about each food cuz everything incredible! Always packed this place but you don't get a ridiculously line.
