I seems overly expensive, honestly. The portions are average-good, their presentation is good, but the content is alright. The food isn't very unique, it's flavors average. I've had two waitresses treat me inconsiderately, though. Not a major thing, but still something to consider. One said that's not on the menu right now but I can sell it to you then proceeded to mention that she was doing me a favor by selling me some extremely overpriced piece of cheesecake. Still, I might recommend.
