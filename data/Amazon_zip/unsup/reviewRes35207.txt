I am only giving this establishment 3.5 stars because of their food. As for their service, I would like to give them 1/2 a star. Correct, that's not a whole star because they do not deserve a whole star - rather, 1/2 a star seems adequate.  My family and I keep coming back although service is horrible every time we dine in. I guess we come for their food and not for their service. I usually order the wonton noodle soup and my husband orders the combination rice platter with bbq pork, roast pork and duck.  I really hope they find a better wait staff because if they don't, I'm afraid they will lose a lot of business. It never fails - every time we dine in, they a.) either screw up our order, b.) forget something or c.) is extremely rude. Come on Sun Wah, we like your restaurant! Get your floor staff in check! I will gladly change my rating if the next time I come in I receive better service.
