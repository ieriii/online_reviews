Forgive my review for being short, but we just got back from dinner at Sunda, and I am entirely too full. We came here for my 29th birthday back in December, and since have been obsessed with their sea bass special. My friends and I went back tonight, especially for the sea bass, and when we only saw one on the menu, we assumed it was the same one. Welllllll sadly, what came out was something entirely different. We politely asked the server what the other one was, and she told us that was just a special and is no longer on the menu. We were bummed, but since everything else was so good, we moved on. A few minutes later, Brian Cummings, the manager came over and apologized for the confusion...walked away, but came back again and told us he was able to work with the kitchen and order us the meal. Not only was the food outstanding, but his customer service skills were top notch. He went out of his way to make our dining experience worth every penny.
