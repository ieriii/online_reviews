Yes, I know sometimes you don't want to wait for a table but... seriously, you want to wait for a table at this place the food is great! Atmosphere in the garden, coach house or upstairs is wonderful - the main dining room is loud and cramped though. I will put up with anything for the asparagus and blue cheese salad which is a staple on their menu! Everything I have tried is excellent. Mia Francesca is my birthday dinner choice every year! (Occasionally, Mia Francesca offers gift certificates via The Loop WLUP radio station "half-price deals", check their website before you go or better yet, sign up for their email updates.)
