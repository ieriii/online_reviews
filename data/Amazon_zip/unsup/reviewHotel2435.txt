Stayed here for a business trip and had a wonderful time. Hotel was very nice. The bed and pillows were COMFORTABLE. I could sleep there all day if I really wanted to. One thing I didn't like was that the toilet looked a like a public restroom toilet. That was a lil odd. Room service was the best. I must say, it was the best room service kinda food I've ever had. Waiter came into my room, served it on the table for me, and opened everything for me: bottles, lids, you name it. Typically, when I order room service elsewhere, the food ends up being stale and cold. But man..... my food (fish & chips) was soooo opposite of that. I know, I know... fish & chips?? Yes, fish and chips. It was GOOD! They even gave me lil tabasco bottles that were as tall as my pinkies. So cute. Shoot, the bill came out to $40. WTF? Also, had an all day meeting there. Servers were very attentive, food came in on time ALL the time. Technicians were always available for IT needs. Gym is huge! They even have a lil track surrounding the gym. That was cool. Biggest gym I've seen thus far in a hotel. I definitely would want to stay here again for next year's meeting.
