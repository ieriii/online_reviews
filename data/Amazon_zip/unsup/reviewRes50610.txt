We went for a "business lunch" and were there for over 2 hours. We met Paul the owner, really nice and helpful with the menu, and Terry our waitress. She clearly conveyed the passion and commitment they are about at Big Jones! We started with fried green tomatoes. Light, delicious, and full of flavor. I had the grassfed beef burger. Yummy! The macaroni and cheese is REAL GOOD (check my profile) and I had to order 1 more to go. Marlene had pulled pork sandwich (which I tasted) and it pulled my tastebuds right to attention. Jesse had Gumbo and it was down right tasty too. I'm going back for dinner.
