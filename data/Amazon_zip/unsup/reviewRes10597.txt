I most recently visited Piece with my good friends Nam Kim and Joe Parish. We had a blast, drinking their original craft beers and eating some of the best pizza in the city. What's great about the pizza? Everything from the delicious crust to the high quality ingredients. I used to love the red pizza, but do yourself a favor and go plain. The garlic and the sauce combined with a lack of mozzarella is totes TDF (totally to die for, if you're not down with the lingo). The beers are pretty sick (as in good), especially the Dysfunction-Ale. Oh, b-t-dubs (by the way, if you're not down with the lingo), they have live band Karaoke on Thursdays and Saturdays. Some people are awesome, some aren't, but it's all in good fun. If you come, you may see me screaming the coda to Hey Jude on my sha-na-na-na-na-na-knees. Piece, Deuce Pibelow
