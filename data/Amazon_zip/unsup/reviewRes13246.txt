So after getting denied at the bar (I'm 21 but my ID expired about a week ago) I was pretty sure i was going to hate this place. Luckily my friends convinced me to stay and it was a good decision. Food was really good, although I'm pretty sure that i drew a lot of attention to myself from the staff after I got denied and was saying how my night was ruined. But props on the recovery. The bacon fat popcorn was one of the coolest appetizers i have seen. The burgers are huge and juicy. No complaints whatsoever. I don't think I've been that full in a while. I never got to try the beer but from my friends expressions it seemed top notch. Next time I'll have to go with a valid ID to get the full experience.
