What else can I add that hasn't been said? So far it's been THE most romantic restaurant in Chicago for me. But it's not just a restaurant, it's a dining experience. Don't make any plans for later; it will take a couple hours to eat here. And once your meal is over, your date will want to head straight home for dessert. ;) Hopefully the memory of your own little after-party will comfort you when you look at your credit card statement.
