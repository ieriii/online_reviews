Dear Lord, I love this place! Like a slice out of WWII-era Americana. I must admit that 90+% of the time I'm there it's Thursdays for Alan Gresik and the Swing Shift Orchestra, but that's the draw for me. Old timey radio commercials and a Depression-era cocktail just take my old soul back to the old days I never saw in "real life." Check 'em out, pay your $6 to the biker dude at the door and enter the time machine to a bygone era!
