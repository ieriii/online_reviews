I actually sorted these 400+ reviews to find the ones that were 2 stars because I couldn't believe people would rate a place this good, that low ever. Maybe we came on a good night but 300+ four and five star reviews make me think otherwise. Guess the other peeps were a little unlucky. Whatever it was, I highly recommend this place. A coworked mentioned it to me when there was a Groupon so I scooped it up and the husband and I went on a date night last night to check it out. Started with a Pama Mojito and it was just delightful. Not to sweet, perfectly fizzy. We split the Taste of Cuba and both the empanadas and the ham croquettes were great and hot and crispy. The star of that plate was the sauce in the middle, I would like a bucket to take home, please, thanks. Husband got the ribeye for his entree and I went with the Cuban chicken. The smell when the plates were delivered was heavenly. Tried a bite of the ribeye and it was spiced generously and was very flavorful. My chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I could have done without the black beans/white rice mixture and gotten about 7 more plantains because they were incredible. Just the right amount of caramelization, sweetness and creaminess. Needless to say, I didn't finish any part of my entree so I am looking foward to leftovers for dinner tonight! I also thought the prices were very reasonable for the portion sizes you get... if I got back I will definitely split some different appetizers and then split an entree because there is no need for that much food on one's own.
