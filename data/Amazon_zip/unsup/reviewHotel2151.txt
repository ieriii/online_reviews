I stayed here 1/1/11 to 1/2/11 : My mini vacation in Chicago. My room was beautiful. King size bed on the 18th floor overlooking Michigan Ave. I slept like a baby here. The decore of the room was beautiful. Awesome bathroom shower with hot water and excellent pressure. Make sure you check out their pool and sauna. Their pool is on the 13 or 14th floor (FC) and has a very unique 20s look. Wooden sauna is great! Staff is extremely nice. If you are still planing to visit the museum or go to lunch after your checkout I recommend taking advantage of their complementary luggage hold at the bell stand. Also enjoy the charming lobby with stunning lion statues and comfy chairs.
