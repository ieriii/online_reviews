Only place to get a real Chicago dog. Yes it is a little pricey, but totally worth it. Gotta love the green tomato, pickle and the fries all in one!! Another thing I like is the neon green relish that is a sign of a good hot dog. Their shakes are the bomb too!! Super Dawg is a nostalgic place with drive in service that is so cool!!
