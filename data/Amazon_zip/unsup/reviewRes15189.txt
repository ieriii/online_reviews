Seriously...I can't believe this place only has 3 stars...it's awesome. Wonderful food...and they bring more of it than any Italian restaurant in Chicago. My husband and I went and brought home food for 1.5 more meals...for under $50 (including glass of wine). When you order an entree you get an entire loaf of bread...another thing of bread smothered in garlic and cheese, soup, salad, a whole plate of pasta and then your huge entree...what a deal. The atmosphere was very "old school" Italian Mafia...I felt like shady things had gone on there...it's neat though...waiters in tuxedos, etc.
