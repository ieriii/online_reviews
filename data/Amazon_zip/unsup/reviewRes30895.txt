YUM! Just finished eating my left overs from last night and even those were delish! The service here is great, they even come around and plate your side dishes.  For appetizers we had the shrimp cocktail, oysters, stuffed mushrooms, and tuna. I didn't eat the oysters, but everything else was really really good! The Tuna tasted like eating sushi without the rice ha! For dinner, I had started with the lobster bisque and 12 oz filet and that was melt in your mouth good. I think i would have liked to have more lobster in the soup. For sides I tried the steamed broc, gnocchi, mashed potatoes, and sauteed mushrooms. I wasn't really a fan of the gnocchi, but really enjoyed everything else. For dessert we shared the butter cake- SO GOOD. It sounds kind of gross when they describe it because of the cream cheese, but it was delicious and I could see why it is a guest favorite.
