Went there, loved there. Every bit of it. I wouldn't have even left except for the fact that I was actually too full to eat anymore, and if my date and I stayed sitting there they would have continued bringing us food. It's such a unique experience. Also, in response to Yin L. I got a reservation on the first try, and I'm happy that you didn't, or at least not on the same night. I would have wanted to shoot myself if I had the misfortune of being seated next to you and had to hear you complain all night. It kind of makes me think that Chef Carlson and friends are not just talented chefs, but also somewhat psychic for being able to vet out people like Yin L. to preserve the Schwa experience.
