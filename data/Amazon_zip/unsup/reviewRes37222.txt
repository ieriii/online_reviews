I miss Dean and Deluca. Wish we had one. Fox and Obel is the closest thing. Amazing selection, helpful staff. They helped me out with Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner many a time. AWESOME catering menu. They even have a room for private events. The cafe is cute. Tomato basil soup is perfect, not too creamy. Their club sandwich is HUGE and delicious. The best place to grab a bite before a movie at the AMC River East 21. As other reviewers mentioned it is very expensive. How expensive you ask? It makes Whole Foods look like Aldi.
