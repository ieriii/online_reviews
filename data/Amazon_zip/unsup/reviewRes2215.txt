I'm not much of a hot dog person, but every time I'm in Chicago I crave for one. Hot Doug's is by far the BEST hot dog joint ever. If you think Pinks is good, you have not tried the best. I love their Andouille sausage. They have specialty dogs on their daily special menu as well that includes exotic meat such a rabbit, rattlesnake, venison, etc. Make sure you try their fries fried in duck fat, available only on Fridays and Saturdays. They are delish! Expect to wait in line; there's always a line outside the door even when it's raining or snowing. It's worth the wait though!
