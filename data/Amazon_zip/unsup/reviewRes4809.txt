Tried some pig ear and tail and a couple of other sides with a nice bottle of wine. The food was delicious and the service was wonderful. Our waitress was wonderful in helping us to select a variety of plates to taste. We went early Friday evening about 6pm and didn't have to wait for a table though it was already very busy. I would definitely go back!
