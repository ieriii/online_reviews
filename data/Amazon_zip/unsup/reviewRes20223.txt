YUCK YUCK YUCK and YUCK. and yuck. where to start? WHYYY do I keep eating here? they always f* up our order, (phone people are all dummies), the sushi is just not good & it's overpriced (& I almost never even notice price on sushi)... I have literally had to spit out the sushi into my napkin on a few occasions - (anything grosser than BAD RAW fish? um. no.) its BYOB (always annoying, I aaaalways forget).. delivery (we live 3 blocks away) is even worse, they give you ONE, yes...ONE tiny thing of soy sauce for an order of 4 rolls and 2 pieces. and they CHARGED us $1.00 for ponzu sauce. so annoying. bottom line, though - it's BAD!!!! $65 order and I'm not full and I'm a little NAUSH. never again this time!!!!
