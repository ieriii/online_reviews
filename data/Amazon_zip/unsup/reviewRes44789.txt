Yummy Yummy Yummy all in my Tummy....lol This is by far the best pizza I have had in my life. I was visit Chicago for the 1st time in 8/07 with mom & sister. We were here to see my mom's side of the family..most of whom my sister & I have never met before. So..Giordano's was near our hotel that we were staying at. I had researched this place before leaving San Diego. We went to this place after seeing some our crazy relatives. I have a good reason for calling them crazy...lol. But, I digress... My sister & I decided on the stuffed pepperoni & cheese which was heavenly. The cheese just melts in your mouth and the crust is so buttery delicious. It's was so good...that we took a pizza back home with us to San Diego on the plane. I'm just sad now because I haven't been able to fine a place like Giordano's in San Diego. Nothing compares. It's a must have when you go to Chicago.
