Wow! A small exterior entrance led into a wonderfully decorated and huge interior.  Had their Koby Beef Brisket on my first visit and found it tender, succulent and absolutely delicious and more meat than I was able to eat.  Tried the smaller Kobe Brisket sandwich on my second visit, very good too, but a little dry.  The service was excellent. My guest and I were very well attended to by many servers bringing complimentary home made chips and bread and butter pickles, both very yummy.  The manager also stopped by to say hello. An exceptional dining experience with a very freindly and attentive staff, a great place to relax and enjoy a long meal.  Can't wait to go back.
