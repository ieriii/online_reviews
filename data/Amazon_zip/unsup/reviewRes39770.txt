Had a nice time here, but not without some hiccups. Came here on a Tuesday night for dinner. Got quoted a 45min wait, so we found some room by the bar and ordered a few beers. Great bartenders here. Knowledgeable with great service. They were nice enough to let my wife sample a beer or two before she ordered. Unfortunately, as 45 minutes turned in over an hour a half, we saw parties that came in after us get seated before us. That doesn't really do a lot to make us feel good about eating here. At one point one hostess asked us to settle up our tab since we should be seated soon. She came back 20min later. Anyway, I guess they realized that we waited a while since they offered to buy our next round of drink, we parleyed that into dessert instead. That's always a nice touch. On to dinner, we had the roasted marrow bones with onion jam. Bone marrow is always delicious, this was the case here. I didn't even use the onion jam. We also went with the foie gras appetizer. Surprisingly light and tasty. For our entrees, my wife went with the pork belly. Cooked really well. Very enjoyable. I went with the short rib in a beef consumme topped by poached foie gras. I enjoyed it, but probably could have done without the foie gras. It was overpowering. The pork belly was the winner here. Other than the missteps in getting seated, a good meal was had. The bartender and our waiter were great and we'll be back.
