Food is outstanding, authentic, and plentiful. They always have a free appetizer when you arrive along with fresh made chips and, if you ask for it, 4 kinds of salsa including an amazing warm tomatillo salsa. Their sauces and seasonings are incredibly flavorful without being overly salted or spicy, which is a problem I usually encounter at other Mexican places. And the quality of the proteins are a step above what you'd normally find at a similarly priced restaurant. Favorite items are the fajitas nortenas and the camaron al mojo de ajo. My dad loves the menudo (tripe soup). I've seen a roasted chicken dish covered in mole sauce go by a few times that looks awesome, but each time I come here, I go back to my favorites. Maybe next time. Price is a bargain for what you get and portions are generous. Service is pretty quick considering the place is always packed. Bring cash though; they don't take credit cards. Parking is usually available along 18th st, but they also have a lot around the corner.
