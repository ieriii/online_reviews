Although I love good tex-mex, truly authentic and delicious Mexican food is certainly a rarity. No tacos or burritos here, instead we get a full, seasonally-changing menu that highlights the true diversity of Mexican cuisine. There are probably items on the menu here you can't get anywhere else in the midwest. As far as the food, I remember it being extremely good although not quite mind-blowing. Although I didn't have any margaritas, people whose opinions I trust have raved about them, so I'm sure they're worth it. Dessert was also delicious, and coffee fans will be happy to know that they use Illy espresso. You can do dinner for two here for less than $100, and considering the uniqueness of the experience and the plethora of expensive restaurants in Chicago, I think it's worth it.
