This is my go-to place for fantastic Greek food. Must try: 1) Taramosalata: cod roe with admixed onion, potatoes, and olive oil (sounds weird, but it's DAMN DELICIOUS -- my absolute favorite menu item here) 2) Pan Fried Calamari: FANTASTIC calamari, rivals the calamari served at Coobah 3) Homemade Gyros Appetizer: lamb strips served with pita bread, onions, and tzatziki sauce 4) Grilled Octopus: thick cylindrical cuts of delicious, charbroiled octopus 5) Mousaka: a baked casserole consisting of beef, eggplant, and potatoes in a tasty bechamel sauce 6) Flaming Saganaki Cheese: authentic flaming Greek cheese You'll notice that a majority of the items I've listed are appetizers. That's because the portions are so big that you'll barely have enough room for an entree. For example, four appetizers shared among three people (especially guys) is usually enough to be satisfied. Free valet parking is also a huge plus....especially in the winter. I'll be returning as I'm a frequent diner already. Love this place!
