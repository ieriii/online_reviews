I'll start out with the bad then finish on a positive note: I asked for chili sauce, like regular siracha, the waitress brought a mini plate out with a bit on it. Everything was fine. When the bill came they charged $2 for the siracha. You can by a liter bottle of siracha for under $2. If the waitress had mentioned the extra charge prior to bringing out the siracha then I would have been OK with it but she didn't. The food was great. I was happy to spend one of my three nights in Chicago here.
