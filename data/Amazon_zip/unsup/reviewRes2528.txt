Doug has lifted "encased meats" to a form of art.  There are good reasons that there is a constant line to get into this Chicago landmark hot dog emporium.  Delicious unique hot dogs and wonderful French fries.  It really is gourmet dining with "encased meats".  Their mural describing the history of the hot dog is so creative.  It's comforting to order each time from Doug himself.  The Legend maintains top quality and service....and he's got a good sense of humor.
