I had the shrimp and grits but i should have had the special of the day, fried chicken. There were many people around us eating the special and I was jealous the whole time. The food was good but it felt a little on the pricey side for what it was. A giant bowl of grits (HUGE) with some shrimp on top. I was pleasantly surprised by the bourbon selection though. Anyways, I'll definitely be back but only for special occasions. Too expensive to work into my regular rotation.
