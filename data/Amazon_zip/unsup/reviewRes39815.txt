So yummy. Stopped by at 7:30 on Thursday night for dinner and were seated right away. Love the interior - easy to talk in the backroom where we were seated.  We started with some booze that we enjoyed while consuming the fun amuse bouche (olive tapenade with goat cheese on a crackery thing). Kobe meatballs were outstanding as was the Brandade with potato chips. We split the sunchoke soup (with scallops - yum) and some kind of pasta-y thing with escargot for our next course. Both were very good. The pasta thing had a fabulous sauce, but the escargot were a little tough. Finally, had the cheese plate for dessert and it was SO worth it. Don't remember the types of cheeses, just that they were delicious.  Overall, dig it a whole lot. Ambiance was great, service was great, food was great. The menu item names are a little fancy schmancy. I'll definitely be back.
