I love this place it's great!I particularly like their tomato sauce; it's the perfect balance between acidity and sweetness, I'd put it on anything!The bruschetta is one of my favorite appetizers so if you happen to stop by you should try it. I'd give it 5 starts but the service has been wishy-washy a few times I've been here.
