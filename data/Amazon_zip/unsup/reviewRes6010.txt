This place has delicious food. It is a typical more touristy place, but the food is good. I had the Teriyaki Tuna steak and it was cooked perfectly. This is a pricey night out and their glasses of wine are over priced. If you like steak this is a great place for that. Our service wasn't that great. And the hostess was kind of rude. It is one of those places that tries to make you wait until your whole party is there...if we want to order food and we want to wait for the rest of our party we should be able to do that. I loved the food, but wouldn't necessarily have to eat here again.
