Love, love, love the food! And when I want some craft beer this is the place I would come. The duck ruben in my fav... but thw whole menu is good. It can be crowded and hard to find a table or even a place at the bar if you are going to drink and not eat... for the most part the area designated for the diners has a space available. This is a place where timing is everything in finding a table for either section.
