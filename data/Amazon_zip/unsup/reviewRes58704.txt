Wow, what a terrible way to end a fabulous weekend in Chicago. And when we think of the great restaurants we did not go to tonight, I could cry. Place was empty, I think there were no more than three tables occupied. We went for the five course tasting menu, and I can only say I am glad we didn't waste more money on the ten course meal. It seemed that they are interested in Serving the most pretentious combination of flavors and textures they can put together, presented by a waiter who acts like he is serving nectar and ambrosia. The tiniest portions, served on barren white plates that only accentuated the absence of real food. It was so awkward, and we had no fun as we trudged through one course after another. Who has persuaded these people that this is a pleasant way to entertain people. My friend and I decided that we would have been better off had we stopped at the Subway down the block, and since left hungry, maybe we should have. Wish we had read the reviews before we had tried this place, and we hope that this review will help some other people decide to run a mile in the other direction.
