I really do love Wakamono, despite the fact that they continue to raise their prices. I guess the almost need to keep raising them, because it's almost impossible to get a table here on weekend nights! That said, the fish is super fresh, the ambiance great, and the fact that it is somehow a combo BYO and serves alcohol is lovely. (Side note, they upped their corkage fee to $8. Really??) I love love love the spicy scallop roll which is reasonably priced and has great flavor. Of the specialty rolls, my favorites include the wakamono roll (perfection), spicy tako, peter parker, and maki mexicano.  Also, on a cold winter night, nothing warms you up like the spicy miso. Yum!
