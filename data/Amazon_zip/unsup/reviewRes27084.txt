We stumbled upon this place while trying to find somewhere quick and relatively close to the United Center. Quality wasn't even a credential, but thank God Neuvo Leon provided that!!! I had fajitas that were awesome, my pops had enchiladas, my sister had tostadas, and my other sister had a burrito. Portions are very generous here, and prices even more so. My favorite thing of all though was the horchata!!!! So sweet and so delicious!!! I will be back here for a pre Bulls/Blackhawks game meal.
