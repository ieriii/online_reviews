Most restaurants are one timers for me. You go once and you just want that one experience. Wildfire is a family favorite. The ribs are really good. The chopped salad is a must. We go anytime we have friends in town. I was a little disappointed with the service just once. The dessert came with the ice cream melted but believe me you, that's the exception rather than the rule. Great food, great service. The only problem is getting a reservation.
