I smell BACON!!! For those that pine for swine, this is it. If not, you won't be disappointed with their vast Euro selection of liqui-dinners (my unregrettable choice).  To avoid the crowds and "Oops-I-rubbed-your-butt-but-didn't-mean-it" experience, go on a night early in the week. We went on a Tuesday night and except for 2 other couples, the place was dead. The interior was cozy--in fact, so cozy, I wanted to nap. The communal tables made it an ideal spot for groups....given you land there on an empty night since they don't acccept reservations. Ordered a perfect bottle of sancerre...my fave and usually tough to find. The bartender was adorable and offered me a gratis serving of the soft serve olive oil ice cream. I'm not a fan of ice-cream, but this was salty, creamy and dreamy...worth a second round. Rated P.P 4 stars because I didn't eat. The menu seemed too meaty (don't eat it) and heavy. Not certain what to think about the pig ears....my dog loves em.
