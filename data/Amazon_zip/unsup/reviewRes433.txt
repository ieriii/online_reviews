Just to get the chance to review this place is a privilege in itself, and to be honest, I'm writing this more for me than I am for the yelper community. In a way, this review serves as a souvenir I can always find, so that I don't forget just how amazing it was to eat at this Temple of Edibles. So, Dalyte, in case you ever forget: You were served a dessert featuring caramelized white chocolate that looked like branches from a bonsai tree. And it was sitting on top of a PILLOW. A pillow that was filled with earl grey-scented air. Despite your better judgment, you wanted to eat the pillow, it smelled that good. You were served an assortment of dishes that featured crab in forms that you never considered, namely an icy crab sorbet. And it was delicious. Your dishes were paired with wines from all corners of the globe, and their exceptional deliciousness transformed you into a pretentious and dissatisfied oenophile for a good month. Once the meal was over, you went downstairs and stared through the glass windows that looked out on the kitchen, observing Grant Achatz and his team of chefs work their magic. You felt like a kid at the north pole, watching Santa and his elves. You stayed there, observing, for maybe half an hour or so, as other guests followed your lead and joined the show, your eyes glazing over with delight and bitter-sweetness, since that epic meal was now over, and your wallet was significantly lighter. Make no mistake. It was worth every penny.
