So I went to Zed purely for the patio experience. At 6:30 on a Friday it was not that busy and I was pleasantly surprised. The decor on the rooftop was cute although I felt like the people next to us were on our date too, in other words the tables are too close together. The wine flight I had was tasty and we ordered the Ocean Harvest appetizer which was a ton of seafood, but fresh and good. I think next time the fondue looks like the way to go. I also moved on to a cherry bourbon cocktail that was just the perfect balance, it was slightly sweet, but you could still taste the bourbon. The service was great until it started to get busy around 8. We rarely saw our waitress after that. I think they need more staff out there in the evening.  Overall, I say go for the rooftop and enjoy a cocktail and apppetizer!
