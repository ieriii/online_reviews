I was disappointed by my experience here, but hey, let's start with the positives. First of all, I really liked the decor. Gray is one of my all-time favorite colors, so I was totally down with that. And I'm always excited about cloth napkins and arrows in jars. Also, I'm kind of a hipster-phile. I'm not hip, but I really enjoy surrounding myself with tons of hipsters (hence being an English major). I definitely got my fill of them at L&E, but I would expect nothing less from a brunch place in Logan Square that serves a PBR breakfast. All in all, good scenery. However, I was not so pleased with the food. I ordered the Tete de Cochon Egg Sandwich, and it was alright except for the grease. You could have seen through my napkin from all the grease that I wiped on it. I have never experienced anything like it, and I've eaten some greasygreasy pizza. The sandwich came with a potato terrine which I think had some form of duck fat or meat in it.. That made me sad because I don't like duck. However, if you like grease or duck, you should order this meal; you would love it. My final comment is in regards to service. In a restaurant where there was no wait to be seated and probably 3 parties besides my own dining, my coffee was refilled once. I was most disappointed by this. Coffee and brunch should cohabitate. They didn't. Booo-urns.
