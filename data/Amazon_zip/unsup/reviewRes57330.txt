One of the best sushi places in the city. Ask for anything. Anything at all and it is amazing! I went with 11 of my girlfriends and was pleased that one of them suggested this place because I would have never known it was there. Try the seared tuna. A must! Hamachi Avo is great. But honestly, I cant tell you enough, I cant describe this place well enough you must go in and see. Coast is beautiful! The service is great. Good atmosphere for an itimate meeting or a place where 12 people want to reconnect over great sushi! Highly recommend it!
