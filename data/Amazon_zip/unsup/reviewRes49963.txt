My boyfriend and I were looking for some Columbian cuisine. He had thrown out a few restaurant names, but nothing really caught my eye. Eventually, however, I stumbled upon the Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse. We went around 4 pm on a Saturday, so it was pretty quiet, but the service was excellent! Our waiter was very polite and very helpful in helping us navigate the menu. And in which way did he direct us? Why only the best way - towards the Skirt Steak. I don't think I have ever tasted a more delicious steak in my entire life. Ordered medium rare, it was tender, juicy, and delicious. Perfectly marinated and perfectly cooked, served with fried plantains, yuca and potato. The price wasn't anymore than you'd pay for a good steak, but this was definitely a high quality meal. I'll definitely go back
