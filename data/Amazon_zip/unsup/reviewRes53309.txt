I really love going here every once and a while. They always have a new exotic type of encased meat. Where else can you go to eat bear sausage, ostrich sausage, or alligator sausage. Pair any of those with the right kind of cheese and condiments, you have yourself a winner. And there are plenty of winners on this menu. My only objection is the price. It is a bit steep. But then again, you are eating exotic meats. It is not an everyday thing, but definitely worth going to every so often.
