I am a bit conflicted writing this review, because the food, wine pairings, service, and dining experience at Alinea were all top notch. I won't go into great detail about the dishes - I'm sure other reviewers have already done a great job of that - but my personal favorites were the scallop with foam, frozen chocolate mousse, and yuzu snow. So why only three stars? Dining at Alinea is a bit like a trip to Vegas. Yes, I had a blast, but since leaving the restaurant I have felt a pervasive sense of guilt from dropping a small fortune on dinner for two. Yes, we were celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary, and you only live once (a life motto that usually guides my principles), but fair warning: eating here will (or at least should) mess with your conscience.
