Went here with a group when I visited Chicago over a year ago. I couldn't remember the name so I couldn't review it, but I recognize it from it's pictures. We shared the family menu, which was SO MUCH FOOD! It's $20 each, but you get to customize what types of appetizers, entrees, and desserts you want. Seriously, there was enough leftovers left to last me five small dinner for the week. Unfortunately we were staying in a hotel so couldn't take it with us, but I would if I could! It was pretty busy, so I think our group of 4-5 had to wait about 20 minutes. If they take reservations that would be a good idea. The food I remember most is the fried cheese.... I still don't know what it was called, but it was pretty darn amazing. The chicken also had really good flavor too.
