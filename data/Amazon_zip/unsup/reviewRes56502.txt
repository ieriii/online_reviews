My husband, myself, and another couple visited Frontera a few weeks ago. We typically enjoy finding restaurants of top chefs as we travel and sampling their culinary treats. We were warned to arrive early, as the doors open and are full immediately. We were very excited upon arrival to note that we'd get a table, and after waiting 45 minutes for the restaurant to open we did. My friend and I were chatting excitedly about sampling Bayless' food, but sadly, we were disappointed. From drinks, to completion, the meal was rather disappointing. The only 'star' of our meal was an appetizer sampler platter and guacamole and chips. Both were excellent. All the meals arrived at barely warm temperature. The food was good, but absolutely nothing about it wowed any of the four of us dining. There honestly isn't much else to say. Give me Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill anytime. That's the sort of food I was expecting. Food that wowed me.
