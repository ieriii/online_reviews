Great Brunch place that does it right!!!!! I take those visiting from out of town there- since many of them stay near Millennium Park etc....It's a great place to start before a long day at all the Museums:) The french toast is AWESOME and they do their eggs dishes well too. If going on the weekend- be prepared for the wait or go after 1pm.
