I've been here twice and we've sat outside both times. The seating is kinda weird/tight and you literally feel like you're dining with the people seating next to you. I would advise people to not meet here if they are planning to talk about anything private- because everyone around you can hear your conversation with perfect clarity. LOL. This also provides great entertainment value however, to a certain extent, depending on who is sitting next to you. LOL. The food here is really good, but I do feel like it has something missing to it- some of it can be kind of bland. Still, there are loads of different options for vegetarians and vegans, and the portion sizes are pretty generous. They even have vegan desserts (which are pretty delicious) and will make vegan wedding cakes. The food all has a homemade type of feel to it (if that makes any sense) and you actually walk right through the kitchen to get to the back patio- which is kinda cool and unique. Overall, it has a great atmosphere- definitely worth stopping by.
