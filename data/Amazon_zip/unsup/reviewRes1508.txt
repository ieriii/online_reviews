When I was here, it's really cold that day. I was in a long long line.... But, you got try this place no excuse! Foie gras dog?? You have to be there 10:30 am open time If you want Foie gras dog cuz sometime sold out. It's really good... Also, duck fat fries is really tasty. Service is really quick and kindness as well. I love love this place!
