High end grocery store and quick eats shop. I would have given it 4 stars but they recently dropped their buy anything and park for free for 2 hours (totally worth it in Streeterville, especially since the fiance works in the same building). Now it is buy a minimum of $20 for free 2 hour parking. Food is pretty good, but more than I like to spend for basic grocery items
