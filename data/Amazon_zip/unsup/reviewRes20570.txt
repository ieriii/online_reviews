My first torta ever. And it was freakin' fantastic! I had the Milanesa: Crispy Gunthorp chicken, black beans, artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa. This is a griddle torta very similar to a panini, pressed and all the flavors have a chance to marry together to make a super flavor. I will be back again, there are more tortas to taste.
