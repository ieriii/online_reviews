CASH ONLY?? REALLY? What is this the 80's? How ghetto is that? Food was dripping with grease, steak was rubbery, rice was greasy and I didn't even touch the beans which I'm sure are made with loads of lard. I'll stick to the higher end mexican places over this grease pit of a mexican joint and I'm mexican to the bone.
