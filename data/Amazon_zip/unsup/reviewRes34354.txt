This place is awesome for a quick and easy dinner. I always get either the falafel, lentil soup and another random small side, or the meat combo. Either way you'll get a lot of food for under 8-9 bucks. It's not my absolute favorite Middle Eastern food in the city (that would be Zaytune in Bridgeport, and I think Babylon on Damen may be slightly better), but it's still really good stuff. I've actually only carried out from here, but it's BYOB and there's plenty of seating so definitely a good place to meet people for a cheap, fun dinner.
