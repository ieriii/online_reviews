I love that this place is still around, I know it's been around for generations and I like that kind of devotion people have to a local business. That being said, I live right down Milwaukee from this place, about a 2 minute drive from my house. I've been here twice, and both times I've regretted it. I had a superdawg the first time I was here, left much to be desired. I can't remember what I didn't like about the dog when I went there, it was about 10 years ago, but I hated it. Last summer I decided to give it another go, got some cheese fries and tried a burger, the burger was the worst I've probably ever had. The cheese sauce was too salty. I won't be going there again, it's too expensive for me personally, I'd much rather go to other mom & pop places that my taste buds appreciate more.
