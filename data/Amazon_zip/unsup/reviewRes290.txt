Incredible, but be prepared for a test of your culinary endurance. I went when I first moved to Chicago, as some friends came to help me move in (although only after they secured reservations at Alinea). We had 9:30PM reservations, and although I expected the 20+ courses, I had no clue we would be there until 1:30AM. I nearly passed out at 11:30 around the 15th course, but a succulent veal course revitalized me. [Upon rereading my friend's blog, it was the pork cheek that woke me up] The menu is also really neat, and I enjoyed a great apertif recommended by the server. The service is impeccable. Throughout the entire four hour meal, it truly felt like we had our personal wait staff team of three. You can view photos (and read my friend's recap) of my meal here: http://www.foodite.com/f
