waiter was rude. the bone marrow is the greasiest food I've ever have, and breads too!! almost puke after the 1st bite. other food with yelp fotos is not good either. people love the place because of the environment and wine, but not the food itself. suggest you could have some light dinner before going there, so u can just taste their wine and enjoy talking with friends. but not enjoying the food. 1 more thing, don't trust tour guide too much. every tour guide has this restaurant listed. don;t know how much money they gave to those publishers. anyway, we paid all they have.
