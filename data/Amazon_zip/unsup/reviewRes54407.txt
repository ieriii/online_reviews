When I cam here it weas because my boyfriend at the time wanted to try some Vegetarian cuisine instead of the same ol same ol in the Kitchen. We definitely loved our time here .Very friendly staff the food (kinda small) but tastey and the Milkshakes Yummmmmmyyyy to die for. The fries arent TO DIE FOR..but the trip here is well worth it .I think you could fool a meat eater into thinking something on the menu is Vegan lol.
