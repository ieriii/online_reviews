I gotta be honest, I don't feel worthy of even writing a review of this place. Yeah, it's that good. Everything everyone had (it was a party of four) was amazing. Doesn't matter what it was, since it probably won't be available again, so just go and pick anything off the menu. You will love it. I resisted going because of the wait, but glad my friend made me do it. I'd do it again, too.
