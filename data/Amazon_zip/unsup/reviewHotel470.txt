I'm staying my way through all of the Chicago downtown Hilton properties when I visit, so this Embassy Suites is the latest one! Convenient to Navy Pier and a variety of shopping and restaurants, it's well-located and transit-accessible. It's important to specify that this is the Embassy Suites on Columbus when you get a cab, by the way, because there's another on State Street and people get confused!  This is a "sky hotel," meaning that the lobby and rooms are all on floors 6 and higher. You get some pretty nice views, but it also means that you have to catch more than one elevator to get anywhere! Luckily, they have enough elevators and they move pretty fast. The lobby and central "courtyard" (like nearly all Embassy Suites have) is really quite spectacular and modern. The lobby does have a bit of a chlorine funk, either due to the fountains or the hotel pool. The bar and breakfast area are right by the front desk and very convenient - the hotel offers a free breakfast and nightly "manager's reception" like other Embassy Suites properties.  The rooms were a little dim for my tastes, without good lighting at any mirror to do my makeup. Otherwise, very standard suites. Living room/dining room area, wet bar, separate bathroom and bedroom. Three sinks in total... one bar of hand soap. I'll never get that. The wifi is free for elite HHonors guests.  I'll keep trying different properties - I think my favorite so far has been the Hilton Garden Inn, followed by the other Embassy Suites on State.
