Tried going here without reservation and the wait was an hour long for lunch. Came back on a weekday with reservations and got seated within 10 minutes of checking-in - yay! They have a lunch prix fixe menu but not everything on the lunch menu was included. We thought that we can just pick 1 item from the appetizer, entree and dessert list but we assumed wrong - the choices were limited and not that enticing. We ordered from the regular menu instead and the food was good. We had Shrimp and Grits and Eggs New Orleans. My shrimp and grits were good but I was still hungry after - their portions were small for $13. The shrimps were a tad small, which was fine if they had given me more, but they didn't - I think there were only 6. Eggs New Orleans was delicious, but I thought the crab cakes were a bit dry. For $16, I was expecting it to be bigger as well (maybe we're just fatties?? I don't know) 3 stars because as much as the food was good, I thought it was pricey and not worth the wait. I'd rather wait and spend my $ at M. Henry's.
