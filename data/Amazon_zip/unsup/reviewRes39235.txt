Mmmm! Yum yum yum! I would like to eat and drink every meal here for the rest of my life. Actually, I think I'll just move in. They allow that, right? Then I could probably skip that horrendous wait they always (deservedly) have and dig right in. Honestly, I don't know how the staff here stays so svelte. If I worked there -- or even lived in the immediate area -- I would be at least 100 lbs heavier. Brunch, dinner, it doesn't matter; all of the food is rich, comforting, deliciousness. I especially recommend the Mac and Cheese. I actually wanted to place an order of it to take home and eat for lunch tomorrow, but unfortunately, I missed the 3pm deadline. Ah, oh well, next time. The drink list is all kinds of whiskey amazingness. Just point and shoot at the menu, and you'll end up with liquid happiness in a glass.
