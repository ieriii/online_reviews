Caro Mio is pretty much named after me, so naturally I am a fan. The place really speaks for itself though. What I love most about Caro Mio is the dimly lit, quaint dining area. The dining area is always abuzz with friendly chatter from neighborhood locals and it seems to embrace me like a hug everytime I'm here. Dining here with special friends totally gives me that happy, fuzzy feeling so it was the perfect destination for an intimate and sentimental sendoff dinner for a special friend who is moving overseas. It's BYOB, which I am a fan of. The food is exceptionally tasty but pricey. I paid $21.95 for a huge portion of Spinach Gnocchi. It was pillowy, creamy, delicious and I had plenty leftover to take home-but I can get something equivalent to this for about half the price downtown at Quartino's. The only downfall of this place. Regardless of the price factor and me being a baller-on-a-budget, I will no doubt come back. Caro Mio is a great place for a date or gathering of close friends and family.
