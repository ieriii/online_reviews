I like this place a lot. I've only had the food two times, first time being the best. The pho wasn't as good as everybody seems to make it. My fave is the #83!!!!!! Oh man it was AMAZING!!!! The free egg roll that came with it reminded me of lumpia (Filipino egg roll). The best was the coconut custard smoothie! Anything custard, I LOVE.  The sandwich my mom had that only cost 2.95 was AWESOME!!! It' was the pork one. MMMMMMMM The only thing I hate is ordering from here for delivery (extra fees).
