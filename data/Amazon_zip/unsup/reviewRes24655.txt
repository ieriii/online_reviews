I first went to Artopolis when I was about 16; it was in close proximity to my high school and my parents and I would eat there for dinner pretty often. Back then, the staff always remembered my favorite order and were sweet enough to ask about my cheerleading practices and how school was going.  I went back there today, after not visiting for quite some time (ok, after not visiting for years! shame on me!), and it's still awesome. The service is top notch, the decor is really cute and the restaurant is very clean. The food is super yummy, fresh and always hits the spot. The desserts are my absolute favorite here. Their fruit tart was amazing when I was in high school and is still amazing today. I'd pay double or triple the price, it's that good. I've had fruit tarts from other locations and they can't hold a candle to the tart at artopolis. The buttery crust, creamy custard and tart fruit just blend together the right way. This is a great place for a girls night out (love the loft area!) or a casual lunch, but it's also good for families and dates, too. I don't think i've ever had a bad experience while dining in, or carrying out.
