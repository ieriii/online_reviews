Very solid establishment Has a mixed old school Chicago and modern day feel to it Very unique dining experience as well with the private booths surrounded by ultra long community tables Food was solid all around with some unique items you cannot find elsewhere The beer selection here is also insane If you like pork and you like beer, you cant miss this
