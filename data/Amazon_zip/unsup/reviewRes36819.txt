This was my 3rd time at the cafe, and I returned because the first two times were amazing. Everything I tried seemed to bring me sushi bliss. This time, however, I don't know what happened- everything had a "fishy" taste to it. Ironic as that may sound, fresh fish does not taste fishy, only fish that's been frozen and then thawed--never sushi grade. Unfortunately, all the fish in our maki rolls were inedible. We ordered $70 worth of maki rolls and ate a total of one roll combined (and even that left me nauseated for the remainder of the evening. Maybe there was a new sushi chef, maybe they had an off night, whatever it was...the restaurant experience was a bust. Kinda sad because I really loved this place initially.
