Will start off with the good. Food really did taste outstanding and presentation was very nice. Now the bad: 1) portions were small (I had a bowl of cereal at home after dinner). I understand that high end restaurants are not meant to stuff you like a chinese buffet but you should not go home hungry.  2) service was slowwwwwwww and not very polished. Arrived at 8:20. Acknowledged with water about 10 minutes later. No explanation of what was going on with the menu (there is none on Saturdays) and had to look at yelp to find out that Saturday's are the underground menu. Being our first time, would have loved to have been told when making the reservation or sitting down for dinner what was in store for us instead of having to research it on yelp while waiting for our food (cost, # of courses, etc). Eventually got our first course 30 minutes after sitting down. Our waiter was friendly but had a really hard time explaining what was going on each dish. This really did not make sense considering everyone in the restaurant was getting the same courses. I understand that the owner is into underground dining and tries to bring a high-end casual dining experience, but the service was too casual. There is a difference between casual/laid back atmosphere and slow/unpolished service. Overall the food really is great but can't recommend this place because of the price ($95/person for the underground menu), portions, and quality of service.
