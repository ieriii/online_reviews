Mmmmm mmmmm Good! The Godzilla Roll ws awesome! The Peter Parker Spider Man Roll was awesome! The Fire Dragon Roll was awesome! ...I think you get the picture. For appetizers, the miso soup had some jalapenos and a lot of other goodies - not just your plain broth. The edamame was average, but how can you really make edamame stand out, ya know? For dessert, we had green tea ice cream - also delicious and yummy! The service, in my experience, was great. Our waitress was attentive and very nice. The ambiance is also very cool - very contemporary Asian. I shall be back!
