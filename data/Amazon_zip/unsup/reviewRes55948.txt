I went here for dinner last night with a group of friends - we were 7 total. After we sat down and caught up a bit, we started reviewing the menu and discussing what we might order as appetizers. We didn't order anything, but all of a sudden the waiter came out with the things we had discussed. It was kind of nice, kind of weird. What if we'd changed our minds? We weren't sure what to think, and everyone had this moment of doubt - had we ordered and forgotten? It was a ballsy, possibly invasive move by our waiter, but luckily everyone was content with what we received. As other reviewers have noted, the main entrees are all really large. My BF got the gnocchi in bolognese sauce, which he devoured with only a little help from me. I got the funghi pasta, which was pretty good though way more garlicky than I realized based on the taste I had in my mouth this morning! BYO is always a bonus. We definitely saved money as a result.What is the deal with the painting in the women's bathroom? It mystifies me.
