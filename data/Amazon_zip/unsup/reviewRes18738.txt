Definitely one of the best burger and beer places in this city. The beer list is extensive, and i've never made it to the end of it (I've been about 10 times). Hah!! The bartenders are extremely knowledgeable about the beer they sell (often times I will just ask him to give me something good), even their not so good beers are amazing! Then you have their burgers (The Big Texan is my favorite), oh man and the fries. I really wish I lived closer. Good service, nice atmosphere, great food= stumble home!
