Xoco is something Rick Bayless has needed to do for a long time. It really shows off Mexican and southwestern cuisine without being too expensive or snooty. I usually only get the chance to go on Saturday when its completely packed. The wait for a seat is usually more than 30 min. The Saturday special (goat torta with avocados and black beans) is amazing. The homemade chorizo torta is only okay. I was pretty disappointed with the pork belly fideos - the broth was just too salty, but last time I was there, they had a sign for roasted duck caldos that looks really amazing (it's not on the menu on the website) The churros are good and not overly sweet and I love dunking them in the authentic chocolate. I was a little annoyed because I tried going there in early January and made the trip down from Evanston just to find out Topolo, Frontera, and Xoco were all closed for two weeks. I kinda wished they posted that on the website. So now I always call and make sure they're open before going. And last time I was there, we saw Rick passing through the kitchen and restaurant!
