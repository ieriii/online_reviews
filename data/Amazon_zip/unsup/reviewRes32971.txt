The first experience was so much better. Not sure what happened. Our server was awesome, though. I ordered the Beef Sambussa for the appetizer, and this was quite nice with the red berbere sauce. The Chicken and the Vegetarian (which wasn't much a vegetarian to begin with) was kind of weird - like ground chicken with no flavor. The Ye-Misir Wot was okay, not as the good texture and consistency I remember as this lentil dish was before; the Kik Alitcha was kind of like a curry paste with no hint of curry or flavor whatsoever - like bad baby food; the Derek Tibs were too potently lamb-like that was kind of sickening; the Ye-Siga Wat was like mush; the Kitfo, which was like another kind of mush. Basically, all of the samples tasted the same after the first few bites. The Ethiopian tea was quite soothing with the nice dollop of honey; I would just suggest get one individual messob, or one plate to share if you happen to come here; right now, I'm searching for another Ethiopian joint.
