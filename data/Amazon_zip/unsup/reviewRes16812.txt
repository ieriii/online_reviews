Just got back from lunch there. Best joint around the loop for indian. This place had the nicest buffet that i've ever been to. They also have Chicken Tikka Masala which was a big plus. Service was great Food was great only complaint is it's a bit pricey at $14.95 /lunch. it's worth it for a now and then joint.
