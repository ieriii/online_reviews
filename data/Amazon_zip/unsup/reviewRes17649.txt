2nd time I've been there, and great as usual. The 1st time I went was when it first opened. I was surprised to see a larger drink menu this time. Also, the music was excellent. They played blocks of the Stones, Radiohead, The New Pornographers. The rock music tells you that the place isn't too pretentious for it's own good. The only thing I would say is that people waiting behind the curtain should be more well informed by the host staff of what is going on. People all just stand in that cold doorway sort of confused about whose next in line.
