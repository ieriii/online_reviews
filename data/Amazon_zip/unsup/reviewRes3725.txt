When I'm not daydreaming of Bradley Cooper, I've actually caught myself daydreaming about these wings. It was a fall afternoon the first time I tried these and I was coming home from a Bears game when I had a craving for wings. Hot and spicy wings. Usually I am into the extra-hot-burn-your-mouth-and-other-parts-of-your-body hot sauce, but these are different and so flavorful. They are also the biggest wings that I have seen. Try the Seoul Sassy flavor. I also tried the Baby Buddha Bowl and it was just OK. I won't be ordering that again, but the wings?? Phenomenal.
