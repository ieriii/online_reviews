Ate at GE for the first (and last) time last night. I am a very experienced diner at all levels, including other molecular gastronomy experiences. This experience missed the mark at many levels. I know what they were trying to do, but they didn't get it done.The drinks, amuse and dessert were fine. The apps and entrees were average at best. The wait staff was sure that they were cool and therefore were too busy to do their jobs well.Poor pacing, poor explanations of dishes (largely due to the noise level), failure to refill water glasses, and 1 diner that went without a napkin for most of the meal (After the waiter took it from them when it hit the ground).This would have been a good meal for 140 dollars. For 240 dollars it was below average at best.Very disappointed!
