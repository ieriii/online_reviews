I've been to Indie quite a few times, and it's always been in my mind the "fancy" place to get Thai food. Decor, presentation - it's a cool place, and I've always liked going. The food is great. The food is fantastic. The food is wonderful. The service blows. Every time I go back, there's a little less friendliness, a lot longer wait for things. Today we were the second table to arrive on a Sunday afternoon, and it took ages for the server to come by to say hello. So long, in fact, that we were able to rattle off our order for appetizers, drinks and entrees because we had been reading the entire menu for so long. And I was there with two people who had never been there before - it's not like we were ordering the same thing we always did. We didn't see the server again until our food came out. At the end of the meal, when we were ordering dessert, my mother ordered a cup of hot coffee to go with it. For whatever reason, that delayed dessert an entire half hour. As well, when we finally received the coffee, the mug was only half-full. I guess they make tiny cups of coffee, one at a time - why would you put it into a full-size mug? The server brought the check, and my mother asked for another cup of coffee. The server paused, tutted, and went to change the final bill to charge us for the second cup of coffee, and 20 minutes later brought another half-cup of coffee. So glad we didn't need to be anywhere. To sum up: You have to try the food from Indie. It really is great. Just get it take-out.
