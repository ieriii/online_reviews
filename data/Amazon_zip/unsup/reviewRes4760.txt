Tapas style restaurants are not really my style but I have to give it to purple pig for doing a great job. Mixing tapas portions and at times full entree portions with their menu. I tried the shaved brussel sprouts which were fantastic. Tangy and a little sour they were a great starter. Than had the foie grois spread which was extremly rich and delicious. Make sure to ask for more toast! The lamb milanese was pretty good slightly gamey but still overall delicious with a hint of sour from the yogurt that it laid on matched with roasted chic peas. The only order that left me questioning this spot was prob the pig tail. It wasn't terrible but the sour saltiness of the chese mixed with fluffed scrambled eggs on top of the licorice pig tail left me puzzled on the flavor combination. It was tender but the meat itself wasn't as delicious as say... oxtail. It was very lean and hence a little more on the dry side. I' have to order the pork shoulder with the arugala. That looked much more appealing than the pig tail. In the end it was an awesome place to eat. Great location near shopping and the marilyn monroe sculpture. Service was great as well!
