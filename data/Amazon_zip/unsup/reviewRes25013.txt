WOW! Everything is good but the desserts are full of win! Seriously, the desserts are almost too gorgeous to eat, almost! I had an eclair, a friend got the tiramisu, both VERY good. Being a greek place, the coffee is really good too. Strong, thick and flavorful. I met some friends for dinner, luckily the kinds of friends who don;t mind sharing. We started with an appetizer plate with 4 kinds of greek salads and dipping breads. Very fresh and flavorful. Followed by a pastry puff thing (I'm Polish, so I apologize for not knowing proper names of things) filled with mushrooms and mild white cheeses that was one of the most savory delicious things I've ever eaten. Someone recommended the potato salad as a side which seemed an odd choice but it was really good! I think they use yogurt instead of may which gives it extra zip and a bit of lightness (flavor, not calories hehe). Great location only 2 blocks from the Blue line Halsted stop, even walkable from the loop - assuming you're not wear stillettos :) The place has always been pretty packed at traditional dinner times and later, no doubt because of its proximity to UIC. So be prepared for an occasional tipsy and/or obnoxious college student rolling in from a local bar. My only complaint was that every time I went service was slow, even when we were there during a slow time. I'm generally not in a huge hurry to get out of there, it has a great vibe, but ocassionally you get stuck waiting to eat a meal you've had for 15 minutes because you need a drink, condiment, etc, and that gets annoying. The little shop in the back of the store is great, lots of wines, condiments, snacks and you can of course purchase items from the dessert case, even cookies by the pound. Definitely worth a visit.
