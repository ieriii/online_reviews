I don't know why I haven't written about Piece sooner, but my recent weekend trip inspired me. Love that you can get crispy crust and thin pizza. Live band karaoke on Saturday, too? OH YES! Their goat cheese and tomato sauce appetizer makes me salivate just thinking about it. Their beer is nice for sitting back to watch the game or shenanigans that go on on a daily basis. It does get pretty busy and can be hard to find a table the later it gets at night, but it definitely is worth the wait. Servers are usually nice, but I did have a bit of a "what the heck?" moment with the guy at the host stand. He was just a little slow and off in his facial expressions to me and my friend this past weekend. I was like, um........am I in the right place here??? Anywho, definitely go once and decide for yourself. But I'm in love. P.S. Two words for you - dessert pizza.
