I came here for a birthday dinner, and was disappointed to say the least. I would consider this a middle of the road restaurant. We showed up slightly over dressed, thinking that this place was nicer than it really is. Basically, show up in jeans and you'll be fine. It's pretty casual unfortunately. We started off with a bottle of wine and shrimp cocktail. Wine was great. Shrimp cocktail was bad. I have never had bad shrimp cocktail....and I didn't expect it from a restaurant like this. The shrimp tasted like it was frozen for awhile...and not fully thawed. It had consistency that was rubbery and mushy at the same time.  We both had bone-in filet's. They were good...but not as good as City Hall / Mastro's / Flemmings / Captial Grille. I would order a steak from here again, as the price was reasonable (~$35) and you get a side. BUT, I probably won't come back....I mean, why bother? Our bill was about $150 + tip, and for a little bit more, we could've eaten at Captial Grille / Flemmings / Mastro's.  Anyhow.....this place is OKAY. Not super pricey, but not cheap. I guess it's all relative, but having been to nicer restaurants that cost slightly more, I just don't see the appeal to this place.
