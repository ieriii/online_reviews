This restaurant is too hyped up. Too much meat and the bill costed up to $140 for 2 people with no alcohol and no appetizer and one dessert. If you are a vegetarian this is not a place to go. On top of that as soon as we received our dessert, they gave us our check. Either, we were Asians or we forgot to put our deodorants, they clearly gave us a bill too soon without us asking. It was not even closing time...and it was not busy at the restaurant. Beware! We went to Blackbird restaurant the next day and they were much more nicer and the food was better, if you want a more upscale service.
