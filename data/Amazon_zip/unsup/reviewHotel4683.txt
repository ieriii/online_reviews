Great Hotel- Very nice, clean, great location. Contemporary decor too. What was especially nice was when I got stuck there for two additional nights during a blizzard, they not only did not gauge me on the price, but actually dramatically discounted the room rate for the 2nd two nights. Very nice, and very appreciated.
