I really love the food and that is what kept us ordering. However, after what happened today, we will NEVER order from them again. To begin with, they are always so rude when they answer the phone! We placed an order and after 1 hour 15 minutes it hadn't arrived and we called them. They said their delivery driver got his car stolen with all the deliveries. Understandable, but did they call us to let us know? NO! So, they said they would make it for us and have it there is a few minutes. 45 minutes later, we are still waiting and trying to call. NO ONE answered the phone for 20 minutes!! It just rang and rang. When the delivery driver got here after a total waiting time of 2 hours 15 minutes, I told him the situation and asked to see what he could do. He called and they offered us $6 off. We really didn't have an option because we were hungry. Then, we opened the food. It was stone cold! I called them and they happened to pick up the phone this time. The person on the phone was snooty and basically said that if we don't like it, give the food back and we'll get our money back. Ok, we USED to order from them at least twice a week and this is how we are treated?? The guy got so much attitude and did NOTHING to make us feel like they were sorry and treated us like it was our fault and that THEY were offended for us calling in. This is a horrible way to run a business and no amount of good tasting food is an excuse. They need to learn how to treat their customers. THEN, when we called to get our money, he yelled at us and said we are being very difficult to handle and he hung up the phone on us.
