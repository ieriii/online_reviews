Took clients there last week. Absolutely unbelievable in every way. I mean, roasting mixed nuts in duck fat says it all. A meat eater's paradise. I am not exaggerating when I say that it took my table 20 minutes to order- not because the service was slow... but because we salivated over every choice, argued over who would eat what, and finally told our fantastic waiter simply to order his favorite 4 meats, 4 apps, and two sides. Perfect choices. Will go back again and again!
