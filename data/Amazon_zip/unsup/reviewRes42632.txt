Art of Pizza came highly recommended from a friend of mine who says it's the best thin crust in town. We ordered this along with some mozzerella sticks. The pizza is different from most thin crusts with a unique sauce that sort of gives it a little spice. I have a feeling that most people will either love it or hate it. I thought it was good, although wouldn't classify it as the best thin crust I've ever had. Definitely a change of pace though from other places, although not something I'd eat on a regular basis. While it shouldn't count against their score, it was difficult to find a menu online (they didn't have a website). They also don't seem to have a computerized system in place to handle deliveries (thus making you give them all your info everytime you order). These are minor, but with the competition in the pizza space in the city, they are becoming necessities.
