Pizza here is nothing special and mostly bread (yes, I understand that the crust is an essential part of the pizza). Food comes out incredibly quick, but it is still not worth the usual 30-45 minute wait. The host is usually rude (I think he thinks he's being to-the-point, but he's coming off as old and grumpy and uncultured). I've come here at least 4 times and every single time the crust was burnt and the toppings were cheaped out. I stopped coming here when wood-oven pizza became a new craze and more places started serving it with better quality and at a lower cost. This place is a hype and not worth it.
