This is the only restaurant that I would wait an hour and 1/2 to be seated. I arrived around 8 to meet some friends who had put out name in about 10 minutes before I arrived. we sat outside at a metal picnic type table and plastic chairs. It is BYOB so we sat around and drank some white wine while we waited for our name to be called. I stepped inside to check it out and saw about four or five groups ahead of use sitting inside on a bench. I glanced intot he dining room which was super small and could not wait to be seated to eat. Went back outside and before you know it was after 9 and we still had not been called! I went inside to check and the guy at the counter said we were the next party. thank god. we were starving at this point! Ordered the guac and cheese empanadas to start off with. *sigh* The guac was delivcous and generously sized so there was plenty for the group of four of us!! I splashed some of the red hot sauce onto the chip with the guac and the combo of the sauce and the avocado was superb! mmmmmmm. the cheese empanadas were so light and crispy on the outside and after adding more of the red sauce onto the empanada it simply was one of the most delicious pastries!!! Mexican food will never be the same after trying these costa rican delicacies! I had the chile rellenos for a main course and they were quite frankly, the BEST chile rellenos I have ever had. Pure heaven. With a huge side of delicious yellow rice, beans and a perfectly dressed cabbage salad, this may have been one of my best latin american meals ever. I will definitely be back even if I have to wait for an hour and half to be seated. It was worth it, YUM!!!!! Thanks Irazu!! You should open another location really. I plan to be back alot,.
