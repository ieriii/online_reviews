i was really excited to finally try crisp yesterday after hearing so much about it on yelp. i ordered the original bad boy buddha bowl & the bf ordered some chicken tenders w the seoul sassy sauce & an order of beef bulgogi. i guess i didn't take a good look at the menu when i first ordered because i didn't realize that the buddha bowl only came w/ veggies, i went to order a side of beef & the guy was nice enough to just give it to me. once i added the beef to the buddha bowl i was genuinely excited to devour this dish..the veggies were very tasty & the beef was really flavorful. it was a pretty big portion that i had enough to take home for leftovers. the bf's order was really good too, the chicken was awesome & i really liked the seoul sassy sauce. the beef bulogi was a pretty big portion too & came w/ a generous side of fries. i also like the wide selection of beverages they have here..they even had san pelligrino limonata..my fav!!! crisp is a casual place w/ great food for a good price..definitely will be coming back!! (especially bc i wanna try the bulgogi burrito!)
