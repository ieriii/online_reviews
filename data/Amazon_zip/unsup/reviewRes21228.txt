My friend Timmay lives across from Mayan Palace and as Timmay is all about: A) expending NO calories whatsoever, and B) half-price margaritas, why, he is the luckiest guy on the planet. Timmay loves to go here - several times per week if possible. I finally went with him recently and have to admit I liked it very much though it is really loud. The nachos are great, the guac is good. I think they need to work on their chip freshness and hotness. Timmay always orders the carne asada but his reason d'etre at the Palace is 1/2 price margarita night - which is Tuesday AND Thursday. Tasty! I can't vouch for service for the masses (kidding here) but for US it is superb. Timmay goes there so much he is apparently like some sort of folk hero and he and anyone who goes with him receives treatment akin to idol worship. One night they seated us outside where there is only one table and other patrons kept coming to look to see who we were. Seriously, lots of handshaking, frequent chip bowl refills, repeated table visits by waiters and management - it was hysterical, but will keep us coming back for more. Mayan Palace, thanks for always making us feel so welcome!
