This place is pretty perfect. The food is great, staff is nice and the place is clean. We came on a Monday night when at least half the tables were occupied so it wasn't too busy or awkwardly empty. The host was really kind, gauged our background in Ethiopian cuisine and was ready to give us any introduction necessary. We shared the vegetarian messob and a couple appetizers. Each dish has its unique spices so flavors weren't too redundant and a real pleasure to share. The menu has some amazing options, definitely worth revisiting to plow through a little more of it.
