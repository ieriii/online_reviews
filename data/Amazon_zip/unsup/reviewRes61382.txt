The first time I went to Brazzaz I had turned 17 and was with the family. I think this place is the best because its all you can eat, but you never have to leave your seat food is brought to you by manny of staff members. this place is a lil expensive but is deffinetly worth every dollar. the food is fairly exotic and taste great, because its always hot. I deffinetly think its worth a trip to Chicago. so go have fun its a great experience.
