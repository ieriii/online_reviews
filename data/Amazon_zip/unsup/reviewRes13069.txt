went there because i bought a coupon from groupon. appetizer - we ordered Tamal Cubano. it's very special however a bit too salty. otherwise it's a OK dish. entree 1 - had Comal steak. it's a bit too sweet and sour kinda like a chinese sweet and sour chicken/pork. it was a OK dish just a bit too sweet. entreet 2 - my friend ordered Almond Crusted Halibut and it turns out to be quite delicious.
