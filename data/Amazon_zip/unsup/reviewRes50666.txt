My mom and I came here for a quick brunch on Saturday. We sat down right away, which is always great, and had a very nice waitress. The menu had an equal selection of both savory and sweet brunch-y items...which I always like. I went for savory with the black bean cakes while my mom went sweet with blueberry pancakes. I really enjoyed my meal, especially the potatoes mmmmmmmmm. My mom enjoyed her pancakes too saying they were very tasty and didn't sit like a brick in her stomach (something many a lesser pancake is known to do.) The best part for me however is that is serves brunch all day! Brunch any time?! I'm there. addendum: while brunch-y items remain high on my list, my overall impression of wishbone had been on a steady decline. They're "regular" dinner type food items are totally below par and I haven't much cared for the overall atmosphere/service on my past couple visits. tear.
