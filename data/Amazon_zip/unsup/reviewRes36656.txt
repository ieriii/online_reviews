I loved The food and the Milk shakes. The Vanilla milk shake was the best i ever had. And the latin omlette was AMAZING. This place is expensive but for me worth it. Expect to pay 10-15 dollars for a big omlette. But this was quite an experience. The staff was very friendly, and i did not feel rushed
