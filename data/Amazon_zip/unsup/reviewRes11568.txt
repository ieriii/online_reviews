This place has a long wait, but it's Sooo good pizza, and the Beer that they brew there is amazing. I'd like to think I'm a beer snob, and I think their brewed beer is better than 3/4 of the mass produced beer out there! The pizza is quality and different. Only down side is it's a Loooooong wait and can be pricey. I recommend captain kick ass.
