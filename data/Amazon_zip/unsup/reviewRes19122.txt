this is a cool unique Bar and grill. they have a bar area with tables and a Back room with Table Shuffleboard. most things on the menu have creative names. i have an egg sandwich with hash it was call the tango and Hash. they have a HUGE beer list draft and Bottle. this is my new favorite bar in North center.
