Shaw's has slowly creeped into my Chicago restaurant rotation. Which is VERY difficult to do, only because the "to try" list is expansive.  I saw a write up about the lobster roll here on the Tribune site a few months ago. Something about my landlocked summer spurred an immediate urge in me to eat that lobster roll as soon as possible. Because Shaw's serves brunch on Sunday, Saturday lunch was the only time I figured I could order it-- I think it took until fall until I finally made it in. Regardless, the lobster roll lived up to every single expectation both I and my friend had. We've been back again and again and while he never strays from the roll, I've tried oysters, crab, shrimp, salads and have NEVER been disappointed.  I love eating in the Oyster bar, the vibe is laid back and congenial and there's always such a variety of people, which I think is always the sign of good food. All types are going to travel for it, you should too.
