There are always lines. Too many tourists who act like they've never ordered a hot dog before. Not enough parking on the street. Confusing (to me) ordering process of ordering under pressure and then receiving a ticket but you don't pay til they call you up. People who ordered before you looking at you enviously as you pick up your order before they do. DELICIOUS hot dogs that leave no heartburn, no need for Prilosec. Fries that are from back in the day. Not greasy, not too salty. Pickled green tomato. All in a nice box. Too expensive in my humble opinion, but since I don't eat hot dogs and fries but a couple times a year, worth it.
