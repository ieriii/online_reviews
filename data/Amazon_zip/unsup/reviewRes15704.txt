I LOVE CARNIVALE! love it. You should go! I wanna go back. Where do I begin? The ambiance is amazing. Very vibrant and energetic. We did make reservations, but it was not necessary as we went early Friday evening. Food: We ordered the Salmon & the Bife Angosto (NY Strip Steak). Both were AMAZING! I also had the Frozen White Sangria....yummy. We were more than pleased with our food. Cons: Our server was just okay...didn't quite know how to make eye contact, so that was rather irritating. A bit pricey, but the food makes up for it! I"m looking forward to going back! :)
