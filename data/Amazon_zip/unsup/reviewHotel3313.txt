Five Thumbs-up! After my last review, which was still really good, I got a message from a hotel rep about the forthcoming upgrades. I'm here tonight on the 19th floor, corner room. The funky shades have been replaced by blackout drapes. The carpet has been replaced and the Base Bar downstairs is now Angels & Kings, with a great looking' decor, though for some reason looks smaller than it used to... The hotel is on top of their game. The check-in could not have been more friendly. This is a cool hotel! Great job Hard Rock Chicago!
