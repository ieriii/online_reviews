One of the best sushi spots in the city! This was my third visit to Coast and I went for my birthday dinner with three other friends. It was Monday night so it wasn't too crowded and it was such a phenomenal experience, like it always is. John was our server and he was so nice, attentive, knowledgeable, etc... This truly is one of the best BYOB spots around and their sushi is absolutely delicious! Highly recommended, but make sure you make a reso!
