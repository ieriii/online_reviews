I absolutely loved this place!! Everything was spectacular...from the decor to the service and then to the food. The restaurant itself is rather small but decorated lovely and the overall ambiance is very pleasing. Our waiter was phenomenal...answering all of our questions and he had such an incredible attitude! One of the best things we ate was the queso fundido clasico! It was out of this world delicious!! We will definitely going back...soon!
