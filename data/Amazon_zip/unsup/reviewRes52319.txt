Being that I am not local and only got to try Chicago deep dish pizza only once in Chicago, I wanted to make sure it was the best. Asked the cabbie what he preferred and Gino's East it was! We went for a late lunch before our flight so it wasn't crowded. Our server was great and attentive, he gave us a heads up that it takes awhile to make the pizzas due to takeouts. It took about half an hour to get our pizza, but when it came out, it was worth the wait! I think we got one with everything and it was phenomenal. We even took the remaining on the flight home and even after a two hour delayed flight, three hour plane ride home, it was still good heated up in the micro! If I'm ever in Chicago again I know where I'm going!
