Every time I order falafel at Sultan's Market, I am hard pressed to decide whether I may be eating the best falafel that I've ever tasted, even better than what the Arabs sell in Jerusalem's Old City. My favorite item off the menu however, is the zatar fatia with baba ganoush-- a pita spread with olive oil and zatar spice mix, topped with feta cheese, tomato, onion, and the fore mentioned eggplant spread. Chased down with San Pelligrino limonata, this is my quintessential late Sunday afternoon lunch.
