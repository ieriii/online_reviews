I've been going here for years and have enjoyed their food! we especially love their homemade tortilla chips that they serve you before you get your meal with their great salsa. each time I try to order something different and I'm not disappointed. Their margaritas are not that great. Seem as though they need more alcohol. LOL but that's just me.
