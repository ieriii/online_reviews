Yikes... tough crowd for this restaurant. I looked at the reviews and saw some nice words but only three stars. I had friends who had been here before and loved it. So I felt confident about the visit. We went for Saturday lunch so we had the place to ourselves. We ordered family style and ordered for lunch accordingly. I shared a platter and had a starter plate between two people. I saw several tables where everyone order a platter. I thought for dinner that might be the better thing to do. We started with the empanadas get the combination - beef, chicken and cheese--perfect size and delightful-- I added a bit of housemade Chimichurri sauce. We shared the Langostinos al Carbon and ordered the Entraa platter; this is beef skirt steak--which the waiter recommended. The Entraa came out perfectly as ordered and smelled delightful. The platter also included plantain, potato and Yuca. When I used the Chimichurri with the skirt steak I was fully contented and felt like I ordered the right items. One of the best Caipirinha's I have had in North America... The drink was adorned with the right amount of limes--both for adornment but also for flavor. So good that I could not just have one! Great service and good environment. Next time I will return in the evening.
