I love Crisp! I discovered crisp through a korean friend who told me about their chicken wings. I love the Seoul Sassy wings. When you think wings, you think greasy, right? No, the seoul sassy makes you forget all the calories you might be consuming but instead forces you to focus on their perfectly fried chicken wings. So crisp and crunchy. I'd also recommend the Bulgogi Burrito which is a personal favorite. I love the sauce they give you with this - it actually reminds me of a spicy thousand island sauce. Sounds gross but it's actually quite good. My only complaint - I wish they would deliver further and were opened later. I'd like to go here one day after I have had a night of drinking! :)
