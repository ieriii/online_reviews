Really tasty food. I've only been twice but each time I was more than satisfied w/ my food. The second time I had eaten just before so I couldn't get through my food but I still wanted to gorge myself on it. The first time I was there was on a weekend night and was able to get a seat fairly quickly to my surprise with a large group despite the relatively small seating area. I definitely need to try out more of their menu but their sandwiches and burritos were really tasty. My brother enjoyed their skirt steak as well. Shakes were interesting and delicious too. A highly recommended change from all those wonderful taquerias you probably often eat at.
