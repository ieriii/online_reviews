I had a great lunch here last weekend, as the dining room is cozy and casual and the food was comforting too. Even though I was kind of in a meaty mood, what I ate was delicious and satisfying. I started with a nice craft brew, and then couldn't even finish the huge black bean burger I ordered! It came with my choice of side, so of course I had to go for the mac and cheese, and this too was tasty.  Everything was fresh and that is pretty important when the majority of your meal consists of vegetables.  I'd go back any day, whether I'm craving meat or not!
