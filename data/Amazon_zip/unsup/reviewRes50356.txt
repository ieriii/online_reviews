Big love to Big Jones! The *automatic*!* *bonus*!* beignets (that's right!) that are served to all in lieu of biscuits or cornbread (actually, now that I think about it, biscuits, cornbread...yummmm!) are a nice touch. I also love their Intelligentsia coffee. For some reason, even the decaf is awesome and neither taste nearly as good when I brew them at home. Argh! In any event, I like to talk a big game, but I always roll on in and order the same doggone dish. Can't help myself. The Cheddar Corn Cakes just make me shuffle off to Buffalo-oh-oh! with their perfect corn cakeiness and their pillowy soft scrambled eggs. Thank you, Easter Bunny. Bok! Bok!
