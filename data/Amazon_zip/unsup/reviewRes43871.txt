Milk & Honey is yummy, their patio is dog (and pit!) friendly, and it's the best place to go on a warm summer day. I love their yogurt and granola and their iced chai with soy is amazing. I know yogurt and granola is a boring choice but it's that good. I should go back soon to try something new, even though I'll miss the patio :(
