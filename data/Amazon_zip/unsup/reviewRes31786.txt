Great place for brunch. The wait for a table and food isn't too bad. The nanadict is addicting. And on a side note, their pickles are really good. My only gripe is they don't serve Diet Coke. BUT it is an organic restaurant but sometimes I need chemicals to wash it all down. Luckily they have really good coffee.
