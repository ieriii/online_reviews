Stayed here when went for a graduation party at the house of blues last summer. Location is ideal, only a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue and a great view of the river. The hotel is great, nice lounge, fun decorations. The room is tastefully done. It has all the expected amenities, flat screen TV, bath robes, and the amazing beds. Westin by far has the best beds, even better than the JW's I have stayed it. Pricing is reasonable, went in the beginning of Chicago summer, and this place was $150 ish a night. Highly recommend.
