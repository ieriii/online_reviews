There are many reviews here and elsewhere that capture various aspects of visiting Alinea, and there's no need to repeat any of that. My advice for anyone curious about the place is to not think of it so much as a restaurant, but as journey to the edge of the world of culinary experiences. The food, and the cost, is fantastic in the strictest sense of the word, and this is not a place to go unless you are specifically seeking a unique and outrageous evening that involves all your senses, with food used as a medium of expression. I was challenged to keep track of all the flavors, aromas, textures, and even sounds and visual effects, and eventually just relaxed and let it flow over and through me. I am still "digesting" it all several days later. If this sounds weird to you, then don't go. You'll be bewildered and might even feel had. If this sounds fascinating and you're not squeamish about cost, odd ingredients, and treating food like art, then don't put off your visit until "some day" that may never come.
