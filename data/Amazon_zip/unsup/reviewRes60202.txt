Had the bbq chicken pizza here on friday and it was delicious. The pizza here is thin crust only and the menu is exstensive. Whether you are feeling reserved or really adventurous they seemed to have everything to fit any taste.   We went with the x large pizza between two people and finished the entire thing so if you are bringing an appetite dont go with the medium as the pizza itself is light so going through multiple slices is no problem. Definetly recommend. One thing if you are planning on coming here, the dining space is small so carry out or delivery is you're best bet.
