we celebrated the birthday here tonight. the salad bar was very nice, enjoy it. but the actural grill meat was just so so. I prefer well or well done but it's definately overcook. so i guess midium is well for them, which i recommend. n it is not that busy tonight but they were really slow while serving, or everyone came at the same time. so we either not getting food/serving for a while, or we got planty food in plate. by the time we can finish it, it already cooled down. i guess after busy valentine's day, all the servants got tired tonight. their dessest is not bad. again, just took too long time to serve. :( bummer~~ well well well, not a super bad place. but i just expected more at this price range. :)~~~~~ ^0^
