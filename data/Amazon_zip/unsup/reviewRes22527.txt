My methodology for rating Greek Islands 1) free valet - plus one star 2) open until 12am, even on a Monday night when I am starving and nothing else is open - plus one star 3) the lemon rice soup (with a name something like aveglamonado - that is totally wrong, but look for similar word on the menu, order it, and let your taste buds dance!) - plus one star 4) anything with fins from this place is amazing - I love that they fillet the fish table side, it is always super fresh and perfectly seasoned with olive oil, oregano, and lemon...the simplicity is delicious - plus one star 5) the feta...on a salad, on the shrimp with tomato sauce dish, basically on anything (or alone) it rocks my world - plus one star Five stars - nice job Greek Islands!
