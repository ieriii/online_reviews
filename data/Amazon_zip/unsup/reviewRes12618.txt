Don't be fooled...this place *used* to be good. Not anymore. I went with a friend for an early seating on a Saturday night. We ordered 4 appetizers, soup, salad and the Cuban chicken, plus 1 falcoholic drink. The soup and Cuban chicken were oversalted to the point of nearly being inedible. The salad was .. meh. The tostones were burnt. Overall, very disappointing. Our waiter was attentive and helpful, although we had to ask a couple of times for water and they cleared our table like there was a fire. Worse of all, we had JUST paid our bill and were text messaging our friends about where to meet after dinner and the manager asked us to leave our table because they had people waiting who had reservations. This despite an empty 4 top right next to us. The manager must've realized he was out of line because he offered us free drinks at the bar and apologized. But I have to say this is a new low for this place. Used to be a lively, friendly place to eat. My friend and I decided there are too many good restaurants in Chicago to bother coming back here again.
