My MAJOR complaint is the lack of air conditioning in the restaurant. It was very hot outside and inside was NOT much cooler at all. The wait was almost a hour and there was no a/c in the waiting area. After waiting a hour to be seated, it did NOT get cooler in the eating area. We were so uncomfortable. We didn't even order coffee, we were so hot. The service was not horrible, but was not good. We ate so quickly because we were so hot, and let me say, the food was okay. The food was certainly not worth having to deal with the above. There are too many great places to eat in Chicago to have to deal with this place.
