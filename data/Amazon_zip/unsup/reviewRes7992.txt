Brazilian churrasco--a never ending parade of meat complimented by a massive salad bar where salad is an afterthought--is tailor made for Americans, and in Chicago, American city of steakhouses, Fogo de Chao reigns supreme. An outpost of the venerable Brazilian chain with more locations in the USA than in South America, Fogo offers the quintessential churrasco experience, from the steaks grilled by a live bonfire to the gaucho studs who only stop slicing steak off of skewers and straight onto your plate when you tell them to stop. Fools fill up on the salad bar, the peerless pao de quiejo, and the addictive fried polenta. Those in the know save room exclusively for Fogo's spectacular beef. In Brazil, cattle is butchered into different cuts than in the States, and unknowns such as picanha and fraldinha stand out. Churrasco purists will note the absence of chicken hearts and the cut cupim (neither of which suit the taste of most American diners). Some cuts, such as beef ribs, are generally available only by request. The spectacle continues well past desert (exemplary flan and tres leches cake) with a liqueur cart and a unique frozen Licor 43 service. In many ways, the theatricality of the experience at Fogo de Chao harkens back to the golden days of Don Roth's Blackhawk, where the food was the entertainment. Alas, there are no spinning salad bowls in sight, but I'll take a slice of Fogo's beef over a slice of "Halo Heat" Prime Rib any day.
