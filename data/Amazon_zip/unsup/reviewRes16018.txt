It was a cold Wednesday night, 7pm, when I met friends at the Violet Hour hour to celebrate a birthday. I knew the boarded and graffitied facade were the only identifiers for the cocktail lounge, but I still felt like I was doing something wrong as I opened the nearly invisible door. Still, having nothing but faith, I pushed through two layers of thick curtains before I entered the eerie Twin Peaks-esque lounge. The waitress, who I blew past looking for my friends, yelled: "hi, hello? I'm here to help you!" And she did, not only with finding my friends, but with describing and recommending cocktails. My favorite was: the Juliet and Romeo. Refreshing, crisp, balanced, delicious. This is a perfect spot for some dope cocktails with friends. Oh, and they play albums through, how novel. We enjoyed some Townes Van Zandt and Grizzly Bear. I will definitely be back.
