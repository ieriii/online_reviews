My husband and I went here for dinner last night (a Friday). We arrived a little early so we had a drink in the bar to start. I had the sangriatini which is a sangria served with is a combination of wine, a sparkling wine, brandy, and fruit. It was really tasty. My husband had a dirty martini that was also good. Our bartender was really down to earth and friendly. The atmosphere in general is a little "hip" for me- but it was also a Friday. The restaurant itself is very pretty. I love the decor and the high vaulted ceilings. We waited about 20 minutes after our reservation time (so not too bad). After being seated we were brought a crunchy bruschetta like bite- this was fabulous. Next we ordered wine and some starters. I asked the server to recommend me a dry white wine. She chose the most expensive glass on the menu which ended up being sweet. My husband ordered a middle of the road temperanillo which he enjoyed. We ordered the olives, the sardine dish, and the bacon wrapped figs. We loved these three dishes (although my husband thought the bacon figs were a little too sweet). Next we ordered the brussel sprouts, the patatas bravas and the pork belly. The brussel sprouts tasted as though they were drenched in oranges. The patatas bravas tasted fake- we hated them. The pork belly was really tasty. We finished with the chocolate croquetas which were not very good- tasted like the outside of a mozzarella stick with a yucky chocolate inside. Being people that love Spanish food and have been to Spain- this food was nothing that special. It was also pricey. Our bill was expensive for decent food and decent wine.
