I've tried to write this review about 10 times now and have decided there is no way to meaningfully explain a meal at Schwa. It's just as much about the experience as it is the food - like being inside the head of an incredibly talented crazy person with interesting snacks that you may or may not understand. It's BYOB, but don't be surprised if you end up drinking another table's booze. At table food descriptions include phrases like "cheese from goats that were walked up and down mountains until they were dehydrated." (To date, I have no idea if that was a joke.) The quail egg ravoli is every bit as good as everyone hypes it up to be, but I think my favorite course was the apple pie soup, which came topped with cheese, because as Chef Carlson explained to us "back in the day they used to put cheese 'n shit on apple pie." Offal courses are standard, so if you are squeamish about eating organ meats, this might not be your cup of tea. But if you are up for an adventure, Schwa is a can't miss. Now good luck getting that elusive reservation...
