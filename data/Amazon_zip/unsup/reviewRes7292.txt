I went with a group of 6, and we all really enjoyed it! I had to take one star away for how long it took us to get our food (multiple lulls in conversation with that "why isn't the food here yet?" feeling). Service: Excellent. We were seated as soon as our party arrived (yes, we had reservations). Our server was professional and friendly. He also let us finish off the open bottle of champagne (it tasted more like a muscat) because it was the end of the night. My only service qualm was the busboy who didn't ask if we wanted boxes. Some of the early cleared plates didn't get a box, they thought it was assumed. Food: Very Good. Everyone liked their chosen dish. I had Risotto Pescatore - scrumptious! The half I took home even reheated well. We got bruschetta (OK), fried calamari (tasty), and grilled calamari (not my thing, but still pretty good). Dessert-wise, everything was yummy (chocolate hazelnut pennacotta was my favorite), but also a little too sweet. Portions were HUGE for entrees and dessert, and there's no way I would've wanted half of a dessert, let alone a whole one, on my own. Space: Very Good. I liked the decor. It really did feel like the fancier restaurants I went to in Florence. The dark wood, the dim lighting, the weird floor plan (mini room in the back), all made it seem very old-world. This would be a GREAT first date place and a great family place (with hungry kids, not so much toddlers). This is not a great quick-and-go. You'll be here a while, so go with company you like!
