Delicious, flavorful Asian food!! I've been here a few times and it has been a rewarding experience every single time. The "Fresh, Fresh, Fresh Vegetarian Roll", Vegetarian's Delite, Tofu & Egg plant slow baked in a clay pot with caramel sauce and black pepper have been our favorites. The warm tea is so soothing especially when the temperature begins to drop. Its very nice that their service has been consistently good.
