Still one of my top 3 sushi places in all of Chicago. The rolls are amazing. The only down side is that is probably one of the more expensive places I've ever been to as well. But I bite the bullet frequently... haha :) I eat a lot of sushi and don't usually order desert, but their heaven and earth desert is AMAZING. So is the peter Parker roll Quality of rolls: 5 (Size, taste, and freshness) Environment: 5 (they even give you a warm towel to clean your hands when you arrive) Price: 4 (slightly on the high side for what you get and they have upped their cork fee since I started going there) Service: 4.5 (about the same as every sushi place in the city)
