everyone not hispanic that i know-- loves this place. everyone i know that IS hispanic, things it's just "alright" I think it's pretty good! A torta with every dressing, sour cream, and guac for about $5? can't beat that. The meat is good quality and pretty tasty too. Big portion that I can eat in two sittings. That's a great value to me. With the renovation, it's so much a nicer place to go with some friends to have a bite if you're shopping in the square. Their horchata rocks and they even serve tres leches! mmmm.... Even the complimentary chips and salsa taste fresh (boo to stale chips.) Bottom line. Mexican joints in chicago can be pretty hit-or-miss with the numerous hole in the walls out there. But Garcia's has great quality, great prices, and offers a whole lot more than just tacos and burritos. I've also sampled their tortilla soup and ceviche... some other things. And nothings ever disappointed.
