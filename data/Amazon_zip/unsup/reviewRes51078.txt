My sister and I went to this place on a Tuesday morning to avoid the crowd. We had a pleasant experience overall. My sister had an egg over hard, bacon, and home fries. She loved the bacon because it was so crispy. I got the crispy french toast with ham which was pretty tasty. Overall, the food was good, but not spectacular because it seems like something you can make at home. However, if you want an easy weekday morning, Wishbone is a good place to be.
