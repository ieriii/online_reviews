Absolutely loved this place! We had a party of eight right in the middle of the diner, on a Tuesday night. The table allowed us to be in the middle of the action and pick up on the great vibe. Our waiter was friendly, offered great suggestions and extremely efficient. This is a kick back casual spot and were tended to throughout by a great Diner team. Some of our tasty highlights included the tostada, pulled pork sandwich, black bean burger, quesadilla. Our waiter recommended the cookie dough shake - Wow it was great, everyone tasted it. This is a vegetarian spot, only one of us was vegetarian, but we all came away very satisfied. Looking forward to a return visit.
