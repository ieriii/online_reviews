The service here was terrific. Our server doted on us and gave wonderful descriptions for my picky needy self.  Loved the atmosphere- comfortable and homey yet hip. Yum list: Mussels Vindaloo Bread Basket...soooo fresh and warm Escargot_interesting but deep fried so not the traditional way Oysters - 5 out of 6 ...didn't tell them but one was not really there Brussel Sprouts Mushrooms(WOW) Wine is pricey but very generous portions. 2 glasses equaled 3 elsewhere Not a cheap night by any means but an outstanding experience with perfect food.
