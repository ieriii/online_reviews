Just tired Yolk once but was impressed all the way around. Was sat quickly even though it was busy. Friendly but efficient waitress got our order out (and right) fast too. I don't eat meat, but the bacon looked great - thick slices, cracked black pepper, etc. Big portions and a lot of choices on the menu. Ambiance was great too -- very cheerful (but tasteful) use of yellow throughout the place. Will go back for sure.
