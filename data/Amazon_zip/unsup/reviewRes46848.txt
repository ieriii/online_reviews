I love the idea of loving Uncommon Ground more so than I actually did. I liked the free parking lot (although small and forces you to take a hard turn into the alley to get in), and I liked the spaciousness of this restaurant once inside. The service was spectacular too. We couldn't get seated until all 6 of us arrived, and overall we were 30 minutes late, but they weren't rude about it. And our waitress was extremely upbeat and seemed almost eager to take 2 group photos of us. The food, however, looked better than it tasted. I wanted to really be able to taste pure, organic ingredients and be convinced that paying a premium at the grocery store is worth it, but I wasn't convinced. I had the $10 roast turkey sandwich on rosemary focaccia with garlic aioli, cranberry jam, avocado, and egg. The cranberry jam overpowered the sandwich, and the bread was kind of floppy, making it not that easy to eat as a sandwich. My bf had the $12 montana omelet with bacon, scallions, cheese, and potatoes that were stuffed inside. He prefers the potatoes to be on the side because it keeps the skin crisp. I really enjoyed the fresh blueberry jam that comes with toast, though! Now THAT was what I was hoping to taste throughout my entire meal - freshness that can't be mistaken!
