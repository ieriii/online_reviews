First timer, just moved from New York to Chicago. Been healthy eating for many years now, am a holistic counselor, and the first thing I noticed was that the Chicago Diner actually uses vegetables (as opposed to other veggie places that use faux meats, etc.)! Chicago Diner makes delicious food that has been developed over the many years it's been serving Chicago, highly recommend it. UPDATE: Ok, they do use a bunch of faux meats, but still a high recommendation!
