Went here last night, this placed was packed!!!  The meat was great...very tender and juicy. There was a good variety of meats; however, I preferred not to try the lamb since I'm not too fond of the taste. The salad bar was good and pretty big, but where was the fruit??? One star off for the lack of roasted pineapple on the skewer. That was actually what I wanted. I went to Brazzaz during the summer and they had the roasted pineapple and it was soooo warm, so juicy, and so delicious. That's what I was looking forward to last night, but no pineapple!! I was sad. If I had a choice, I think I'd go back to Brazzaz....less expensive and they have roasted pineapple!
