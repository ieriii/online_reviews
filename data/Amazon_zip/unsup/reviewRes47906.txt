I've only been to the rooftop so far, but what an atmosphere. My friends and I sat on banquettes that were surrounding a grassy lawn. I've never seen that before. Just glad it didn't rain earlier. Get here early because they tend to have a line about an hour after opening. The cocktails are on the expensive side and I wouldn't recommend ordering wine if you want your money's worth, even by city standards. All in all, I would go back a few times a year for sure. Can't wait to try dinner.
