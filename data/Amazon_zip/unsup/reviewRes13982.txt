Holy smokes, ya'll. They make a sandwich with steak, grilled onions, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato AND FLATTENED PLANTAINS INSTEAD OF BREAD. I'm kind of a newbie to Cuban food, but if its as amazing as this sandwich, I'm moving to Cuba. This place is sooo cute too. It's just a little take out place but it has old Spanish ads from the 50s on the walls, and a dog sniffing another dog's butt painted on the outside. Also, they have a hot sauce there that was perfect for the sandwiches. Although it was small we totally stayed and ate and hung out for a while here. The staff was sweet and would make a lot of noise when someone new would come in, and then they came out and asked us how the food was. We also tried a guava & cheese empanada that was delicious! I can't wait to come back.
