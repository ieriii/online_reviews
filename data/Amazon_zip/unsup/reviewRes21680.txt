This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Chicago. I wandered in here after I first moved to the neighborhood, not really knowing what to expect. I was beyond pleasantly surprised with what I found. The service is outstanding and the staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. The food is great and they have quite a few options to please everyone. The margaritas are also not to be missed (especially on 1/2 price night)! Mayan Palace is not to be missed!
