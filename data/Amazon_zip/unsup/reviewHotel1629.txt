So for our 2.5 year anniversary I left all the planning up to my boyfriend. I was pleasantly surprised at the hotel he picked for us to stay...admittingly I am sort of a "hotel snob", & from walking in the door to checking out had a very good experience. My boyfriend surprised me with having chocolates covered strawberries ready and waiting in our room as a romantic surprise. They also delivered a bottle of White wine on our first night (our official anniversary date). The decor of the hotel was pretty modern & our room was huge! We had an amazing view of the city from our room, I couldnt stop looking out the window & actually slept with the windows open. The only reason I couldnt rate this hotel a 5star hotel. We encountered 2 problems. One of the 2 elevators stopped working so guests had to use either the 1 working elevator or the service elevator, which made length deliveries & things much longer. Also I have really sensitive skin & dont use the soaps provided by the hotel management, so I usually travel with my own soap, not thinking anyone would throw it away i left it in the shower, for the next time i use it. When we got back to our room after being out all day, I noticed our room was cleaned & my soap was gone & replaced with a brand new HOTEL BAR OF SOAP. Luckily we were close enough to everything, from downtown, millenium park & shopping..I was able to replace what they had thrown away...needless to say I didnt leave my soap in the shower in the next morning.
