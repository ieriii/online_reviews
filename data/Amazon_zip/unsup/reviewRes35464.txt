I have to say that my party of four really had a five star experience last night. We were seated promptly for our reservation. Our table was in the back room, which was nice because it was a bit quieter than the main room. Our waitress was friendly and took a drink order right away. Lemondrop martinis, Elder....martinis both were very, very good. The latter was made with gin, lemon and mint. So tasty! The king crab bites appetizer was amazing. Super fresh and tender meat. The crab dip was amazing. My party said the oyster Rockefeller was good too, but I wasn't brave enough to try oyster. Steak and seafood combo dishes. All fantastic. Perfectly cooked filet minion. I ordered medium and got a true medium, warm pink steak. Delicious!!! Desserts aren't anything special, but still good.
