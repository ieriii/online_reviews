Decided to have a very vegan Thanksgiving this year so I ordered a meal from here. Since I've never eaten here before I was a little skeptical, hoping the food would be good...got home after picking it up and of course had to try a few bites of everything before Thanksgiving tomorrow...WOW. The tofu "turkey," the stuffing, the cranberry sauce, the gravy, the pumpkin pie...amazing. Absolutely amazing. I will be back to eat there, really cute place and friendly staff. 5 Stars!!
