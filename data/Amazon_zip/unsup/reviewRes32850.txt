Ok, before going here, I would eat sushi, but I wouldn't say that I loved it. Now, I LOVE SUSHI. This place is absolutely delicious! It's a little on the pricy side, but if you can go on a day that they have a special, the rolls are absolutely amazing! I think I'm partial to the dynamite and golden child rolls, as well as the duck salad for an appetizer. The service has always been good, they bring out your food as soon as it's made, and the staff overall is quite friendly. Check it out, even if you're not big into sushi. This place will change your mind!!
