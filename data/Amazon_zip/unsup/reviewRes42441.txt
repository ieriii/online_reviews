Yes, I know deep dish is allegedly what they do best, but I don't feel you can judge a pizza place soley on deep dish until you've had their thin crust. Why? Because Art of Pizza's thin crust pizza is horrendous. Domino's crust tastes less like cardboard (yeah, I said it!) And their deep dish? Still not that great. Giordano's or Chicago's is better. And I'm not sure the cheese was entirely melted in the last deep dish pizza I got from them. Ew.
