Before coming to Chicago, my friends put Hot Doug's on the top of the list of things to try. However, upon arriving to the city the odds were definitely not in our favor. The universe simply did not want us to experience a Chicago dog. On Friday, we made plans to try Hot Doug's for dinner only to discover that it closes at 4pm on our journey over. On Saturday, another attempt was made for lunch but our lack of knowledge of public transportation caused us to be late. On Sunday, we woke up early to make it on time to find out it does not open Sundays. Finally, on Monday we started our adventure at noon to get to Hot Doug's. My friend's map on her iPhone does not like us and led us to a location that was about 30 minutes away from Hot Doug's. We couldn't hop back on the bus because our one day pass expired and we didn't have any cash. We had to walk about a mile to the nearest CVS to purchase a bus pass. From there, we had to walk another mile to the correct bus stop. It was now 3pm. We finally arrive at Hot Doug's around 3:30pm. Hallelujah!! The line was long and we spent our time deciding that we would each get two hot dogs after our three day journey to get to Hot Doug's. Ten minutes before closing, we finally make it to the front of the line.... to find out it was cash only. We had about $20 between the three of us so we sadly agreed to split two hot dogs between three empty stomachs. After ordering, Doug (I'm assuming) noticed our disappointment and we explained to him our mishaps. He says "How do you not have cash?!!! Unless you're Californians, you should always have cash!" WE ARE CALIFORNIANS. He laughed at the coincidence and told us to order whatever we wanted and he would only charge us $20. Needless to say, it was the most delicious hot dogs I've ever had. The Foie Gras was definitely my favorite and I highly recommend it for all you duck lovers out there!
