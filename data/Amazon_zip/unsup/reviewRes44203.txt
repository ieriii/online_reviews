Was touring Wrigleyville and stumbled upon this place, and my friend said it was pretty decent. The place was fairly small, contemporary looking, and was dark. The place was packed, so I figured it would be pretty good. Was seated after 10 minutes, already had a glass of water for each of us, which was interesting, because they put cucumber in their water. The waitstaff was friendly and she was very prompt to take our orders. I ended up ordering the Kani Chung Roll (king crab, tempura crumbs over spicy albacore tuna, asparagus, unagi sauce, toasted sesame) and a Spicy Salmon Maki Roll. The rolls were reasonably priced, both only costing $19 total. The fish tasted very fresh and the soy sauce was on the sweeter side which I enjoyed. We all shared a few rolls which I do not remember which, but they were all good as well. The roll was not rolled as well as it could have been, because some of them were falling apart, but it was not a problem. The wasabi, ginger, and soy sauce were good compliments for their sushi as well. The experience was good the sushi was good, but I would probably try some other places in the city, because there are so many options.
