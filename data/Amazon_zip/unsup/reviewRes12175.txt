This place has been reviewed plenty. I just wanted to show my appreciation by giving it 4 stars. I went to Piece for the first time Saturday night. The wait was terrible, but the pizza and beer were excellent. We had meatball, bacon, and black olives on one half, and artichoke, goat cheese, and bacon on the other. So good.
