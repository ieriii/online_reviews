I don't have any complaints about the service. It wasn't the best service in the world, and it certainly wasn't the worst service I ever had. One complaint I have is the noise. The place gets overly packed with people we couldn't even have a conversation during dinner it was so loud. I took my parents here when they were in town for the weekend. This was a Saturday night around 630pm. There was a mob of people outside waiting for seats and inside that stood in the waiting area and and hovered over our table so we felt somewhat rushed. If you're looking for a quaint, quiet place to take a date, this definitely isn't the place. As far as the food, I am a full bled Italian, and grew up eating in Mom and Pop style restaurants in NY. The food was definitely better than The Olive Garden, but wasn't spectacular like I am reading these reviews that have said. We ordered three entrees and an appetizer to get a full take on the menu. The calamari was decent, and the dinner entrees were above average at best. I didn't walk out of there feeling disappointed, nor impressed. I have definitely had better Italian food in the past, and environment is key - and this was too loud and crowded place for me to truly enjoy it. But if you're looking for a decent Italian meal this is your place.
