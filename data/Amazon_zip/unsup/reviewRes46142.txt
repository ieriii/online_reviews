I attended a retirement dinner with 25 people in attendance. It was held in a small, private room which added to our positive experience. The service was impeccable. We had more than enough servers who attended to the guests with style and professionalism. Our meal was preplanned with three entree options; grilled salmon, Madeira chicken or rib-eye steak. I chose the grilled salmon which was accompanied by Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, fresh green beans and carrots. The salmon was grilled perfectly with a very tasty rub. The veggies were cooked al dente' which is just fine with me. One of my dinner companions chose the rib-eye steak which he thoroughly enjoyed. Portions were very generous. A wonderful surprise for dessert were beignets with three different sauces. To say that they were a hit would be an understatement. I haven't had a beignet in over 20 years and my recent dessert brought back fond memories of New Orleans. Until a couple of weeks ago, I had never heard of Grand Luxe Cafe. If you have an upcoming special occasion and want an equally special restaurant to host a small group of guests, I think Grand Luxe should be on your short list.
