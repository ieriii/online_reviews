Las Tablas has some of the best food and greatest restaurants I have been to in my life, which is saying a lot. I went on a Monday night so obtaining reservations for a party of 11 on the day before the reservation was certainly not difficult. I held a surprise dinner for my boyfriend's birthday, which I provided explicit in instructions to the host. These were, "you must say party for 2 NOT 11, otherwise it wouldn't be a surprise!" These were not ignored and acquiescently followed, which I greatly appreciated. Now let me tell you about the food and service. The food was the best Colombian food I have had in my life. For the appetizer I ordered the Empanadas Combinaciones to split, which comes with cheese, beef, and chicken Empanadas. These were really amazing. What puts them apart from other Empanadas I have had is that they are succulent and the dough used to encase the filling is very complimentary. For dinner I ordered the Entrana, which was the specialty of the night. This included the skirt steak with plantains, potato, and yucca. the skirt steak was seasoned perfectly. Others in my party were saying the steak was too salty, however they did not know how South American meats ought to be seasoned. I know my steaks; and this was amazing, one of the best. Mondays are half price Sangria nights, so naturally we ordered Sangria. I do not know what they put in the Sangria but it is good. Overall this place is amazing it is a precious find, which people ought to value. The experience of being served was great and more than memorable. I highly recommend this place to anyone.
