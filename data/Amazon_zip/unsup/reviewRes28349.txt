YUM! I'm kind of surprised by the mediocre reviews of this place. My first visit there was perfect. We started off with the Frijoles Sabinas appetizer and an order of pico de gallo. The beans were amazing-- so full of flavor and topped with grilled onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and melted cheese. The pico de gallo was super fresh (as it should be) and our waitress was very attentive. Our party ordered Bistec a La Mexicana, chicken tacos, machacado (steak & egg) tacos, and a chicken burrito. It was definitely too much food and we packed up a lot of leftovers. All of us found everything authentic, tasty and fresh (inexpensive, too!) It's also a BYOB. I wish we had known that before walking in. If you visited this place and gave it 3 stars or less, please send me a message recommending me your favorite Mexican restaurants. I honestly think this was one of the better Mexican meals I've had.
