Two phocking thumbs up! 'Tis the season to get your pho on and there's no better place than Tank. Whether you prefer one of the other phomiliar spots, you know the ones - they tend to start with 'Pho' and end with random digits in triplicate - you still have to give it up for the locale with a menu so robust they need not one, but two restaurant monikers (holla Pho Xe Tang), to get the phonomenal job done. Naturally, if you're no pho virgin, you've already got your favorite dishes and likely your preferred spot for consumption. If you want to give Tank a try, my adventure pants salute you! However, for now, I'll focus on those not yet initiated in the wiles of navigating a big 'ol pho time. Tank is a great place to start for pro's and novice's alike. It's clean, friendly and damn tasty. While the menu can be a bit intimidating (think pages upon pages upon PAGES of choices) stick to these pho basics and you'll be fine. 1. You're there for Pho 2. Don't forget that 3. It's easy to be swayed by visions of Shrimp Cakes, Sizzling Crepes, Vietnamese Sandwiches and the like dancing on the shiny menu pages 4. Stay Focused 5. If you must have an instant gratification moment, try the Simmered Caramel Pork and Shrimps as an appetizer above anything fried or with the name 'roll' in it 6. Commence ordering anything in the 'Vietnamese Beef Noodles Soup' category, this is the legit pho 7. Meatballs are your friend 8. Extra meatballs are your wife 9. But extra meatballs and sliced beef, well done brisket, well done flank, soft tendon and bible tripe is your mistress 10. You're welcome
