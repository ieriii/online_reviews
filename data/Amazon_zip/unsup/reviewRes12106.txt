yummy. but only 4 stars b/c it's a tad on the expensive side. $28 for a medium 4 topping pizza kind of cuts me deep as an unemployed student. but i would give this pizza 5 stars not taking price into consideration had two of their beers also and i'm not an expert so can't really comment, but i thought they were pretty decent
