On a recent visit to Chicago, I was excited to have gotten a reservation at Alinea. I had heard a great deal about the chef and his food, and since I've yet to get a coveted reservation at Per se in NY (my hometown) I was eager to try Chicago's much-celebrated restuarant. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met, and the whole evening was a bit too contrived for me. From the sliding door upon arrival to the hushed tones of the wait-staff that take themselves way too seriously, the evening was a disappointment. The food was good, but not outstanding. You don't get a menu so you don't know what's coming out, and there's no full bar, so you really have to go with the wine pairings (which were very good). It's just as well, since it would be impossible to select a proper wine to accompany the many courses. Maybe it's me, but I just don't go for having to be instructed on how to eat my food, which it was happens with just about every course. I have spent $600 for dinner for 2 before at top restaurants and have done so gladly, since I really do appreciate a fine dining experience; it's just that Alinea wasn't one of them. Everything was okay, but just not stellar. And for the prices charged, the bar should be set at stellar or above. I can still tell you every course I had at a meal at Lespinasse 5 years ago, and yet I'd be hard-pressed to recall more than 2 or 3 of the courses I had at Alinea just 1 week ago. Overall I'd say that Alinea is a good restaurant, but I'm at a bit of a loss to get what all the fuss is about. My meals that same week at MK and Copperblue in Chicago were better and much less expensive, and I'd recommend those restaurants over Alinea if you're visiting (or live in) Chicago.
