I brought my mother in for Mother's Day, we had the Sunday Supper, the bleu cheese fondue, and a few other items. She loved the entire meal, especially the pork shoulder she ordered. Nana serves organic food and is apparently mostly local. I thought the restaurant had a great atmosphere, excellent food and the best brownie I've ever had! (Ps. We brought my little sister and they had a kid's menu just for her)
