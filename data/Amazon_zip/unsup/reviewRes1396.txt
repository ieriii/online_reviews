I think everything that can be said about Hot Doug's has been said. I'll just add that Doug is the nicest guy - he must really love what he does because he greets everyone with a smile. If you want to avoid the lines, try going on a weekday after 1:30 - my boyfriend and I do that whenever we are craving Hot Doug's and never have to wait.
