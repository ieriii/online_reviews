I actually really liked this place until I went a few weeks ago and they were closed by the department of health for HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS! Yuck! So I googled this to see what happened and learned that they have been shut once or twice a year that I could find!  Cockroaches....improperly storing food...no hand washing facilities for employees...etc. Not going back!
