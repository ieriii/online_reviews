I think greek islands has the best food in greektown and i love the atmosphere. The orange roughy is very tasty and worth fighting the loads of tourists clamboring to get through the doors. The lamb is juicy and tender and i always love the potatoes. I would skip the spanokopita as it is a bit greasy, but the rest of the food is very nice. Don't miss the rice pudding. I am obsessed with rice pudding and would probably eat it anywhere including off of the floor, but theirs is seriously good. I get a kick out of it when people yell "oopah!" when setting cheese aflame as well.
