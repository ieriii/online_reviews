I tried Carnivale a few times, and I'm pretty indifferent to it.  This is a place to bring a group of friends to. I wouldn't come here for a date because it's pretty loud and busy (always some kind of law student or MBA student gathering here). The food is not worth the price you pay, not that the food is bad it's nothing special. I've tried the cheese plate, Camarones al Aijillo, Ropa Viega, Empanada, Arrachera entree and Bistek Palomilla. I think I preferred the Ropa Viega out of all appetizers and the entree was ok. I remember their potatoes wedges were super greasy to the point that half of my meat was soaked in the grease. I'll probably order the Costilla De Res next time. Only reason why I go back is because of the coupons they send thru email and the service was excellent.
