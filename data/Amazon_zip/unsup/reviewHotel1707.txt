There's a certain ridiculousness about this place. The decor is absurd. It's like some sort of satanic Eyes Wide Shut wannabe mixed with Ikea mixed with some Ansel Adams/Norman Rockwell musical-note visual art (no nod to actual MUSIC however, unless you count the date-rape disco being piped into the lobby area).  THE ROOMS ARE TINY!!! I reserved the room online and wondered why it was so cheap for the area, but the web photos looked so nice. Well, because it's like a 10 x 7 ft. room with a dinky washbasin in lieu of a sink, cruise-ship style. FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT STAY IN ONE OF THE REGULAR ROOMS WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON FOR ANY EXTENDED PERIOD! You could go nuts enough to write in a bunch of ALLCAPs at the memory. I did appreciate the power strip embedded in the side of the desk.. They have a drink at their bar called the "Crimson Cooler" -- it's made with organic hibiscus infused vodka, muddled organic strawberries, organic agave nectar, and thai basil. It's my perfect drink. The bar was closed to the public though for private parties half the time we were there, which was rather disappointing and annoying. I'll be trying another hotel next time I visit the windy city. (I feel like such a honkey writing this review.)
