After dining at Gino's East and not convinced we had found Chicago's legendary deep dish, we went a friend to Giordano's. The restaurant is crowded with minimal waiting room. However, they offer a full bar, which distracts you from a 50 minute wait. You can also preorder your pizza while you wait (as the deep dish takes 45 minutes to cook, anyhow). I found that an advantage and disadvantage. That service obviously lets a hungry customer dig into their layered pizza, but takes away the dining experience of conversation with your other guests at the table. DO NOT BOTHER WITH APPETIZERS, even if you are starving! The pizza was enormous. I made it through 1 slice while others clocked out at two. There's multi-layers of dough, cheese galore and marinara sauce topping. It was delicious, and if you are in Chicago to taste deep dish, this is the place to check out! Our service was attentive by both our waiter and bus boy. My boyfriend drinks a gallon of water per sip, and never had to ask for a refill. =)
