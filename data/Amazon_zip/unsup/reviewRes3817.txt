So, I wondered into crisp one hungry hungover Sunday afternoon looking for some wings, because a friend had said they were the best in the area. After browsing the menu I decided one of their steak bowls might be more suitable and boy was I happy with my decision. The marinated meat on top of the perfectly cooked and sticky brown rice was the most amazing combo that had hit my taste buds in a long time. Over the next few weeks I tried the wings, chicken bowls, boneless chicken strips, and a few other items and nothing was disappointing. This is a great cheap and easy place in the neighborhood that doesn't lack in flavors or portions. Definitely check it out if you want to kick up your hungover Sunday or laid back weeknight.
