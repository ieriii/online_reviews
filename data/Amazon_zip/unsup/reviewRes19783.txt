I have heard a lot of good things about The Gage. In fact, I used to work with the Head Chef/Creator, Dirk Flannigan. He is so talented and this restaurant proves it. I went for lunch at 12:30 pm on a Thursday and the place was packed as if it was Saturday night at 7:30. The staff was excellent and very accommodating. My friend suggested the Fish and Chips and they were fantastic. I try not to eat fried foods too often but this was work the extra calories. The fish was so fresh and all white. I also really enjoy the atmosphere. It's a large space but with a lot of smaller rooms so it doesn't feel like a huge restaurant. It feels warm and inviting. The decor is clean, modern and comfortable. I would certainly suggest it to anyone. I would definitely go back to try their more sophisticated dinner menu.
