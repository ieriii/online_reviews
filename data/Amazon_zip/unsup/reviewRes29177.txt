Just ordered from Peqoud's and even though it was 2:00 in the afternoon the wait was an hour and a half. I know what caramelized is and I can definitely say that the pizza crust was burnt. There was very little sauce and even though i paid extra money for the the extra ingredient (fresh basil) there was little to none on the pizza. What a joke! You'd expect pizza that is expensive to actually be decent or at the very least cooked properly. I will never eat here again and I would never suggest it to anyone- you do the same.
