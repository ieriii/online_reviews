Outstanding place. Great ambiance, drinks, and service. The only thing I would change is that I would add specials and perhaps add a few more value added drinks. Beer is reasonably priced, however, expect to drop quite a few more dollars on the anything else. Although the ice cubes they place in your dinks are unique and creative understand that it is a business driving technique which reduces the amount of alcohol you get. (60% ice-40% alcohol?). Overall great place with great service and ambiance. Expect to dish out some mulla!!!!
