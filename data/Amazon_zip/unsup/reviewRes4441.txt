I guess you pay for the experience but 12 dollar cover and 4 bucks for a PBR, if I was supposed to step back 4 or 5 decades then why are the prices so high. I give the place a 5 for atmosphere and the total sell on the retro...but the prices killed it for me. BTW its mostly cash, can only start a tab with an AMEX. Next time for a beer I'll just head over to Fat Cat
