This is a great place to take your non-vegan/veggie friends to get them to try some alternative foods.Some of the prices are a bit high and the quality of food can be a little inconsistent, but the staff is generally friendly and there are a lot of options.The mac and cheeze is a favourite, as is pretty much anything from the dessert menu.
