nom nom nom Weekly sausages with exotic meats and duck fat fries. Drool... I've only gone on Saturday's since they close fairly early on weekdays. The line to get in usually wraps around the building and it is pretty packed once you get in, but totally worth it.  I've tried pheasant, alligator, elk, rabbit, to name a few and are paired with a perfect sauce/cheese, such as foie gras or goat cheese. I haven't tried the standard Chicago hot dog yet, but I hear they are really good.  Doug is always at the counter to take your order and is a super nice guy. I actually ordered a large drink and he recommended i order a small since there are free refills! Known as the encased meat emporium, they were even featured on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. Haven't been there in a while, but my stomach's grumbling just thinking about it now.
