Really amazing place. It's probably my favorite place in town. There is valet. It is BYOB. The prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food that you're getting. The service is outstanding and we didn't have one roll that we didn't love. The White Dragon is out of this world. You really must order it. Great place for a date or a girls night out. We use it as our go to Moms night joint. The lights are dim. Very sexy/trendy without feeling stuffy or pretentious. That only drawback was that the bathroom was only a onesie. Couldn't have dealt without that but I won't knock 'em for it as everything else possible was perf.
