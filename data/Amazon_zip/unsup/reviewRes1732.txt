Hot Doug's has done more to further my goal of eating one of every animal on the planet than any other establishment! Where else can you get sausages like antelope, alligator, duck, rattlesnake, crawfish... there's so many and they change so often you could go every day! Not only that but paired with the kinds of sauces you'd find in an upscale restaurant gracing "fancier" meats and cheeses like aged gouda. Not only is the food wonderful but Doug and his entire staff are great. The fact that Doug welcomes me into his store on a first name basis every time I go in only reminds me how much I love this place and the people that work there. I swear, he knows everybody and treats everyone that steps in like an old friend.
