What can I add that hasn't been said already? Um, when you're finished eating this fantastic pizza and drinking some premier Camel Toe or Top Heavy Hefeweizen you can simply walk across the street to Forever Yogurt for dessert, or head over to Nick's Beergarden for a nightcap. The only downside to this place is that the selection of appetizers is pathetic, but then again, no one comes here for them anyway. Enjoy!
