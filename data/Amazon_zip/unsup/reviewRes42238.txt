My ladyfriend brought me to Gilt Bar on my birthday after she almost assaulted the bitchy hostesses at Mercadito. The very nice hostesses at Gilt Bar however listened to our story, and managed to get us a table despite being all booked up for the night. Ten stars for empathetic service. The cocktails and food were pretty great too. Very good arugula lemon-honey salad. Don't pass up the pork belly. It basically melts into a pool of deliciousness in your mouth. Yum.
