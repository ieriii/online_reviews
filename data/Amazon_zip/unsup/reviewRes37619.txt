One day my mom and I decided we were going to get some Foie Gras. We had been wanting to try it after watching various episodes of Iron Chef. As it turned out, Fox and Obel not only satisfied us in regards to duck liver, but also had an assortment of delicious pates to choose from as well! This is truly a market for the elite, which naturally makes the prices unreasonable for the average consumer. However, if you really want something of quality that you know you cannot find at Dominick's, then I suggest going here. On a side note, the staff behind the deli counter was EXTREMELY helpful- they basically taught us various ways to prepare the foie gras. A fun, unique experience!
