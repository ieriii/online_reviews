Out-of-towners inevitably want some deep dish pizza during their time in Chicago and Pequod's is where you should take them. Lou Malnati's may have a bigger following, but there's something, that mom-and-pop like feel about this place that sets it apart.  Try their pan style with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and spinach and you'll be leave satisfied. It's an especially great spot for a Blackhawks game.
