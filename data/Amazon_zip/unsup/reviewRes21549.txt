As someone who grew up eating authentic Mexican food, it has become quite a habit measuring Mexican dishes up against my grandmother's cooking. Mayan Palace definitely met my expectation. There were so many options on the menu, it was difficult to choose a platter. I finally decided on the Pollo Ranchero. The chicken was tender, juicy, flavorful and with the right amount of spice. I am also particular about my Mexican rice and it was indeed delicious. Overall, my palate was satisfied. Last but not least, I would have to reaffirm that the quality of service is superb! The server was consistently checking up to see if we needed any refills on our drinks or if we needed anything else. I highly recommend this place.
