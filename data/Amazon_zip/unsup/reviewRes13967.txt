What can I say.... Not enough! Happy friendly funny! Kicked off the adventure with bread pudding, warm perfect firm yet moist and lush, plus two pastries a guava and a guava cream cheese... I was splitting these with my buddy and I could have eaten them all, I was skeptical when he said they were imported from Miami, thinking pastries imported that can't be good, but somehow magically they were fresh and amazing YOU Can't Have Just One! Dan had the Cuban with the sweet bread it was very good! For some reason I have never been wowed by traditional cuban sandwiches; I dated a Cuban for a while and ate them here in Detroit and in Miami and this was as good as they get but I liked the Bistec better! I had the Bistec which is their version of a beef steak and Dan and I agreed it was a transformational experience! so deep so good I could have eaten two easily even though one was quite enough food! Also had a traditional double shot of cuban coffee and it was so perfect so wonderful I wish they had a location by me in Edgewater because I would be there all the time, something tells me I will be looking for reasons to visit this place more often for sure! This place rocks out on every stage with shake rattle and roll and no apologies for happiness and love! You will love this place!
