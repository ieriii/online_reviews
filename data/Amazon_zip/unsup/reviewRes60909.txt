This is a must visit for any wine aficionado. The wine flights are the best and very educational. I have a gazillion of the little cards that I take with me on every visit. I kick myself when I forget them at home. The food is excellent for appetizers. Be aware that it is all very pricey. I suggest this is the place to start or finish and to sit at the bars.
