I've been thinking about this review for awhile. I wanted to put up a 5 star, poetically mentioning all the wonderful sights, smells and tastes of the beautiful restaurant. When I really thought about it a little more, I recognized it for what it was, a simple 3 star, it's ok review. The restaurant is beautiful, that I'll give it. I love the lobby and the design of the dining room. The only problem I had is that it's oddly loud. I had problems hearing my husband and he was sitting next to me. The service borders on overbearing. It was busy, but somehow we were asked how we were every 3 bites or so. It's really hard to enjoy your meal when you constantly have to answer questions. The food. It's ok. The highlights were the lamb chops and the little bread balls they served. I could easily have eaten just the bread and been happy. The lobster bisque and au gratin potatoes were great as well. The rest of the meat I ate all pretty much tasted the same. It was good, but I couldn't tell you what specific cuts I had because it all ran together. Kind of disappointing. I'd go back, but it's not my first choice by a long shot.
