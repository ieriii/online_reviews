Haven't been in a while, but this is a fine place to visit even when I don't have visitors from out-of-town. Not sure about the criticisms regarding authenticity, whether or not chips and salsa should be complimentary, and portion size, but my meals at Frontera have always been a delicious and satisfying experience. I'm only giving the place four stars because I haven't eaten at Frontera Grill proper since summer 2007. Since then, I've been getting my fix at Frontera Fresco.
