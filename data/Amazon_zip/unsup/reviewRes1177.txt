What can I say besides Doug is the man! He has got a good thing going here and he knows it and he doesn't exploit (or hasn't yet) his idea into branching out and expanding! When I see a line wrapped around a building for food 99 out of 100 times I keep on going and hit up someplace else. I waited the 45-60 minutes today. I hear that the wait is always like this on Saturday's. As i was standing in line, I kept saying to myself, "I can't believe I am waiting this long for hot dogs. Yes I waited... Yes I was very happy that I did wait. All I ordered was two hot dogs and a fountain soda. With all of the other dog/sausage options I wanted my inaugural visit to consist of the core foundation that Hot Doug's was built on: Simple Chicago Style Hot Dogs. I took the grilled over the steamed hot dogs and there is nothing like a char-grilled hot dog. The fries were also hand cut and very tasty! What really impressed me was the efficiency in which they ran the place. Doug is the conductor of this symphony at the register and he has a clear view of the entire operation and controls the speed of the line so there is not a wait for a table at all even though there is a line around the block. I am already looking forward to my next lunch outing here
