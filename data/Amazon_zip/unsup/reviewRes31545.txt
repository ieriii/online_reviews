My partner and I received friendly service and organic food at prices that didn't threaten to break the bank. The location is great for those who live in the area, otherwise plan to drive down to Bridgeport. Parking is easy in this part of town (we pulled up right in front during the lunch hour). If you're in the area during lunchtime this is a great place to try!
