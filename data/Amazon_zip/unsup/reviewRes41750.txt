Ruth's Chris's Chicago location has always been good to me. Service is generally good, and the quality consistent. I usually rotate steak options (always with extra butter, to my trainer's dismay), occasionally opting for lamb chops, and have run the course of starters and sides. It's one of the rare times that I'll order potatoes - garlic mashed, to be precise. And for all intents and purposes, the cost of their sides is what keeps their prices a little below their competitors'. The one thing I have noticed in recent years is that the number if inappropriately dressed clientle has risen. I'm not saying that you have to show up in a coat and tie, but something more than the shorts and shirt you went sight-seeing in would be greatly appreciated.
