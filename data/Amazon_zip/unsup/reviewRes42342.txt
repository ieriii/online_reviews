I am a huge fan of Maudes Liquor Bar and Au Cheval so my expectations were high before I went to Gilt Bar recently. I was not disappointed. Guilt Bar has its own version of the magic shared by it's sister establishments derived from cool ambiance, well informed and engaging staff and incredible eclectic sound track. The smoked fish salad I ordered was prepared perfectly and came out fast. A bonus to Guilt is Curio the speakeasy bar in the basement. It's a very cool space and the night I was there there was an excellent jazz trio. The bartenders were very cordial and I could have stayed there and listened to the jazz all night. Guilt Bar is the original of the three establishments and as good as it gets.
