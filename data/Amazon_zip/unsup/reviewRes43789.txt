I really liked the food here. I had the heuvos ranchero I usually am a pancake person but I heard good things about this egg dish soI thought I'd give it a try. I am glad I did it was one of the best egg dishes I have ever had. The granola and yogurt was good too. The seating was a little bit to cozy for me. However if you like to eavesdrop it might be a good place for you. All and all a great local place that I cant wait to eat at again.
