On my third adventure, I finally get around to writing a review. Today's sausage pizza was a little bit too greasy and too saucy even though I asked for 'just'a'touch' of the red stuff. I dislike wiping my mouth after every bite due to the grease of the fear of tomato sauce on my beard. The previous two visits make the four stars though. They do have a nice beer selection for you to enjoy your pizza with. The complaints about the wait staff? Valid though they are typically spread thin. Friday nights, Saturday dinner time as well as Sunday lunch are typically the busiest times, so expect a wait.
