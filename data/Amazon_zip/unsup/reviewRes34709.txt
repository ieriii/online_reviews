The food is pretty good, especially the lentil soup and falafel sandwiches and rices. Their falafel is far from the best, however. It's like the fried chicken of falafel, crunchy and greasy a bit hard on the outside. Falafels should be lightly browned, tenderly crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside, soft enough to easily mash when you push down with a fork. Taza in the loop or any of the Kedzie joints like Salam have this kind of falafel. Sultan's falafels are larger, crunchier, a bit overcooked and not really moist/soft on the inside. Still, it's not bad, especially the way they stuff them in pitas with Jerusalem salad. I'm sad that they expanded the way they have over the years and raised the prices. Used to be able to get a sandwich and a soup for about 5 bucks -- now it's somewhere between 6 and 7 bucks.
