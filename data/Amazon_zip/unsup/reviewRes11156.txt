Every time I walk by the people (ALL of whom ALWAYS seem to be on their cel phones/Blackberries) huddled up to wait 2 hours for crappy pancakes, I wonder what the hell the world is coming to. I try so hard to make sense of what it can be about the horrible cloyingly sweet french toast, or the the cold bacon next to the cold omelets that taste like they were made with powdered egg, or the dry crumbly potatoes that makes people behave like dazed cows with electronics at their disposal desperately hoping for the trough to be filled. The only thing I can come up with? Marketing.  Then I waltz into my favorite brunch place a few blocks away, am seated immediately, and tuck in to what is in my opinion the best eggs bene in the city with a tall glass of OJ, and a spectacular cup of coffee. But it ain't at The Bongo Room, and I don't want any of Bongo Room's cast offs clogging up the works and making it harder for me to get my bene. So ya'll enjoy your wait and the mediocre food that wait will get you. Me? I know there's something better.
