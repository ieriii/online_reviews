Recently renovated Lincoln Square Mexican fare. You won't leave hungry. This place is outstanding at nothing, and good at everything. They don't have the best anything in town, as noted by the conspicuous omission from the recent Mexican restaurant round-up in Chicago magazine, BUT, it is a packed house every day of the week. I've been to Garcias more than 100 times and I could write a novel about the storied history. Basics: good margaritas, above average basic Mexican food, hit or miss service, fun atmosphere (nicer and larger than a typical taqueria), high volume. At times the service is great, at times you can sit for a half hour before someone takes your order. Before the renovation I always thought the salsa was my favorite, but now it's not as consistent. That doesn't stop us from going back. In that neighborhood, if we don't go to Opart Thai, we wind up at Garcias. I wish the stupid beeping noise coming out of the kitchen would stop, if you have a choice sit as far away from the kitchen as possible. It is a must-try, decide-for-yourself Chicago-Mexican mecca.
