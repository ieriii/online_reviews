Good Pizza, good beer, good rafters. I love any place with rafters. If you're an indecisive person when it comes to ordering food, you're screwed. It's just pizza right? Wrong. There are tons of options, and almost all of them are good. Servers may steer you to a more basic pizza, but that's only because they've tried all the awesome crazy combos and are now more reserved with their choices. Trust your gut. Or your server. Whatever. Can't really go wrong. Only drawback is this spot will get crowded. If it's your first visit, you may want to shoot for off hours/days so that the wait or crowds don't take away from your experience. But honestly, once you've had the pizza and beer, that's all you'll need to keep coming back. DJ, one of the managers there is a true american hero. Plain and simple.
