If some cataclysmic event took place and I had to be trapped inside Hopleaf for 6 months, I don't think I could be happier. In fact, I can't think of an place I'd rather have that happen in. The never-ending selection of quality brew makes me feel like a kid on Christmas morning. My heart rate quickens as I try to decide which one to open first. After I am done with the first one, it's on to the next, and so on. It should go without saying that this is a place for people that really love beer, though while I was there a girl ordered an apple martini. The bartender look like he wanted to kick her in the heart. I kind of wish he had. The food is excellent and well suited for a beer-driven establishment. Most plates are hearty and heavy with Belgian style influencing the food as well as the beer including rabbit, homemade Gruyere mac and cheese, and excellent frites. With all the wonderful beer at hand, I must admit that I anticipated encountering a little beer snobbery from the staff. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that the bartenders weren't just nice, they seemed genuinely friendly and happy to share their passion about beer. Once inside Hopleaf, the focus is on the company you keep, the beer you drink, and the food you eat. There are no distractions from these things, and that is a welcome change. There are no TVs, video games or jukebox. It's a very comfortable atmosphere with dark wood, low lighting, and vintage beverage signs and posters scattered about. Not enough good can be said about Hopleaf. You should probably just go there yourself and see.
