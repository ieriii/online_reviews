My friends and I were really excited to go to Frontera on the recommendations of friends and it being a Rick Bayless restaurant. We were told it could take as long as 3 hours to get table but we decided to make a night of it and pass some time in the lounge. The drinks were great, the atmosphere fun and lively. Our hostess was super attentive and we managed to get a seat near the kitchen in a record 75 minutes!The guacamole was delicious, but the ribs some folks who were eating at the bar recommended were bland and we left most of them on the plate. The steak was very good but overall we were disappointed in the food. To add to that lackluster discovery we were harrassed by two gestapo like floor managers who insisted we sit still in our seats... apparently they worried we would somehow injure ourselves or others in the 8 foot walkway- despite the fact that these women outweighed us by 50 lbs and were standing in the walkway themselves.Rick! Get a handle on your employees. Large Marge and her friend did not give off the warm and fuzzy vibe I think you would like your restaurant to have. Unfortunately, I will never be able to recommend the Frontera Grill to anyone visiting Chicago.
