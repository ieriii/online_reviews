As close to Athens as you can get without changing your dollars for euros.  Artopolis is 1 of my 2 favorite Greek places in the city. Casual Greek cafeteria-style seating and service with pleasant decor. I'm a big fan of Greek food and I've eaten at pretty much every place on Halsted. This place is at the top of my list for casual dining in that area. My favorite items are the artopita, baklava, greek salad, lemon chicken. The best item on the menu IMO is the Lemon Chicken Rice soup, its excellent. The tiny bottles of soda almost fooled me into thinking I was back in Athens.  Don't stuff yourself on the main menu though, leave some room for dessert and a cappuccino, they are quite good.
