I can't speak for the dining in experience, but I'm pretty sure Wicker Park isn't cool enough to be in Wicker Park so I'm probably not cool enough to be there either. Regardless, the delivery is awesome. Always prompt and always exactly what I ordered. I'm also pretty sure their feta and onion red pizza would be on my last meal list.
