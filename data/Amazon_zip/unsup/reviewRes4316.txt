Just went to the Green Mill for the first time tonight with my husband and some friends.  Definitely a good time, and we'll go back for sure. We went on a Monday night. It was not crowded at all and we got our choice of seats. We sat right at the bar in facing the stage. Contrary to what previous yelpers have noted, the doorman was very courteous. Cover was $6. Drinks were a little expensive but I didn't mind because my cosmo was one of the best I've had.  It is true that talking during sets is discouraged, but obviously that's because the musicians deserve a little courtesy and most people are there for the music.  The musicians were quite talented and fun to listen to.  And the atmosphere definitely had a 1940s kind of vibe... there are booths, tables, and seats at the bar. Lots of very ornate woodwork and mirrors.  Overall a great experience and we can't wait to go back!
