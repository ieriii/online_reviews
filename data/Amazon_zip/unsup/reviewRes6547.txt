Davanti Enoteca was awesome! It was out of the area that we normally go out in-Gold Coast/Lincoln Park/West Loop etc...so we were a little hesitant because we weren't sure how difficult it would be to get a cab back. We were able to get a cab right I'm so glad we went! The wine was great and fairly priced when compared to similar restaurants. The waiter we had, a very bug guy,was great with wine & food suggestions! The wine list is brought out on this huge bottle---it was so cute! The food was excellent! The fresh palm salad is a MUST have!!! It was amazing!
