This place is really great when the weather is nice so that you can sit outside. They do have heating lamps, so it's not bad in the fall either, but I'm not sure if the outside will be open once it actually gets colder. The food was really good, but the menu is small. If you're a picky eater, I recommend looking at the menu ahead of time to make sure that you can find something. The atmosphere is trendy/casual, so I would say it's a good place for a date or a get-together with a friend. It's pretty small, so I don't think it would be great for groups.
