every time i have been to chicago, i make a bee-line to fox & obel. it is sort of like dean & deluca, but different .. a little less pretentious and a little less expensive (but still not cheap). when they have it, i get this amazing chocolate angel food muffin. the coffee was respectable, if you are in town and nearby its worth stopping in. the market part is pretty neat too with some out of the ordinary foods and products. i dont know too many bake shops or trendy super markets in chicago (yet), but fox & obels is my favorite so far ..
