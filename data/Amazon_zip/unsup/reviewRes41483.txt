I've been to many steak houses but this was my first time to Ruth's Chris. From the moment we walked in, it was heaven. I was totally looking forward to my slab of meat and butter. The place just reeked (in a good way) of meat, butter and potatoes. My mouth was watering.  I ordered a casesar salad to start, although i totally should have ordered the corn and crab chowder that my companion had. it was chock full of stuff. really yummy looking. my salad was good too. we both ordered the ny strip with shoestring fries. it came out sizzling on the white china plate. i had to hold up a napkin to prevent splatters. 11oz, i think. i don't know, but i ate it all. i totally impressed my companion.  nice job.
