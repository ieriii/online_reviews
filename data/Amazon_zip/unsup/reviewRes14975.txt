They've got really good old school Italian food which you'll eat in a cavernous room loaded with loud people and families screaming to one another. Classic Italian dining experience- if you like this sort of thing, this place is for you. Plus the Wednesday night Lobster deal is really something and I like their wine storage too. I've got many friends who give it 5 stars, but this kind of place isn't generally for me, and their parking lot backs up onto Irving Pk road and causes traffic, so I knock a couple off.
