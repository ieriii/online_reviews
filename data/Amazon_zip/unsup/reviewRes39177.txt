The food is actually probably 4-5 stars but this place is unfortunately 3 stars overall. The side dishes are plentiful and a great start while you wait for the onslaught. The onslaught of smelling like a meat smoke stack that is! We came in a group and ordered off the set menu (one in the group was Korean so we let them do the talking) and all was going well. The food came out and it was juicy, succulent and super tasty. We were all nicely full when everything was said and done. Then the bill came. And the oddity began. We ordered for 6 people off the multi- person set menu, so we assumed we would be charged 6 x the single person price. However the place and hostess charged us for 7 and said that you have to have 7 people even though it doesn't state that anywhere in the menu. We go on and on and round and round on this and even in Korean we got nowhere. We took cash out of the ATM and paid the exact amount with $1 extra, i.e. basically the tip was removed to cover the extra person charge. I thought that was a bit shady of the restaurant and they wouldn't budge even though there were clearly 6 people at the table. I don't know what they were smoking that night (probably all that meat stench) but I wasn't paying enough attention as I don't speak the lingo! Oh well - guess this place is off the list. But darn - the food was pretty good!! Buyer beware.
