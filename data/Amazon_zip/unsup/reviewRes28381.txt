Graham Elliot is a fun culinary experience... I loved the playful mixture of fancy food items with junk food! Foie gras lollipops with a Pop Rocks candy coating created explosions in my mouth that almost made me forget that I was eating liver. A delicious sweet potato soup garnished with corn nuts was amazing. The inventive nature of the menu created a fresh experience. It's too bad that we ordered too much food and couldn't stop ourselves from eating, so we were a little uncomfortably full. Definitely worth checking out!
