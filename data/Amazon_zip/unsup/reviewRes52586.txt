this was my second time dining at brazzaz and it did not disappoint. we got a coupon in the mail for a BOGO dinner m-th, so that's exactly what we did. we called ahead to see what the cost of the meal was for the day we went and they told us $34.50. turns out that's their "special" that they run and if you get a deal (ie: BOGO coupon) you pay full-price $48 for the meal no matter what day you dine. a little bit of trickery if you ask me since they charge $34.50 m-th and $48 fri-sun. whatever the case, not a deal breaker. the salad/hot bar here is by far better than fogo de chao. the meat is also really good, but slightly below the quality of meat they use at fogo. if you're looking for an overall experience i'd go to brazzaz but if you're 100% about the meat, go a few blocks north to fogo. i still haven't been to texas de brazil so i can't comment about the comparison there. overall, the service was great until the end of the night. when they cleared our plates and asked if we were done, it took an additional 25 minutes before the waiter came over to ask if we wanted dessert (which we didn't... get me outta here). another 10 minutes and they finally brought us the check. a bit of an annoying end to a nice meal if you ask me. i will say that the first time we dined here, that was not the case. perhaps it was just an off night (no it's not because they were busy, it wasn't that busy at all). anyhoo, from the combined experience both times I dined there, i'd say it's tasty and worth a visit.
