i went to crisp when it first opened and was super disappointed. the chicken did NOT have a nice crisp and the flavor was just allright. i figured i'd give it some time to work out the kinks (as with any new establishment), and then revisit it at another time. so tonight i FINALLY re-visited crisp with some friends, and was pleased with the improvement. we shared the following "funke chickens": the plain jane, seoul sassy and crisp bbq. my favorites were definitely the first two. both were nice and crispy. the plain jane wasn't as flavorful as i would have liked but the chicken was very tender and moist beneath the crispy skin. i wanted to serve it with a side of waffles. the seoul sassy has very asiany flavors. the crisp bbq was a tad too spicy for me, but i'm a wimp with spicy, so that was my least favorite. the hubs and i also shared a seoul steak bowl -- this was basically just a bowl of rice, bulgogi, and scallions. the only gripe i had with it was that it was a bit on the oily side, otherwise also tasty. good job, crisp. i'm pleased that you improved upon your wings.
