The food is decent and it is lovely to have at least ONE decent Indian place downtown. However the prices are a little bit too high for food that is merely "decent". I've been here for both the weekend buffet and a weekday dinner and both times was not impressed. I will say that their chicken tikka (brought out endlessly during the buffet and one of the only reasons this place gets the third star) was delicious. The naan was decent. The selection at the buffet was plentiful and I got to try a few curries I've never had before. Still, there was nothing particularly exciting, and I left feeling a bit cheated and like I hadn't eaten my fill. The second time was for dinner with my mother, who is a vegetarian. I admit, I tend to judge a place on the quality of their dahl and India House just didn't do it for me. The bhindi was good, although I prefer it cooked more, it was still a treat to have. The pakoras, while good enough, were nowhere near of the quality I've had at, say, Sabri Nehari on Devon. And it was all so much money. For so little and so boring. India House, I thank you for reinforcing my knowledge that it is indeed worth it to make the trek all the way up to Devon.
