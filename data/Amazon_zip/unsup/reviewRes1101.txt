I absolutely love this place. I'm not sure what began my undying affection for encased meats, but Hot Doug's takes my love to some sort of impossible perversion that makes me want to go back again and again. The last time I was there with my lady we tried 4 dogs, the foie gras (insanely good,) a chicken chorizo topped with Mole, a rattlesnake dog with a prickley pear raita (kind of tasted like a gyro, but better) and a lamb sausage with harissa, which was pretty good as well. My only issue with Doug's is that its seemingly impossible to choose what to get because, in addition to they're evderyday menu, they have specialty dogs that all sound awesome. If you show up at the right time, the line is almost non-existant, but if you assume that by showing up at 1 on a saturday that there'll be no line, you'll be sorely mistaken.
