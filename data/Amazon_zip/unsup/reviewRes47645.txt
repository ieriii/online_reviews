Celebrated a friend's bday at the lounge. Great open space and nice interior, but here's the problem. I ordered a vanilla infused bourbon cocktail with muddled fruit. It was way too tart and I didn't taste the bourbon. I think there was just no balance because there was hardly any bourbon in it.  I'm sorry Zed451 but I'm gonna have to call you out on watering down your spirits.  So my friend ordered red bull vodka and tasted just red bull. 5 patron shots that tasted liked agave water. And to confirm our suspicions, my friend ordered a shot of Grey Goose straight up and no surprise it was some damn expensive quality H2O.  There was a bar that I frequented in Scotland that had 1 pound well drinks that were watered down. I can deal with that. But it's just wrong to charge downtown Chicago prices for drinks in which the main ingredient can come from the bathroom sink. I think this is a great place if you're the designated driver, in fact this is a great place to prevent kidney stones. I thought Zed was beautiful and had a great vibe, but it was missing something. I just can't put my finger on it, oh... how about more ETOH and less H2O!
