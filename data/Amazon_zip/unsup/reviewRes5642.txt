My friend heard about this place and said it had pretty good reviews, so four of us went for dinner around 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We had no wait but was placed at one end of the communal high tables. It was a bit crowded, especially when the food plates started coming, but we made it work. I think the general theme of the food is small portions of oil, fatty deliciousness - starting with the fluffy, buttery bread. These were the dishes we ordered, shared family style: *Lardo Crostini - I actually can't remember what this taste like, must have not been that memorable! *Sicilian Marinated Eggplant - one of our few servings of vegetable, and very enjoyable topped on pieces of grilled bread slices *Purple Pig Platter - we didn't really know what was what on the cured meats section of the menu, so went with the platter to sample a little of everything. Even the waitress couldn't identify all the meats on the platter! I particularly like the Gabagool/Coppa, probably the fattiest piece of cure meat on the dish. *Whipped Feta with Cucumbers - refreshing and delicious *Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda - the mostarda was really delicious and went well with the rest of the spread *Prosciutto Bread Balls - this was fried and a little heavy after all the other dishes (came out last), but I liked how the prosciutto flavor was still quite distinct. *Quail with Salsify & Pomegranate - yum, I like quail. Not much pomegranate. Being as the restaurant at "cheese, swine and wine" under their name, we decided to order a bottle. None of us were very knowledgeable about wines, but the waitress suggested one and gave us taste. I found it satisfactory and so went ahead with it. They have many wines under $40, and ours was just around the $40 mark. We were too stuffed for dessert (a rarity for me). Split the bill evenly - $35pp. Not bad at all, especially on Michigan Ave. All in all, a delicious, happy and recommendable experience.
