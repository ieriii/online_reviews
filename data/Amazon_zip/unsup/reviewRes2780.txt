this place is hidden without any indication where it's located. It took awhile and walked around the same block prob 5 times before someone pointed to a door that took us to this ultimate place called "TRU" First, it's been about 8 months since I've been here but I still remember it like it just happened. this truly is what you call a fancy wancy no music, have 5 waiters for each table, everything white and silver kinda place. We had the 9 course, wine pairing ultimate course. Everything is portioned like an aneroxic model eats her food but it was perfect since we had so many courses to look forward to. Caviar with teeny tiny spoons? you are a God-send! Each wine pairing was brought out by a personal sommelier and was explained to us the region, ingredients and such. I just love listening to someone talk about food in European accent. Please sir, do go on~ Each course was amazing and made me really appreciate food like I never did before. Dessert was brought out in a rolling tray and we got to choose the ones we wanted. Of course, I only decided on 2 since I didn't want to seem like I'm at a Chinese buffet... The best experience about this place was my date. I have to admit, we were giddy and giggling about how quiet and stuffy the place was however, the conversation and how he looked that night I will never forget. More so than the place itself. When you are walking out, they will hand you a paper that has a listing of your complete meal with your name on it. BTW, it' pretty pricey. It's as much as an average person's month rent. So be ready to open up your wallet, and enjoy the ride~
