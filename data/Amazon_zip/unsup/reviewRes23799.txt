FREAKING GOOD. The bad news: super long wait. My group of eight arrived at about 8:15 and were seated around 9:00. The food also took a long time to come out, which is to be expected, but by the time we were halfway through our entrees we were being asked to pay our check so the restaurant could close up. Ehh...... Besides that though, everything was great. The empanadas were really tasty (my table got 7 for $13 as an appetizer). The dinner plates were also pleasing. Our server was very candid in informing us that we should probably skip the pineapple empanada. Dinner success!! BYOB BTW.
