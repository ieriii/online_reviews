Went to q tonight with a group of 10. We arrived for our 8:30 reservation, but weren't seated until 9:20. Had that been the end of the night, it definitely would have been a 1-star review. However, they recovered somewhat by offering the table some free appetizers. Food was very good, and the atmosphere is great. I'd go back, but definitely with a smaller group....
