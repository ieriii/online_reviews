I really like this place. It's loud, boisterous, and sorta kitschy in how it's so very not kitschy. You enter through a piano bar right out of a Tom Waits song, it's all red upholstery and dim smoky lighting. The food ranges from outstanding to just OK, though large portions are the rule here. They do have a pretty good selection of wine, not so much with the beer. There are roving musicians going from table to table, surly waiters (in a good, amusiing, ball-breaking way) and prompt service. It's dark, loud, and fun. Plus, it's packed with great archetypal patrons for this type of place. Check it out and you'll see what I mean.
