I and my mom stayed on the 20th Floor in mid-August. We were covered with bedbug bites all over our bodies. (10-15 bites each) The hotel management was very defensive and they said that the insurance company will investigate. Of course, the insurance company did not find anything. We have been itching for a week after the incident. There is an ongoing problem with this hotel, so STAY AWAY!
