This is my all time FAVORITE steakhouse. Been to them all-Morton's, GIbson's, Joe's...Ruth's Chris is the ultimate. First tried it on an anniversary night with my now-husband. They immediately greeted us and congratulated us on our anniversary (nice attention to detail). This place gets pretty busy so even with reservations we waited maybe 10 min at the bar. They serve the best apple martini here with a whole green apple slice floating on top.  Every steak come out sizzling made to perfection. Sides are enormous so remember to share! **was included in Restaurant Week this year so keep an eye out for next year too! Amazing deal for the best steakhouse in Chicago.
