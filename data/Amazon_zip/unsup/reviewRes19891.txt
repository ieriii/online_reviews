We walked to The Gage from our hotel, mostly on a lark, and were quite hugely thrilled. Of course, neither of us looked like we had any right to be there -- we arrived in our Seattle "finest" during after-business hours with the well-heeled money crowd -- but it hardly mattered once the food and wine started flowing. This is one of those restaurants where you just have to "give in" to the menu. Don't worry too much about your personal food preferences; go for what they point you to. I ended up with some mild citrus lobster and quinoa; she ended up with (what else) house-made sausages. Both dishes were simple, delicious, excellent. We both wrapped up our meal with the house-made doughnut desert -- insanely delicious and highly recommended. Definitely worth a visit!
