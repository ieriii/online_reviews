The only reason I gave this hotel even 1 star is for location! I marked all the photos as not helpful because none of them represent the true suckiness of the room. I was doubly horrified because I brought my 6 year old son with me! Five minutes after entering our room, he found a used razor under the dresser and in the course of our stay we found several other items that had been there, God knows how long. There was a clearly visable dirt ring where the vacuum didn't reach and obviously, the crack cleaning staff doesn't believe in moving furniture!Don't fall for the free continental breakfast either! They never had enough supply for the demand and unless you were down there at the crack of dawn, you were lucky to get coffee! Just go across the street to Duncan Donuts!If you're feeling brave, by all means enjoy the excellant proximity to many attractions. We walked to the Field Museum, Shedds Aquarium, Sears (Willis) Tower, Harold Washington Library, etc. You can catch the #10 bus to Museum of Science and Industry at 10th & Colombus and hop a train to Wrigley from State and Harrison. But, if you're faint of heart, run...run like the wind! I'm somewhere in between and I constantly went over the sheets for any signs of bed bugs and made my son sit on towels all the time!It may seem weird that they have an old fashioned elevator there, but we quickly learned that it was the only one that we really felt safe in. We were on the 12th floor so it wasn't an option. The other elevators seemed to lurch quite a bit, enough that my son was afraid of them...I was too, actually! If you end up facing North, the loop runs right outside your window, all night right outside your window. If your window faces South, you get to look at a brick wall!
