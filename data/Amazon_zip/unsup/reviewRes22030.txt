I love this Greek restaurant....The food is very fresh and Authentic Greek. I have dined here for years when traveling in Chicago. Start with the tomato & Cukes salad and some OPA flaming cheese, this will get you talking Greek. For dinner the Seafood is very fresh and some even flown in daily from the Mediterranean. The lamb Giros are very tasty nothing like you have ever eaten in a fast food joint....and after a great meal don't for the "Greek Viagra" desert and some ouzo.. OPA! enjoy.
