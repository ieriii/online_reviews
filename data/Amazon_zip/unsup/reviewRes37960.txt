This is the first and only deep dish pizza place I have ever been to, and let me tell you... it was friggin awesome. The pizza was around 3 to 3.5 inches high, filled with thick melted mozzarella and your choice of meats and vegetables.. Don't let the vegetables fool you, your cholesterol can probably increase just by looking at that pie. We were lucky and got seated right away, but the Chicago local we were with told us that the wait here could get pretty horrendous.  1 deep dish pizza and a few beers later... game over.
