Gilt bar was awesome, and I'm not just saying that because I live half a block away. We arrived at 7 on a Friday night and were told that we would have to wait an hour. No big deal, there was plenty of breathing room at the bar to grab a drink, but it was still crowded enough that it didn't feel like this place was going out of business. After 25 minutes we were escorted to our table by one of the ultra friendly hostesses. Don't you love it when the hostess seems glad that you are dinging with them as opposed to acting like you are an inconvenience? I visited Gilt Bar before the walls were painted black and massive chandeliers lit the room - when it was Agire Doux. My meal was tasty then, but I must say the Gilt is a definite upgrade. The drink menu featured an amazingly light champagne cocktail and a host of imported beers on tap. Our waiter seemed busy but still met all of our needs, not forgetting anything we ordered. My only complaint is that we ordered a side dish of cauliflower (extremely tasty, I highly recommend!) that arrived before our main dishes. Other than that, I was extremely pleased and will definitely be returning!
