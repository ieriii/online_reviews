They don't give me the option to give 0 stars. The service was absolutely horrific, let alone the chicken wings. I went after reading the spelndid reviews with my significant other and boy was I WRONG.Korean Chicken? I think NOT! If you want decent chicken go to Popeyes or KFC. Overpriced with awful sauces mixed in. Our table was filthy with trash left from other customers. The staff was also playing hardcore rock music.... In a so called Korean RESTAURANT. DO NOT COME TO CRISP. It's a sham all of you who have reviewed this with 5 stars are idiots and need new taste buds.ENJOY!
