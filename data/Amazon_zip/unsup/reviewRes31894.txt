Don't hate me, but I just can't see what all the Sunda craze is about. I've tried it several times, and while the decor is appealing and beautiful, the food just doesn't live up to the hype. The sushi is mediocre, the drinks are too sweet for me and I didn't feel like I could find one thing on the menu that didn't weigh me down for the night. Usually I love lumpia, but these were so deep-fried that they were hard and tasteless. In terms of ambience, I've been there at 10:30 on a Friday and 6:00 on a Wednesday, and both times the noise level was unbearably loud - my friends and I had to literally shout to have a conversation. Fine for a bar - but not ok for an expensive dinner. In the end, I'll probably end up at Sunda again because so many friends seem to love it, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
