Wow. I am impressed. And being a huge fan of breakfast, I have lots of places with which to compare its greatness. A friend of mine lives down the street and has talked about this place for quite some time (I believe she is a weekly regular). And after one visit, I can see why. The atmosphere is perfect for a brunch catch-up with friends, and people sitting alone with coffee reading or getting work done seemed equally comfortable. The menu is quite extensive and may take you more than one proclamation of "we need just a few more minutes" to your waitress. The food comes out super fast and the portions are more than adequate (you are probably looking at left overs). Not the best cup of coffee in the world, but you can't base the rating of a diner-like establishment on the quality of your unlimited cup of joe. The service is sufficient and prompt and prices are not over the top. As a north sider, I won't be running down here on any regular basis, but I am looking forward to trying a few more yummy dishes next time I meet my friend for brunch.
