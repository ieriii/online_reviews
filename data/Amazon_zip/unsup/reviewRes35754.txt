First and foremost, this Chinese eatery has the best menu design I have ever seen. I went to Sun Wah after seeing them featured for their BBQ on the food network or the travel channel whichever. The portions with the prices are very generous and well made. Definitely worth checking out if you are craving chinese BBQ in Chicago! As a disclaimer, while I visited Chicago, I never entered their chinatown but this uptown hood off the argyle stop had so many vietnamese and chinese options (maybe it's like a mini Flushing). Or just maybe I should stop comparing every city to NYC! =)
