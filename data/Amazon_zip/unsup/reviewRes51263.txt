Steak Burritos @ Garcia's = A+ Yes I can understand that it get's busy often and delays are expected but you get an F for never visiting our table to greet us or take our order after 25 minutes of sitting there. Unsurprisingly, after addressing the issue in a non-threatening tone, no empathy or acknowledgement from the portly guy behind the counter, the manager, I suppose. I suggest you order pick-up if you are looking for a good Garcia's experience.
