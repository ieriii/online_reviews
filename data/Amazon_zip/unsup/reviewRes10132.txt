I had quite a delicious dinner at Piccolo Sogno. It was packed on a Tuesday night -- a great sign in these times! My dad loves this place and has become friendly with the chef, who introduced himself when we walked in. He, and the service in general, couldn't have been friendlier. The food was simple, fresh, and very good. The chef sent over a complimentary pizza with arugula, mozzarella, olive oil and reggiano. It was delicious in it's simplicity - the ingredients were really fresh and the crust was thin and crispy. For dinner, at the high recommendation of our waiter, I had the farro pasta with asparagus, mushrooms, garlic and truffle oil. What a wonderful fall dish on a cold night! My dad had whole wood fired branzino with sea salt and fennel that was absolutely divine. The prices are decent, the atmosphere is fun, classy and casual - a great spot!
