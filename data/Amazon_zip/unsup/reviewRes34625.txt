I love breakfast food, and I love Yolk. Go early! When you go for brunch on a weekend, of course you'll have to wait. But, I have never had to wait longer than told. The portions are large, and usually the service is great. I always order the make your own scrambler and upgrade to french toast which is fantastic. They do serve food for lunch, I just wish they were open past three.
