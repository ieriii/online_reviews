I was unimpressed with the food. First it was expensive for the amount and quality. The chicken was dry, the lamb was fatty. I like spicy food. I mean I really like spicy food, but in trying a new place I ordered a dish to be mild to medium. Most of it was ok, but there was one bite that was like eating 5 scotch bonnets in one mouthful. I had to spit my food out and chewed on bread and had to stop eating altogether because it was so awful hot. It made me feel sick. Obviously it was not mixed well. The masala sauce I had tasted like butter. There was no spice/seasoning to it. It was tomato, cream and butter. I've never tasted anything so strange. If anyone has suggestions for nice curry, even a hole in the wall or bistro style I would love to try it. This was unpredictable and not worth the expense. Plus they close at 10, but what they really mean is you can eat in the restaurant until 10 but they will be cleaning, stacking chairs and tables, vacuuming, restocking the bar. It was not comfortable in there even though I was just waiting for take out food.
