First and foremost, I wish I could remember our waiter's name. Tall thin gentleman with an accent was our waiter and we received top notch service! The service alone was very impressive and is enough for me to go back. Bravo and thank you to our wonderful server! Food.....the steak was really good, but to be honest it was a bit of a let down for me. In my mind I was automatically comparing it to Saloon Steakhouse, Brasserie Jo, Wildfire and Morton's. They way I've heard others describe the steak here led me to expect much better than what I had at some of these other places. I don't mind paying $40-$50 for a steak, but I really didn't feel like I was eating a $40-$50 steak. The Potato's Au Gratin were very good as well, but again, I'm not sure it was worth the price. I was a bit (okay, very) disappointed in the beer selection considering the impressive wine list. For beer, they had the usual boring basic brew ( Stella, Blue Moon, Fat Tire, Corona, Heineken, Amstel, Miller, 312, etc.) I was a bit put off by such a mediocre beer selection in an upstanding steakhouse like this one. Don't get me wrong, the food was very good. Well above average. I had a great time. My friends enjoyed everything as well and we left a very much deserved 30-40% tip for our rock star of a waiter. (What was his name!?) Again, thank you for probably the best service I've ever had at any restaurant.
