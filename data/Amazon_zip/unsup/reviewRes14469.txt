Wonderful fish at reasonable prices. Went to this restaurant with friends recently and really enjoyed our dinner. Everyone enjoyed their fish except one person in our group who had walleye encrusted with pretzel which was just really dry. However, I had grouper and it was firm and well-prepared. They have a liquor license, but we opted to bring our own bubbly. Save room for dessert because they serve Hoosier Mama pies which are the best. Per person our meal was about $40 including shared appetizers, dessert, tip and tax, but remember that we brought our own adult beverage. The restaurant is very small, as are the tables, and at times we almost didn't have enough room on our table for our food.
