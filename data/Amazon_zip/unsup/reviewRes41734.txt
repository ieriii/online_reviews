The steak was too buttery. That said, this place was awesome, including the slippery steak. The first time I came a couple years ago, our brand-new and slightly nervous waiter accidentally spilled my beer on my lap, which brought him almost to the verge of tears, apologies from the manager, and best of all -- free beer, extra sides, complimentary dessert wine and unlimited desserts. One of the best nights ever. And now they've earned a lifelong customer, even if it's only cause I'm secretly wishing the waiter's going to spill my beer again. Oh and the food is awesome and worth every penny.
