Okay, I've been here twice. First time we went too early and had to eat off the afternoon menu. We sat at the bar, deep, south end of the bar near the kitchen. Watched all the star chefs pick and pair oysters, beers and wines. We asked our waiter to give us what they were having. We got half a dozen of oysters, ham and pickles, some bread, a few beers and wine each. The bill was what we expected $100 give or take a tip. I can't recall still pricey. It was barely enough to feel full or drunk. It was Valentine's day and we got to the new chic restaurant. We felt "cool." Next visit, I agreed to go out with a group of four. We went during the people-watching hipster time dinner at eight. We ate at one of the long, communal, tables. We were told the food is served to share with each other. All of the dishes ordered was served about 10 minutes apart from each other. I had 1/3 a cob of corn, one shrimp, a bite of pulled pork, and couple oysters and three beers. It felt like we were fighting to eat food. Beside sitting so close to strangers. It was too loud to hear anything. I was lip reading through most of the meal until I came to the conclusion this place is f'ing bullshit. Bullshit food, bullshit people and bullshit bill. I felt rushed. The split was $150 each and I spent the night with food poisoning. Bad oyster, or bad oysters? I have no idea other peoples hands was all over the food.
