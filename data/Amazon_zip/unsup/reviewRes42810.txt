My favorite pizza place in Chicago. I love deep dish but sometimes you just need a good thin crust. There are so many choices it is hard to decide. I often go with the buffalo chicken pizza, it is my absolute favorite. I should warn you it has quite a bit o blue cheese, which I love. I also really liked their California club pizza, strange but very very good. I recommend walking there and picking it up. A full pizza can be a little expensive but it's worth it. They also sell it by the slice, 2 for $7. Go FoGo2Go, you wont be disappointed!
