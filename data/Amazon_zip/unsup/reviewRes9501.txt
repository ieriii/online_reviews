I wouldnt say I'm a 'fan' per se but we had a good time here. Service and food was very good. We were under-dressed and felt a bit awkward. They gave me and my date a corner table which was a very intimate setting and we enjoyed it. Wait staff started out slow but soon picked up speed and once they had taken down our order things went smoothly. Go here with a formal group.
