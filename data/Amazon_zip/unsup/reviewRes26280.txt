I absolutely love this place. This is my husbands go to restaurant for a nice, long, relaxing dinner. We have been here twice for 2 special occasions and it was the best choice. The place is very romantic, it's very dark and has lots of candeles and really sets the mood for a romantic night. Their sauces are amazing, I like melting pot but their sauces have nothing on Gejas. Both times we've come it's been my birthday and when my husband called they made sure to ask if we were celebrating anything and brought out a birthday dessert. Gejas is a great date place!
