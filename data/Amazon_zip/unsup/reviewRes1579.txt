My boyfriend swore up and down that this was the place to go to get hotdogs. He warned me that we would probably have to wait in line for a while.....we waited about an hour. Anyone that know me, knows that I am the most impatient person in the world, so I was not excited. But I can honestly say it was worth the wait! These aren't your traditional processed wiener on a bun with some chili and cheese hot dogs. They have multiple types of sausages and toppings most people wouldn't think to put on a hot dog. There will surely be something on the menu for you! Anyone visiting Chicago looking for a gourmet hot dog needs to try Hot Doug's!
