After a particularly unfortunate day, the hubs said screw it, let's go out to eat and try to enjoy a few minutes. Not one to turn down eating out, I said sure. My sweetheart gets gift cards to Lettuce joints from work all the time so we opted for RJ Grunts. I used to go to the other locations as a kid all the time which are now long gone. I always liked going and fondly remember the miles-long salad bar. It has been forever since I've been to RJ's, and never to this locale. It was pretty much as I remember it: kitschy, strange and pretty decent food. As we left, the hubs said he now knows where the idea for Applebee's and the like came from. We got seated right away, well, probably because it was Monday, though it was a booth next to the service entrance to the kitchen, next to the bar service well. I didn't think we were that ugly or poorly dressed, but even though it wasn't the best seat in the house, it worked out fine as we were dour, not wanting to be around other people anyway. Food summary: the french dip was tasty, the cottage fries were real good especially dipped in the Merkt's cheese sauce side order, hubs wasn't a big fan of the buffalo chicken wrap but he didn't hate it either. My sloe gin fizz was a little heavy on the citrus. And too ice heavy for such a small glass at $8. Brownie with ice cream for dessert; brownie was too undercooked for my liking but the ice cream was good. Big enough for 4 people to share, easy. Our server was nice and pleasant. All in all, way better than cooking and cleaning up. I'd go back. Stupid long trek from Irving Park neighborhood and of course parking is hard. More like 3.75 stars or so.
