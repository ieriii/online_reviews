Wakamono is perhaps one of the best sushi restaurants in Chicago. Their sushi is supreme and the rest of their food, from the miso soup, to their salads are extraordinary! Their service is really good and love how they put love on every detail; from decoration to how they serve their dishes. Try their miso soup! It's like no other I ever had! I didn't see the plum wine on the menu but I asked for it and it was really really good! If it gets to loud inside, sit outside while weather allows. Although, some nites is not to crowded. Love it!!!!!!
