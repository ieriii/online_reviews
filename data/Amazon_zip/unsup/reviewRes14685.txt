I usally love their Shrimp Enzo, but after going there many times, I finally had the lobster special and they didn't disappoint. Large, perfectly cooked and lots of butter. Everything was exceptionally garlic-flavored, italian-seasoned and buttery goodness. Served on Wednesdays comes with their usual complientary pizza flatbread, minestrone soup and salad with creamy garlic dressing. By the time my entree comes I'm practically stuffed by somehow make room for the delicate fish and pasta of my choosing. The one disappointment was the baked clams which were extremely overdone and chewy. So much so that we sent them back. To their credit our waitress agreed and removed it from our bill. I had them another time since that and they were perfectly cooked. Love this place for ambiance, a special occasion or just another Wed. night. Their prices are reasonable considering everything that comes with your meal. Try to make a reservation if you're going during peak hours or have a large group. There's a big bar area to wait in while you soak up the vibrant aromatic scent that is Sabatino's.
