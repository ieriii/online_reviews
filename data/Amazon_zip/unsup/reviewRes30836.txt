Mastro's is truly top notch, in everything they do!! Chicago's known for being a steak town, and Mastro's answers the call. It's pricey for sure, but it really is worth it. The steak just melts in your mouth. I came here for my bachelor party and was really treated like royalty, just as anybody else that comes here is. Make a reservation.
