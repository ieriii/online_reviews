Great place for Pho, HUGE poritons, reasonable prices. The service was unbelievably speedy and nothing's better than the fresh, hot pho at Tank. Definitely try the appetizer that's a seafood/egg pancake. I could have eaten a platterful of that and wouldn't have batted an eye at disgusting everyone in sight. Yum!!
