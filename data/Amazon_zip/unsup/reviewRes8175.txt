My pizza, which art in my stomach, hallowed be thy taste. Thy pie doth come, it will be done, in minutes if not in seconds. Yes, this food is heavenly. I came with around 16 people for my birthday (they take reservations!!) and EVERYONE was impressed. Especially when we were ALL offered an after dinner "shot" our choice (limoncello for free? yes please!) for vacating our table -- not that we were rushed in any way. I'm very picky about my pizza after having lived in Italy for 6 months, but I will sing my praises of this restaurant and most certainly be back.
