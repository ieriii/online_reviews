WOW! Best tacos in Chicago hands down. The serive isnt all that great but theyre def. people you can sit back and talk to and have a laugh with. This place is especially great after a hard night of partying or after a concert. I recommend the "carne asada" tacos with some Jarritos, I def, recommend this place.
