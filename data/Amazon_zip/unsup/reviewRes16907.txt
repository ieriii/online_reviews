Fabulous lunch buffet. 1. The atmosphere is elegantly decorated, full of grandeur, and very clean. 2. The variety of food has surpassed every Indian buffet I have been to. Each dish is perfectly spiced. I loved their cauliflower and vegetable medleys. The chicken tikka was to die for. The dessert was incredible as well. 3. My two friends and I each came home with nearly-exploding tummies. Make sure you starve adequately prior to lunching here. 4. I look back with lamenting eyes as I am no longer living in Chicago. I often wonder if I will EVER find another Indian buffet of this quality.
