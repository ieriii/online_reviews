Stopped by Sultan's for a quick and delicious bite to eat before the USA-Honduras WCQ. The interior is small and its definitlely a quick eats type of joint, but they earn a star for maintaining a welcoming and clean restaurant and food counter. I picked up a few dolomites (stuffed grape leaves) to go along with my falafel sandwich with mild spice. A generous slather of fresh hummus followed by two sizeable falafel patties, topped with a cucumber-tahini dressing and tomatoes onions made for a very tasty sandwich. The dolomites were among the best I've ever had, which was quite surprising for a quick eats joint. At under $4 for a falafel pita, the price was right and I'll definitely be back again. I agree with Ruben L., its more like a 3.5-3.75 but I'll curve up here.
