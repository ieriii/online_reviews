I started going to Doug's about 4 years ago just for the plain dogs-which are awesome. In the past few years the wait has become excrutiating so when I do feel like waiting the half hour I try to be adventurous. Being adventurous is easy at Doug's-I generally go for "the Game of the week" which is a sausage of some type of game meat. I'm generally very happy with the food there, it's creative, it's tasty, it's something you can't get anywhere else. Doug is always at the front counter, and he's super friendly, and helpful and while I do agree the hours are stupid- I'd rather have the stupid hours than have it be open all the time with doug there only half the time.
