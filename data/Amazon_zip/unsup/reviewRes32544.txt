I can't believe that I am only giving the diner three stars but it is just not what it used to be. Wait staff is wonderful and always cheerful, the food is great but they have limited the number of menu options and removed a number of favorites. The price is worth it but just barely. I usually order an entree (9 bucks ish?) and a smoothie which runs about $7. Add in coffee and a shared dessert and breakfast for two can easily be $50.
