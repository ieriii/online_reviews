I have been a regular patron of Glenn's for about a year and have always sat at the bar. I have generally overlooked the glossy eyed service because the food is very good, but this morning was the final straw. I decided to have my Pre-Marathon breakfast at Glenn's with my wife. Today is an important day and I wanted to get started on the right foot. We arrived at ten minutes to nine and had to wait until 9:05 for the doors to open, no big deal. Once we were seated we patiently watched as employee after employee bumbled around chatting, playing with the radio, going to the bathroom and deciding what they were going to have for breakfast. As we sat and waited, my wife and I noticed one of the regular servers stomping around like he was about to entef the cage for a UFC fight, it was comical to say the least. After sitting unattended to for another 10 minutes, my wife said to the tuff guy waiter, "Excuse me, we are ready to order.". His response was illegible but was obviously not friendly. I asked him to repeat himself at which time i got the response, "What do you want?". This was conveyed with the tuff guy persona mentioned previously. Needless to say, I bit my tongue and we walked out, never to return. Word of advice tuff guy, you are a Server, come to work early enough to be prepared to do your job at 9am. Lose the hangover, lose the attitude, definitely lose those big ridiculous beads you wear around your neck and try to remember no matter how tough you think you are, you look silly walking aroundin an apron serving cold cereal to north side yuppies.
