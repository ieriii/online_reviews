I was taken here on a first date and was told to expect something "swanky." He wasn't kidding; this has to be the swankiest lounges I've ever been to! First off, the high backings of the chairs give the place an Alice In Wonderland feel--super cool. Second perk- our waitress asked us kindly if we would be willing to switch tables nearby and offered us free shots for doing so.... can you say yes please? I had no idea what most of the ingredients were on the menu but our waitress also had some great recommendations. Pretty drinks, candlelight, good company = impressed me! Definitely coming back to get my "swanky" on again.
