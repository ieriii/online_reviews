This place by far is my favorite restaurant in the city. I dine in and have delivery at least once a week. 1st. The foccocia bread at the table Is awesome.2. The smoked braid salad I get every time. Ribs fall off the bone great taste. I love to cook and these are good. And 9$ a full slab with sides. Best deal in town. Pizza is great. Every dish I have tried there I have loved. Wine selection great. Always new specials daily. I can go on and on. Service and ambiance always perfect. If visiting the city this place is a must. If you live here you too will become regulars of this hotspot. 5 of 5 stars
