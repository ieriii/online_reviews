Actually - I want to give this restaurant 3 1/2 stars but Yelp doesn't have halfs yet. Don't get me wrong, I really do like the sushi here. Their rolls are inventive and fresh. The waitress was so-so. I asked for tomago, unagi and salmon, plus some rolls. I got two tomago and no salmon. That's ok though.  I also had their spinach appetizer, it was good but not the best. I felt their peanut sauce was a little bit too murky.  And this is what really deterred me, the noise level. OK - yeah, I know I'm in a hip Bucktown joint, boy do they not let you forget it. Really, you can't do anything about the noise level, everyone is enjoying themselves. I just had a hard time listening to the conversation or even what the waitress was telling me. And that was on a Wed. night, can't imagine what it's like on the weekends. I guess I am old fashion wanting my sushi restaurants nice and calming. It's good and I would go back, maybe for takeout?
