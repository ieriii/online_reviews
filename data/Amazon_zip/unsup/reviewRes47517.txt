I went there with my fiance for dinner. Granted, it was a Saturday night. We expected to wait for a table, which was fine and we waited at the bar with drinks. We were eventually seated and that was great. However, after we were seated we were not approached by a server for quite some time. After we finally placed our orders, we literally waited well over an hour for our burgers! The waitress apologized for the wait explaining that the kitchen was behind because there was a party of 20 people in back and they couldn't keep up with the orders. We finally got our food at after 9 p.m. We had arrived at about 7:30. Ok, not to worry too much UNTIL my order came out and my burger was wrong! Not worth even bothering to send it back at this point because I was too hungry to have to wait again. We ate the food. My burger was mediocre but my guy liked his fine. He also liked the mac-n-cheese. The place is trying to be like Kuma's, but the food and service fall short. Service was so bad when we were there that I don't want to return for a second try.
