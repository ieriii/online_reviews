Chicago is the land of plenty. Plenty of Mexican fare that is. So I have become somewhat picky on the subject of Mexican food. I think getting just "Okay" Mexican is a crime in the city because there is so many great spots. And Garcia's is one of those great spots. It doesn't look like much on the outside but to me that can be a sign of greatness on the inside. I have yet to go to the fancy one in Lincoln Square because this one is a hop, skip, and a jump from my place. The food is good. I have yet to experience a dish that is less than great. Your standard Mexican dishes. This fish tacos are great and the burritos are huge and tasty. But the real prize here is the margaritas. Not only are they delicious and strong, you get a lot. We usually order a pitcher which is a full pitcher with your margarita glasses already full. So its like pitcher of margaritas plus. So being in walking distance of this place sure does help. Overall great Mexican, decently priced, and killer margaritas. May not look like a great place on the outside but, venture in. You'll be glad.
