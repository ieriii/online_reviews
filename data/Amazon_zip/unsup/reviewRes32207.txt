I will not consider my self as a connoisseur to many types of food, but I've tried almost everything but Ethiopian. Metromix TV recently showcased this new restaurant in Uptown, which gave me interest in going. I decided to make reservations to dine here on Valentines day. They accepted my reservation 2 days prior to the event which was a plus. Once I arrived, it was very busy due to the occasion. I was pleased to see that my reservation was held once I saw a table with a reservation sign with my name on it.  Service was mediocre. It took a while for our water and menus to show up. We also had to ask our waitress what each dish were rather than initially explaining. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, due to the fact that it was Valentines. It looked like they didnt expect to be that busy.  Our dinner choice was the Demera Messob, which consists of a variety of side dishes served over a large sourdough flatbread, known as "injera". Here's the best part: no utensils! Injera took place of the utensils in Ethiopian cuisine. This was a great experience for me and is definitely one of my favorite type of dishes! We ended the night with a nice bottle of wine that I brought, which was corked for only $8. I will definitely have Ethiopian in the near future.
