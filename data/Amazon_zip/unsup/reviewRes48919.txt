I'm a designer, and thus I have very specific ideas about restaurant decor... I would love this place if the decor weren't so full of compromise. There's some straight out weird stuff (why make the people sitting in booths like like pigs in pens? It's just cruel, not ironic), and there's some strange decision to make the place LOUD and BRIGHT. I guess that's meant to be fun? And finally, brass? Really? Brass? Again, is it meant to be ironic? It just looks really cheap. Anyway, that aside, I think that the food was great. Really great. Reading other reviews, I think we hit some things that no one else seems to have mentioned, and I loved them. For instance, the country-style ribs have been nicely brined and grilled, with a nice slaw. Loved the ham platter, and really loved the Perch. Fried food needs acid, and the pickles, especially the pickled apple slices, worked really well. Still a bit of a beer neophyte, our server was incredibly helpful in stearing us to good beers that paired really well with the food (Belgian style Saisons are new to me). Ah, to continue learning here, but alas Chicago is many miles away from home. Don't know that this will replace Avec for me (same owners) but it's good when you want something FUN (LOUD)!
