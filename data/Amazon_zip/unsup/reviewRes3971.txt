Likes: -Besides the fact that it's harder than Stanford to get into, it's completely unpretentious. The chefs take their work very seriously but don't take themselves seriously. -Reminds me of Seattle, low key, grunge, hipster -Good value for the price. You don't walk away thinking what did I eat? I'm still hungry! Dislikes: -For 9 courses we only really loved 2 of them: duck cassoulet and the wendy's potato bar. -While the flavor profiles were nice there was always one element that was overpowering. Something was either way too rich or too sweet. I think I ate a ball of butter in the one of the courses. -There was neither enough depth in the flavors or a good juxtaposition between textures. While, the courses were very creative, they were still 1 dimensional and I think that is more due to one element overpowering the whole dish. Conclusion: There's a lot of really good restaurants in Chicago that are easier to get in and in my opinion, taste better.
