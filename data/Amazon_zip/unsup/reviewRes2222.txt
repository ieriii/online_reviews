All I have to say...duck fat fries! Yum!!!! I used to live in France and even the French don't make fries as good as Hot Doug's. I like mine with mayonnaise. Don't overspend on the specialty sausages like I did: spicy thai and alsacienne w/brie. Go for their regular menu: red hot topped w/everything. Yes, the line winds around the building but it moves pretty fast. PS For parents w/infants, they don't have high chairs (no room) so I kept my son in his stroller and fed him the duck fat fries (he loved them, too). Outdoor seating has a bit more space but good luck getting a table.
