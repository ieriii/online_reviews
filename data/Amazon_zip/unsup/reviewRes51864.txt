I live in New York, so I'm going to start off this review by pointing out that Gino's East does not serve pizza. Pizza has a thin crust. This fact does nothing, however, to deter me from giving this place five stars. Don't be scared of the line. It's really not that bad and moves quite quickly. If it isn't moving quickly enough for your liking, go inside and order a beer and enjoy it in a plastic cup while waiting outside (this is how I discovered 312 - great local brew!). My boyfriend and I went for lunch and split a Caesar salad, an order of wings, and a small deep dish, which I should mention is a lot of food (we only made it through because we hadn't had breakfast and both like to eat a lot). The Caesar salad was fine, nothing really noteworthy about it. The wings were tender and tasty - not too spicy with lots of flavor. The deep dish was absolutely phenomenal. We split supreme - sausage on my half, pepperoni on his, with onions, green peppers, and mushrooms on the whole thing - and absolutely devoured it. It really was incredible. Next time I'm in Chicago, I will most certainly be making a stop at Gino's East.
