Great atmosphere great service. When we arrived we were seated in the rotunda. The soccer game was on the television. They give you bread and butter pickles and bbq potato chips to snack on while u wait for your food. The bbq was amazing comes with four homemade sauces. Not to mention a stylish to go bag.
