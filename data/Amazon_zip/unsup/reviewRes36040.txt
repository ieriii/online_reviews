This place is so good and CHEAP. My family used to eat here even before they moved into their new shmancy new larger digs. The staff is always kind and personable. The place is run by a very sweet family. One time I went here with my parents, my cousin and her kinda boyfriend. My parents INSISTED we try duck and steamed buns and my cousins kinda boyfriend was VERY scared to try it. In the end we all loved it. Portions are huge also,
