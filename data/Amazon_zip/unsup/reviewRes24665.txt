Definitely love a small and casual dinner at Artopolis. If you dine during "old people" hours (before 7) I have not experienced a wait. The starter platter with hummus/baba-ghanoush is a favorite of mine. It's great for an appetizer but lovely as something just to munch on while catching up with friends. I really only have had the artopitas - Mushroom and Emmenthal cheese is very rich... but anything in flaky pastry with cheese probably is. I've tasted the roasted chicken, which was good (not surprisingly). Service here can be good or bad, depending on your mood. When I want to chat and be left alone, I love their nonchalant service. When I need to get the F out of there because I'm running low on time... I don't like it so much. At least they're not the inconsistent ones :}
