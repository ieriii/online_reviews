If victories are counted by numbers of beers sipped rather than chugged, and hipsters in classy attire instead of rags, then Revolution Brewing Company has won many, many wars. Against prissy wine savants, Pinot-sippers with pinkies out and bayonettes nearby. Against martini-armed spies, Silencers silenced, shaken not stirred Against milk. And water. Revolution my buzzed brethren, REVOLUTION! P.S. Try the Brown Working Woman & Eugene P.P.S. Get a growler.
