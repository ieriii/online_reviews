If there is a 3.5 star, I would give that, so I rounded up. I went with a friend about a month ago. Had the rabbit pate, a foie gras/raspberry dip with a really fancy name, their highly rated sloppy joes, cream ravioli. I gatta say, very interesting food for sure, but did not exactly got blown away. Very good and interesting flavors embedded within each dish, but they tend to be on the heavy side. I guess this is where the whiskey would come in and lift the heaviness to wash down your palate. To bad, I decided to just enjoy my food that night. So, overall, if you are looking for place for a couple friends to enjoy some interesting flavors and whiskey, give Longman & Eagle a shot.
