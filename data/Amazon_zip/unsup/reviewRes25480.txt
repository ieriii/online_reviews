Very good deep dish pizza. Different than some of the others (e.g., Lou Malnati's) in that its thickness is due largely to its crust rather than being stuffed with massive amounts of cheese. I didn't feel quite as sickly full eating Peqoud's as I did eating at other famous deep dish pizza places. And, despite the thick crust, Peqoud's avoids the taste and texture of pan pizzas. Not sure how they do it. I did miss that extra cheese a little bit, but overall a great option for someone who wants deep dish pizza but does not wish to endure the typical 5 hour food coma that generally follows a Chicago-style pizza experience.
