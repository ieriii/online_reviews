The greatest strength and weakness of a Chicago hot dog is that it can easily be reproduced. There is a set list of ingredients that is needed and if met I could be at Gold Coast, Portillo's, or a stand on the street, and chances are I will have access to a delicious Chicago-style hot dog. That is the case with this place. I ate a good hot dog but nothing I haven't tasted before. I'm not complaining. Along with a side of decent french fries and a stellar milk shake the hot dog and company made a great meal but, again, nothing really different from around the city. The main reason why one should visit here is because it's an icon. This is the kind of place that the Food Network or the Travel Channel shows off when talking about hot dogs. It's a hot dog Mt. Rushmore. So come here. Eat. Buy your souviners. But, unless you live close by, this place is really only worth a one time visit.
