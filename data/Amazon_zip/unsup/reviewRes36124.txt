We tried this when we first moved to the neighborhood hopeful that we had found a new breakfast spot. Alas, it was not to be. It was super crowded like the owners wanted to fit in as many people as humanly possible so it felt very awkward and packed, more than most spots. I had a basic scrambled eggs and toast dish but the eggs had an odd consistency like they had been microwaved. The service was fine and the juice I had was very good. All in all, it was okay but it's not my first choice in breakfast spots.
