Good seafood selections. Great drinks at a reasonable price point, made the old fashioned way---simple with good honest pours. I love the grilled calamari (which comes with spinach). I highly recommend reservations. The service is good. The restrooms are clean. There's a small parking lot across the street, otherwise it's street parking. I highly recommend this place.
