Honestly, best pizza in the city. I know, I know, sacrilege. But it's true. When I moved away from Chicago for a year, I had dreams about this place. As soon as I got back, I made a bee-line and stuffed my face with my favorite: red pizza with mushrooms, spinach, and pepperoni. If you're with a group, I recommend saving some room for the chocolate pizza. It's pretty out of control but totally worth a try! Of course my boyfriend loves this place because of the beer, which is nothing to shake a stick at. Piece's brews have won numerous awards, which are well deserved. Ask your server for the latest on tap, because these beers turn over quickly. The only problem I have with Piece is the wait. Even on a weeknight I've had to wait upwards of an hour and a half to get seated. I don't even bother to go on the weekends anymore.
