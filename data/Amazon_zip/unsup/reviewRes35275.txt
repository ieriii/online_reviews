The firing squad is poised directly behind me. It is officially my last day on this earth. They're asking which will be the last meal I will ever have, and just when I say "Alinea" or something, they tell me it has to be somewhere I've already eaten. My neurons fire through a lifetime of food experiences. My taste buds search for something memorable and while a few places come to mind, only one of them speaks louder than the others. To my surprise, shock and amazement, that place is Shaw's Crab House. The time and care they take in training their servers is obvious, I've only had one four star server - the rest are almost always five. The crab is consistently delicious, that's why I go there. I've had filet there that I tell people about. The oysters are delicious, though not the best I've ever experienced (minus one star, Thomas Keller ruined oysters for me - but if you're going to be ruined for oysters, best to be ruined by him, no?) The fancy side has fancy service, classy music, low voices and a big wine list. The casual side is jeans, CNN on tv, loud laugher and fizzy beers. Those options appeal to me, and the oyster bar is a place I wouldn't feel awkward going to alone - though food and service this good should be shared, I think.
