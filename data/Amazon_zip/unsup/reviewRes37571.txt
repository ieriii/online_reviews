This place is more expensive than Whole Foods, which is saying a lot, but it's so cute and they have a variety of things so I can't help but love it. AND, they carry Frrrozen Hot Chocolate mix from Serendipity 3 in New York, which is freakin' awesome. I love the candy bar and the pre-made foods selection. Not to mention the free valet parking out front.
