Being a carnivore, I constantly am on the lookout for restaurants that can dish out the red meat. The Brazilian steakhouse set up is right up my alley. I've been to Fogo de Chao and was looking forward to Brazzaz.  However, I now know why Brazzaz is cheaper than Fogo. The salad bar is ok but certainly not over the top like Fogo but I didn't go here to eat greens, I wanted bloody steak. :) Still, I would have liked to see a few more options at the salad bar. Oysters were available and I did appreciate that. Back to the meat. The servers came by as soon as you turned over your card. My GF and I had a constant flow of various different meat products on our plate ranging from the typical filet to the not so typical parmesan crusted pork, my GF's favorite. I liked most of what I ate. I tried the filet, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, butt steak, etc. I think I ate every red meat they served along with the chicken, pork and sausage.  It was a fairly decent meal. When I had enough, I turned over the card and the servers went on to other tables.  I had only one issue with the meat. Every meat was over salted. I don't mind a little salt but I was begging for water after every bite. I believe I drank 8 glasses of water during my dinner. In my opinion, I think they salt the meat to get people to drink more sodas, alcohol, etc. so that they can make up for the cheap price of dinner. After I was done washing down my dinner, the restaurant gave me a free dessert to celebrate my birthday. Very nice. I had the mango/vanilla ice cream concotion. Not sure what it was but my GF said it reminded her of baby poo. It wasn't very good but nice that they comp'd it for me. Service was good. Very pleasant waiter but rude coat check girl. It was cold and we wanted to take our coats to our table and she got snippy with us. I'd recommend Fogo over Brazzaz any day but if you are on a budget go with Brazzaz  I sometimes find coupons for buy one get one free and you can't go wrong with that!
