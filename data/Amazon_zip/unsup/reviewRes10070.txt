I was sadly disappointed with my experience at Piccolo Sogno.  I had been looking forward to it for a long time. PROS: + Excellent service. Our waiter and the bus staff were properly attentive, pleasant, and well informed. + Great Wine List! All Italian, but approachable. And our waiter was more than willing to help. + Good menu. The menu is as advertised, true rustic Italian (not Italian American) - even if the food didn't do it, the menu made my mouth water. CONS: + The food. The simple pork entree was so dry and overdone that I needed a drink every bite just to swallow! How hard is it to mess up a pork roast? Ok, it happens - but they served it! I should have sent it back, but I have never done such a thing. All of the accompaniments were tasty. Also the mixed seafood grill appetizer was certainly mixed. Some it was cooked properly, but most of it was WAY overgrilled. Holy chewy. OUT OF FAIRNESS: + My wife had the whole fish and it was very good. Nothing special. + Neither of us had a pasta dish, whish we are told are very good. I might return to Piccolo Sogno to try a pasta dish, but with so many excellent, true, rustic Italian restaurants in Chicago - I might not bother.
