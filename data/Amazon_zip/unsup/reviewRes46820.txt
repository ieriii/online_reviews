If I could hug Uncommon Ground, I mean wrap the entire restaurant in my arms and give it a squeeze, I would.  Everything I've eaten there has been downright delicious. And I can fulfill my trendy, hipster sustainability needs with the knowledge that it's nearly all local and organic.  The burger is delicious. A fried egg on top? Win. My favorite by far is the chopped salad. I've ordered it probably 10 times. Nice house made dressing, and usually with little treats from the rooftop garden. The hot chocolate is amazing and you can drink it out of a bowl if you so desire. Nothing like a whole bowl of beverage. I will divulge that I'm biased since I was a farm intern here, but that doesn't change the fact that I would stuff my face with this shizz every day if I could.
