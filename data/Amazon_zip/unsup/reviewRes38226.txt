Don't get me wrong, this place rocks for beer. I especially love the belgian beers and the beers from England. But it feels more and more like a wrigleyville bar. Don't go on a Friday or Saturday night, unless you want to be smooshed and scream to hear people (although every bar is like that, I know, it's not a library, although I do often bring reading material). And for God's sake, if you want light beer, DON'T DRINK HERE. It's for people who actually like beer.
