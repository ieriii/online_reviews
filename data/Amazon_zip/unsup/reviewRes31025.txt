Used to really like Sunday but not too much anymore. Can't get a table unless you want to eat sitting side by side at a picnic table. Starting to see the same sushi creations at other restaurants for less money. The crowd seems like they got lost on the way to Rush Street. Now that the original people that opened it are gone Sunday has lost its charm. It's just another sushi place and there are too many of them to deal with the hassle when you go there.
