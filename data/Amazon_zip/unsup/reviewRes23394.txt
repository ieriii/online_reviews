***Updated 3-11-10*** I received a very nice message from the owner of Irazu after posting my initial review below. In this message he apologized and told me that he would send me a gift certificate. I initially did not do anything or reply to his message because I wondered how he would send me a gift certificate w/o my information. I was pleasantly surprised when I checked my mail this afternoon and found a gift certificate from Irazu. For having such great customer service, I decided to update my review and give them 2 stars (I originally gave them one). One thing that I think is very important for any business is to have an excellent relationship with your consumer and to listen to them. I think I will try Irazu again.....maybe they were just having an off night. After all, most of their reviews on here are great! Thank you, Irazu! ________________________________________________ We ordered Irazu through Grubhub a couple nights ago and I was very disappointed. I'd have to say the best thing about my meal was the plantains that came with the dinner. I've been thinking about giving up red meat for weeks now and after having the Bistec Tico, my decision was so much easier. The beef was very chewy and bland. I feel like the meat was probably sitting in their freezer for weeks...was not fresh at all! It made me feel nauseas after eating it. My boyfriend ordered a sandwich and they didn't get that right either! He did like the Chifrijo, it really wasn't my thing. I don't think I'd ever order from here again. But maybe it's different dining in.
