this place was good, thats all i remember, we went with a large party, and they had some pretty good mojitos, my bro got a raspberry one, Twas delicious. i think we got some guacamole which was pretty good, and i just got some tacos or somethin, they were good, everyone enjoyed their meal, great ambience inside as well, quite colorful, pretty sharp lookin and clean.
