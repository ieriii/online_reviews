My experience at Sapori Trattoria was just that, an experience. In a very good way! First, I'd like to praise the wait-staff. My husband, cousin and I had an 8:30 reservation and unfortunately my husband became tied up with work and was running behind. Not only did they seat us, but they allowed my cousin and myself to linger over a bottle of wine and an appetizer for a full hour while we waited, without even the slightest hint of annoyance. And it was a decently busy Saturday night! Great job making a patron feel like a guest and not just a table to turn! Now on to the food, which is high quality Italian fare. The bruschetta was very good, as was the buffalo mozzerella bruschetta, which was a special that night. And even though I usually don't order pasta or chicken while out to eat, I had the Pennette Cardinale, which had both. The light tomato cream sauce was amazing and not too heavy. The artichokes added great flavor as well. My husband had the Zuppa di Pesce (spicy upon request) and was a big fan. Portions were sizable. The wine list had good variety with several great reasonably priced options. All in all, one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Chicago thus far. I'll definitely go back, as there are so many great sounding dishes on the menu that I can't wait to try!
