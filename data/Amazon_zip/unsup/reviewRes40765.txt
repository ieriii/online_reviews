Back in the summer, my friends all took me for a birthday dinner here. I had heard a lot about this place and the fact it's Michelin rated helped out big time. I think our meal was 5 or 6 courses and very relaxing and very good. We did not have the top meal (which I think was over 10 courses), but chose a smaller, less filling one. The meal itself was very good, although it was not "I am blown away" good. I think if I had the 10+ course meal, it might be a "wow..amazing" type of meal. The course that really stood out to me though was the "Scallop Surprise." This thing was amazing. I mean really, one of the best things I've had in quite some time anywhere. I'm pretty sure they took some scallops with some garlic and God knows whatever else and baked it. It was just amazing. Actually, luckily for me they were at Lollapalooza and serving this. I nearly had a heart attack and ordered it. It was a lot, but well worth it. The lady behind the counter was even shocked I've eaten at the restaurant. It's not a cheap meal, but much recommended especially if you want to try out a Michelin rated restaurant. Overall, the food was great, but not "I am blown away" great except one dish. The service was also exceptional. FYI, this place is BYOB.
