I just recently had the opportunity to dine at the current "it" place, Carnivale. Some restaurants do one thing great, and you keep going back for more, but Carnivale seems to have struck the right balance between reasonable prices, good service, festive decor, and reliable (but not a-maaaazing) food. I didn't know what to expect because I had such a difficult time getting reservations and dealt with a cold, bordering on rude hostess, but as soon as my friends and I were seated, all ill-feelings were forgiven. We were mesmerized by the bright colors and hues splashed across ceilings and the walls which held what seemed like hundreds of bottles of wine. The mood is bright and prepares you for an enjoyable meal. The menu is very simple, drawing from various South American influences, and perfect for a crowd with different tastes. Among the appetizers tried, the winners include the empanada (which is an overgrown version of any you would find in South America) and the guacamole. The chicken dishes and the arranchera steak were also crowd pleasers. Surprisingly, not only were the dishes very tasty, but the portions were quite generous too. I wasn't particularly a fan of the ceviche. The fish wasn't of the freshest, right off the boat quality, but when you're paying these kinds of prices, there's not much room for complaining. While most trendy restaurants fail to post their prices on the web, Carnivale is very upfront with what you're getting. http://www.carnivalechic With drinks, appetizer, and entree, you can go from $25-$40/person.  Carnivale definitely reigns supreme amongst the other Kleiner restaurants.
