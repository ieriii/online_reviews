Come at night and get a table by the window or sit outside - enjoy the delicious tastes of true Italian while people watching. The pasta is delicious, although the fare is probably not in line with the prices charged. However, if you don't mind paying on the higher end for Italian restaurants in the neighborhood, then try the lasagna and let the waiter recommend the wine. Maybe you'll hear the guitar solos from Alive One wafting in.
