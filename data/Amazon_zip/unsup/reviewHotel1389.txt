I stayed here for a conference. It would probably not be my first choice. There are a few interesting things about this hotel - it used to be the Playboy Hotel when Playboy was headquartered in Chicago. If you're into quirky historical places, yay. It's also within walking distance of Carmines - another quirky historical place. Frank Sinatra and Al Capone were regulars. See my review of Carmine's for more info. The hotel itself is a small boutique joint. The rooms are very small, but clean and the beds are comfortable. The bathrooms are modern, and have rain showers as well as hand shower wands. My room did not have a bath tub. As far as food choices at the Knickerbocker go, plan to eat elsewhere. There is a martini bar in the lobby, but don't ask for a cucumber martini. You'll get a blank stare. There is a restaurant - Nix - but don't plan on dinner. They are only open in the mornings. Don't even plan on a late lunch there. They close at 1.  Internet is not complimentary ($9.95/day), and there is a minimum $5 charge to use the business center. I was also informed (incorrectly, as it turns out) that there was a charge for gym use. Parking is valet only, and is $53/day (gulp). There is no pool. If all you need is a comfortable bed, on a quiet street close to Miracle Mile, and you either don't need extras or don't mind paying for them, this is a great choice for you.
