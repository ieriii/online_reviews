I love this place for it's delicious food and incredibly friendly waitresses. No matter how busy it may be, they don't try to rush you out. I met up an old friend here for a Saturday brunch around noon. We got here before the brunch rush and were seated right away. It got pretty busy while sitting there but the line seemed to moved quickly since there's lots more seating in the back. Brunch recs: -The sunny side duck confit hash was delicious. Eat it quickly while it's hot so you don't realize how buttery bad it is for you. Really tasty. -Market scramble was fresh but very filling. We ended up staying for 3 hours, catching up and later ordering fantastic Bloody Mary's for dessert. Really AWESOME Bloody Mary's!!!!
