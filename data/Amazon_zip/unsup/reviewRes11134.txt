This is what brunch should be about. Yes, there is like a two hour wait. Yes, its crowded and very loud during the weekends (I haven't been lucky enough to go during the week). Yes, it is a bit overpriced. But yes, yes, yes! The hash browns are perfection. I have never had hash browns anywhere else so yummy. The bacon is crispy. The drinks may be a bit weak but they are fruity and delicious. I have tried every benedict they have....and I have never ever had a bad meal here. I've been several times. For a cheapo like me (if you're going to enjoy yourself, be prepared to drop around $30 including tip), I'll happily treat a friend to the Bongo Room. Now, if only the lady can come with me next time...
