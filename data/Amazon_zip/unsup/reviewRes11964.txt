On our second trip to Chicago we knew we had to pay another visit here after being so pleased the first time. After a short 10 minute wait were were seated. Our waitress, Geraldine was pure sunshine. I ordered a hot mocha to warm my hands and my boyfriend a triple espresso. For breakfast I had red velvet pancaked with warm vanilla cream, 2 scrambled eggs, and my boyfriend had an omelet. The food was just as sensational as it was the first time. The pancaked were really red velvet, not just pancake batter with red food dye, the warm vanilla cream was sinful. My eggs were cooked to perfection. Our water glasses never went empty and our waitress checked on us several times. She even noticed I didn't finish most of my mocha and without even asking, brought me a to-go cup for my leftovers. Her level of service was amazing. The Bongo Room still remains one of our most favorite places in the city!
