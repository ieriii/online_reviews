I really liked this place! The service was very good and the food was really fresh and tasty. I went for brunch and the selection of dishes was very diverse. I had a hard time choosing between the chiliquiles and the pumpkin ravioli. Very good place to eat. My only beef with it is the location. Edgewater might as well be a suburb it is so far from the west side of Chicago. If you are north, you should go here a lot. If you are south or west, make a trip at least once.....it's well worth it.
