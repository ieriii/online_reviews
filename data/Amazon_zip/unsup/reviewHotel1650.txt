We stayed at the Hotel Allegro the weekend of our wedding. We talked to "small groups" who told us to book reservations on our credit card and transfer them to our guests. This system did not work! Small groups and the reservations department don't coordinate! Anytime someone would call to transfer one room all the rooms got transferred into their name! For instance, at one point my aunt was going to be billed for all 9 rooms we had booked! Luckily we figured it out, but it took us 4 hours on the phone with them 2 days before the wedding to straighten it out. And they did not offer us a discount!!! So we went in pretty upset. Despite this the people on the phones were always very pleasant. It was just the system seemed to be inadequate. The hotel is actually a pretty cool place. The lounge areas are sort of hip and the rooms and our King Suite were very nice. I'd recommend staying here if you just book your own room. Don't use small groups!!! This may be a Kimpton problem more than just an Allegro problem.
