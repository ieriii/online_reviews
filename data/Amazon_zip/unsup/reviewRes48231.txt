What a fantastic concept for a restaurant. I went here for a group birthday dinner, and was wowed by the decor, food and libations. The beer hall style seating, large open interior and high ceilings are nearly evocative of a medieval church or stable. The extensive beer menu gives you something to do while you wait for your seat at the communal table and the staff is very helpful. Dishes are either pork or fish and because I was with a large group, I had the chance to sample most of the dishes. The oysters, mussels and frites were delicious. We were brought complimentary spicy pork rinds - something I never would venture out on my own to try - but were surprisingly tasty. The pork dishes were deliciously flavorful and fatty.  While there are vegetables on the menu (brussel sprouts were delicious), this heavy meat and seafood-based menu is not for the faint of heart. Be sure to ask the waiter for recommendations, or else you may end up regretting your choices. It's ideal for sharing, but is easy to order too much. I'm still dreaming of these mussels and impatiently waiting for the next occasion/excuse to return here.
