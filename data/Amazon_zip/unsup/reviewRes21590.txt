The place opened at 11am which is when we arrived (hot dogs for breakfast = awesome). It was packed by 1130. The hot dogs are hefty here. Meaty, moist, and tasty. The fries are served what I would call "medium well" (crispy with some browning). They are pretty good, though I prefer softer fare. The hot dogs are very beef centric. The pickle was large enough to stand up with the beef but I couldn't really taste the brightly-dyed relish, onion, or mustard topping. The meat overpowered it. Personally, I wanted a bit more parity between flavors. Nonetheless the beef hot dog was good. One thing that differentiates Superdawg from other hot dog joints is the pickled tomato. It was really good. In fact, I wouldn't have minded them replacing the pickle (for clarification: the traditional pickled cucumber) with a few more pickled tomatoes. The cashier lady wasn't the most pleasant around. You can get hot peppers with your hot dog. Fries come with the hot dog. It's the same price with or without them. The meal is delivered in a compact box.
