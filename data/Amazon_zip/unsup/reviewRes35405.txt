Always excellent, but not 5 stars. We've been going here for 20 years and never been disappointed. Everyone has favorites - our are the crab cakes (consistently amoung the best in Chicago, lots of crab in them), the coconut shrimp (as a shared starter), and the key lime pie. This is a big bustling place, with the decor you would expect. Waitstaff is good, but too busy to interact after the initial friendly chat when you're ordering. All the fish courses are consistently good, so it's a good place to go if you like seafood and want a broad selection.
