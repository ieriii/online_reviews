I really debated whether I should even bother writing my review of the Giordano's, as it seems that there are so many passionate people out there liking a certain place for Chicago pizza.... I understand that. It's like when one asks about where the "best" dim sum place in SF is. It's subjective and everyone has his/her favorite for one reason or another. Besides, I am just a visitor who happen to enjoy occasional Chicago style pizza here and there..... I used to like the Chicago pizza from Edwardo's on Ogden Ave. in Naperville when my in-laws lived there. When that closed, we always ordered a take out from Nancy's when visiting Chicago. Reading Yelp review, I actually requested my in-laws that we try out Lou Malnati's but was instead told that Giordano's better. Apparently, they had less than stellar experience with Lou M. as their previous order ("Lou" pizza) contained Cheddar cheese, as they did not read the menu thoroughly before ordering, which they found appalling and unforgiving. We took the pizzas to go and ate them at home. And yes, I felt quite sick and nauseous, like I am supposed to feel after eating 3 giant slices of those bad boys.
