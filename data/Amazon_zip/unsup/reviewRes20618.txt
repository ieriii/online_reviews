I had the agohada torta and it was absolutely phenominal. The crispy bread, the tomatoey fiery broth, the delicious meat. Everything worked in harmony.  Yes the line was long and the wait was even longer, but when you cram next to others you make friends and it turns out to be a great experience.  I will definitely be going back. It is an opportunity to eat one of the worlds best chef's food without breaking the bank.
