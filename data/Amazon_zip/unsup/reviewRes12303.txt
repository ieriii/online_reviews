This little Cuban/Mexican spot was well worth the trek up to Irving Park Rd. We stopped in later in the evening on a Saturday and surprisingly, only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. We enjoyed the pear salad and coconut shrimp as an appetizer--the best I've had, mind you, and my entree was the Cuban steak. The food was exquisite and flavorful, and I had the best frozen mojito ever! Slurped it up like kool-aid, yes I did! A couple major annoyances? The place is seriously conversation challenged with the constant noise of the servers stomping the hardwood floors. Add to that a group table with a cackling girl and some latin music piped in overhead, and you just have one noisy evening. I guess it's a time to let the food fill your mouth and not as much conversation.
