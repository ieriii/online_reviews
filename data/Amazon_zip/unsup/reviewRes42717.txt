Gilt Bar is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The atmosphere is trendy and the interior is similar to places like The Violet Hour and Girl and Goat (exposed lightbulbs, dim lighting, modern with a little bit of nostalgic Americana accents). My only complaint is that it is very loud and the food is VERY rich (although very good). We ordered the mushroom & truffle pasta (the best dish), the pot roast, white cornbread (favorite side) and brussel sprouts. All were delicious but because it was so heavy we could only eat a few bites.
