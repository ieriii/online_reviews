The food was good. The menu was vast. The atmosphere was cool (although a bit of a chain feel.) The service we had was horrible. It took over two hours for us to have lunch. We pre-ordered a chocolate cake before our entrees and at the end of the meal our waiter brought out apple pie. We were devastated! Also, one of my friends ordered the duck pot-stickers as her entree (she ordered when they brought out our entrees) and didn't receive them until after everyone's leftovers were bagged and the bill was paid. How long does it take to make pot-stickers? All of my companions and I have decided that we would go back because the food was great, but we will ask for a different waiter. 11/14/06: I went back a second time and the service was still bad. This is not a place to go if you have to get back to work. I asked our server when our entrees would be coming out (they were taking a little too long) and he said "they'll be out soon. I'm sorry, we're just really busy." I'm shocked that a restaurant on Michigan Ave. would be busy at lunch time. (Yes, that was sarcasm.)  I did get to try the molten chocolate cake and it was divine. I would go back just for that.
