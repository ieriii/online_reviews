Came here for drinks at about 10pm on a Sunday night and it was packed--PACKED! On a Sunday night!! Don't people have to work tomorrow?? Well we did, but that didn't stop us from getting a few great cocktails at the bar and staying for almost three hours. I loved the feel of L&E: exposed brick, dimly lit, and a bit crowded, but with a classy, hipster/chic feel. We were told when we first arrived that it might be a 30-45 minute wait for a table, and the bar was already packed. Luckily, we hung around and were seated in about 15 minutes at a quieter table in the back room.  Now I'm not much of a Whiskey connoiseur, and let's just say the bulk of my drinks in college were single or double shots of Smirnoff from the nearest Jewel Osco (shameful, I know)....but I will say that now, I can appreciate a good drink when I find one. There was a great craft cocktail selection to choose from, and the drinks were strong and the service was friendly. A waitress even came by offering free shots of whiskey. What a great place! Wish I could say more about the food, but neither of us was hungry, but we split a cheese plate and each had a pretzel. What we did have was delicious, and I will definitely be back again, hopefully for brunch or dinner!
