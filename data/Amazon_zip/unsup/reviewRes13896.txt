The only Cuban caf I eat at because it's that good! I usually get the Cuban sandwich or the Bistec but I highly recommend the Cuban sandwich. The fries are also scrumptious! The smoothies are all good but give the mamey a try. It's a fruit that taste like a sweet potato and pumpkin (if you like those things). The price is very reasonable.
