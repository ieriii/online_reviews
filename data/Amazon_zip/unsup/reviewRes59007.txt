I went to Sunda last Thursday for one of the "tastings" before the restaurant opened to the public and I was really impressed with the restaurant on its opening night. Usually it takes a few weeks to work out the kinks, but the servers were pretty knowledgeable. They only had a limited menu when we were there but we got to sample tons of dishes. It's a really good place if you like Asian food but not necessarily sushi - they have tons of other options if you don't like raw fish.I think this place is going to be the new "Japonais" and the trendy vibe/menu is on par with places like Koi, Nobu or Tao. I will definitely be returning!
