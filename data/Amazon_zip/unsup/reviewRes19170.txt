I had originally made reservations for Topolobampo, but decided to cancel as I wasn't feeling the menu. I ended up coming here twice on my trip to Chicago as we were so impressed with the food. It's hard for me to get excited about upscale mexican food, which is why Xoco was more appealing to me instead of Topolobampo. I did actually try to get into Frontera Grill for lunch on a sat, which was a foolish endeavor, since it was a 90 min wait, so we were more than happy to come here again. First time I was a damn pig, and got a carnitas torta and a bowl of pork belly fideos, as well as sharing some amazing chicarrones and an order of three churros. So I waddled out of there ashamed at my gluttony. second time I was more reasonable and got the saturday special...braised goat torta and the chicharrones again. Both tortas came with sauces that were knock-me-on-my-ass delicious..just an amazing amount of spice, heat, and flavor. The pork belly fideos..which is like the mexican version of ramen noodles..was pretty spectacular as well. The chicharrones were the best I ever had, for sure. Worth the wait and the communal seating to have some amazing Ric Bayless food for affordable prices here.
