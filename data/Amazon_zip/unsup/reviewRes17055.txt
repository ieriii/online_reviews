Chicken Tikka Masala - was very good had a second helping Lamb dish on a heated plate - It was good also. Naan- was very fresh when brought out in the basket. I tried the paneer that was wonderful as always even though I can cook it at home a little bit on the soft side at India house. Fish Tikka Masala- didn't look good to me  The buffet was really nice don't miss it. I would try the mango Ice cream at the other counter with the desserts wonderful taste! The tandoori chicken was on a hot plate I was very surprised that it came with the meal. Since they already had such a large selection of food for the buffet. I can cook "Chole" Chickpea curry alot better then this place.
