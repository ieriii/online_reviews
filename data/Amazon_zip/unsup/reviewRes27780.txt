Went again, and I'll still go to this place sometime in the future as I would imagine they will continue to update and change their menu through out the seasons. And don't get me wrong I still like GE and would still suggest it, however my last meal had a couple things wrong that must be pointed out. Food had great taste, but it was on the cooler side temp wise. And second I personally like going towards the end of dinner service. I don't like going with all the "we want a 7:30/8:30 reservation" crowd. So I took the second to last reservation of the night, not the last one as that would just be being a dick. With that said the pace of the meal was WAY too fast. I know there's those people that bitch and moan about waiting 4 minutes for their next course, however seriously with the amount of money that one spends at a place like GE, it should be an experience you can sit back relax and enjoy. I wish they had paced the meal out longer.
