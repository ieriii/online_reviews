Great Chicago fondue staple. Have been eating at Geja's for years, and always return. Not for the quick dining experience though, as fondue takes a while to cook, then eat. Romantic environment, with ample food and drink selections. The chocolate fondue is to die for!!! If you like fondue and have some time, try Geja's!!!
