Tried an egg frittata, an omelette, and the French toast. I normally love anything breakfast without question, but this place really turned me off with the egg dishes which I didn't think would happen with a place named Yolk. I was halfway done and had to push my plate away. The service is very friendly and the French toast was amazing, especially with their homemade syrup. Good coffee too. Probably will not return here though.
