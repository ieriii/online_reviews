Caliente. That definitely describes Carnivale. This restaurant receives 5 stars because of its amazing decor, great drinks and flavorful food. The minute you walk in your dazzled with the vibrant colors and salsa music. First, you must start your experience with an amazing Raspberry Mojito. This signature drink was so good I followed it immediately with another. For appetizers, I recommend the guacamole, the mixto ceviche, or the empanadas. My main entree was Bistek Palomilla (Niman Ranch Ribeye with grilled onions) which came with a side of fried yuca and garlic mojo. It was such a large portion of meat I was having difficulty finishing it, however I still managed. Wow, every bite was better than the last. One of my friends ordered the fish of the day and it was delicious as well. Everyone was extremely happy with their food. Service: The staff was extremely knowledgable and friendly. We joked around with our waiter which made the experience so much better. Price: Yeah, this is the not so fun part. It's definitely pricey. However, the overall experience and food quality made up for the steep prices. I highly recommend you venture out to Carnivale with a group of friends for a great time.
