I went there with a group of 7 girls for a celebratory dinner. The wait was about 1.5 hours since this place does not take reservations. It was our first time so the waiter recommended that he order for us about 3-4 plates per person which was TOO MUCH FOOD. The food was avg-good. Not spectacular by no means. The girl and the goat is much better. We paid about $50pp including tax/tip w/ drinks. Would I come back? Yea, I'll give it another try. Would I wait 1.5 hours. Definitely NOT!
