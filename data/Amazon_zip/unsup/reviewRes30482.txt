I am a big fan of Frontera. The food is very good, though it isn't cheap, and the margaritas are excellent. Although it is tough to get a table, I have managed to eat in the restaurant a number of times after arriving in the evening without a reservation, and it is usually possible to eat in the bar. The decor is a little over the top for my taste, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it.
