this place is infamous for a reason. i love the low-lighting and prohibition era ambiance, the delightfully strange and ever evolving menu, the knowledgeable waiters, so on and so forth. i HATE their stupid no reservations seating system that almost always forces me to wait in a crowded hallway for over an hour.
