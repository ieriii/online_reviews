I went here a week or so ago with my roommate - we had heard awesome things and wanted to try it for ourselves. The service was standard, the portions were huge, but the food was not very tasty. Our veggie-friendly dishes had limp, yellow broccoli. The queso was dripping in extra fat (yeah, yeah, I know that I shouldn't be complaining when I knowingly order queso, but this was a bit much). The house margarita was actually okay for the price. Overall, I was disappointed. I was hoping for yummy Mexican food for low prices and a convenient location. Two out of three normally isn't a bad deal, but the food turned me off. I won't be back.
