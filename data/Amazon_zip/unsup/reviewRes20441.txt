After a week of eating standard lunch fare--sandwiches, salads, and pizza (not deep dish), this was a breath of fresh air! I ordered the ahogada which is a torta with golden pork carnitas with carmelized onions that stand vertically (2 halves) in a bowl of tomato-y goodness spicy soup (medium spicy was plenty HOT--they don't mess around). Perfectly balanced with my agua fresca of cucumber, mint, lime -- just lightly sweet and oh so refreshing for a muggy summer day. Dessert was the churros everyone's been raving about. Call me clueless but I didn't know you had to order a cup of gooey hot chocolate separately. I thought it came with the order of churros, my bad. My friends and I came at 1:30ish and we waited about 30 minutes in line to order our food. The hostess was telling us 50 mins+. Btw, it's pronounced "SHO-ko". By far the BEST food I had in Chicago! I want to try Frontera Grill next time I visit =) Go Rick Bayless! I gave it 4 stars due to the lack of seating and pour layout of the restaurant. The staff have to walk through the restaurant to access the 'kitchen' and not the prep area on the other side.
