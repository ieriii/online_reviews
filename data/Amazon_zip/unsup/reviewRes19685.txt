I'd heard good thing, so when my gf wanted to celebrate getting a raise we thought we'd hit up some fancy sushi.  We were seated right away and our nice bottle of New Zealand sauvignon blanc was quickly poured and set in a chiller. As our server poured the wine (which came with a Stelvin [aka. screwcap] enclosure) he told us that not everything in a screwcap is crap! What an ass! We ordered some appetizers and a couple rolls and everything came out well prepared and nicely displayed. After eating thru that we wanted to order some nigiri, so we told our waiter we wanted to order more. He said ok, then walked away and didn't return until I managed to make eye contact with him. Once he brought the nigiri he mis-identified every piece. How lame can you get?? The fish had terrible texture, looked less than super fresh and came on a hockey-puck's worth of rice. After finding the bottom of our bottle we left and will most likely never return.
