Swoon! Swooning like a teenage love affair. Not over just The Publican, but more specifically, their breakfast foods - I'm lookin' at you, omelette - o scrumptious omelette. My sister and I had a special brunch date at The Publican on super bowl Sunday. We had an early afternoon reservation and the place was packed and * noisy *. Not just with loud talking, but with rather lively (we referred to it as "clubby") music. Yes, this was Sunday brunch in an otherwise dead West Loop, but this place was hopping! We split three delicious dishes: (and actually ordered a fourth, but there must have been a mistake with the waitress because it never came and we weren't charged for it - we were both too stuffed to eat it anyway, so it actually worked out for the best.) - Ricotta & Milk-Stout Beer Bread SO good. A new found love of ricotta cheese (and vow to use it in home cooking). The bread was served atop a big mound of ricotta with honey and apples, and sprigs of greens. Really nice, fresh combo.  - Quiche Served with mushrooms, lots of onion, gruyere and a side salad. Great combo of the cheese, shrooms and onion - with that flaky crust. - Omelette The. best. omelette I've ever had - seriously. This thing was like a miracle of eggs. It was the softest, thickest, juiciest omelette (I'm actually curious how it was cooked so I can try to (most likely unsuccessfully) recreate it on my own) served with gouda, roasted tomato and cauliflower. I'd love to return for dinner - hopefully in one of those awesome side booths that close you in. But, if brunch was this packed/loud, I'm sure it just gets more bustling later on. Still - fun. And fantastic food! [ The menu item that almost was would be the waffle. Ah... next time... ]
