Two stars is generous because I've actually had worse pizza than this.Anyone that thinks this is what Chicago pizza is a about just movedhere and lives in Lakeview or Lincoln Park. As a Chicago native, I love my pizza. My wife is from Indy and she called this pizza "barely edible."That said, the salad was worse than the pizza. I was starving, and I still am. Probably going to throw the leftovers out. Boo.
