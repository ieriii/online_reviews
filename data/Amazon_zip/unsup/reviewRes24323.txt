I'm really trying to be unbiased, bc I'm sure Im the only person of a 400 mile radius who experienced the best crepes in the world at a street cart in Philadelphia. So, keeping that in mind, it was not quite up to par with my frist time, but it was an excellent dining experience, and the crepes were still filling, vegetarian friendly, and flavorful. The issue that results in 3 stars was my confusion in flavor of the dinner crepe. The crepe itself was pancake-like trying to mix with my feta cheese & its mediterranean friend filling. It would be much better if the non-desert crepe took on a garlic or dinner like flavor in the batter. One flavor does not fit all here.  On the other hand, the desert crepe (we got strawberry with nutella) was excellent and luckily, I have nothing to compare that to. I would go again, especially since I'd rather eat from 1 star Chicago restuarants for a week than go hang out in Philly. I'm just glad Chicago has a crepe restuarant at all.
