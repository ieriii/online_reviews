Love love this place! Had dinner here back in November and am still in love with the experience. We brought 2 bottles of wine which were alternated for us based on which pairings worked with which dishes. My reservation was actually canceled due to the restaurant closing for the night not once, but twice - but the guys at Schwa were incredibly nice and apologetic about it. They even comped a good part of the bill for us because of it (not at all necessary or expected, but very much appreciated!). I've been calling the last two weeks trying to get another reservation because I still can't stop thinking about how wonderful the meal was! I'll probably still be calling for a little while before I'm lucky enough to get in again...but at least I know it'll be worth it!
