I came here for my 21st birthday a year ago and was amazed at the incredible service, I came in today and was amazed at how downhill they went. I suffer from Celiac disease and was astonished by the condescending-- if not downright malicious -- tone the server took with me. I erred on tears. After feeling pressured on our orders, the server took them and went along. He spent significant time dwelling at other tables while ignoring ours; and while I drained my water glass, the server addressed my family member's fuller glasses while I waited a good 15 minutes before he took heed and filled my glass. This isn't even the worst part-- it took him 45 minutes to deliver our lunch and he delivered my lunch last. In most cases a server will generally augment the flaw of bad service with a special consideration towards the table (i.e., wine, dessert) anything to reflect better on him or her... However this waiter was quite arrogant, displaying hazardous traits that guaranteed him a very scarce tip in return for his poor, poor service. My conclusion being: the Mercat a la Planxa hires ageist servers that are insensitive towards the gluten-intolerant/Celiac community and for this reason the service they hire reflect horribly on the restaurant itself, thus giving the restaurant a veneer of pretension that ill-suits it.
