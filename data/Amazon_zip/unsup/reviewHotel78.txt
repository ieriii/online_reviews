I got a room for my parents in the motel section of the Carleton and I was so pleased with the rooms! They are used to Holiday Inns but I wanted them closer to me in Oak Park. The rooms were cute, very Mad-Men-60's, but adorable! They were clean and nicely sized for a motel, they had a little kitchenette and a nice clean bathroom. I told my folks that if they didn't want to stay there, I would and they could have my apartment! They were very comfortable and pleased with the location, they said next time they come to town they will surely stay there!
