Art of Pizza is a HUGE favorite for out of towners. When I lived in the suburbs, this was a treat. A super delicious, cheesy, saucy treat. When my friends come to visit from said suburb, they always wanna come here. It's cool...I'm down with that. It's not really in my regular rotation anymore, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it any less.
