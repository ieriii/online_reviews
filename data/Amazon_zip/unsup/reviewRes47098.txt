SqueeeeeeeEEeeeeee!!!! Best. Place. EVER!!! The cocktails are delightful, the food is amazing AND sustainable and the waitstaff is classy. This is the perfect place for date night- particularly the one on Devon which has a better dinner-hour atmosphere and a classier menu than the coffee house-style UCG in Boy's Town. I love this place and would recommend it to anyone. I have made some very special memories there- and it lends itself to unique experiences. They created flavors I had never tried- the servers are very knowledgeable and can nudge you toward something that you will love if you are indecisive like me. I haven't ever had anything bad. The lighting makes it perfect for sipping your cocktail and batting your eyelashes at a date. They have absynthe and serve it in the traditional style. They do not rush you and servers are the perfect level of attentive. I just can't say enough good things about UCG and would go there every night if I could afford to do so. Oh, and LOVE the music and farmers markets in the summer!!!
