Went here on a Friday in lent so sadly no meat for...from what I saw this would likely be a 5 if I coulda had meat. The ricotta cheese and honey rivaled one of my favorite starters ever...a similar dish at Laconda Verde in NYC. We did the cachio pepe and raviollo before tackling the mushroom pizza. All were very tasty. I try to keep these to food, but if I have any complaints it was the somewhat icy service. The guy wasn't rude, but he certainly wasn't welcoming either. It felt like we were bothering him whenever we ordered.
