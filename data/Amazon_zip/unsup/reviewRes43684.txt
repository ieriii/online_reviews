A review for a restaurant like Kinzie has to take into consideration its prices. So the rating should not be in the context of Outback or Lonestar, but other steakhouses where steaks are in the $40 range. I had their $50 special of the day, which was the 16oz dry-aged Delmonico with two shrimp and risotto. First, the steak looked small for 16oz. Second, the steak was slightly burned (I ordered "medium"). Third, it didn't have the tenderness and taste normally associated with a dry-aged ribeye. Sure, it was better than a ribeye from Outback, but that shouldn't be the benchmark, should it? Overall there's nothing wrong with Kinzie but it's a rather forgettable and ho-hum experience and I don't feel compelled to go back.
