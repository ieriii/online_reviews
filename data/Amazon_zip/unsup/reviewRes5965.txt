I love Wildfire -- it will always be the place I learned to love steak after years of overcooked, burnt-to-a-crisp versions by my mother. But after this last experience, I think I'm over Wildfire. The ambiance -- a blend of Art Deco-y, Rat Pack stylings -- is what I love most about Wildfire. I feel like I should be decked out in 50s garb to really enjoy the experience. Even in jeans I feel classier just sitting in the dining room. But this last adventure was disappointing. After six months away from Chicago, I went back to Wildfire, talking the joint up to the boyfriend -- the steaks! the ambiance! the wait staff! the experience! What were we left with? My rice pilaf was hard as a rock on top, it was dry and tasteless, despite the many flavors piled in. I couldn't even eat it beyond a few tastes because it was so dried out. The boyfriend suggested this was likely the result of it sitting under a hot lamp, and he was probably right. My steak was a little overcooked, and the amount of juicyness that I expected was lacking. It wasn't dried out, but it wasn't as juicy as it could have (and SHOULD have) been. Luckily the wait staff was plenty friendly and attentive. But I'm left feeling disappointed and over the experience. We had a good run, Wildfire. Good luck.
