Shared 36 oysters with my boyfriend. So good and fresh! Our server was really knowledgeable and friendly. We were celebrating the birth of our baby and they were really cool about us bringing her in. Although at two weeks old she doesn't really do much. They also gave us a free dessert to celebrate.
