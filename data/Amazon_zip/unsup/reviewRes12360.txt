checked this place out on the recommendation of my roommate. i'm not usually a thin crust girl, but something about this pizza is addictive. they have thin lonnnnng slices, nothing like i've ever seen before. i also tried one of their home brews...which wasn't bad, but not the best i've ever had. but definitely go for the pizza. it's a little crowded and loud, but worth it for the food.
