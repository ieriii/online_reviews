Ate here on a Thursday night last week. Ambience is very lowkey, it was more casual than I expected. Boyfriend & I got the medium deep-dish with sausage, tomatoes, & olives. Waitress warned us that we'd have leftovers - we proved her wrong by finishing everything (er, except the crust, which I wanted to eat but couldn't squeeze it in because I was as stuffed as the pizza was!). Everything was absolutely delicious, the cheese was so fresh & gooey *droooool*, & the pizza overall wasn't all that greasy (being a lifelong NYer, I do love my NYC pizza, but it can sometimes be a bit too oily). The crust was flaky & doughy but not overly so, everything was perfect! The only bad thing was the wait, it took about 45 minutes for our food to come out. But the waitress did tell us ahead of time, so we at least expected it. Also, the A/C was weak on a very humid night.
