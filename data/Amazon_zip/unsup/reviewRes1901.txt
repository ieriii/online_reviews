Grubbin!  What else can I say about this place. It's famous, even Anthony Bourdain No Reservations came here. Shared half dogs with four of my buddies, so had about 8 different dogs. My fav was defiantly the Foie Gras and sauternes duck sausage w/ truffle aioli. Pretty money. We had some of the favorites too. My other fav was the rabbit dog, lamb sausage with smoked gouda, and the rattle snake sausage.  Over all, we're pretty spoiled here in the San Francisco Bay Area, so we have our own dog joints. I would just order what you like.  Pros- So many different dogs and toppings Cons- The line was sooooo long. About an hour and a half wait.  Over rated but MUST GET!!!- The duck fat fries. They're actually pretty dry.
