The best Brazilian steakhouse in Chicago and the best I've ever been to in any location. I've been here several times and it is consistently scores five stars. Service, food, and atmosphere are great. A few of the other Brazilian steakhouse in town do have a few more items to select from on the salad bar (sushi, cold cuts, etc), but if you are interested in the salad bar this isn't the place for you anyway. The Picanha and bacon wrapped filet mignon are my favorite and the endless side dishes are awesome too! Food- 5 / 5 Service- 5 / 5 Atmosphere- 4 / 5
