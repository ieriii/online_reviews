Bin 36 is definitely the place to go to try new wines, eat excellent cheeses and enjoy a swanky atmosphere. Our waiter was very accommodating, friendly, and very apologetic when our main entrees took a long time to arrive. We had the beef short ribs and shrimp cocktail as appetizers, both of which I would highly recommend.  For entrees stick with the fish options as the steak was so-so. The chocolate fondue was a fun dessert, but too cold. Aside from not falling in love with the food, we would definitely go back.
