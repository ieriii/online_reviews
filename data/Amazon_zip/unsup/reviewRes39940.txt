The overall aesthetic, from the space to the staff, says "I don't have a job", but the price point says "I work in an office." I guess you could say that about a lot of Logan Square these days, but L&E somehow seems like it's pulling off one of the more egregious hipster dick-waggles of high-end low culture. That said, they're improving every time I come around. The cocktails are ace, and the bartenders know what they're doing - ask about some off-menu whiskey cocktails for a treat.  I've been blown away by a couple dishes (venison breast over chanterelle and lobster, prawns and grits) and a couple left me flat (pork shank, appetizer combo). I'd recommend going with a few small plates, which seems to be where L&E shines.  Don't expect to get a table easily on any night, and don't count on the bar to have any seats, or even space to order a cocktail. The patio's great, so long as you're upwind of the truly toxic pork-and-whiskey rot of the alley dumpsters, which may eventually establish L&E as an EPA Superfund site. Most nights, you'll run into your typical blue-line yupster crowd, but you'll also run into Chad and Trixie who, faced with a majestic wall of interesting whiskey, order High Life. But that's what a GQ write-up will do for you.  Three stars, docked for inconsistency and overcrowding. Sometimes it's really hot when we hook up, other times, it's best to just let that call go to voicemail.
