I am not sure what this hotel is like inside, but I know the customer service is horrible. I tried to reserve a block of rooms here for my wedding - called three times and sent one e-mail and never got a response, even after talking to someone on the phone. She promised to send me information on rates and availability and then radio silence. I even called twice to follow up. Nothing. I guess they don't need the business.
