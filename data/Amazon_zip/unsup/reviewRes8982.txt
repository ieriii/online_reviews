We sat at the bar upstairs as all the tables were reserved, and I'm glad we did. With dark lighting and clusters of towering fake plants, it felt a little like a jungle. One of the bar tenders was easy on the eye, and that never hurts. We started with the pho, which was very good, but the main courses were just average. I ordered the Mi Axo Do Bien and my dad got the Bo Bitet Tom Nuong. Mine was decent at best. It was a good portion, but I thought the flavor was too mild and it took away from the freshness of the seafood. The noodles were a weird crunchy texture that I didn't care for either. My dad's was much better, but not what he remembered from 20 years ago. I think my favorite part of his was the rice. It was like a tomato based sauce with pineapple and a flavor I've never had before. Apparently it's the only dish on the menu with it, but next time I might ask for a side. Even though it was way overpriced, I would go back for the soup and to try the lettuce wraps. I'm just not in any hurry.
