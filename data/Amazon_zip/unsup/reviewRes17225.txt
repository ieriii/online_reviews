I've only been to this trendy restaurant once so far and thought it was a really cool atmosphere. I couldn't believe how big the restaurant is, but yet it's still packed and impossible to get a reservation. It looked like the perfect spot for a party so I'm planning a Cinco De Mayo bash for my company here...looking forward to it!
