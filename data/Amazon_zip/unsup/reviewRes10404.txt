First time I've gotten Piece take out. Last time I will get Piece take out. I've spent the last month talking up this restaurant and their pizza. So when i had family & friends coming to town I insisted we go to Piece! A group of 6, it was going to take 1.5 hours to seat us at 6:45 - so we just decided to get take out. The gentlemen over at the take out side were polite, though they seemed a little frazzled/busy. Our party went down the street for a round of drinks while we waited for our pizzas. I picked them up, and drove them 40 minutes home to the suburbs. Unfortunately both pizzas were extremely wrong. And I say extreme because they both were covered with extra jalepenos. There was only supposed to be jalepenos on half of ONE pizza. The stickers on the boxes had our correct orders as we had told them to the employee. The pizzas inside were a mess. It looked like someone had thrown handful after handful of incorrect ingredients on our pizzas. Needless to say, I looked like an asshole for talking about how great this place was going to be. I paid $55 for our 2 pizzas (including tip). Not only were the toppings wrong and a mess, but the pizza looked like it had been sliced by a child. Some slices were an inch thick, while others were huge. I didn't call to complain because I knew how busy they were. And to be honest I'm not the type of person to do that. I am the kind of customer who will instead just stop coming back, and stop praising their restaurant. I will do the opposite of that now, and encourage people to get their pizza elsewhere. Sorry Piece, but I've now had 2 bad experiences with you. Both of which were with out of towners who wondered why I thought your establishment was so great. I now don't know the answer to that question. Bummer.
