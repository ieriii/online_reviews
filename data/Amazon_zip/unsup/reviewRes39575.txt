I usually love San Soo Gab San. I've been here several times before and always keep coming back because they have good marinated meat, LOTS of side dishes, and always serve rice/miso soup with the BBQ items. However, recently the quality of their side dishes have dwindled and the meat was too salty. We ordered an extra small bowl of rice and an extra bowl of miso soup....at really unreasonable prices. I understand if you have to charge extra for extra items...but $2.50 for a little bowl of rice and $4.50 for a bowl of soup??? Really?! I almost felt taken advantaged of, not to mention that their service is very rude and impolite. When we were paying our bill, we wanted to pay partly cash and partly credit card but they wouldn't let us and said that they could only accept one method...when in the past they've even accepted split checks from us. After telling my friends that have been there about the bad service, they said that the restaurant is known to be rude to their customers (especially non-Koreans). Although the waitresses did thank us when we left. Probably will not be going back anytime soon.
