I've never met a Jimmy John's I didn't like, and the this location being across the street from my office makes me love it even more. This has to be the freakiest-of-the-fastest Jimmy John's I've ever been to, even during the lunch rush. Consistently top notch & in and out in under 3 minutes... if only I could say the same for ex-boyfriends. JJ's, you never disappoint.
