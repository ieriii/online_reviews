This place is worth the hype. I planned a trip to Chicago specifically to go to dinner here. Yes, that sounds crazy, but it was worth it. We did the 24 course menu with beverage pairings. Everything was incredible. The service, the food, the wine, the decor, everything! I have to say I wasn't full after the 24 courses (and being on a foodie vacation, I had already eaten deep dish and hot dogs at Hot Doug's earlier in the day). If you're going to Alinea, just do the 24. I wouldn't have been satisfied with 12 courses. I didn't travel all this way to be in and out. Just go for it, and you'll be happy. It was about 3.5 hours. I can't compare this place to anywhere I've ever been. It's a once in a life time dining experience. If you're a foodie, or want a special occasion place, this is it. I'm honestly having trouble getting excited about going out to eat since eating here 2 weeks ago. It's just that good. PS. Hot potato, cold potato, and truffle explosion are insane!
