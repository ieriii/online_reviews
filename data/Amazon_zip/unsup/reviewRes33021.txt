This place was great! I got the French Toast Combo which came with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of sausage, and 2 pieces of bacon. The bacon was cold and not very flavorful, but everything else was great! My boyfriend got the Carnitas sandwich which was on a pretzel bun with goat cheese and a fried egg. We got the potato pancakes to share among the table and those were DELISH. Came with classic applesauce and sour cream. Portion sizes were HUGE as everyone has been saying, so come hungry ;)
