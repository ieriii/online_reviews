Greek Islands doesn't need another reivew, but I'm shooting for 100 reviews, so here goes. The combination cold plate was fun ($8.95) as an appetizer, but my wife wouldn't touch any of the stuff (Taramosalata, squid and octopus, etc.). She thought her Saganaki was hard/tough. My chicken and potatoes was nice. We are old time Roditys' fans, but it was nice to try another place. Greek Islands usually beats out Rodity's in Chicago food reviews. Although its rambling atmosphere can handle more people and you can see them cooking in one of the rooms, the quality of the food is no better than Roditys.
