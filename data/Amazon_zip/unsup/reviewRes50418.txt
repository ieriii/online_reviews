Two reviews for Southern places in two days, and both of them get 5 stars! My Pa would be happier than a piglet sleeping under the shade of a magnolia tree. I reviewed Wishbone (aka the best place for Sunday brunch ever) yesterday; Big Jones has a similar feel to much of their menu, but it's just more upscale. And it is absolutely delicious! I went there for dinner two weeks ago; I started with an amazing spicy corn chowder. It was velvety, smooth and full of complex yet subtle flavors. It was better than the smell of dew drops on a honeysuckle blossom in the warm Savannah Sun. My entree was the Catfish Pecan, which was more victorious than the Union soldiers at Gettysburg! It was perfectly balanced between the flavor of the fish, the pecans and the mustard; it was a great savory and sweet combination. And please do not go here and simply order wine with your meal! You must order a specialty cocktail! I had the Carolina Julep, which is, "Firefly Sweet Tea Infused Vodka, Lemon, Cane Syrup, Mint, Club Soda." It is the amazingly refreshing and sweet and just perfect for sipping on as you watch the lazy Mississippi River drift by you. The enviroment is very relaxing, quiet and simple. The staff (at least our waitress) couldn't be cuter and sweeter. Even though I have lived in Chicago my whole life, my dad is Southern and has really bestowed upon me appreciation for good Souther cuisine. Big Jones has it, and you would be quite the fool to not experience it for yourself!
