My husband and I went there last weekend on a Saturday afternoon, after the annoying crowds began thinning out and we could hear ourselves talk without a baby crying next to us. We thought we were going to be able to enjoy our meal. We ordered the day's special salad, a cup of soup, and a couple of iced teas. As soon as the busboy put the plates down on our table, we could see that the salad leaves were brown and wilty. We dug around the plate to see if it was just a "few leaves" but it was all. We normally don't like to send food back, but we had to, it was inedible. They obliged and offered for us to order something else. But we are watching our diets and thought that salad was the "healthier" option so we just asked for new salads. They brought back 2 "new" salads, and this time only HALF of the lettuce was brown, as opposed to ALL, the first time. We ate our soup and bread and left the salad alone. We paid almost $30 for the whole meal. We will probably never go back there again (we used to go at least 2-3 times a month and saw how things were changing from when they first opened to now...definitely declining, food-wise). At least the staff is friendly enough. But we did find our new place for brunch: LULA CAFE. For now, they have the BEST BRUNCH EVER.
