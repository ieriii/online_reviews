I love this place, and i go here at least 3-4 times a month. Some meats are too salty, but i don't blame the resturant. The chef's hand probably slipped. This server who was moved to Miami's location used to serve me all the times. And i always tipped him $50. After that, i still kept tipping $50 to every server of mine. But not long ago i went there and it was only 2 of us. At the end, when the check came the guy had charged me a 15% service fee. That angered me. For a resturant going to high places such as this, they should train their eimployees well enough to understand respect. Yeah, service charger, for tabels above 6 people is understandable. But for 2, sad. I still left the guy extra $50. Maybe he'll learn something that way.
