Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of bone marrow. I love it, so any restaurant with it on the menu is automatically intriguing. I went there with high hopes one late afternoon and I wasn't disappointed. The Purple Pig does bone marrow right! Delicious crunchy bread, yummy bone marrow with salt, parsley and capers as garnish. The fried olives were fun. The artichoke and fingerling potato salad was nice and tangy. Great coffee too. If I lived in Chicago, the Purple pig would be in heavy rotation.Very pretty and european style set up inside. Nice outdoor seating.
