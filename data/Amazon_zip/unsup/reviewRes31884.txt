A few key items to remember, folks: 1) Make sure you're comfortable with your dining mates' hygiene habits. You'll be sharing dinner with them eating caveman-style with no utensils! 2) Remember "sambussa". You're gonna want to try it. It's like a crisp, deep fried appetizer dumpling, Ethiopian style! 3) Messob (forgot what it means, but backwards it spells "boss 'em"!) is a good way to try a few different meats and a few different veggies. The portions were a bit smaller compared to other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to, and the meats (beef, lamb) and veggies (collard greens, yellow split peas, lentils) were a little salty for me too. Injera wasn't as sour as other places, so that's a thumbs up. An additional stand-out perk here is the modern, warm interior decor and colors.
