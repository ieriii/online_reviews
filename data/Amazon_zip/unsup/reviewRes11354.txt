We went to Bongo Room on a tip from some Chicago natives, who had it on their short list. We must have been really lucky because we showed up at 11:30 AM and got prime seating at the window. I love the space--perhaps because it reminded me of a restaurant I'd find in North Berkeley (which much of Wicker Park reminds me of, actually). I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with brown sugar butter and they were amazing. Seriously, I still think about them now, three weeks after. When they placed the heaping stack with ice cream scoops of butter in front of me, believe me, I did not protest. My bf ordered a beef medallion sandwich on focaccia with horseradish mayo that was made perfectly. We ended up taking half the sandwich to go and it was still good two days later. Service was attentive (in spite of how quickly the place filled up) and the coffee was good (Intelligentsia). What more can you really ask for in a brunch place?
