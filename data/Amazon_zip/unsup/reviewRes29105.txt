Fabulous. The Hawaiian ceviche was soooo good, the soup was sooo good, the tacos sooo good, the dessert was soo good, even the tequila spiked coffee was sooo good. Do we see a pattern here? Not as expensive as I thought it was going to be AND they support local farmers and sustainable food. I heart this place. The server was nice but a little slow. We got appetizers before we even got water or silverware, but I'm not taking any points away. It was restaurant week, it was slammed, and the food made up for everything. I will definitely be back!!
