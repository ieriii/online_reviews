My boyfriend and I live for Irazu. The traditional dish, the casado, is unbelievable in its blend of flavors. Not only that but its the best bang for your dollar as you have left overs for at least two days! We go there just for their shakes, Oatmeal only! It sounds weird but it will be the best thing you've ever tried. Highly recommend it for guests, but get there early. Always a wait but worth it!
