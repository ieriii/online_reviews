What's not to love about Glenn's Diner? Not much. I've been here several times for brunch and each time has been fantastic. It's actually my go-to when I have out-of-towners to entertain. The best part is they take reservations for any party! This is a huge plus. I have a couple of favorites: 1) the classic egg sandwich (it really is a small house) and 2) the parm and chive eggs. Both come with the "potato pancake" which is cheesy as well. You can't really go wrong. Their portions don't skimp and the menu itself is large. The most recent trip I made here was this past weekend, and a friend of mine ordered their bloody mary. I'm not a fan of them in general myself, but hers looked like a small meal in a glass - it came with a skewer of shrimp and basically looked like a salad. She raved about it saying that this is how they're made back home (she's from Louisiana).  The short: I can't recommend this place enough. Just come hungry. As for the review below by Rita....wow. Just terrible. Although since you have grandchildren, I can only assume it's a generational thing.
