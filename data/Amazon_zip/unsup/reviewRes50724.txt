The last place you need another review for is Wishbone, but today I had a brunch there that made me question my prior affections for their brekkie. Yes, true as you all say, passel of yuppies with screaming, generally undisciplined tots all resulting in a train-terminal-in-rush-hour ambience. I've tolerated that because I can get so many different southern-y or more adventurous breakfasts and, in the past, could suck down some of the yummiest spicy bloody marys. Today, it was the same typical cacophony, herds of yuppies and their spawn, same exact menu, but nothing was GOOD! What? The point of enduring the otherwise unpleasant surroundings on a weekend would be for reliably good food. Today? Not so much! Here's the rundown: Coffee: totally watery and weak Bloody Mary: watery and weak, not spicy at all, no discernable vodka, and celery that looked like it just completed a death march into the glass -- all brown and broken, you wouldn't give it to someone to eat at home, or eat it yourself, so why garnish a drink with it, you dumbass? Crabcakes Benedict: eggs were not even remotely poached, completely overcooked hard-boiled quality yolks. Underneath it all, the english muffins were blackened and burnt and actually difficult to cut. Side of cheezy grits = cold. My boyfriends poached eggs were also cooked to rubbery. To their credit was our waiter, who I asked "what's going on? Everything is totally weak and missing the mark?" and showed him my overcooked eggs. I told him I didn't want another replacement meal, but he brought one anyway and on the 2nd go, they did get it right. After the fight for parking, queuing, screaming offspring abound, please don't go tits up on the quality of the food. My prior affection is in check, but hope this was just a bad day.
