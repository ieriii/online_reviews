Art can be inspiring and profound. Who would have ever have thought that pizza could have the same effect. At The Art of Pizza, deep dish pizza is truly a work of art. Although Chicago is known for its deep dish pizza, there aren't that many places that sell by the slice. Who has the time to wait 30-45 minutes for a whole pie? Art of Pizza does the city a service by offering pizza by the slice every day for only $3.75. Because this place is busy, they bring out new pizzas pretty often. The pizza is packed with flavor where the sauce is robust and zesty and the crust is thick and buttery. I recommend dining in rather than take out so that you can enjoy it while it's hot. This continues to be my favorite place in the city for deep dish pizza. One bite and you will marvel at the mastery in this creation. A slice of art for only $3.75 - priceless.
