I went to Piece last night for my friends birthday. When we got there we were told that the place is filled to capacity and that there is a three hour wait. So we could not even go into the place and chill at the bar while waiting to eat. Now I have been here before and know that there always is a wait but this was the longest yet. Because of the wait we decided we would put our name in and head to another bar and come back later and check on our wait. When we came back from the bar it was perfect timing and we were next on the list. The waiter was pretty cool and attentive to us. We ordered two different types of beer in pitchers. One was a light ale and the other a medium ale. The light ale was so so. I would suggest the medium ale over the light. We also ordered three medium thin crust pizzas. They came in a short amount of time. I couldn't stop eating the pizza that had the sausage and green pepper on it. It was delicious. Now I don't know if it was possibly because we had several drinks before hand at the other bar or if I was hungry, but that pizza was heaven in my stomach. The sauce on it is really good and it seems to have the right ingredients for my taste in pizza. They also served my friend for her birthday two huge pieces of chocolate cake and ice cream. I had a taste of that and it was pretty good as well. Also it was nice of them to do that for her. I would definitely suggest trying out this place if you don't mind the wait. I know in order to make reservations there you have to have ten or more people in your party. But keep in mind there are plenty of bars around the area to chill before hand and wait.
