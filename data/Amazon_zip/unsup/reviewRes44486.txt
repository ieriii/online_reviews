This is our go-to neighborhood sushi place. Fun for a night out and excellent, dependable delivery service too. The sushi is always fresh and tasty. Prices are a little high, but worth it for the quality. Our only minor dislikes: their spicy rolls and the long waits for tables (why we usually order take-out/ delivery).
