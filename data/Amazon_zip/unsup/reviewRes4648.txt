I thought the style of the food servings are like tapas. Pricier than tapas tho, but very delicious. I had the pan fried chicken thighs with tzakiki sauce, roasted bone marrow, grilled wild tuna, and my favorite, Caesar salad with a whole anchovy. Everything was tasty! Not a place for the "non-adventurous".
