On our last day in Chicago, my boyfriend and I decided to go out of way to get to Hot Doug's before catching our flight. We were psyched to have the duck fat fries, as well as anything else we could get our hands on. We made the trek here, drooling the whole way over and discussing which wonderful encased meats we would try. We waited on the line outside for about 35 minutes, sure it'd be worth it. Finally reached the counter and the warmth inside, only to see the one sign that would crush all of our hopes and dreams... CASH ONLY. How did we not know this beforehand? I studied their website and read a few yelp reviews and thought we were ready for greatness. Turned out, we were only ready for $7.00 worth because that's all we had between the two of us. JUST enough for the duck fat fries and one Chicago dog each. Not even a drink to wash it down. Saddest moment of my life, so why the 5 stars? This place is kick-ass, regardless of our stupidity! Plus, it just means we'll have to plan another trip to Chicago now! Next time, we'll be prepared. We even found an ATM nearby (after the fact, of course, and by accident) on the way to O'Hare... just in case.
