Haven't been for dinner - just for brunch. It used to be a surefire backup when m.henry had lines snaking around the block, but Big Jones' own popularity seems to be growing on weekend mornings too. And with good reason. My favorite indulgence is the Sally Lunn French Toast. It tends to be served with whatever is seasonal, but my first experience was divine. Thick, gooey, cakey bread topped with glazed peaches, drizzled generously with creme anglaise, and sprinkled with praline pecans. It's simply unforgettable. And anyplace that offers complimentary beignets with your coffee has more than earned my adoration!
