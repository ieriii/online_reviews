5 stars Mastro's, 5 stars. We had colleagues in town and so our cosy little group of 20 rented a private room on the 2nd floor of Mastro's. I usually try to write slighty humorous reviews, but today I just want to cover our experience. The shrimp/ dungeness crab appetizer, decadent. Good. The jumbo lump crab stuffed mushrooms, very nice. I had the big Porterhouse, I had it medium which our server said would still be red in the center. Perfection. Best steak I've had all year. I also ordered the spinach and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was extremely good, I wish I could just pop over and have some more again to appreciate the flavor.  I can't remember the name of the martini I had at the beginning but it was just okay. I'm not a martini person by nature so I would not go by my thoughts. I did however had an expresso martini at the end and it was darn good. I also had some of the profiteroles desert, it's really enough for 2 or 3 folks because each of them has a scoop of ice cream. So I liked our experience on two levels, my wife and I greatly enjoyed the meal, but also my company had a great time too. I'd say the only feedback would be that in the very beginning that our server, Gina, was very good but when we first started to talk about drinks she could have been a bit smoother with passing out the martini list. We had an awkward short conversation that was quickly not a big deal once I had a copy of the list. To be honest I probably threw her a left curve when I asked about drinks maybe she thought I wanted something like a Manhattan. Also our group of 20 arrived in clumps, so we made things a little crazy in the beginning. Best steak I've had all year, and I have been to Joe's Stone Crab and Gene & Georgetti's this year too. Now I must try David Burke's Primehouse. Great job guys, we had a marvelous time.
