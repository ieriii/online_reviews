I've been here 3 times in 3 weeks. That's a sure sign of addiction. The quesadillas from the gluten-free menu are still fab, as are the avocado tostadas. The bbq bacon burger is, hands-down, my favorite, with the grilled tofu "steak" a close second. Do I think for a second those things taste/feel like real steak or burgers? No. They have their own taste and texture that is damn good; just don't try to compare it to real meat. Bonus: they have a great beer selection, wines by the glass are cheap, and the chocolate peanut butter cake is sinfully good.
