Great classic American burgers. I had the Yowza burger. Cooked just the way I wanted. Burgers run for about $10. Definitely tastes and feels like a $10 restaurant burger should. They also have a few beers on tap, which is a plus. We had the onion ring appetizer which actually came on a ring, and more importantly were very good.  Service was friendly and efficient. I liked the atmosphere of a college-aged, yet family friendly, burger and bar joint. It felt cozy to be here on a cold winter evening.
