My husband and I go here whenever we are in the area. They have a great selection of beers on tap, and the wine list is fantastic.  We usually order the scottish egg to start, and sometimes the oysters, which are always fabulous!  The entrees are always delicious and the service is just short of perfect. I love the atmosphere-clean, with dark wood, ceramic tiles, soft lighting.
