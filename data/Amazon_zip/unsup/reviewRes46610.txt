I accidentally stumbled upon this place on the way back from the Zoo, and had a great experience. The waitstaff and the 70s retro atmosphere were both very nice. I ordered the Teri Chicken sandwich with tomato, lettuce and sauteed onions on it, and it was one of the best chicken sandwiches Ive ever had. The freshly fried potato crisps were delicious, and I would imagine healthier than frozen fries from a bag.  Although its a little pricey, I would recommend getting a mlikshake, in one of the big range of flavors available in ice cream or low fat yogurt softserve. Either way it gets you about 2.5 glasses from the big metal mixer, so you get your moneys worth of shake for sure.
