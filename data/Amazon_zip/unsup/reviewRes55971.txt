Our group was shocked by how rude the staff were. We arrived @ 6:40, which was only 10 minutes after our reservation. The extremely rude host told us we are 15 minutes late and they had to cancel our reservation. We told him we are only 10 minutes late and ready to be seated. Then he asked if our entire party was here. I said we're missing one person, but we are ordering for everyone. He said if everyone wasn't present in 5 minutes, then they will have to cancel our reservation. The rest of our party arrived with the 5 minutes. Then the host came back to us and said he called us earlier in the day to confirm our reservation, but since we didn't call back to confirm, it was canceled.Why didn't they mention this in the first place? Why give us a hard time about being 10 mins late and not having our entire party there if we did not have a reservation to begin with. I cannot speak for the food but that doesn't matter when customer service is not valued. There are plenty of restaurants in Chicago that have the combination of good food and good service. If you value good service, LOOK FOR ANOTHER RESTAURANT TO EAT.
