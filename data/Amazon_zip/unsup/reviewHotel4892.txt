Beautiful place, lovely room. I am very sensitive to noise, and had none. I thought the staff, if busy, very busy, were very helpful and very nice.  It took a while to check in, with two people constantly answering the phone rather than checking people in. Took a while to get my luggage.  But I would highly recommend this place. NOT your cookie cutter hotel room, European look and feel.
