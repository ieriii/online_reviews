A great place for a date, to hang with friends or just spend a lazy afternoon sipping world class beers in a friendly, laid back, non-pretentious atmosphere. Fantastic selection of imported beers, many on tap, many hard to find. Reasonable prices for what you get. The crowd is very mixed, young/old, business pros and working class. I like that very much. The kitchen doesnt open til 5. it's worth the wait. The menu is seasonal but does always have the fantastic mussels steamed in ale. Served Belgian style with Frites and garlic mayo. Amazing. My wife loves the decadent Morbier, Cashew Butter and Fig Jam grilled sandwich, which is quite remarkable. There is always a veggie offering too. Get there by 6 pm or you will be standing. A classic bistro style bar with the best beer selection ( and some decent wine too) in Chicagoland. I cant recommend this place higher.
