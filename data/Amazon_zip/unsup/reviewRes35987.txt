As a habitually single individual, I rarely go out for brunch. It takes a truly special establishment to coax me into partaking in this traditionally couply custom. Meli's is one such establishment. They have a dizzying array of omelettes, skillets, scrambles, pancakes, and juices. Every Sunday, they offer 8 or 9 specials, usually organized around a theme (chocolate on Halloween, fruits on V-day, and Asian food this morning). Ingredients are all of high quality, and for the most part, portions are voluminous. Rarely have I eaten something here that isn't among the best versions of the dish served in this city. I have to knock off a star because the meat sides are stingy, which make them unorderable for me. Otherwise, Meli's delivers in every imaginable way. Well worth waiting 45 minutes for!
