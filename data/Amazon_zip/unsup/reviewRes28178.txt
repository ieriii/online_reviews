Was fortunate to visit the Morton Grove location. Definitely a hole in the wall pizzeria! Loud music, awesome waiter, awesome food! Had a deep dish pizza - the cheese caramelized to perfection - sweetness of the dough - it made my visit awesome! Looking for Chicago style pizza? Pequod's gets my vote!
