4.5 ? Go here for lunch. (For the price, portion size, and no wait) They give you free sides to start! Pickled cucumbers(I guess that'd just be pickles......lol) and bbq chips! I got the pulled pork sammich which came with a HUGGGGGGE piece of jalapeno something cornbread and pickled ... sliced radishes? Anyway, couldn't finish it so I took it home and heated it up and the cornbread. It somehow tasted 100x better microwaved, lol. Oh, the space is loveeeeely and the service is prompt.
