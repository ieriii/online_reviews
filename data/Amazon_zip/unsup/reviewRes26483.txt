I have some good news and some bad news. First, the bad news: I get cranky when things are disorganized and when I am hungry. These two disasters converged last night before I ended up at Pequod's. A group of 8 of us were supposed to meet at Piece, but due to that giggling whore Alpina from Check Please airing it recently, we couldn't get within 15 feet of the door (I am not stupid; I know we should have had reservations, but they don't allow them for parties under 10, you judgmental cunt). So, to cut to the chase, our friend suggested Pequod's. He said he called and that we could get in, so I tried to calm down (i.e., pounded two beers) after I angered my fiancee by stating that her friends are idiots and that the reservations should have been left in my able hands. We get into to Pequod's and it is fucking PACKED. We can't stand up front, and I got yelled at by some sluttish whore for bumping her at the bar. Seriously, there was no where to go, and we had to wait for 40 minutes. I think this was our friend's fault, but I don't know. Why is it so crowded? Do they over-book or is it just that popular? Now we come to the reason for the 4-stars: the best pizza I think I have ever had. We got a thin crust with hamburger, and two deep dish, one with a lot of veggies and one with pepperoni, mushroom, and onion. FANTASTIC. I nearly shit in my drawers. We really only needed two pizzas. Wonderful crust. The floor manager with the long, gray ponytail is great and friendly, which I admire: I would rather lop off my left nut than work at this sweatshop. SUMMARY: Go on a Tuesday afternoon or something; the quality leads to mind-numbing crowds on weekends. Seriously, I thought I was in a concentration camp.
