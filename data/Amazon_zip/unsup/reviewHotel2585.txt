wha ha ha ha ha ha ha do you have to use the restroom? too bad at victor hotel. what is it, two restrooms for guest AND staff? minor point, but really a bad idea to have the minimum amount of restrooms for a 200+ capacity club [its not against code either] the decor is pedestrian. the design, pastiche. [come on jerry, its getting old, like you - actually he is a very nice person with the most insane kitchen ever] if you really think you are sitting on actual eames and mies chairs you are probably the type of person who dreams of having the vip key with their name engraved on it. [i'll give you the address of the turkish guy who makes them on kinzie-his knock offs are phenom] anyway, living 30 meters away from the place i sometimes go there first when i have guests in town. and when it is less crowded at 8 or 9 pm, the place is great. midnight, screw it.  good looking women galore at the victor, but alas i don't have a penis or else i might give it another star.
