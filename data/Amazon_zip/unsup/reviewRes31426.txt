Chicago Diner merits either 2 or 3 stars in my book- I leaned lower because this place is sooo overhyped! As a longtime vegetarian and a recent Chicagoan, people have been recommending this place to me for a while. Finally got the chance to check it out and I was less than impressed. It's a tight space, which translates into a lot of noise and a lot of hipsters. Tables are small and far too close together, but I guess necessary to fit in all the people who seem to want to grab a bite of unimpressive veggie fare. BF and I split the BBQ 'wings'- strips of lukewarm seitan that don't come close to the fare served at Soul Veg; a wrap that was ok but nowhere near as good as the one at Handlebar; and something else I can't remember, probably because the whole experience was less than memorable. BF loved the hot apple cider and I really dug the cookie dough milkshake. Our server was friendly and helpful, and there is free parking in the back. Overall, though, don't believe the hype. There is far better veggie fare to be had at many Chicago establishments (Soul Veg, Mana, Handlebar, just to name a few...)
