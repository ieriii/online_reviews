When you just got paid and got $ to blow...this is excellent. Had the crab crusted shrimp for appetizer; so good, had to get it twice. I had a Porterhouse, medium, with Parmesean crust. Probably the second best steak I've ever had (first being Primehouse). Had a Very Berry Mojito. A huge fan of mojitos in general, but this? THIS RIGHT HERE? Wow. Tasty as hell. Only complaint (which really isn't) is that I couldn't feel the alcohol in it. It tasted VERY good.
