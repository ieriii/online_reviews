This store has experienced a very steep decline in both food quality and customer service over the last several months. It really is quite a shame as it used to be at the top of Chicago' s high end grocery stores. The bakery in particular has declined dramatically over the last few months. The breads and rolls are frequently overcooked and taste burned, while the pastries frequently seem to be old and stale. In the past, I would have said that Fox and Obel has some of the best breads in the city. This is certainly no longer the case.The cheese and deli counters also have a similar problem of selling items well past their prime. As far as customer service goes, the person behind the cheese desk is usually either vaguely incompetent, or just plain ignorant of what they are selling. At a store that is clearly positioned to be a gourmet destination, this level of quality is really just unacceptable. Hopefully Fox and Obel will be able to turn this slump around, but for now I would HIGHLY recommend avoiding it.
