Be aware that this place gets crazy on the weekends! Not that it stops the good food or the good service. However, there was one time I went with my husband and the waiter was clearly swamped (I had some sympathy). We waited too long for our toast, and then our check, but the waiter brought over for both of us Yolk's two large super tasty hot chocolate. So, I forgave him. :) If you go, go very early or go after 11, when its not so crazy. The food is like upscale diner food: great omelette's, the coffee is actually good, fresh squeezed juice, just overall great and tasty. My last trip I had their eggs Benedict, and I cleaned my plate.
