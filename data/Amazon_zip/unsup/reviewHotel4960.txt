GREAT place to stay. However, we weren't crazy about the $50 overnight parking fee, and the $25 "restocking/cleaning fee" because we placed our (food) leftovers in the refrigerator. I suppose it was our fault, because we didn't read the small sign on the refrigerator, so just a heads up for anyone who stays there.  :-(
