Our first time at this centrally-located boutique hotel. Parking is outragious in Chicago and I only wish we would have known that they valet hybrids for free, since we took FI's car instead of mine. (They are a LEED hotel.) Staff was extremely friendly during our 4 day stay, saying hello and goodbye, offering their services and holding doors. The lobby area is beautiful and a great place to enjoy a glass of wine or cup of coffee. Rooms are very small and if you are a light sleeper, you will wake each time one of your neighbors enters or exits their room. We also found the heat to be really hard to control. It was always too hot or too cold in the room. Barely any closet space and found that our suitcases took over the room because of lack of space to put things. Was warned by several people about my safety here, since a homocide happened over a month ago. I though the location seemed very safe and that the hotel did a great job securing the hotel in the evening hours. We walked almost everywhere and never felt like we were in a shady area. We got this hotel for a great price on PLN ($85 per night!) and for that price thought it was worth it for the location and hospitality. Had we paid more, I probably would have expected more.
