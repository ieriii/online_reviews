I love this place for so many reasons. Not only is the food phenomenal (I especially love the ravioli), but the attention to detail is unparalleled. I had a birthday dinner here, and was surprised to to arrive to find customized menus wishing me happy birthday. How thoughtful! The dining area can be a bit crowded, but it has a nice, intimate feeling. If you sign up to receive emails, you will receive some very zany emails from the chef, which will either leave you laughing or scratching your head. However, the emails will notify you in advance of any special or promotions they are running, which always sound like a great deal.
