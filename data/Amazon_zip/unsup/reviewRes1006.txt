Obviously this review is utterly unnecessary, as everyone in the world is aware of (and currently waiting in line for) these freakishly amazing hot dogs. But for my own sense of completeness, I am here to tell the world HOLY CRAP, these are amazing encased meats. I went on a Monday at 11:30, so the line wasn't so bad. Probably waited about a half hour. All I'll add to the already lengthy commentary is GO WITH A FRIEND OR TWO - the kind that will eat anything and love to split stuff. It is so worth it to try a bunch of sausages. We split 3 between 2 people, plus the large cheese fries. We couldn't even pick a winner, they were all so ridiculously good. Also, wow, Doug is really friendly! I'd be mean if I had to take orders for 5 hours every day, but this guy is genuinely pleasant!
