Oh wow! FRESH FRESH FRESH Stopped in for lunch during the week. Not a lot of people, nice cozy place. First thing you will see is the bar and the dessert area. Going pass the dessert area makes you think, do I even want lunch? ha ha ha... Well then you have the lunch stand. They have salads, sandwiches, pizza (personal). And let me tell you the Salads are so fresh and so tasty! The portion size are perfect and best they have 2 for 1 deals. Plus you have fresh water and the bus boys pick up your plates from your table when you are done. This is so perfect for SUMMER! I will definitely return...
