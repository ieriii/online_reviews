We often head here when craving fresh Vietnamese food. Great value for money, with generous meal sizes and a huge menu selection. My favorite is the grilled pork chop with rice (or on the side with noodle soup), which never fails to satisfy. We always come here hungry, as it is a fairly long train ride from home! I also love the mango and avocado shakes with fresh fruit topping, these are the perfect way to end a big meal. Don't come here if you are looking to be seated straight away or for a quiet, relaxed place to eat. Tank is busy, popular, noisy and at times smoky (due to the kitchen grills)! If you are looking to get a seat sooner rather than later, suggest showing up around 11:30am for lunch on weekends, before the mad rush from 12:00pm onwards.
