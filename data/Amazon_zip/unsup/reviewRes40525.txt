I came here on a Saturday for brunch. The wait time to be seated was around 30 minutes. Not bad. Luckily, they have a large bar area to drink while you wait to be seated. The Bloody Mary w/vodka I ordered was good, but definitely not the best I've had dining in Chicago. The hostess was probably the nicest hostess I've ever had; she even came up to my seat to let me know that the time would be approaching where I will able to get a seat at a dining table. I really liked the decor of this restaurant; decently spacious with an extra room in back. I ordered the Market Scramble which consisted of scrambled eggs, house-made fromage, mushrooms, red peppers on a croissant. I liked that there was an option between potatoes and mixed greens as your side; especially for those of us who are more health conscious. My food was ok. It was good, but I felt like I had to add more salt or hot sauce; the meal was missing something. My companion, on the other hand, raved about her meal. She ordered the crab benedict. We were in disagreement. This place seems like the perfect spot for experimental meat eaters. I've heard people who love the wild boar sloopy joe. As for myself, I'm a recovering vegetarian who just started eating raw fish, so red meat in general, especially boar or deer, is not a favorite. Overall, the place was great, but I don't think I'll be coming back. I feel like I've had better and more satisfying brunches at M.Henry or The Bongo Room.
