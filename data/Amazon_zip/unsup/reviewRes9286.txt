I went to Le Colonial last summer and it turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years.  We made reservations for the balcony and when we got there (on time) they said it would be an hour and a half wait, so we ended up sitting inside. That was annoying but not enough to ruin the experience. However it was almost completely empty upstairs yet they sat us next to a table of obnoxious drunks that were arguing about politics. After about 10 minutes I asked the manager to move us to any one of the vacant tables so he said he'd come by to move us outside in a minute but never came. We sat and ate in misery. After the dinner I talked to the same manager and he apologized that we had a bad experience and then had the nerve to say that next time we dine there we should ask for him personally, as if there would ever be a next time. The food was good, and the waitress was exceptional but it still turned into an experience that I cringe at every time I think about it.
