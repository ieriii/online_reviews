Our initial visit went smoothly. Busy Sunday morning, great hostess who took our number down which then allowed us to go a couple stores down to drink coffee and read until they called us. What a great idea! Not only to promote neighborhood business (they should hook up with the coffee shop to offer a discount) but a nice way to make use of your time as you wait. We ordered the crab cake brunch dish (forgot the exact name) and the corned beef omelette. The crab cake was yummy, but what made that dish Fantastic was the Potato pancake! I don't know what they put in their but the flavors just melted in your mouth. Our second visit was what led me to give this place 3 stars. Same process of waiting for a table, but this time a different hostess. It was President's day, so I'm guessing this guy was not your normal hostess. He had a white apron on and a hat, so I'm assuming he was a cook in the kitchen, who was relocated to greet guests. I gave him my cell number to call when our table was ready. Considering that a long line started to form inside we offered to wait outside until I received his call. He told me I was the next 2 top. We waited and waited. Finally my friend suggested we check on the table considering a considerable amount of people have left. I walked in and he welcomed me as if he hadn't seen me the first time. Everyone behind us in line was already seated! I reminded him of our interaction earlier and pointed my name on his clipboard. I was glad that there were available tables at that time because between my hunger and my annoyance, I think I would have just left. Regardless we had the crab cake as an appetizer, this time it was ok. It really must have been that potato pancake. My friend had the Jambalaya and I had the house special lobster mac & cheese, which was also ok. I didn't realize that it was on DDD until after our initial visit, so it is a must try considering that Guy visited it. I'm not sure if I would suggest going back a 3rd time.
