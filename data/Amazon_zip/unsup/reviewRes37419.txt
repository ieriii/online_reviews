Yet another otherwise great place that is just basically not an option because of the lunatic scramble to get there ever earlier in order to secure a comfortable experience. I'm sorry, but I have better things to do than go to a bar at 530 in the evening just so I'm not rammed up against a wall by the back of someone's chair or four people deep away from the bar. The tragedy is that I live in the neighborhood, it should be my sweet go to. UPDATE: OK. So I really actually do like this place a lot when I can get it, which I've done plenty of times lately now that I am old and prefer having early drinking affairs to late ones. Their back patio is a perfect place to spend the waning hours of a summer afternoon, and their menu is of course unassailable.
