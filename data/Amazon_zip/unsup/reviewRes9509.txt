At some point toward the end of my meal at Sprout I actually told my companions, "This dinner makes me regret all the other 5 star reviews I've ever given other restaurants on Yelp." That statement still stands. My dinner here is one of the top 3 meals of my life and was absolutely perfect from beginning to end. 1. Service: Perfect! The right mix of attentive and unobtrusive. Great attitude and a fun guy. 2. Atmosphere: Perfect! Classy but not showy. Didn't even notice the noise level. 3. Wine selection: Perfect! I can't remember what we drank, to be honest, but it was good and it was less than $50 a bottle. 4. First course: Perfect! My licorice salad is kind of hard to explain but it was divine. 5. Intermezzo: Perfect! Shave ice - just like home. 6. Second course: Perfect! That braised short rib looks like hell in photos but tastes like heaven. Among the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Ahem. Bonus: Perfect! Check in on FourSquare and get a free glass of champagne. 7. Amuse bouche (is that what you call it?): Perfect! A deconstructed grilled cheese sandwich with hard apple cider. 8. Dessert: Perfect! Who knew that beets and dark chocolate would make such a wonderful pairing? I may have screwed up the order on these but believe you me that for $60 a person you can't do any better (especially for those used to food prices in Hawaii). However, even if they were to raise prices 50% it would still be well worth it. Go, just go. You won't regret it.
