I've been to Bongo Room numerous times for brunch and have always loved it, but today's visit knocked it out of the park. I am a fan of sweets for breakfasts (actually sweets anytime, who am I kidding), and Bongo brings it with the caramel pretzel pancakes, chocolate tower French toast and banana Oreo hotcakes. If you want to try multiple types, you can ask for a "tasting" (one monstrous pancake instead of the standard 3). My husband is also a huge fan of spicy/savory breakfast and he loved the chorizo-avocado omelette (almost as good as Over Easy's sassy eggs, if you can believe it). The only reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is the wait, but it's worth it. Ask for their delicious Intelligentsia coffee to nurse while you stand out on Milwaukee Ave and people watch for a half hour. Thanks Bongo Room - seeya next time!
