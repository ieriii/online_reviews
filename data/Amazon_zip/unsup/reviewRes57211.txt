Crazy awesome. I've been here four times and each visit is just as great. Service is great and the food is killer. I'd like to note that the cuisine is a modern take on classics. On that note, I want to point out that the Puerto Rican rice is not authentic. The taste and texture isn't close. I know because I was born and raised boricua.Other than that, spectacular.
