Hot Doug's is everything a local eatery should be. Great food, friendly service, and a quirky, fun atmosphere. The wait will be long. There's pretty much no getting around that. But it's a product of a place that refuses to expand or change and lose what makes it great. And trust me, the food is worth it. Don't expect much in the way of your standard hot dog. These are specialty dogs that will completely change the way you view encased meats.
