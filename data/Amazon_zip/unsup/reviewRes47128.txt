I live closer to the other UG, but decided to venture up to this one for brunch on Saturday to see what it was like. I loved it! The service was much, much better than the one on Clark and the atmosphere was cozier. I love the art on the wall and I can't wait to come back for a drink in their cute bar area. Oh yeah, and I'll definitely be back to hear some live music. Overall a great experience.
