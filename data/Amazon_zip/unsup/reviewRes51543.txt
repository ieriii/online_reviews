OMG! So freaking good. I'm SO glad I live in Uptown now, because I get to be closer to this fantastic place. The veggie items are delicious! I love a Mexican place that has good rice and beans - it's so basic but it makes the whole dish. The chips and salsa are fresh and tasty. MARGARITAS - amazing. You really don't need more than one :) Simply GREAT food and drinks that are VERY INEXPENSIVE! Love.
