This place is right down the block from me, and I remember one of my roommates RAVING about this place as soon as we moved in this past summer. Granted, it took me a surprisingly long time to meander down there myself...like, four months. Haaa. (So I'm a little slow...)It's a great place for breakfast or brunch! There are so many things to choose from for breakfast that it made our heads spin.The portions are huge! The prices are great . The waitress checked up on us several times. Simply Great place ! Thanks
