man...do i love good vegan food that is designed to replace and draw inspiration from traditional meat comfort foods. and man does the chicago diner deliver in spades. here is what i had - 1. peanut butter "milkshake" 2. "wings" with vegan ranch dressing 3. the "dagwood" sandwich - a concoction with fake roast beef, pepperoncinis, cheeze and other toppings everything was amazing. i mean incredibly tasty. the wings were honestly better than anything made with chicken. honestly, wings are all about the sauce anyway. and the vegan ranch was tremendous. the dagwood was incredible too, and while the milkshake didn't quite live up to cafe blossom's in nyc, that's kinda like saying derek jeter doesn't live up to albert pujols. what makes it five stars though is how knowledgeable and passionate about the menu our server liz was. neither my buddy and i could decide on multiple items and she talked us through the whole menu. now THAT makes my vegan tummy happy. i'll be back here.
