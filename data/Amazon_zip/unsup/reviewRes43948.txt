Kudos to the chef, the meal was delicious. Rib eye was mouth watering and the risotto appetizer was amazing. Service was ok, waiter was only around a few times - could be good considering what other yelpers have mentioned that it's a place to do business and prefer the wait staff to be away, however I would have liked someone to come by to refill my glass more often. The guy that cleared the table should probably be a little more refined for an establishment. He moved my water glass with his hand cusping the mouth (something I personally didn't enjoy watching- hygiene!!) Overall, good place for some good steak.
