Awesome Italian. I've been here a couple of times, and it is a nearly perfect experience. The portions are beyond huge, though, so consider sharing.  We started with the fried calamari-- very tender pieces with light and crisp breading. Just perfect. We also tried the two daily specials-- the gnocchi romantica with chicken and mushrooms and a homemade rigatoni with smoked mozzarella and prosciutto. They were both delicious and fresh tasting. I was worried the smokiness of the mozzarella might overwhelm the rigatoni dish, but it was perfectly in balance.  Even though we were pretty full, we couldn't help but order dessert when our waitress described their bread pudding as "heartwarming." She was so right. It's covered in both chocolate and raspberry sauces, and it really does warm your heart.
