I really liked this place! My dude and I came here on a rainy Sunday afternoon on a whim, and I have to say it made the rest of that rainy afternoon extremely tolerable. Or was it the champagne that did that? The food is rich and can be a bit pricey, but the milk braised pork shoulder was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. To make a point of how well it was cooked, my boyfriend ate it with a spoon (yes, I think the champagne may have gone to our heads by that point.) The seating at the restuarant ranges from private 4-seat tables to sharing large (read: seats 14) high boys with your fellow patrons, which is a great way to meet people. The couple sitting kitty corner from us ordered the bone marrow, which they insisted we order as well. While I don't think I'm a huge fan of bone marrow, I was glad we tried it! They also have a lovely selection of cheeses and really good wines (did I mention the champagne?). Chicagoans- if you're looking for a place downtown to take your visiting parents or in-laws, this is the place! It's not a chain (it's owned by three well-renown Chicagoy chefs), and it's hip and cool without being too young. Visitors- if you're looking for a special treat downtown and don't mind dropping some coin, I highly recommend it. Again, it's not a chain, so I feel like you can get a great Chicago gastronomic experience.
