Too bad I can't wish this place out of existence... Yes, it's that serious. Marvelous Chocolate was not appeased or even relieved hunger. Satiated? Sated? On a scale of 1-10? ZERO, ZERO. I ordered the Caesar salad from the UNREMARKABLE, BORING menu, which PERVERTED all my comfort foods in the guise of ethnic & literary masquerading. Sorry, if you think being "authentically Irish" means GRILLING SALAD, you do NOT understand the SCIENCE of WILTING or what it means to be Irish. And if you understood authentic, you'd F-ing put some anchovies in your G-damn Caesar dressing, Bitches. Oh, and I thought it was lame AND GROSS that Wilde will not let customers special order a g-damn omelet since they're PRE-MADE!@!!! That's right, Wilde isn't wild about cooking. Apparently cooking eggs on demand is too much. Perhaps I should visit a drive through for fresher fare! There isn't a potato famine so you don't have to eat here.
