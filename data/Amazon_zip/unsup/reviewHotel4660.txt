I will start out by saying what I liked about this hotel. The room was cheap, location pretty good and the staff is very friendly. The staff was almost too friendly. Also, if you end up drinking the water in the room, it's only $2.50 and has an eco-friendly bottle. The most annoying thing I found in my room was the bed. It's lifted on this big and bulky wood thing so you can have drawers underneath. The corner of this bed frame closest to the window is a nightmare. I can't tell you how many times I banged my knee into that thing. I spent many a time biting my tongue after one of those impacts. The sinks are ridic. It's like someone decided they wanted a hotel built very quickly and went to find some chic wholesale sinks and got a deal on these crappy ones. FYI, you will touch the sink basin while washing your hands. You have better options if you want a boutique hotel in Chicago. I'd try the Talbot or the Dana...
