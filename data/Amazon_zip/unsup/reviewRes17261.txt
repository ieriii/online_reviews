On a recent trip back to Chicago I decided it would be fun to have dinner in my old neighborhood and a friend recommended Carnivale. What a wonderful suggestion...I thought the food, service and decor was great! I had the best NY Strip Steak I have had in a long time. Oh I miss Chicago and all the incredible food!
