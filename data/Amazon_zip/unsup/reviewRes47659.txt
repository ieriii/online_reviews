After hanging out at the Gold Coast Art Fair Ryan & I decided to head up to the roof to enjoy a nice cold beverage & a mid-afternoon snack. The hostess was unbelievably cute & sweet, which I was not expecting. So hats off to her! We went upstairs & it was pretty much empty besides the few random couples who obviously had too much to drink the night before & could only make themselves feel better with their uber expensive bloody mary's. Damn, go somewhere that has a deal if you wanna drink that many! I liked that there were many options of seating-tables, bar, benches, booths & the "natural" feel with the AstroTurf flooring. Anyway, Ryan had an iced tea & I had a lemonade (way too sweet!). We ordered the chicken samosas & Ryan got 2 sliders. Even though the wait for our food was a bit too long I did not mind once I took my first bite into the samosa. Mmm, so warm & crispy & filled with Indian deliciousness. It came with a sweet soy sauce & yogurt sauce for dipping. I preferred the yogurt sauce & am not ashamed I kinda...no, I definitely did...eat some of it plain with my fork. Whoops! Ryan's sliders were good. He had a beef slider that had crispy onions & a pickle on it. The beef was super tender & kind of fell apart, but hey it was good & I stole a bite or two. He also had a sausage slider, which wasn't too my liking (too sweet again!), but he raved about the high quality of sausage. Didn't know my manfriend was such a...sausage expert. Um, ew! Anyway, I enjoy other rooftop patios much more than this one but it wasn't bad for a lazy afternoon!
