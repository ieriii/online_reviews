Sapori is a cozy spot with excellent food and service; I recommend it. It appears to be a tiny little restaurant but it is secretly much larger. There are additional rooms in the back and upstairs that are excellent for large parties. Making a reservation for a Friday night was simple and the restaurant was busy but not packed. Our waiter was very polite and kind, not pushy. I order the rigatoni caprese, and it was delicious. I also tried the gnocchi which was very good too. They have a nice wine list and serve fresh bread before the meal. Everything was delicious but slightly overpriced. I paid $20 for a pasta dish that probably should have only cost $15 in my opinion. I will go back, and Sapori is definitely worth a visit.
