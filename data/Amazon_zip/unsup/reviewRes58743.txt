Love everything about this place. Let's start with the bar since that's what you see when you first walk in. The mixologis , Lynn House, I would marry her. She's professional, knowledgeable and pleasant as can be, with just enough attitude to keep the evening entertaining. She's also trained her staff so they are capable. You're comfortable just grabbing a drink or sitting at the bar for dinner.Now the main dining room. Graham is awesome. Food is so fantastic and also imaginative. Menu changes regularly with the seasons, which many places claim to do but really don't. Staff is approachable, knowledgeable and not pretentious at all. Some high end places, the people have NO clue what they are serving but act like they are offended when you ask. You won't find that here. They seem to love what they do here, love the food and love talking about it. After putting Avenues at the Peninsula on the map, Graham leaves and creates something accessible to the masses. Gotta love him for that.
