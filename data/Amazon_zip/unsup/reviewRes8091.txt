This is the kind of pizza I dream about. I love the chewy crust, fresh toppings, and the amazing buffalo mozzarella. I have absolutely no suggestions on making these pizzas better. Sure, maybe they're a little pricey, but the quality is excellent-- plus, if you get an appetizer, you can easily split one. And you totally should get an appetizer-- the prosciutto and mozzarella and caprese salad are both great (once again, it's that amazing buffalo mozzarella). I've also had the mussels, and while the broth is absolutely perfect (as in I asked for two extra bread baskets, just to sop it all up), the mussels themselves are kind of scrawny.  If you have room for dessert, the gelato is great-- I was disappointed that they ran out of the special banana flavor last time I was there, but the hazelnut was wonderful. This place is worth the wait every time.
