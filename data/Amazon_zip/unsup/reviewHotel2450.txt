Whenever I have the opportunity to recommend a hotel to anyone, I always give them the Hilton as my first choice. All the history behind this place, combined with the comfort and overpowering amenities make it a great place to stay. The bars downstairs are great, and the food in the restaurants are above standard for hotel food for sure. There is also a lounge area next to the check-in desk as you would find in most hotel lobbies, but they do an exceptional job of keeping in mind that this is a classy place. The only downfall is that it's a little far south if you're coming here soley to shop. If you're going for comfort and convenience to the loop, you are crazy if you don't consider booking.
