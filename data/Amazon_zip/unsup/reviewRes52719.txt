This is a typical Brazillian steakhouse. There were a good amount of cuts and the service was good, but I didn't think it was anything spectacular that would make me want to come back again. The salad bar was OK. Not anything extraordinary, but expect the usual - different types of veggies to make your salad, some sushi, oysters, and other toppings that does not cost too much to provide. They also had warm dishes that will DEFINITELY fill you up if you have a plateful. Make sure you don't stuff yourself with the pastas or rice dishes they provide because it will definitely fill you up before you even get your meat cuts. My favorite meat was the ribs and shrimp. The filet mignon was good, but that is about it. I would just say this is very average, but very costly. We went with a coupon for 2 for 1. I don't think we would've come here if we didn't have the coupon. My boyfriend had dinner at Fogo De Chao before. He definitely recommends that place over this one.
