Friendly staff, clean rooms, but no free wi-fi! $9.99/24hrs and the quality was bad at that. Signal, no signal, signal...  Room service always efficient and friendly. Breakfast average. Air conditioner broke twice, owner apologetic. Not our choice Chicago hotel, but it's in our timeshare network so we make do.
