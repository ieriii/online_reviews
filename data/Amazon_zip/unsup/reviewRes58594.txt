My wife and I and our two kids went on a Saturday night for my birthday dinner. No problem getting seated quite soon after our reservation time. Unquestionably a very vibrant, cool restaurant, but we come from the sticks so what do we know? Rather than ordering entrees we decided to order lots of appetizers and such and share everything. Here's the run-down on the dishes:trio-of-cheeses: we ordered a rosemary Manchego, an aged cow/goat/sheep cheese, and a fresh goat cheese; all were outstanding, and the crisp, almonds, and honey that accompanied them were nice additionschorizo: very good, but so intensely flavored as to largely blot out the flavors of anything eaten with or soon after itdrinks: not the best ever for their varieties, but very good, with lots of fun choices; kids had mango/passion-fruit aqua frescas that they really likedshrimp ceviche: probably the biggest disappointment; not bad, at all, but just not at all what I think of as ceviche; it was more like cooked shrimp served with a very tasty cocktail sauce; I expected shrimp that had actually been cooked in an intensely citrus-y liquid -- but maybe that's just a ceviche cliche'?duck sopes: very tasty, in a kind of dark, slightly evil sort of way; couldn't really tell the purported faux gras was there, but maybe it just blended in...fried yuca with *lots* of garlic: none of us had ever had yuca before, and it was really good; one or two of the pieces were a little tough, but most were delightfully crunchy and seriously salty/garlicky -- yum!arepa: delicious corn cakes, very flavorful filling including crunchy pickled jicima; only problem was it was difficult to cut up to share; the avacado and chile sauces it comes garnished with were excellentempanada: probably my favorite thing of the night -- other than a cheese, the only thing we ordered another of; I've made empanadas at home from Penelope Casas' tapas cookbook and these were quite reminiscent of those flavors, though in a more intense restaurant-y way; the lime crema garnish was probably one of the best single flavors of the entire eveningrice & beans: like a fairly intense dirty rice; as a side, would actually have been nice to have it a little blander; very tasty as a not-so-side dish, thoughdesserts: the off-the-menu desserts are huge -- beware; neither kid could finish their chocolate cake and ice cream (although it was extremely good); my wife got the market special, which was a Meyer lemon pie; it was good, but not as in-your-face lemony as you'd expect something with that title to be -- and it was way too big; they brought me (see below, though) a free birthday dessert that was described as being a flourless chocolate toffee cake but was really more like the sort of dark, dense, moist, gingery cakes/puddings you see some place in the Caribbean; it was pretty good, but I'm not sure it was exactly what I was in the mood forservice: we were slightly apprehensive about the service based on some of the reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere, but for most of the meal it was very good; attentive without being annoying, no undue waiting, food came out promptly, etc.; then, for reasons that remain a mystery, at the very end it went completely off the rails: I had agreed to have the birthday dessert, and had ordered an espresso to go with it, and everyone else ordered their desserts; after a reasonable amount of time everyone's dessert but mine (Mr. Birthday) showed up; wait... wait... wait... ; we ask the waiter, he says it's coming right behind me!; wait... wait... ; finally it shows up, after everyone else is pretty much done with theirs; no espresso, everOverall, we had a great time and great food; next time we'll try some of the entrees.
