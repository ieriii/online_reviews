i don't even like pizza very much. but i like Piece. which is good, since my friends want to drag me there all the time (they're obsessed. seriously.) the thin-crust is good stuff. also, i like some of their brews, particularly the Worryin' Ale and the Dysfunctionale.  and, umm....karaoke. thursdays. stass. he dedicated a song to me once, and my friends made me leave before i got to hear it. i've never quite forgiven them for it.
