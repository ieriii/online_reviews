I'm pretty picky about my pizza and since everyone had said this was one of the better spots my expectations were maybe a little too high. I actually enjoyed the homemade beer better than the pizza (I had the english style ale). I ordered my own small pepperoni, but ordered it extra crispy. The crust was somewhat crispy at the edges, but pretty flimsy everywhere else. Considering there weren't' any other toppings to weigh it down, I wasn't too impressed. The pepperoni and sauce were good, just wish the crust was a little crispier...
