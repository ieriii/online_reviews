love big jones but agree with the guy who said it is a little schezophrenic. have been 3 or 4 times. each time the menu was a little different. went on the 2nd week it opened then a few other times both for lunch and dinner. it's as if they can't quite decide what they are going to be. the decor is like a trendy lincoln park place with a classy, sleek look. great plates, flatware, glassware. service good, great cosmos, which is one of my criteria for a good experience. food consistantly good but could use a touch more new orleans flavor cuz that seems to be what they are trying to be. my only beef was the ladies room, which was a bit like a bathroom in a gas station. I mentioned it the very first time I was there and one of the owners seemed to appreciate the comment. when back a few months later, not only was bathroom still a little gross, but I ripped my shirt on a nail sticking out of the stall door frame. again mentioned it to the other owner and he gave us a $25 gift certificate. I was not looking for a free-bee by complaining. I really like their food and want them to succeed in andersonville. there is a lot of compation with restaurants on clark st. and a sub-par bathroom simply won't cut it. the owner thanked me for coming to him rather than posting it on yelp, which i thought was interesting. if I wouldn't say it in person, I wouldn't say it on yelp, but that's just me! will go back soon and hope the bathroom situation has improved. then it would be 5 stars!
