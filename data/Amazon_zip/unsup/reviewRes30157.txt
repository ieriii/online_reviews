This is a neighborhood gem in goldcoast, Chicago. A quaint cozy non pretenious environment,. Food is delicious - The pancakes are consistently well made - good texture that doesn't flake off when you lift it off the plate. This place is also known for its bacons. The crowds ranges from students to professionals, young couples with babies/kids, visitors and the elderly, a good cross section of neighborhood. Also - there is a newly introduced flat thin noodle soup special as of a few weeks ago - a size good for a meal itself - tasty and rich - was told it's a chef's special on certain nights and is not yet on the standard menu - hope it made it to the standard menu. There're also an ever changing array of photography and artwork display on the walls for sale. If you plan on working over your lap top ...go sit by the window - you maybe able to tab into some unsecured internet connection from the residence above...but there're limited duplex outlet on the wall. wish they'd build in more outlets on the walls throughout the main and secondary dinning area.- it makes good hangout place to work on projects during downtime.
