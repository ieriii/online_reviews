I took my boyfriend to Big Jones for his birthday last weekend and we had an incredible, delicious, lovely meal. Start to finish, every drink and dish was delicious, and our waitress was incredibly attentive and thoughtful. Thumbs up to the soundtrack in the background, the incredible cocktails (like the Sazerac), the black-eyed pea cakes, crab cakes, and holy sugarcubes, the desserts. Absolutely my new favorite restaurant, and I'm dying to try breakfast there sometime soon. I was so happy with our evening there that I wrote a glowing review on Chicago Metblog. (Don't know if I can post links here, but I didn't want to just cut-and-paste the whole thing.) http://chicago.metblogs.
