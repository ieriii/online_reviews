My group at work stumbled into Mastro's looking for more drinks after a booze-filled meal at Frontera...Mastro's did not disappoint. We sat right by the front next to the piano, where we were serenaded by beautiful voices. I apologize on behalf of my boss, who was drunkenly requesting songs at the top of his lungs. One con is the number of...older and wiser folk here. Being hit on by a 65 year old named Randy was definitely a highlight of the night.
