Sorry, but if this is what Chicago deep dish pizza is supposed to be, then I don't like it - and I eat anything and everything. We had a small cheese. The crust was so dry I couldn't eat it. We also had the buffalo wings and chicken parmesan sandwich. The wings were soggy and the sandwich was mediocre. The best thing were the fries. Sorry, but I would not go back here - and now I really don't think I like Chicago deep dish pizza :(
