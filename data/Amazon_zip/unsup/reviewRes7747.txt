I am giving this place a 1 star only because I can not give them 0. Don't get me wrong, the food is ok. But that is where the extent of their greatness ends. The have by far the worst service that I have ever experienced. The waiters service while at the restuarant was sub-par at best and he was not bright enough to figure out a simple transaction between three credit cards. It has been 3 months since I have been there and I am still disputing 2 incorrect charges to my credit card that they charged. And on top of it, they are lying to my bank and sending false documents to claim their money. To give you the reader, a quick background, my total bill was only supposed to be $44, however I was charged $132 more than that. After disputing the incorrect charges with my bank they sent false documents that I did not sign to claim that I was supposed to be charged that amount. Truth is, the docuement they sent to my bank was signed by another person in my party as was not for my card. On top of all of this, when I first called this restuarant the night of me visiting after I noticed the incorrect charge, they achknowledged the incorrect charge and promised to send me a gift card for 1 free dinner because of the error, and I have still not received this, after 3 months! This place is a hoax and will try to steal your money, it is not worth the pain and hassel.. Try one of the hundreds of better italian resuarants that are in Chicago.
