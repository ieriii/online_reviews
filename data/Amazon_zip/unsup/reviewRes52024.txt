I want to cry just thinking about the crust on this pizza. The crust that MAKES the pizza the edibly magical treat that it is. It's the pinch of corn meal that's lovingly beaten into the dough that adds just the right amount of CRUNCH to every delicious bite. It's the pie sized sausage patty baked perfectly into a bed of sauce and cheese that fulfills a carnivore's need to bite into a nice thick chunk of meat. Rawr. It's the great feel of a good ol' windy city pizza parlor that makes me say... best deep dish pizza. Ever. Dare I say... best pizza I've ever had. YES, a very bold statement from a bonafied pizza enthusiast.
