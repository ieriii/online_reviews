Went last friday around 11 and there was still a long line despite the rain. Troopers! First thing I noticed was that the menu changed. The names changed and the prices went up. I'm glad they raised their prices though because I am more than happy to spend more on establishments that really care about their job. Is Hot Doug's BYOB and I never knew about it? I saw a man come in with a bottle of red and glasses and he poured everyone at the kitchen a glass before settling down by himself with the rest of the bottle and a book. If it is BYOB I would be thrilled to bring a PBR next time to enjoy with my dogs.
