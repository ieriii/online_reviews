All good things Cuban here. Friendly staff. A warm atmosphere (the all-weather patio helps as does a cozy gas fireplace). Delicious food. Just remember to bring your own booze (preferably rum and they'll make you some delicious mojitos). Of course the plantains were delicious (I don't think I've ever had bad plantains) but I LOVED the Masas de Puerca - pork medallions marinated overnight and then flash fried before serving. The traditional Ropa Vieja (traditional shredded beef) was also very good as was the rice mixed with black beans and pork (or bacon) couldn't tell but I certainly enjoyed it! I would definitely recommend 90 Miles for groups. Sitting in the all weather patio or outside enjoying the sun - it's a win win!
