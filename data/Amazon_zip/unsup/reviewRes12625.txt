Came here on a Sunday night to use up our Groupon. Even thought it was 8:00pm, there was still at 20 minute wait, which wasn't a problem as my husband I and promptly sat ourselves at the bar. He had a mojito, and while he's not connoisseur, as it seems some on here are, he really liked it. Said it was one of the best he ever had (and he drank a lot of mojitos on our Miami vacation). Once we were sat, we were promptly greeted and we ordered the tamal cubano appetizer, which was delicious as we both love polenta anything. I had the special scallops entree, which was pretty good and came with a BBQ-ish sauce, but nothing crazy special. My husband had the Ropa Vieja and really liked it. I took a few bites and it was very good. Service and atmosphere were both above average and we had a great time. My only criticism is there were out of a lot of their desserts, many of which we were interested in and had to go elsewhere to get our sweet on.
