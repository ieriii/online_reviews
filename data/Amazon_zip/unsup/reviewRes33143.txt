So, I went here on my birthday yesterday. The first thing that stood out was the fact that the interior was actually larger than I thought it was. I drove by so many times and always thought it was going to be this hole-in-the-wall tiny eatery, when in fact it was quite large with seating for 30+ and very well decorated inside. Once we sat down, however, things got awkward. The wait staff seemed aloof or just a little out of the loop - we definitely got there early, but that doesn't mean we don't expect some level of service. The following conversation with the waitress went as thus: (after the waitress handed out the menus, we were kind of just waiting for a few seconds) Me: "So ... " Her: (blank stare) Me: (blank stare right back at ya) Her: "Oh would you like something to drink?" I love socially awkward situations as much as the next guy, but usually when they happen to other people. Thankfully, after this little encounter, the rest of the night was okay. I do think they were a little understaffed or that the place needed to train their waitstaff a bit better, but overall the service was good. The owner was very hands on, which I'm a fan of, and I think he could get away with it since it was a smaller operation. Plus, he gave my table drinks on the house!
