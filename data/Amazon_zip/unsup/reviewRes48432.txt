Definitely a great gastropub to hang out with great friends for the atmosphere and the beers. The beer/wine selection was extensive. The ambiance was festive, the service attentive. The food selections were pricey and tiny but mostly good. Be ready to sit very close to your neighbors since the chairs are all placed very close one another but very nice decor. Since the only reservation slot available for that Friday was 10 pm (I called at 4pm) and we didn't want to wait until 10, we took a chance venturing out there sans reservations and totally lucked out by snagging 2 of the 5 remaining first-come-first-serve bar seats at 6 pm with no wait.... within minutes of our arrival, every one of the 9 seats at the bar would be occupied, at least for the next 40 minutes.  We had the following.. Trappistes Rochefort Belgian Ale ($13) - goes very well with bar food. Very tasty. Chef selection of 6 oysters ($15) - 3 west coast and 3 east coast oysters. Tasty but not exceptional. Spicy pork rinds ($5) - super light, very little grease, excellent texture, taste and flavorings. Charcuterie plate ($21) - featuring pork pie, pork-foie gras terrine (excellent), coffee cured pancetta, morteau sausage (very tasty), pickles & mustards were all good. However, I was not a fan of that lardo on bread since it was just fat and bread. Yuck. Pork belly ($21) - did not impress and was way overrated. Just a piece of not-very-tender-pork. Very plain and very average. I'm used to tender, melt-in-your-mouth, expertly seasoned Kurobota pork bellies or even pork prepared in ethnic restaurants. So I'd say just pass on the Pork Belly at The Publican. Overall, great experience!
