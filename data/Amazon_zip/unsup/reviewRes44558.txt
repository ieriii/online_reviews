Alliance Bakery is an important establishment: they have a creepy neon sign outside the main entryway. It's one of the few vestiges of how great this neighborhood was before the Lincoln Park kids took it over. The coffee is good, the food excellent. I consider it as crucial to my boyfriend and I getting together (along with The Coffee Studio up in Andersonville). And I credit it with the consumption of thousands of unnecessary yet utterly worthwhile calories from the likes of their cupcakes, almond croissants, cookies and who knows what else. In the weeks following Blago's indictment, Blago cookies appeared, replete with insane frosting hairdos. Let me explain how this place is set up. You go into the tiny, closet-sized bakery, ogle their goodies, and get your food/coffee (which is all good, I promise). Then, if you're nerdy like me and the bf, you exit, take three steps to the right, and re-enter the building through another door to a room that is a bit grubby and filled with tables and chairs and.... grad students!!!! It's silent as a tomb in there. Then you hang out for the rest of the day, studying and eating cupcakes and trying to look as cute as everyone else who comes to this place. So go to Alliance Bakery! Support what's left of once-cool Wicker Park/Bucktown! And Blago too, of course.
