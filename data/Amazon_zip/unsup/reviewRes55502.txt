This is one of the best Italian restaurants in the City. The wait is well worth it when you taste the food and experience the great service. The atmosphere is upbeat and the outdoor seating is great in the summer. pasta dishes were fresh and homeade, pizza is very tasty. I have visited piccolo many times and would reccommend it to anyone looking for a great experience!
