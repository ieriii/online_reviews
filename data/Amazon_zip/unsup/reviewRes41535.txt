A restaurant week winner!! After it's all said and done, Ruth Chris' was THE best menu I had for restaurant week which makes me confident that I want to check them out as a regular. 1. Lobster bisque and House Salad - both delicious but the bisque was superb 2. Didn't try the chicken. Filet mignon was good but could use less salt. 12 oz Ribeye was delicious! Very well seasoned and beats the Filet hands down! Salmon was also very good... it came with scallops on top as a dressing. Nice touch! Sides: The mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were delicious! Sauteed mushrooms were good too but nothing to write home about. 3. Desserts: Bread pudding was a little heavy on the alcohol for my taste but it was still delicious. Chocolate mousse cheesecake - good mousse but unnecessary whipped cream All in all, great value for your buck (everyone was stuffed!) AND excellent service. We rolled in with a large party 1 hour before closing and they didn't give us any glares or whatever you would expect from some other restaurants. And they pleasantly rearranged seating to add people to our party as last minuters showed up too. 22 people! I didn't give it 5 stars only because I still think Gibson's steaks are better but Ruth Chris is still very good.
