Delicious and dependable. Went here on a Monday night after work and was surpised at how packed the place was! Our servers were attentive and helpful. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to start, including the flaming cheese, Tirokafteri (spicy feta cheese spread), Cold Octopus Salad (SO GOOD, great texture - not chewy), and Skordalia, this cold garlicky mashed potato concoction. Everything was great. For the main course, although I was already stuffed, I ordered the sea bass. It's a whole fish, but they can de-bone and fillet it for you. The portion is large, but very yummy. With the side of vegis, it was a light and very healthy meal. The lamb dish, arni fournou, got rave reviews at our table, as well as the swordfish kebobs.
