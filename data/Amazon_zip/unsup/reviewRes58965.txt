Brussel Sprout Salad. Holy moly was it good. Seriously. So was everything they placed in front of us. Soft-shell crab, "lemongrass lollipops," and a specialty maki with lobster and bacon called a crispy pig or something like that. Crazy good.It's pretty loud and a lot hipper than me. But good food and not nearly as pricy as I thought it would be. 4 adults with drinks and a shared desert plus 20%+ tip for $200.
