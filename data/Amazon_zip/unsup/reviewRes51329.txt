Had a wonderful time with my partner and our friends on Saturday evening. The service was awesome and the food was excellent. Even though it was very busy, we were seated within a very short period of time. Our waitress was very attentive. I have never had a bad experience at Garcia's. I will say, that it can be a litte on the noisey side, but when you receive good service and excellent food, this can be easily over looked. I will definitely be back.
