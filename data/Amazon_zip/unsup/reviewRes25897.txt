my now fiance made reservations to this place as our dinner before he proposed. The atmosphere is dark and great but damn it took the server so long to get to us! I was about to get up and ask the hostess if we had a server when he came to us! Other than that we got the chef's choice and each plate served to us with so rich with flavor, butter, and fat!! So good! Not each dish was a hit and if you not a fan of fatty, salty, and MEATY food then this is not your place!
