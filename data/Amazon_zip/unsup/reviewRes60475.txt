I had high hopes for Atneprima after reading the other great reviews but it fell far short of my expectations. I started with the veal meatballs. they were good, not great. My boyrfriend started with the polenta. It was ok, but we both thought it was too salty.We both ordered pasta for our main course. I had the pesto with clams which was way too salty...the salt completely over powered the pesto. The pasta itself was fresh and could have been great if paired with a better sauce.My boyfriend had the fava bean ravioli. I like it much better than my dish but it was nothing special.The best part of the meal was the wine. Great selection and the by-the-glass servings are huge!
