I am generally supportive of R. J. Grunt's, but a late visit last night did not work. This restaurant advertises late hours, and I've visited the restaurant during them. Yet it was not the case last night, when we were told the restaurant was closed, and it was not even 11:30 p.m. Some sites list the closing at midnight, others at 2:00 a.m., but whatever it is, I felt as though I caught R. J. Grunt's at the _wrong_ time. So, after a performance, it's off my list of places to visit. I'll just stay at the opera house -- at least Lyric Opera of Chicago stays open after performances. So far....
