Beautiful interior decorating, located downtown only a few blocks away from millennium park and TONS of shopping and eating. walking distance to an all-stops train stop, so it's super convenient if you need to get somewhere else in the city. the staff was fairly friendly and helpful and there is a nice bar/restaurant downstairs.fair warning (as with most semi-expensive hotels), nothing is free. Valets are waiting for you as soon as you pull up to the hotel, but the parking is about 50 dollars a day.overall it's a nice hotel, but the last 2 days of our trip my friends and i stayed at a travelodge which was actually closer to the park, to the train stops, about twice as large and much much much cheaper.
