What to say about The Publican that hasn't been said before. Lets see? The guy that greeted me at the door told me that it used to be a sausage factory, then a basketball court for the people living upstairs. Thats kinda cool. The food, brilliant. The beer selection, interesting. The staff, helpful and friendly. The volume in the place, epic. At one point my dinner companion looked at me across the huge, family sized table and yelled, "I can't hear a damn thing you're saying." Prepare yourself for that and a really enjoyable dining experience.
