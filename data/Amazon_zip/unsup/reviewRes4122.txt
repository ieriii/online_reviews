For how hard it is to get into this place, just not that impressed. Food is alright, but the presentation is dope. They try too hard to be cool. I get what they are going for...underground hipster vibe with 5 star like food, and make it impossible to get in. However, it just flat out wasn't anything special. I feel like people rave about it because of its underground hidden reputation. A fun experience for sure, but not worth the $. I went to next restaurant and this doesn't compare.
