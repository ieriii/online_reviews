My boyfriend and I came here for a date night this past Saturday night and we had the BEST time. We arrived around 6 knowing there would be a bit of wait and wanting to have a drink at the bar. We ended up scoring two seats at the bar and enjoying some wine before our table was ready! We were starving and ordered right away the pork belly polenta and the Truffle egg toast. The polenta came first and was served table side, but we noticed it wasnt all that hot when we ate it? It was still delicious, just not as temperature hot as we would have liked. The truffle egg toast came next and that was BY far my favorite bite of the night. The eggs were perfectly runny and the truffle oil added such a kick of flavor. I could have ordered another one! We then had a pasta, which was pretty good and the leek, mushroom and truffle oil pizza. The pizza was definitely better than the pasta, and we actually ended up eating the whole thing! The flavors just worked so well together. For our dessert, we ordered the chocolate mousse and that was just as excellent as everything else we ate. We will definitely be back to try many other items they offer on their menu. Its such a cute date night spot, and we actually saw two people getting engaged that night! Super cute!
