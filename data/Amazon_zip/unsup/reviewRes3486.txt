Best post-marathon dinner I could have asked for. Not only does Crisp has plenty of options, but they seem to have occasional deals that are a steal. I split a whole chicken (spicy Seoul style) with a side of kimchi, onion rings and two drinks for a measly $20. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the windy city!
