As everyone knows, the W is known for it's contemporary, chic decor and of course, the Bliss Spa. W City Center needs a little help, though. It's decor lives up to W's reputation, but the rooms are very small and the bathrooms feel more like the Holiday Inn. The Bliss producst are fabulous, but I was very disappointed in the hotel overall. It needs a lot of updating, architectually. The hallways are narrow, the walls are thin, and the rooms are small and stuffy. I had trouble sleeping as the airconditioner never really cooled the room off (despite the thermostate being turned down to 66). The restuarant is fabulous and they did let me check in 4 hours early, so I will give them that. Overall, the W hotels in Chicago (including the Lakeshore) are disappointing.
