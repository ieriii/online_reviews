Tried this place after seeing it on a list of top 25 pizzerias in Chicago. I was not disappointed. We ordered a stuffed pizza 1/2 spinach 1/2 mushrooms green peppers onions.  I favored the mushrooms and green peppers onions over the spinach. The pizza was delicious and is definitely deserving of a rating in the top 3 not 25 pizzerias.
