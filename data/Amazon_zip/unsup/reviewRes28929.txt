OK, after practically licking my boyfriend's bowl of his "pretty spicy" order of Khao Soy, I am more vigorously giving this place a four-star review. We were hungry after a day of lazing around (seriously, who doesn't get hungry doing that?) so we ventured out into the melty day for some grub. I went with the pad thai with tofu...it was OK, and much better after we hunted down the waiter and I was able to red chili sauce it up. But my boyfriend's dish: Khao Soy...like frickin' spicy heaven in a bowl. Admittedly, his taste buds can handle the spicy stuff better than mine, so him saying "pretty spicy" didn't really raise my eyebrows. But then I had a little sip of his broth and despite my slight choking, it was fantastic! It's a good spicy, a slow burn, if you will, that warms your soul. Coconut curry rocks, and with the kick Opart gives it, you'll be rockin' all night long. Do it.
