Not much to update really. Dinner for seven on a weeknight, I thought it would be slow. The place was 3/4's packed! Service was phenomenal the way I remembered it, we thoroughly enjoyed caipirinhas one after the other with our meal. The food was excellent, the desserts! Oh! I regret not having them the first and second time I visited. Definitely you have to try this restaurant with a group. Get a few bottles of wine or do mojitos and caipirinhas and for sure share some desserts. It was an excellent time. One thing which bothered me, in the Men's room the cleaning supplies were left in sight on the counter to the side of a mirror. That is tacky! When your place is spotless, clean, decor is on point, please please put that stuff away.  People say you must dress up, naw.. there are plenty of tourists that stop in think they are dressy? Hint: some people say if you do push-ups in between you can eat a bit more. For seven with drinks, dessert and meal.. you can expect the bill to be over $600 for sure.
