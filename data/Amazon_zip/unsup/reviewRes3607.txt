Another order gone awry. We (finally) had a successfully completed delivery after the last review (switched to the wings, which are phenomenal, by the way), but when we tried to get a Buddha bowl today we ended up with half a chicken and some other food that we definitely did not order?! I understand that orders get mixed up from time to time (although, this is the 3rd out of 4 that has been wrong), but when we called and they came back to correct the mistake, the food that they brought was (yet again) missing the protein (4 outta 5... sigh). The guy on the phone sounded really busy, so I feel bad. The order on the receipt was correct as well, so I know it wasn't his fault. The food is SO DAMN GOOD! This review makes me sad... but really? Get it together, please!
