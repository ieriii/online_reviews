My favorite Chinese in all of Chicago. For those looking for spice, this place will set your GIRD in motion. I love the spicy and I take a few pepsid tabs as a amuse bouche. From the pepsid course, I highly suggest the szechuan jelly fish. Certainly not the egg roll, crag rangoon or pot sticker, but delicious. From there, I had, but one choice, the 3 Chili Chicken. The dish was sweet and extraordinarily spicy. On my next trip, I will skip the chili's and simply dine on the chili flavored chicken which was nearly perfect. No rice needed, just the Chicken Crack and a pair of chopsticks (an 2 tabs of pepsid).
