Romantic atmosphere - good. Margaritas - good. Ropa vieja - gooooood.  Hard to find not much to like about Cafe 28. A connoisseur of Cuban cuisine I am not, but this joint is much better than some of its competitors in the neighborhood (e.g. Coobah, Sabor a Cuba). Waitstaff is polite and attentive, food never disappoints, and drinks are superb. Really the only thing negative I have to say about the place is that I have sat out on the patio and find it to be not as appealing as the coziness and comfort of the inside dining room.
