I came here after going to the beer festival at Union Station so I was hungry, very, very hungry. Let me preface...I don't think Greek food is the best. Don't get me wrong, I love a gyro but that's about it when it comes to Greek food and yes, I've had other options many times.  So we ordered pomme frites, Caesar salad and the Hawaiian pizza. Not very Greek like, right?...that was done for a reason. ha. BUT even these options were not good. Pizza was supposedly cooked in a brick oven. It sure didn't taste like it. It's doughy pan like pizza with not enough sauce. The fries are typical of what you would find in a high school cafeteria. The salad was the best thing on the table. And the bakery...No bueno. Ugh. I ordered several different cookies which all needed some major work to taste right. If you're still set on coming here, I think this place is best for lunch or to grab something on the go. It's too casual for dinner.
