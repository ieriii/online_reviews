Gilt Bar is metal (= awesome). I went with a large party which is the perfect way to share a variety of toasts and sides. My personal favorite was the Steak tartare toasts - words cannot describe. Add a drip or two of sriracha (okay go for two). The sweet balsamic roasted garlic toasts are also a must. Party goers enjoyed the chicken pasta dish (with Smoked Gouda - yum!), mussels (huge portion and so tasty), roasted chicken (if chicken could only taste that good all the time), and the handmade pork meatballs (like grandma used to make).  We unnecessarily ordered several sides to accompany the main course, but we wanted to try them all! I recommend the corn bread, blackened cauliflower, grilled asparagus, and of course the frites. They have a terrific selection of beer, wine, and specialty cocktails; all of which will wet your whistle and will make you whistle like a bird. The service was top notch and friendly. The atmosphere is completely unpretentious and the ambiance might have been my favorite part...Think the roaring twenties meets country meets rock & roll - it was music to my ears. Throw in a dark, rich color scheme and a plethora of wood and leather - all done very well. The lighting is amazing and will make anyone look good, so keep that in mind if you wet that whistle ;) There is also a killer bar in the lower level; be sure to check it out - a private party down there would again be metal. My mouth is watering just writing this review; I will undoubtedly be back soon;
