Piece is great. A unique style of pizza, a full range of beers, and the ability to handle groups and large crowds even on the weekend. Their pizzas are custom made, and always serve more than you'd think (the large pizza always blows my mind in its sheer size). They handle kids well, they always have baseball on TV, and the wait staff is wonderfully pleasant.
