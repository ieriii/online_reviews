Recently ate here and enjoyed it. Very cool design, there is even a small library in the back. I did feel that it was mostly over priced. Burger and fries should not cost you $12 bucks but to each his own.  I had the mac and cheese and it was wonderful. Yummy combo of cheeses and a great crumble topping.
