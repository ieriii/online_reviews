Excellent martini, very good service. One problem, it appears that the chef used coarse salt to salt the food, so that several people at our table complained that they would get a very tasty bite, followed by a way-too-salty bite. Other than that, food was quite good, though not the best Tapas I have had. If it weren't for the salting problem I'd probably give them 4 stars. Actually one other thing, one of us ordered apricot sorbet, another ordered mango, and the gut that delivered them had them switched - they look identical. I'd suggest to the kitchen they need to do something to distinguish those two. They were both delicious.
