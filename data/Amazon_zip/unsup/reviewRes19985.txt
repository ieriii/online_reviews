About a block away from XOCO, you can smell chocolate. It's pretty amazing.  I was shocked when I DIDN'T have to wait in line. I've heard stories of it wrapping around the block and then some, so I was thrilled that didn't happen during my XOCO experience. Came for lunch. Had the mushroom torta which was very good. The portion was perfect, the mushrooms had an excellent flavor. The hot chocolate is really why I came though. Trust me, it's good...like...what-angels-drink-on -their-break good...
