The food is incredible. Everything I've had there has been fantastic. The service is always friendly and the staff is very attentive. Your water glass will never be empty and you'll never find yourself wondering where the waiter is. My favorites: saganaki, mousaka, meatballs (i don't remember the actual greek name). I think I had something called the greek islands special for dessert that was really good too. I think I waited too long to write this review because the food coma I went into wiped out some of the details...
