This place is beautiful with some really impressive history, and secret tunnels beneath. My only problem was that you can't start a tab. I think they only take American Express, so you have to pay with cash. I like starting tabs with my friends, so we found that to be really annoying. We also don't carry much cash around, so it was a pain in the ass to use their atm and get that service fee. And that's my only complaint!
