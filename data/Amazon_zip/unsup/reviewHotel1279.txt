I checked out of the hotel at an ungodly hour of the morning and, in my stupor, ended up forgetting my padfolio in the cab when it dropped me off at Yolk (best breakfast ever!). I called the Ritz and they put me in touch with the doorman. He remembered the cab driver and, when that guy pulled up again, he rescued my padfolio and called me to say he had it! Kind of a miracle, no? I swung by on the way to my interview, got my padfolio, and tipped the doorman $5. Writing this, I feel bad for not giving him more.
