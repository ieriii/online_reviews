I would consider this to be in Lincoln Square rather than Ravenswood, espcially since its pretty much under a sign that says Lincoln Square.  Onto the food, went here with my g/f and my sister and was very impressed. The burritos were very very big, very good, and very cheap. I don't know if there is a much better combo than that. My g/f had the tacos and she said they were excellent as well.  The drinks were very strong, which when you are drinking a margarita is not always the best thing. The dining room is well kept, definetly nothing special. The one complaint I did have was the cleanliness of the menus. It seemed like all of the menus we had we had were dirty is some fashion. Outside of that I would definetly recommend this to anyone looking for some Mexican food on the square.
