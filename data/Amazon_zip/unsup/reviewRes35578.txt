Now the oyster bar feels like my bay area home. Live music, nice! Food was great. I know where I am going to go hang and be happy each and every visit to "chi town" The place is not so easy to find I must say as we walked from our hotel and had to ask around to get there. It's a place to go folks, two thumbs up. I notice even the locals call it a place to go. That is always a good indicator. As Arnold would say "I'll be back"
