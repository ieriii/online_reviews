Caro Mio is a cozy, yummy Italian restaurant. I'm taking off a 1/2 star because it's teeny tiny and there is no waiting room/bar. And another 1/2 star bc it's BYOB. But this is actually a good thing bc of the $$ you save. It just sort of sucks when you get there and have fogotten about it! Anyway, the food is fabulous. Cesar is a great waiter. Makes you feel comfortable and is full of good suggestions. There is some mushroom sauce that is great.
