Sweet Lawd! I haven't reviewed Giordano's yet?! Seriously - there must be some mistake. I could have sworn that I did on my last trip to Chicago when my fiance-now-hubby tore into his first deep dish pizza like a starving man with a tapeworm! I am trying to pace myself, but it's hard. With the exception of Gino's, no one even comes close to Giordano's deep dish! It's a pie made of perfection - cheesy, chock full of veggies, and meats and with the best crust of all time. There are only two problems with Giordano's: the wait (both to get a seat and to get the pie - make sure you order the pie while you are waiting) and the heavy, "I-just-wanna-rub-my-belly-and-go-to-sleep" feeling you get after eating it. Both are worth it in the end, but don't make plans to go out or go shopping afterwards. The only thing you should be doing after eating a deep dish here with friends is chill at the crib with a bottle of wine and a movie good enough to keep the awake ones' interest, but simple enough that the sleep ones' can nod in and out and still keep up with the plot line.
