This place is 2 for 2 so far. Ran through for a quick dinner, and just had a late lunch to see if my first impressions were valid. They were, indeed. My favorite aspect of this place is the strange, hybrid set up of brewing your own beer, yet having a massive selection of other craft brews on tap and in bottles. I had never seen that until this place. And the selection is stellar. Great Lakes Brewing Co, Green Flash, Left Hand, Bell's, etc...just a fantastic representation, maybe the best I've seen in the short amount time I've lived in Chicago so far. And their own brews are solid...I've had a couple of ales and a Belgian style Wit that all held up pretty nicely. Food has been great on both visits - I've gotten the Mustard Herb Chicken and Smoked Pulled Pork sandwiches...and they both rocked big time. Really want to try a pizza and/or entree. Fries are good, and portions are rather large. Good prices, too. (like $10 a sandwich) The design of the place is very chic...almost too nice - with plenty of nice wood around the bar, including custom carved out pieces, mixed in with post modern, metal lights that are mega-urban in appearance. Good location on Milwaukee. Crowd has been so-so...I'd personally prefer a bit less of the button down vibe, and more of the tatts and piercings group (as 90% of the workers themselves are a part of), but great beer speaks to everyone! In all honesty, I'd give it a 4 1/2, but have to dock at least a half point for ambience. ;)
