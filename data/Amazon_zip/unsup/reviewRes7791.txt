I do prefer Brazzaz to Fogo de Chao, but that's not to say this place isn't worth a visit as well for the service alone. Let's start with the popovers. A basket arrives on your table as you are seated, and as soon as the staff suspects they not be piping hot anymore, they replace it with a new one. Then, water. As soon as my class got less than 3/4 full, it was refilled. So, yeah, service is amazing. But the thing is, I NEVER saw the people refilling water and replacing baskets until they were at my table doing so. I swear to god, I dropped my fork, and as it was falling someone was replacing it. I don't know how they do it, if they have little cameras and microphones at each table so as soon as they hear that you might need something they're already on it, but it's great. I wasn't a huge fan of the salad bar though. It was fine for your average restaurant, but for Brazilian grills, it left something to be desired. Since I didn't fill up on the salad bar (and somehow have a tolerance from the number of pounds of meat I can consume within an hour), I was able to get and thoroughly enjoy dessert. The chocolate mousse/ganache/cake/whatever I had was delicious, and a great finish to the evening.
