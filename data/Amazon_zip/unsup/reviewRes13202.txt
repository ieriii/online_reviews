So, so, so good. Worth the treck to Logan Square if you're an East-sider for the bacon fat popcorn alone. A great place for a date, especially if you snag one of the small booths upstairs. I've had everything from the reuben to the pizza to the mussels and it's all been top notch. If anything the food is at four stars and the beer and atmosphere take it up to five. Note that even if it's crowded there's additional seating upstairs and it never seems to take as long to get a table as they say it's going to be... although maybe I'm just enjoying the beer at the bar too much when they call us up.
