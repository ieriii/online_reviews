It don't compare to the top Korean places in LA or NY, but SSGS is my go-to place for Korean grub in Chi-Town. My favorite is the huge pajun (seafood scallion pancake), which is miles ahead of the Cho Sun Ok counterpart. Seriously, it is a must-order before each meal. The Korean BBQ is decent, and if you want just a quick or cheaper dinner, the stews and other dishes are very reasonably priced and awesome. Our usual rotation includes the kalbitang (stew with kalbi), yukgaejang (spicy beef stew), and soondubujjigae (spicy tofu stew). Bibimbap is good too if it's a hot day. And best of all, SSGS don't skimp on the banchan. Sometimes the service really sucks. Bringing along a token Korean person who speaks Korean well might help... and also the parking lot is small.
