Come for the beer. Belgian and specialty beer heaven. They know their brews, so explore a little and ask for help. You won't be disappointed. Stay for some of the best gastro-pub food in the city. The brisket is great, so is the Ham and Cheese sandwich... and it's not your typical ham and cheese. Stacked high with quality ham and numeske (sp?)cheese with a bit of cole slaw and grilled. I've had the rabbit which is amazing as well. Don't miss the macaroni and cheese either.
