I liked it. We went for brunch this past weekend but they had so much to choose from on the menu, I ended up getting a large lunch salad instead. It was the one with chicken, artichoke, peas, lentils and tons of veggies. It was really good but huge I could only eat about 1/2 of it. I couldn't resist getting a mimosa, which was my favorite part of the experience. I would go back if i was on Michigan Ave. for something else.
