I just recently reviewed this place but just want to throw a couple more things out there :) The ribeye steak that they sell by the ounce is AMAZING. Very large -- perfect to share with 4 people and still get to enjoy some other dishes. The last two times I have been the waiter told us "the kitchen only has two left, so if you want this I will have to put the order in soon." I am pretty sure this is a line, but I don't really care since the steak is really that delicious. It's cooked so well, you can cut it with your fork, and comes with a side of decadent horseradish (I think) sauce.  The Whitefish is perfectly cooked, and the accompanying veggies and sauce are delicious. Definitely recommend it. Truffle pasta is very good, but very rich. I would definitely recommend it if you have never tried it, since the flavor is so unique. The gnocchi is also good, not great.  For dessert, the gelato is a perfect way to end the meal. It comes with a little tub of warm chocolate sauce to pour over the gelato. Absolutely perfect. This place has yet to disappoint me.
