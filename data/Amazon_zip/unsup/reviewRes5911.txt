If you love good italian food you need to try Davanti Enoteca!! My boyfriend and I, along with another couple had dinner here last Friday night. The whole no reservation thing kind of threw us but I still wanted to try it. The hostess told us 45 minutes so we went across the street to the wine bar. Very convenient! It wasn't even 20 minutes later and we had a table, on the patio to make it even better. Great ambience all lit up with white lights. Couldn't have been more cozy.  The waitress was super friendly and helpful. The prices were decent too. I don't remember everything we tried...lol due to the 2 bottles of wine we ordered. But my favorite had to be the flatbread type pizza with honey, to die for! It wasn't on the menu but the waitress recommended it so def ask your server for suggestions!  We'll be back!
