So I was a little skeptical about "The City Suites" since there was mixed reviews on the various sites around, but it was to where I wanted to go and none of the reviews I read contained neither the word "junkie" or "prostitute" like some of the other hotels, so I decided I would give it a shot. Checking in was a speedy process in which we were given the skinny about the parking (less than a block away), check out time (11 AM), and breakfast (7 - 10). The first clerk was ok, not terribly friendly, but not rude or hostile. Our room was a nice surprise. The bedroom was separated from the living area, which was nice. The bathroom had checkered tiles on the walls with cubed windows which added more character to the hotel room . The room was very clean and fully stocked. The only downside to my stay was slow internet speed. When I spoke to the first front desk attendant, he seemed to have the attitude that everything was fine and I just needed to deal with it. Which is an OK answer for me. But, the evening manger Jeremy was very informative, telling me that the hotel was fully booked, he already had contacted ATT, and I wasn't the only guest to have mentioned this. That's how you handle a complaint. Jeremy the night manager was very courteous, funny, and informative. The hotel rooms are very descent for the money you're paying, but the service from the staff and attitude of the staff is what really makes you want to come back for another stay at the "City Suites".
