wow. so many reviews. this review is ONLY for the lemon raspberry hotcakes on a friday morning. read: no crowd. the were AMAZING. however-service was a little slow, so i am sure it is hellishly long when it is crowded on the weekend. i would never wait in the line that i always see forming out of this place on the weekends. they really are just pancakes.  also-the iced tea was amazing. i don't know what was so special about it, but it was awesome.
