On my to-do list for my Chicago stay was of course breakfast! After reading some reviews on Yelp, I decided to come here and it was a great choice. I ordered a mango, orange, kiwi and honey juice blend. It came in a tall glass, slightly cold but closer to room temperature and you could taste that it was freshly squeezed. I also had a cafe mocha with soy milk. They use LaVazza coffee, which I was excited to try, but the soy milk was overpowering. Too bad. They have an extensive breakfast menu with pages of omelettes, scrambles, french toast, pancakes and crepes. There's sure to be something for everyone. I decided to go simple. The server was a bit disappointed especially after she saw me taking some pictures. She said they have so many creative items that are much more interesting. But I enjoyed what I had: over easy eggs with rye toast (you need to ask for it more toasted if you like it that way), bacon and potatoes. The potatoes were the stand-out. They came cubed, nicely seasoned and dusted with parsley. You also get small condiment bowls of their whipped butter and homemade marmalades. It was blueberry and mixed fruit for my meal. I don't usually like using any kind of fruit spread, but I did at least want to try them. The blueberry was awesome! The portion is huge (check out my photos). The service was very good. I came on a late weekday morning and didn't have to wait. Wish I could have made it back before leaving the city.
