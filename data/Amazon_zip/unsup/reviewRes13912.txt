Rev Brew has lots of vegetarian options that can be modified to be vegan and even one or two totally vegan dishes! I appreciate that they denote them with a "v" on the menu. I went for brunch and had the tofu scramble which was unlike any I'd had before; it has fried polenta bites, beans and lots of leeks- my favorite! It was a healthy portion and comes with rye bread and strawberry jam on the side. The carnivores were extremely happy with their meals as well. It was all topped off perfectly with a mimosa. There was no wait for brunch on a Sunday! Maybe because it was Easter?
