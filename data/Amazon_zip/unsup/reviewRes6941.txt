This restaurant is popular for a reason. Great food, Great Value, Great Experience. This is my favorite local Italian Restaurant for a weeknight meal or special occasion.  I've been to Sapori Trattoria many times and have tried most of the entres. I have always had an wonderful meal and great service. Great variety, great fresh ingredients well prepared and delivered by friendly, attentive and professional staff. Definitely give it a try, you will be glad that you did.
