Typically I expect Italian places to be risk-less. Simple food, simple tastes, and certain expectations. Honestly I was wowed by this joint. Their menu was wild and had, what I consider, innovative things. I didn't touch pasta, or pizza, or any basic italian food, and the food was awesome. The service, even better.  Great place, worth the wait.
