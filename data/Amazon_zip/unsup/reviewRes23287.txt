I can count on one hand the number of times I've had crepes. In fact I've had crepes twice, so I am by no means an expert. Went here with my friend because we couldn't decide on anything else. It was a night where nothing sounded good... As other reviewers have said, you don't need to get two crepes to get soup, snd one crepe is plenty enough, at least it was for me. I had the Icosium crepe and it was decent, but I got kind of sick of it about halfway through. I went with the veggie soup, which was definitely not what you think of when you say veggie soup. It was more of a cream, veggie puree. It was tasty though. We split a sweet crepe that was butter, brown sugar and raisins. I realized I don't like raisins :( Overall, it was okay. Good service, okay food, reasonable prices. Take all this with a grain of salt though, as I'm no crepes expert.
