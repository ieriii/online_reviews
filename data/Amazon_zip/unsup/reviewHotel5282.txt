I AM a fan... a big fan.My family stays here every time we come to Chicago, and we have had impeccible service every time. The hotel lobby isn't fantastic, but it is in a great location. We can walk almost everywhere we want to go in the downtown area from Kinzie Street. There was a new gym when we were there at Christmastime, which was a huge plus. The 5:00 open bar and and early morning breakfast are wonderful as well.
