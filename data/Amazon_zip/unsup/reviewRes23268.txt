I've been going to Greek Islands on Halsted since I was a kid, my family is from Greece, so definatley good judges of Greek Cuisine. We all love it and I've never had less then the best service and food there. The atmosphere reminds me of being in Greece ( minus the sunshine lol) You must try it, if you have never tried greek food they have a great sampler dish that has a an array of food. P.S. if you like sweet wines order a bottle of Mavrodaphne its a dessert wine to die for!
