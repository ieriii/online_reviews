I really enjoy eating at this restaurant. Its a nice environment with really hard working people. Their desserts are to die for. I feel like I gain a lb or two whenever I step into that place because I cannot stop eating their desserts. I even take some to go for my friends and family. We always order their mango cake for the birthdays we celebrate in our family. The only bad thing is that the parking is horrible. You have to be fast and the furious when trying to find parking.
