WOW. the food is SO amazing here. Yes the portions are small but packed with flavor. I actually went there for Chicago Restaurant Week (because the pricing on it was much more affordable), and had a variety of items with my friend. The food not only pleased my palate, but my eyes as well! If you are willing to spend a little bit of $$$ for a decent and satisfying (not full) meal, then this place is place to try
