one word: TRASH. All I have to say is that the one and last time I went to this place it took so long for my speciality cocktail to come that I had to go to the bar. I asked for a ketel one on the rocks, and the pretentious bartender rolled his eyes at me. Trash. I walked across the street to the former Pontiac, and ordered my vodka. When I returned to this trash heap my drink was still not on the table and when it did it was less that satisfactory. P.S. god forbid you bring a cell phone in!
