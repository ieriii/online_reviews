4.5 stars Simply the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. We each had potatoes with our brunch, then ordered a side of them for dessert. We went there for brunch after reading reviews here, and we're glad we did. I had the crab benedict, which I'd give 4 stars, and I my girlfriend had the banana french toast. Both were really good, just not perfect - the french toast was a little dry (solved this with some additional syrup) and the crab benedict lacked a little something. Beyond that, the service and drinks were excellent, as well as the ambiance. Just the perfect neighborhood brunch spot...I wish they had one in Austin.
