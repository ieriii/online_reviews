I wanted to like Chicago Q, mostly because this part of town needs some good BBQ. Based on a late lunch this afternoon, however, I doubt this spot will make it. The upsides - a pretty dining room and friendly staff (at least on this visit); great house-made pickles and chips served when you sit down; a very tasty array of sauces (two of them are actually BBQ sauce, one is ketchup, and the fourth I couldn't really identify); and a hot towel for cleanup after a meal that's mostly eaten with fingers. The downsides - for starters, lunch time prices. Even in the Gold Coast, you ought to be able to get a lunch entree for under $10, but there are no BBQ entrees at that price point. I tried the classic burger (9.75), which was served with the aforementioned sauces and some fries. The fries were piping hot, and looked freshly cut, but alas not very crisp on the outside. As for the burger: cooked precisely medium as requested, tender, but lacking in flavor. If there was any seasoning here, it escaped my attention. Adding BBQ sauce helped. Service was friendly but I still don't understand why (in a deserted restaurant) it took more than 5 minutes to get the requested mayo. I'd suggest a couple of strategies for this spot:  1) Address the shortcomings on the food mentioned by others. 2) At lunch offer a different sandwich each day on special at 9.95 including a nonalcoholic beverage; and a full entree (not a sandwich) for 11.95. 3) Try some signage out front so people know what they will find inside.
