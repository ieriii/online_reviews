sincere disappointment. xoco was supposed to be my entry point to loving all things rick bayless. i have absolutely no issue standing in an hour-long line and paying $11 for a sandwich (but, it's got to be worth it). i found the meal unusually heavy and i had horrible heartburn the rest of the night into the morning. (and that was only eating half my sandwich). i ordered the gunthrop chicken torta with chips + guac. the bread on my torta was so hard that i could barely bite into it -- and this is coming from someone who loves crunch to their sandwiches. i felt the meat had more italian flair than mexican and this bothered me because it was as if i was pouring salsa over an italian-style sandwich. the guac and chips were so-so... just guac and chips. nothing special, nothing terrible. to be fair, the salsa was very tasty and 5 stars for pulling off the local concept with impeccable detail. (i hate to rain on any restaurant that is featuring local food, but xoco didn't do it for me). i'll have to support local food via other efforts.
