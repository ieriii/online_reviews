Nothing I can say about Frontera that hasn't been said 522 times (as of this writing). So I will join the chorus that approves of Rick Bayless' courageous experiment in Mexican fine dining. I can't give Frontera five stars, even ignoring the long waits (which is only fair). My meals here have been very good, but occasionally the food has been inconsistent. At this point, I will only do Topolo since I haven't had a chance to go for the highest end Bayless experience yet.
