I've been wanting to try Irazu for a long time. Maybe I went in with my expectations a bit too high because I left thinking it was pretty good, but not great. We decided to put our name in for first available, but I wished I'd chosen indoors because the outdoor "heated" patio was COLD. We started with the chifrito because fried pork always wins in my book, but it was disappointing. It was just rice, beans, and sparse pork- not the "dip" I was expecting. I was kicking myself for not ordering the empanadas, and I'll be back just to try those. The milensa was good, the steak burrito was ok, and potato tacos good. I think the "tacos" were more like taquitos or flautas than tacos though, personally. The plantains were amazing, but I'm kind of a whore for plantains. I liked the cabbage salad, radish and beets that came with my tacos a lot though. We mentioned Yelp to get our free oatmeal shake, but again I think the word shake is misleading it was pretty watery...more like horchata made with oatmeal than a shake. Overall, I will go back and I especially love that it is BYOB. Next time I'll just leave my preconceived notions at the door!
