A great local breakfast place. Be warned though, this place gets very crowded so expect a wait. I had the egg burrito and was very happy w/ it. I also shared the coconut pancakes w/ the table. Very yummy and definitely satisfied my sweet tooth, even though I'm more of an egg-breakfast person. Added bonus, they serve the delicious Intelligentsia coffee.
