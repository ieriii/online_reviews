I hate to say it, but yes, I was disappointed. Maybe it was all the hype (Don't believe the hype ... name that tune!). Maybe it was where we sat. (In the corner next to a cold, windy door) Maybe I've been cooking too many fantastic meals at home. (haha!) Either way, I was unimpressed by the food here. We ordered the Kobe meatballs, Wild Boar sloppy joe, bone marrow dish and the duck egg and tongue dish. Oh, and the creme brulee at the end. First, the portions. TINY. Okay, let me preface this by saying that I do have some portion control problems. But still. There were like, 6 Kobe meatballs half the size of a golf ball. I was like, seriously? I know it's Logan Square but COME ON. Not everyone needs to squeeze into the skinniest jeans possible (I live in Logan Square so please don't throw tomatoes at my bad joke). The Wild Boar Sandwich was definitely appetizer size ... I could have eaten two on a bad day. And yes, I could have eaten two because that was the only thing I truly enjoyed at dinner. The bone marrow was, eh. The toast was burnt and the marrow just wasn't very good. The duck egg and tongue hash was pretty good ... but not blow-my-mind terrific. And, they were out of the yuzu hot toddy. Booooo. I was sort of wanted to ask, well, can't you just whip one up? Guess not ... We did have some whiskey shots though ... I guess that was good. All in all, unimpressed. Maybe Ciao will have better food.
