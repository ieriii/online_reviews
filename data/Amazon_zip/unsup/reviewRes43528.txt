used to be the go to pizza place, even with the long wait, the food at least arrived hot and gooey. recently it's been slipping and i kept kicking myself for ordering. this weekend was the last time that i'll kick myself, because i'm never ordering from here again, and here is why... 7:15. friday night. yes i do realize that's prime ordering time and that we'd have a wait. that's life. place relatively simple order-14" thin crust pizza, friend zucchini with RANCH (as it comes with marinara). 45 minutes to one hour wait. cool. 8:20. no pizza. 8:25. no pizza. call AoP. Told that they just spoke with the driver and that it will be there in no more than 15 minutes. hung up on. 8:55. still no pizza. have my fiance go down and check with the doorman just to be sure that we didn't miss something. start mentally writing this review. 9:15. pizza arrives (2 hours after ordering). zucchini is incredibly soggy. not even 15 minutes in the oven fixed it. and no ranch. frustrating. pizza is like cheese flavored rubber. again, even time in the oven can't revive the pizza. no apology from the driver, though who knows may not have been his fualt. anyways, with so many pizza options in the city, there's no reason to continue to pay for this.
