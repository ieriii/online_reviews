My boyfriend and I went here for our first time last Sunday for dinner. I had heard great things about this restaurant from my sister and her friends, so I was excited to eat here. The inside of the restaurant was very nice, but the service was not the best. When I went to order a root beer float the waiter told me they don't have root beer floats anymore. I just said okay and ordered a root beer. I told my boyfriend if they have root beer and they have ice cream, I'm confused as to why the waiter told me they can't make a float. When we ordered our food I asked the waiter if the shepherd's pie had any sauce or gravy and he told me no. When it came it was covered in gravy. I like gravy, and it tasted good, but the waiter told me it didn't have gravy on it. Overall, I was very happy about the fact that they have Goose Island root beer, the best root beer ever, which is hard to find. However, I was disappointed because the food wasn't as good as I thought it would be, and the waiter didn't seem to be at all familiar with the menu.
