Okay, if you're looking for cheap pancakes go to Pancake house and stop bitching about the prices here. Bongo Room is fantastic. If you want traditional breafast, Bongo has it. If you want an amazing omelette made to order, Bongo is the place. What they're famous for of course is their pancakes and french toast smothered in fruits, creams, sauces, chocolate, whatever your sweet tooth asks for. I'm not a sweet breakfast person, so for people like me, there's the breakfast burrito, the benedict, and many other things. They change their menu seasonally as well. The only drawback is the wait time. If you hit it wrong, you have to wait an hour. Weekdays are better, but there's nothing like Bongo on Sunday morning. This is another "take the out of town guests here" place.
