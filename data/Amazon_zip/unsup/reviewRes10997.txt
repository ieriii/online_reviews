This place is ok and has decent thin crust pizza with a lot of variety of toppings. It is also a microbrew which scores big points in my book. The problem is that the pizza was just super soggy. I still ate it and I guess it might have been a result of the ingredients on the pizza, but still if I have to use a fork and knife to eat the pizza, it better be deep dish.  The other thing was that I could have sworn I had a banana bread beer here in the past. I asked the bartender which of their micros that would be and she looked at me like I asked for a Zima and then just seemed to pick one out of a hat. When I asked our short jort wearing server, he did the same thing but chose another. I really would have appreciated someone just saying they did not know or that they did not have anything like that.
