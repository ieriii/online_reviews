Mmmm, Tank Noodle, you never disappoint! We always get the pancake appetizer, it is delicious and satisfying, the fish sauce that comes with it is fantastic, love the slices of pork in the pancake, always yummy! Spring rolls are a fave of my hubby. Hubby and I love the beef with lemongrass dish, spicy and a little sweet with a great lemongrass flavor, soak the rice in the sauce on the plate and make sure to the eat the veggies on the plate, you will thank me later! Pho is good on a cold winter day, though I stick to the standard beef, I am not brave enough to try the more exotic kinds. Love the smoothies, when in season the watermelon and cantaloupe are crazy good! Service is just ok and I am a little sketchy on the jalapenos on the table but this place is still a great place for Vietnamese fare!
