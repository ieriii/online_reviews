Yolk is a great place for breakfast...no matter when you have that meal! You pretty much get what you pay for so since it's not expensive, you get pretty good quality. It's not great but certainly not awful. i've only had their Eggs Benedict and Omelets. Both are good. Service is friendly and fast. The restaurant decor is a little to be desired but it's always clean. Basically, it's a breakfast place so don't expect a 5-star meal here. They do breakfast about as good as I've ever had it...better than I would do if I had to cook for myself that's for sure! lol
