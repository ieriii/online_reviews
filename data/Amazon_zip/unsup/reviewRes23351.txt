This is a really nice place. I came here with a friend and we both shared the fried eggplant appetizer. It was really good, not too salty but just right. I had the Mousaka and she had the Pisticio (SP). They both pretty much tasted the same haha. Prices are pretty reasonable and they have FREE valet parking which was a huge plus in this frigid weather we're having in Chicago. While waiting outside for the cars, we stood under these heat lamp things, so warm. Waiters a greeters were very friendly.
