NOT COMPARING Lockdown to Kuma's - can't, same formula but much different execution. They both serve a certain crowd and both do it well. Now, Lockdown on it's own is phenomenal! Can't say enough about how good the service was. There is a lot to be said for a hostess or server with a smile, exceptionally accomodating to boot. Sauce on the mussles is a curry of some sort, full of flavor and a great twist on the classic beer or wine garlic sauce. Trio of burgers that I tried included the Elvis burger and I was hooked. Next time I'm there it's gonna be for the full-size Elvis. Skip the mac n cheese. Don't miss the loaded fries!
