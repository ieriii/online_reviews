Having experienced at-home fondue and Melting Pot fondue, I'm a fan. When I saw this place come up with a fantastic deal on Groupon, I had to jump on it. And it ended up working out perfectly for the "date day" my girlfriend and I had planned. Not wanting to spend over our allotted $50, we got the cheese/chocolate fondue special (roughly $20 each) with extra veggies. We later learned I could have ordered a meat fondue a-la-carte, and she could have ordered the cheese/chocolate special so we could have tried everything. Oh well, next time! The waitress was very helpful and friendly, and I hardly event noticed she was training someone at the same time. She was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. The atmosphere was cozy and dark. Once you adjust it isn't so bad, and it certainly was a nice romantic spot. Plus it has to be dark so you can be awed by the flaming food of awesome! Now on to the food. The cheese fondue was amazing. None of the liquor "bite" that I've experienced in some fondues - just smooth cheesy goodness. I liked the mushrooms, onions, and bread the best. I would definitely say go for the extra veggies - the apples, grapes, and bread just don't give you the full experience. After having had a large late lunch, we were already feeling full after the cheese fondue. The chocolate fondue was good but...honestly, I was a little disappointed. It tasted a little like hot fudge or chocolate syrup to me - not real melted chocolate. Personally I think Melting Pot does chocolate fondue better. This just wasn't what I hoped for. The fruits were super fresh though, and I had no problem eating them up with only a little bit of the chocolate. While we didn't try the meat fondue, several of our neighbors did and they seemed to really be enjoying it. When we got our check we were given a flyer to get a $25 gift certificate for special occasions- hell yeah! We will definitely return for our year anniversary and have the meat fondue.
