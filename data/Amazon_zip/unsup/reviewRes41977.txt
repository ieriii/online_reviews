This is my ALL time favorite restaurant!!! Every time I take friends they love the food and drinks. I love the ambience and music. Their lounge downstair is very cool and cozy. The steak tartare is the best dish in the city. I never can have enough. The chicken, gnocchi, and hamachi are just as delightful It is a definite Must, and if u like cozier and more intimate try their other restaurant Maude's. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this restaurant!
