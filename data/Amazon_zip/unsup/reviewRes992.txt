Ordered the "Cherry-Infused Venison Sausage" and the daily special "Rabbit Sausage with Pumpkin Creme and Goat Cheese". Both were $8. Both were delicious. Great service inside with the food coming out quickly.  The only annoying thing was waiting in line outside in the twenty degree weather. The store opens at 10:30 am, and we were there at 10:15am. A line of 30 people were already in front of us. I wish Hot Doug's could provide heating lamps or expand his store so more people can wait inside.
