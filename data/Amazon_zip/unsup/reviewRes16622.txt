The 70s looking plywood exterior that I've walked by many times just down from the Double Door and Flash Taco... never would've guessed. Maybe would've thought it was some weird club or rave spot... thankfully it was not.  We waited nearly half an hour in an awkward space with an interminably open and closed door as parties first-come-first-serve were welcomed inside the velvet curtains. Once inside it was comfortably busy but we were showed to our two spots at the bar. I prefer the bar in these establishments as the bartender is the show here since it's centered around the cocktail. Our guy was totally cool and even did not scoff at my request for a less sweet drink as others have lately. The Nickel Manhattan was my favorite of the night. The cocktails are expensive but strong and balanced, you won't be shooting them like well bombs and that's the idea (the rules posted said 'no bombs of any kind.'  Sat next to a Sous Chef from Cleveland... seems like foodie central around here and I like it.
