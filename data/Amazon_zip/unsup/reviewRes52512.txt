Came here for a Sunday Linner (Linner: the definition between Lunch and Dinner. A first cousin to Brunch) and me and dinner mate were SO EXCITED about the oyster bar. Yes, I said it right.... the oyster bar....at a steak place....So we loaded it up, and oh my, were they tasty! Oh yeah, the meats....All were very good, but our favorite was the bottom sirloin. Tender, juicy and very flavorful. We also loved the mushroom risotto! Creamy, well seasoned and delicious. Another favorite was their grilled pineapple. I'm not a fan of pineapple, but grilling it took this fruit to a whole other level, as it caramelized it well, leaving the bitterness and tartness that I usually taste when having the fruit at it's natural state.  I'd have to say that Texas De Brazil is my favorite steakhouse. They seem to have more variety of meats and their salad bar is humongo. I also enjoyed their capirinha better at Texas, and yes, I'm critical of that drink as it is my ultimate favorite. Also, Texas is two stories, and you don't feel as cramped when dining there. But if you're looking for great grilled pineapple, risotto and similar meats, Brazzaz is an alternative for you. Parking difficult in this area.
