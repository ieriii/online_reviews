For the price you probably won't find a nicer hotel in Chicago. Sleek and modern, this is a fantastic place to stay. As many others have noted: the rooms have floor to ceiling windows, so be sure to close the shades when you're, uh, you know. Or don't. Oh, and the B&W Zeppelin iPod docs are a great touch.
