i love irazu. i have only ordered the vegetarian plate because i love it so much, but it is always good no matter what the vegetables are. my boyfriend loves the oatmeal milkshakes, eh i think they are OK. but i am not really a milkshake or oatmeal lover. He always loves his food (usually the sandwiches) and introduced me to the place. I am assuming that i am not incorrect in my love for the veggie options because his discrimating puerto rican vegetarian mother loves it all as well. you should probably go for that reason alone! the major con is that it is small which is great when not busy, but better left avoided on busy nights and weekends.
