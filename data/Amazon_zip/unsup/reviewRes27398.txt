"$6 for all of this!?! Right on!" After leaving Nuevo Leon, I felt like I had robbed the place or something. I don't know how they can survive charging the prices they do. It is an effing brilliant concept though. After waiting only 10 minutes in a line that reached out the front door, I was starving. Delight reached my face as the waitress laid a bowl of spicy veggies, chips and salsa, water, AND a delicious taquito on our table. All of this before we even ordered. How did they know I was ready to gnaw on my BF's arm? I went straight for the combo platter because A) I have a hard time making decisions and B) I get bored with one single dish only. Each of the items on the plate was unique and impressive in it's own right. I really can't think of a better way to spend $6. Nuevo Leon is the best Mexican I have had in this city yet. I will definitely be back!
