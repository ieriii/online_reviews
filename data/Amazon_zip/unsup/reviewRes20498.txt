For a sandwich shop it's muy expensivo but I would NOT categorize this place as such. Walking in is a little overwhelming but the energy is this place is amazing. The hostess immediately greeting me and explained how it worked...You wait until your table is ready to order and then they bring you out your food. I had the woodland mushroom torta and the bread was toasted to perfection. I am usually not a dipper or dunker of condiments but this sauce was the perfect sweet n spicy to offset the earthiness of my mushroom/goat cheese/arugula sandwich. All of rick's salsas are amazing and surprisingly easy to make at home. Roasting the peppers and tomatoes totally make the difference and did i taste a bit of cinnamon in there? oh and I love how they have sparkling water in a self-serve tap.  At any rate, I am glad i stopped in and can't wait to come back another day after 3 for the caldos.
