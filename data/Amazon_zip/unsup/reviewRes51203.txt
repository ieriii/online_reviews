My wife and I were in from Minneapolis and spent a day wandering around some of the more charming neighborhoods of Chicago. We wandered into Big Jones, which was busy on a Saturday night, and were attended to immediately. The service was fantastic and the food was even better. Delicious margaritas, fresh out of the oven cornbread muffins followed by some amazing appetizers, which included cheddar herb croquettes, crawfish boudin fritters and lump crabcakes. Our entrees (Carolina Pulled Pork & Shrimp and grits) were done to perfection. We left so satiated that my wife forgot her iphone. Unfortunately, we didn't realize it until we were at the airport. The owner found it, called us and offered to send the the phone to us. That kind of attention to customers in this day and age is rare and greatly appreciated. Andersonville is one of the hippest and coziest neighborhoods in Chicago and Big Jones is it's crown jewel. Needless to say, we'll be back any and every time we're in Chicago.
