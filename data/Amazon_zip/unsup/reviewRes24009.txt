these aren't the thin, americanized crepes available at IHOP or denny's or whatever. these are authentic recipes with delicious results. the "breakfast" crepes are super sweet, so beware of that. they're very good - just very sweet. the "savory" crepes are amazing... i'm partial to the chicago or the carthage crepe. coffee is great... soup is great. as a matter of fact, i've never left here not wholly satisfied. you can build your own, but the ingredients in the entrees are all fresh and compliment each other very well.  this is definitely a niche place, so let me put it this way:  love good food? go here. unfamiliar and/or skeptical about creperies? go here. want something other than a crepe? do not go here.
