Was a bit hesitant to try this place since most of the reviews seemed to come from friends who were on a first name basis with the chef/owners. However, was pleasantly surprised with my meal. Monkfish and short rib entrees were very well prepared. Flourless chocolate mouse cake was melt in your mouth good. Sweet deal for $20/3 course prix fixe, although some entrees and desserts have a supplement cost. BYO is a plus. Patio out back provides a nice summer outdoor dining option.
