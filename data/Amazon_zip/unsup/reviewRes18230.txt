Bayless does it again. This place is amazing, just wish it was open on Sundays, I'd eat brunch here every week. Really a fatal hole in a lot of the River North area unfortunately. Coming from New York, brunch is kind of a big deal for me. The selection of true Mexican food is incredible, home-made salsas and delicious home-made juices that will cure any hangover. I think I'll be coming back here for as long as it takes to try everything on the menu. I would suggest you do the same. My advice would be to try everything because you never know if you'll like it otherwise. This place should get 5 stars but until they open their hours up more I can only give them 4.
