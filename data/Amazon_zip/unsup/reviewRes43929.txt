Where should I begin? Walking around the city and me craving steak, my boyfriend and I decided to stop at Kinzie. As our server told us about the chef's specials,and the mahi mahi caught my attention instead of the steak. BAD mistake! Did not like it at all, only the corn risotto was delicious on my dish. My BF had the Kinzie cut and was Great. Service was wonderful and the palce was very nice.
