Cool atmosphere, loud...more of a sportsbar. Upon entering a guy overheard me and my friends discussing we'd never been there before. He felt compelled to make a pizza suggestion- mashed potatoes. I appreciated the effort, and we ended up getting it. Unfortunately, we were eating with a fickle group and had a hard time picking toppings. Mashed potatoes only...let's just say, it wasn't the best thing I put in my mouth. As we're eating, i notice something shiny on my pizza. What is that?! Oh, just a copper wire from their oven cleaner. We'd basically devoured the entire pizza at this point, but my friend told the waitress anyway. She was super nice- apologetic. The manager came over and offered to make us a new one. Mashed potatoes?! no thanks!! We said it was okay, and appreciated his concern. The bill comes and the entire meal was free. That was really thoughtful of them, and I'll definitely go back to try a different combination. I don't recommend the potatoes.
