I was looking for a nice time out this past Black Friday -- good food, great atmosphere, holler-able wine and awesome company/conversation. I set the criteria and looked to my friend Dan for a suggestion. He picked Wakamono, as he loves and raves about this place ever so often. Now, let me quickly set up my sentiments on sushi before I list off what I ate: I started out life HATING sushi. Earlier this year, I began to tolerate it. A month or so ago, I grew to like it. After the food/experience at Wakamono, I might go as far as using the word love. Or in K-speak: love love. Edamame - fine. Can't really screw that up. Godzilla roll - my favorite. I could've eaten the whole thing by myself. Dragon roll - not overly decorative yet packs amazing flavor Fire dragon roll - mmmm; you feel the spicy kick after swallowing Spicy tako roll - heaven in the form of a beautifully crafted roll We dogged all of the above with a bottle of wine and life felt pretty effin' sweet after that. I honestly can't wait to come back the next time I feel like some great sushi. All criteria = beyond satisfied -- especially re: the awesome company/conversation. Dan was a superb date (any fellas wanna holler? He's single!). Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand I'm spent. :)
