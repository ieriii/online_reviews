Our evening began with a romantically lit corner table and an abundant spread of rolls. Of course, that was the employee table tucked behind the register counter. And yes, they did eat right in front of us. It took 45 minutes to get our food even though there wasn't a crowd. No explanation for the wait was given. When we finally got our food home, I almost gagged. The rolls were seaweed stuffed with mayo. We could only distinguish a difference between the rolls based on the color of the mayo oozing out. Upon further consideration, we theorize that the sushi isn't even produced onsite. The extra mayo is a cover up for the lack of freshness.  Evidence? There are no sushi chefs visible as the food mysteriously appears from behind a curtain... and you can't order pieces, just rolls. Hmm... Just a theory. Sushi X: sushi for people who don't like sushi... so, why even bother?
