Quack-Quack! DUCK. I'll take duck over chicken any day! I'm the guy who orders duck pad thai even if it's not on the menu! To say I am a fan of the duck is an understatement. If I ran the world, there would be less KFC's and more KFD's! Chinese BBQ? Peking Duck?? YES PLEASE! I came here with my family of 5. Three of us split the Peking Duck Dinner. There other 2 didn't care for duck. I had to double-check to make sure we were related. It was my first time here and I had a great experience. I enjoyed how they carved the duck at our table. I enjoyed the steamed bun-pita that accompanied the duck to make little wraps w/ the special sauce & pickled veggies. It all came together very well. I enjoyed the duck fried rice & the soup that was flavored with the remaining duck after being carved. The BBQ Pork here is great as well! Moist and tender! This place is great for large groups.  I washed down my meal with a Goose Island Matilda. Duck coma ensued, which resulted in me handing over the car keys to my family and loosening my belt by one notch. Duck = Winning.
