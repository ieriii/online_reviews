My first time to Chicago and I had to try some deep dish pizza. This place seemed like a good choice based on reviews. I love pizza. I waited the 30 mins like he said. Got a sausage stuffed pizza. It looked good and when I took that first bite.....that's it? There wasn't much flavor to it. I couldn't taste the sausage. The worst part for me was the crust. It was flaky for some reason. I was truly disappointed. They were busy and there are many good reviews so I don't know why I don't feel the same way. Not at all impressed. The next day I tried the Art of the Pizza and that's how I expected it to taste!! I would pass here and try somewhere else. But the service was friendly and prompt.
