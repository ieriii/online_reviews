Not that I need any help reverting to primal tendencies, but this is a really good place to get yourself into the spirit. I have lurked outside of here periodically but haven't gone in because I wasn't... prepared. You want to come to Publican on a night when you're primed for meat like you've never done meat. There is no other way. It took me years to come to that night apparently. It's the Publican, so what do you really need to know? Get the cured meat. I could've eaten a whole ham spread alone. I have no idea what was in the rillettes, and I'm perfectly happy not to know. Shredded fat-cooked something (was it rabbit, maybe?) served chilled on toast. The fish and chips are better than I've had in Hawaii, which is the only place other than England that specializes in fish and chips (I'm sure England would put up a fight). The half chicken, my friend said, was the 'best fucking half chicken you can get'. It does put other rubbery chicken to shame. I think I ate a hunk of this leftover and it was delicious even with my questionable high-flame reheating methods. There was another pork item in here, and I can't remember what it was. I was drunk. The beer list is obviously impressive and requires some degree of blind ordering unless you are an expert. I suppose I never came here because I am allergic to the majority of the menu on the left side. That shouldn't have been a deterrent. But you know how it is. I have no memory of the service being attitudinal, but little offends me. Their bathroom sink situation is lovely. A+.
