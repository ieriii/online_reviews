I'm a Starwood bigot, admittedly, but this is one of my least favorite properties. The rooms--even when upgraded--are small and not that well-appointed. They always, always, always smell like the cheap MDF that you get at IKEA. The "Sweat" gym at this W is a joke: two lousy bikes, three treadmills, and a few free weights in what might best be described as a room the size of a large janitor's closet. They don't have a pool--which is fine--but with nearly 400 guest rooms, the gym could be 4x this size and it still might not be sufficiently sized.  Half the rooms in City Center face the obnoxiously loud L, which will ruin your night no matter how many $18 drinks you can stomach. I generally opt for the Westin on Michigan Avenue or the W Lakeshore whenever possible, but sometimes get stuck here due to logistics or availability. I always cringe, but at least the rooms are clean and I get my Starwood points.
