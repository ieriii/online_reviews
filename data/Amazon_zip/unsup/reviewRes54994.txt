The food was lovely, but the Saturday night underground tasting at $85 really wasn't worth the price. The dessert was spectacular, as was the fois gras, but the portions were so microscopic that we all ended up at the tasy freeze for fries after dinner! There are better restaurants of better value in Chicago
