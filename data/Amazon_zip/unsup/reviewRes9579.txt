Wow. Wow. and Wow. That describes my three courses at Sprout as best as I can possibly articulate them. Add in a Yum and another Wow for the two intermezzos. It really is a five star 'as good as it gets' experience. I went there for a milestone date last night and it was an awesome experience worth every penny and worth getting seated 20 minutes after my scheduled reservation. We both went with the $60 meal along with the $25 wine pairings and were both very happy with our decisions. I had the beef, rabbit, and Stone. The beef was the only thing I wouldn't include in the 20 best dishes I've ever had between my date's meal and mine. It was really good, though. She had the Scallops, which were a phenomenal way to start. The rabbit was simply amazing. It had this gnocchi with a truffle glaze that was the single best food item I've ever had. It was soft and smooth and sweet and tasty and perfect. Should I ever be wrongly accused of a crime, I'd want it as part of my last meal. She had the pork chops which were very good, but not my thing personally. The intermezzos were both very good. there was a shaved ice for the first and the second was a grilled cheese type thing that was paired with one of my favorite beers (Founders centennial IPA). The deserts were great. Hers was basically a malt that she described as the perfect balance of a hot chocolate and milk shake. She said it was one of the best food items she'd ever tasted (till she got to the bottom which she thought was a little heavy on the lavender). My dish was a peach, nectarine, plum shortcake dish that was very very good. Everything about the meal was top quality tasting ingredients and the service was very good. I'd come back again for sure. In fact, this may be our go-to place for meals in this price range.
