Grunt burger.Those are the only 2 words you need to know. They have one of the best hamburgers in the city with the perfect bun and loaded with fried onions and whatever else you want. They serve curly fries which are much better than normal french fries.The salad bar is just fine, but you don't need it unless you are only getting soup as the portions are huge.The bar is small and not worth your time if you are going out for a drink only. Go for the burger when you just gotta have one of the best.  Great place to bring a couple of friends (great atmosphere and location), but don't even think about going with a group as the tables are small and you'll never sit together.
