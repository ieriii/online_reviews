Went there recently with my date and had a great time. yes it was very expensive but the food was very good. i would say dont order drinks as they are extremely overpriced and do order the sampler (not sure what it was called) but they give you about 30 different dishes.  our waiter was unbelievable (believe his name was CJ). the ham they have is out of this world and everyone should get to try it at least once. i could eat it everyday. having the chef come out and talk to us about the food was also a great touch
