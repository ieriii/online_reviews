Brunch is my favorite meal and it is so nice to find a bustling brunch place with such an extensive menu. They had everything from yogurt and fruit specialties to oatmeal to eggs benedict. I wanted to try just about everything. I finally settled on the Zamboni crepes - ham, eggs, and spinach folded into two sweet crepes topped with hollandaise sauce - because I so rarely see savory crepes on any menu. It's served with fruit or potatoes and your choice of toast, pancakes or english muffin. At only $10, it's an incredible value. The crepes themselves weren't thin and delicate as traditional crepes should be, but they were still solid breakfast food. Service was nice, friendly and efficient. I'll come back. There is usually a wait, but it's not terribly long, it's a big restaurant with lots of seating. Parking is easy and convenient in the parking lot next door. $7 with validation.
