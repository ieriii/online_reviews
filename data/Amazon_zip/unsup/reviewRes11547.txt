Pretty decent thin crust pizza. Went with the red sauce, sausage, mushroom and onion pizza - delicious. Good char on the crust and great flavor. Plenty of screens to catch sports. Great service. Beers brewed on site are also solid and managed to get through the range (there are great sampling options) Dark and Curvy and Full Frontal my favorites. Only two minors criticisms; no head on the beer and found it hard to order beer without a menu to understand what name represented which beer style.
