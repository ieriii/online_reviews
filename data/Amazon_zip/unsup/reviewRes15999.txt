Okay, I was prepared to hate this place given all the hype and pretension....of course I still totally wanted to go! The wait was about 30 minutes and so totally worth it. Amazing cocktails, great food, beautiful space and the ability to have a decent conversation without having to yell over the music or talk to the random drunk person who has just sidled up next to you and your friend (though sometimes, that can be fun). I will definitely use this as a show off spot for my out of town friends.
