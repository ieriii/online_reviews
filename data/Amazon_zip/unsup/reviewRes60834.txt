I am disappointed with my fellow yelpers. Zed is a great place! It's new and it's theme isn't about stuffing yourself to the max, it's about trying new selections and making the "menu" work for you. The price is comparable to any other place in the area and what you can get is amazing. Items are always changing due to what is in season and what the chefs deem desirable. I have been there twice and left completely satisfied. The staff is pleasant and it seems like they are having a great time! Of course there will be kinks but come on! It's a new restaurant...let's give them a chance. The drinks are unique and the outdoor deck is wonderful. I had the opportunity to try some of the bar menu items and was blown away. For all of you out there that don't like the meat selections order off the bar (I suggest the steamed muscles) or just get the "harvest table" for a cheaper price.  All in all I think they are going to do great things and people will actually enjoy themselves with the staff there.
