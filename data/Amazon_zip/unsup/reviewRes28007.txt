We arrived at a quarter to 5 on a Wednesday night and there was already a long line down the block but we had some time to kill waiting for our other friend, so we stood in line and when the restaurant opened, we got a nice table in the bar area. The margaritas are delicious and strong! We had 7 margaritas between the 3 of us, which is why our bill was a bit high, but well worth it. The atmosphere in the bar area was boisterous and fun, everyone seemed to be having a good time. Our server was attentive and gave us some suggestions off the menu. Guacamole is fantastic. I had the carne asada and it was ok, flavorful but a little on the tough side. One of my friends had the ceviche trio and the other had the gazpacho and they both liked their food. Oh yes, and I can't forget the delicious ice cream, I believe we had the raspberry and blueberry flavors (I don't know, I'm buzzed from the margaritas at this point) and it was freakin fantastic. Great time, awesome margaritas, energetic atmosphere, and good service. And FYI, Rick was next door behind the counter at Xoco, which is where we were going to eat originally but there were not many tables to sit at.
