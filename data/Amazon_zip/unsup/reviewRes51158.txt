hot damn you're good! not only was my dish good (i took the easy route and went with the burger) but i couldn't stop eating from everyone's plates. to start with they offered us the most scrumptious corn bread and sweet butter, i think i could make a meal out of that and the cheddar grits. the summer drinks we're also outstanding, i had the blood and sand which was a favorite of mine in LA and hadn't had since. it was a great experience and i will most definitely be returning.
