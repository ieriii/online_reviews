Let me tell you something about Cuban food. I am half Cuban and from Florida's equivalent of the Cuban ghetto in Miami. I've been living in Chicago for 7 years and I was on a quest to find authentic Cuban food. I was overjoyed when I discovered 90 Miles. If you go there and order a pan con bistec (skirt steak sandwich) and a cafe con leche, it tastes exactly the same as if you walked up to LaCarreta or Versailles at midnight in Miami and ordered the same thing. It's authentic. And the reason for that is because the owner is from the same part of South Florida I am - which I learned when I met him one day at the restaurant. (Side note: he is also smoking hot and doesn't look like he's in his 40's but he is!) There is also a ridiculously great waitress there (her name is Sam - short for Samantha, I think) who has been so pleasant every time. For anyone who is seeking AUTHENTIC Cuban food, this is the place to go for it in Chicago. All others I have tried are nowhere near as good. My only complaint is that they don't deliver to my area. :)
