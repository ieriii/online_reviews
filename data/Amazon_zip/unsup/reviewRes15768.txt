The world Latin food menu was a little pretentious. I have to say that food here isn't better then any good mexi-cali place in Pilsen. The only thing this place has going for it is the very nice decor and you are definitely paying for it. We came there on a Saturday night and the people were dressed to impress. There is a very nice lounge area outside the restaurant floor that seemed like a nice place to hang out. I ordered the skirt steak medium and it came out well done. The shrimp ceviche was tough and over done. I've been spoiled with salmon poke in Hawaii and the salmon ceviche just doesn't do it for me anymore. At least the valet parking was only $5 =)
