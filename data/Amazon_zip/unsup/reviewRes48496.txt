AWESOME BRUNCH!!! AWESOME AREA! The "meat packing" district of Chicago is mimicking the meat packing of NYC. New trendy restaurants, unique apartment buildings, and cobble stone streets. What a great experience. The Publican had incredible Sunday morning brunch. A girlfriend and I decided to indulge ourselves with some coffee, bloody mary's (they come with green line beers) and an appetizer of banana/walnut bread with ricotta cheese. WOW- I couldn't have asked for a better starting to my morning. I had the omelet with brocolli, peppers, asparagus, and gouda cheese. It was excellent. My friend had the Scrapple- and the entire plate was cleaned! We also ordered a side of hash browns which were to die for. All in all- what a great Sunday morning brunch, in a great little area...we did wonder over to the Market to find some great finds. MMM
