Shaw's Crab House is the preeminent seafood house in Chicago. From the clubby atmosphere to the super friendly staff and only the freshest seafood, flown in DAILY, you can't beat Shaw's for a wonderful meal. The Oyster Bar can be fun if not a bit noisy, especially when there is a live combo playing. Always check the menu for what is seasonal, that is their specialty. Too, if you have a favorite fish, check out their website. They list when a particular fish is in season and when you can expect to find it on their menu. Shaw's has several festivals built around seasonal selections. Keep an eye out. As Shaw's is managed by the Lettuce Entertain You Enterprise, it's best to sign up for their frequent diner card, especially if you find yourself there frequently. Points add up quickly and you can get a significant savings on your check in very little time. Tell Lewis the Maitre d' and Martin at the bar I sent you.
