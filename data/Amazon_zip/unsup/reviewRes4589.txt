It's like coming home and that's how they treat you. I sat at the bar and no less than 3 different guys tended to my gastronomic yearnings. They guided me to the Sicilian white wine, awesome and then it only got better with the "JLT". That's J for jowl. Yes, the decadence of bacon is surpassed with perfectly cooked pig jowl. This sandwich topped with a sexy sunny egg and is filled with yellow heirloom tomatoes and frisee. It is essentially the classic French frisee and lardon salad brought to a sandwich.  From there to the octopus of which I have never had better. Chew not, this octopus was nearly fluffy with a crisp charred exterior. The salsa verde of marjoram, chervil was of perfect acidity and portion.   Always packed and for good reason. Try it between 2:30 and 4:30pm
