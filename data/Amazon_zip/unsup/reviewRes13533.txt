UPDATE (2/6/12): I was contacted by Glenn, who offered an explanation of his pricing decisions. While I still feel that the pricing needs work, I did remove an unfounded accusation from my initial review. Also, he offered amends, which I appreciate. _____________________________________________________________ Glenn's Diner was an okay dining experience, even though... The service was top notch. It's best to get reservations. It's not a large joint. Also, they won't seat you if your entire party isn't there. You'll have to saddle up to the bar, since standing in front of the chalkboard is likely awkward. Also, you may want to eat earlier than 8 p.m. because they will start posting "OUT" signs next to some of the fresh fish dishes. The BLOODY MARY ($8) in a pint glass was a meal, complete with a large shrimp on a skewer, cantaloupe piece (not as large as some pics on here), celery stick, and carrot stick. It was good, but it might be worth a splurge on top shelf liquors. Also, I didn't stir it enough or something because it was extra spicy toward the bottom. The LOBSTER FETTUCCINE ($24) included plenty of large lobster pieces and four large texas toast, garlic bread pieces. It was enough for two meals. As the waiter said, it was good today and it'll be good tomorrow. I tasted my friend's dishes -- one had an interesting spicy corn side with a fish, while the other had Asian mahi-mahi. Also, one friend had the clam chowder (which includes bacon, so I couldn't partake), but she didn't exclaim that it was the best she ever had. So, why was it just an okay trip? My pescatarian verdict is that while GD knows how to cook fish, but I think the flavor is on the bland side. The descriptions on the blackboard sounded great, but then the execution of the dishes weren't as creatively flavorful. As I like to do, let's talk price. Frankly, almost all of the main entrees were $20+. I know, fresh seafood isn't cheap. Yet I've had really good fresh fish entrees that were under $20 before. We split the bill evenly at $43 each. Ouch. I can't be too salty though, since I got two meals out of my order. I kind of wish that I'd hit The Southern again instead. I think I'd go back to Glenn's Diner for the Bloody Mary and appetizers with friends during warmer weather.
