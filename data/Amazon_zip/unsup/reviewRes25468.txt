Ahhh Geja's. This place is soooo dreamy and super romantical. You just get swept away in all the romance this place provides and you get good food too! Oh what a treat. This place is great for cheese lovers and sauce lovers. And chocolate lovers too. I like sauce - on my own terms - so this hits the spot with me able to dip to my liking. And all the choices!  I suggest getting a premiere dinner and a premiere dinner ala carte (sans the cheese app and choc fondue dessert) per couple as alot comes out with the appetizer and dessert and is def enough for two to share. Unless of course you both are die hard cheese and choc lovers and prefer not to share...then induldge, my friends. FYI, there is a special on http://opentable.com, offerring $60 worht of food for $30, which reminded me of Gejas: http://spotlight.opentab must. get. one. now.
