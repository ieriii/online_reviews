So... Seated after it took more than twice as long as we were told, which is awesome with two kids. Oh yeah, they said 15 minutes and instead of offering us a cup of coffee instead told us we could go two doors down to Starbucks top buy some. Now another 15 minutes before a waitress came over to offer coffee or anything. Told us she'd be right with us (she had to rush over to the table next to ours to snap a picture for them). Only reason we didn't leave is after committing so much time to waiting, the prospect of another wait (even a reasonable one) with our kids someplace else wasn't in the cards. My expectation is the food will be fine. Been here before but never again. (Don't get the corned beef hash.)
