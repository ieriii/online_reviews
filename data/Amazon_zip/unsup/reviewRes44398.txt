Excellent neighborhood sushi place. Tasty rolls, great music if you like an 80's experience - Billy Idol to Journey (you almost feel like you are in a club, not a restaurant). Average service and packed to the brim on a Wednesday night. Lots of couples with a bottle of wine - it is BYOB. We were one of two tables in the entire restaurant without a bottle. Get there early as it does fill up quickly. I especially like the fried calamari appetizer. Does anyone else think the calamari nuggets look like tater tots? Two rolls and an appetizer cost $27 plus tip. Not bad for a quick bite to eat and some pretty healthy and creative sushi.
