I'm going to knock them up a star based on my brunch experience yesterday, on the Independence Day holiday. I was brunching with a quartet, so on occasions like these, you have to be a little more flexible. Uncommon Ground wasn't my first choice, but I'm glad that we went because my food was excellent this time.  Plus, the service was very good, and I had an A La Card that I was able to use. However, I have to complain yet again about the disparity between their actual menu and their website menu. I showed up primed for the Italian sausage scramble and the strawberry-basil lemonade. No dice on either one; I also noticed several other discrepancies. Why can't they keep their online menu up-to-date? Even if it's not a purposeful bait-and-switch, it's still annoying and inconvenient. That said, I ended up loving my brunch dish AND my drink, so ultimately no harm was done. My ladyfriend, who obviously knows me so well, pointed out the Templeton Tea--mint tea, Templeton rye, and mint syrup. Sold! I squeezed a little lemon juice in there, and it was the perfect refreshing cocktail for mid-morning on a hot summer day. Brunch was Huevos Uncommon, with black bean corn cake, ancho-chili sauce, chihuahua cheese, and, in my case, the eggs scrambled rather than over-easy. It also comes with some fried corn chips on the side. Simply put, it was one of the best southwestern-style breakfast dishes I've eaten in recent memory. So, so tasty and satisfying. I'd be willing to go again now. I just won't look at the menu ahead of time.
