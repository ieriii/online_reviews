The Ahogada is great. I stopped by for breakfast the other day and just missed it (it stops at 10 am). They had empanadas as a consolation prize before lunch started at 11. They were amazing. I took one to go and it was still amazing the next morning. Every time I go here I get a drinking chocolate and churros. Both are worth a visit here alone.
