I can't tell if Pequod's wants to be a pizza place with a bar or a bar that serves good pizza. Because of this I think it doesn't amaze at either. The bar is nothing special. Much like any in Chicago with an ok beer selection. The pizza is very good, I cannot deny that. I've gone a couple of times now and this most recent time was the best. The staff has always been nice, but the decor is just ok.
