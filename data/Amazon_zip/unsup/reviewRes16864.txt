Hard to be disappointed with any Kleiner designed and inspired restaurant. Our group was impressed by Carnivale, its cavernous atmosphere and a waiter that had his details so exact, quick and clear that we think his day job is an auctioneer. Started with a nicely balanced margarita followed by the seasonal cheese and jam starter rounded out by perfectly spiced guacamole. Orders were primarily beef-perfectly prepared and seasoned.  What a nice way to spend a nice spring night with friends.
