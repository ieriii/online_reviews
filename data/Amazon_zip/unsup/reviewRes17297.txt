We celebrated my daughters 19th birthday here by her request, what a mistake! #1 Got there the place was 1/2 empty and even though we had made reservations, it took them another 15-20 minutes to seat us, were never approached while we waited to see if we wanted any drinks. #2 We were finally seated, now it took another 10-15 minutes for a waiter to take our appetizer order when it came he just threw a bowl of guacamole & chips on the table (guess he was not having a good day) #3 Our waitress had to keep yelling the specials over the next tables loud party rather then just repeat her self. # 4 NOW TO THE FOOD, I have eaten at probably at 10-15 different Cuban, Mexican & Puerto Rican restaurant in Chicago and I have to say they have Nothing to worry about. I had the Palomilla Stake (tasteless) my wife had the gamiest pork chop she & I have ever tasted ! my daughter had the Lechon, that tasted as it had been laying under a warmer for a few nights. I was born & raised in Cuba so I know what Latin food should taste like & let me tell you last night I found out what poor & extremely over priced Latin food taste like! even the desserts were horrible the Coffee??? flan was bitter! (how can you screw up a flan!!! ) The last surprise was the bill!, I knew coming in that Carnivale it was not a cheap venue how ever the price compare to the quality & service.......never again! I should have kept to my original plans t o go to Al primo canto or Laguardia. Three RED X's to Carnivale!
