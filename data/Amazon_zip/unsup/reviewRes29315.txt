To update my previous bad review, I was impressed that the owner contacted me and apologized for my experience. Good PR work. For that, I'm willing to add a star. However, as anyone who has worked in the restaurant business knows (and I happen to be one of those people), if your customers have a bad experience, they won't be back and they will tell other people to not visit the establishment. All restaurants/cooks have their bad nights when things are not going quite as well as expected, but there is little excuse for food that is not fresh and dishes that are not clean. Gray bean sprouts are unacceptable. I've had my share of Pad Thai and can say that it's not a difficult dish to prepare. My noodles were clumpy either because they were sitting for a long time, were overcooked or (and I really hope this wasn't the case) microwaved. As mentioned previously, the prices and service were decent. Although I think it's great customer service to offer a free or discounted meal to a disgruntled patron, I am not really interested in trying the place out again for the previously mentioned reasons. Quality control doesn't seem to be at the top of this list here and that's where my reluctance comes in.
