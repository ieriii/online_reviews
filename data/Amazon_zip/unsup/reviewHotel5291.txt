I don't care what anybody else says, this Hotel sucks. 117.00 for room and 36.00 for parking (which they will lie and tell you no other parking is available). I found clothing left by a previous guest under the bed. You had to flush the toliet 3-4 times before it finally had enough power to flush. Hair was on the toliet seat and in the tub. I had to use stck a washcloth in the bathtub hole to keep my bath water from draining because there was no bathtub stopper. The flatscreen T.V remote control had a missing poweron/off button. The volue and channel buttons were confused. The walls are so thin that I heard every word of the guys next door.. When I called to complain, they told me that it was the only room left. What a ripoff. I found out later there is parking down the street that's so much cheaper, bu they siad it wasn't anywhere else to park. The housekeeprs are lazy, rude, and the front desk agents were rude, unprofessional, mean, and I must also add GHETTO!!!! I will NEVER stay at another red roof, more less this one!!!!! There service sucks!
