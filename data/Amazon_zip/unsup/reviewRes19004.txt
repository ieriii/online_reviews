Like everybody said, the tortas here are pretty good. We had the Pepito, the chorizo one, and the goat one, and they were great! A little expensive for basically a sandwich. They're all around $10 and up.  The place can be a zoo at times, where the wait can be as long as an hour, which is another thing I don't like about this place. The churros are good, but nothing to write home about. A little expensive as well.
