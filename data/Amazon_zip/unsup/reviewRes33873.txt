This place is like a well-oiled machine. A delicious, inexpensive, well-oiled machine. I had the falafel and the baked spinach pie. Both vegan, and just over $6 total. It was maybe five minutes from the time I walked in until I was sitting down with my food. My dining companion had the falafel and the lentil soup, the latter of which he claims is outstanding. I got my falafel SPICY HOT and it was PERFECT. I agree with my homie Kiarash Z. that it was not very warm, which kind of bothered me, enough for me to drop it down from a perfect five-star rating. But other than that, this meal was enough to convince me that if I lived in Chicago, I'd probably eat here (at least) once a day.
