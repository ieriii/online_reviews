Well, we actually did eat here. Friday, relatively early in the evening. They put us as a couple in a back room that was dominated by a table of 8 or so people who were having a grand time. Their boisterousness was a somewhat good sign until we realized that they didn't even have their drinks yet. It was tough to hold a steady side conversation without being drowned out. Great space for a small semi-private party, but a bad one for multiple conversations. Regardless of atmosphere, we were enticed by the menu's Louisana style offerings. As such, one of us had the gumbo, the other got a shrimpburger. Both arrived in relatively short time, but were a bit bland. We were really hoping for some actual spice, but to no avail. Perhaps if we go back we could specify to increase the heat? The gumbo's presentation, consistency, and many of its flavors were there, but it really lacked any umph. The shrimpburger seemed to have not been seasoned at all. The waitstaff helped make up for the lacking food and atmosphere. Our waiter was attentive and considerate. We will try this place again if only because of that and a hope that the kitchen will up the heat (and flavor) quotient in the near future.
