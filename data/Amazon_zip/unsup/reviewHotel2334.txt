I stayed here for a convention over Memorial Day weekend. Like other reviewers mentioned, the location really cannot be beat. It's right in the middle of everything, and it was an excellent location to explore the city from. From my experience, the staff is incredibly helpful and kind. Downsides are definitely the lack of mini fridges (!) and the size of the rooms, which were a definite squeeze for me and the 3 other people I stayed with. There was almost no space for our luggage, which was a problem. What irked me most though was probably the paid internet. This place isn't cheap; if a Motel 8 has free wi-fi, why doesn't this hotel? Overall a good experience though. Would recommend.
