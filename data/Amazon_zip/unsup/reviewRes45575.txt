I have been here a few times, and they have all been wonderful experiences. I haven't hung out their that much, I mainly go for dinner, and the mac and cheese is amazing!! I think it is a good beer selection, anything with Guiness and hard cider on tap is wonderful! Going there soon with a group, so we shall see how that goes!
