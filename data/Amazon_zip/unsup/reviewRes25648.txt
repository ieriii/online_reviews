This is one of my favorite low-key places. I like the European Cafe flair, and appreciate that they never make you feel rushed. You can sit forever and talk, and they only give you the check when you are ready for it. The artopitas with potato salad are my absolute favorite. I recently had one of the salads, and it was OK. But I have never had an artopita there that I didn't like. Plus the frappes are such a delight. Pleasant and courteous staff, good food, and nice atmosphere. You can beat that!
