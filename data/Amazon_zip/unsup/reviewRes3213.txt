Cant go wrong with this place. I have had some of the sandwiches and the chicken tenders. My favorite sauce is definitely the Seoul Sassy, but the buffalo is also quite good. You certainly get what you pay for and even more sometimes. More than once I have received more tenders than I ordered. Will certainly go again.
