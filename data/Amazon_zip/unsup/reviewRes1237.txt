I used to work across the street from Doug's Encased Mmeat Palace and I ate here fairly frequently. And I have to admit one of the proudest moments of my adult life was when he looked up from his pad and said to me "What will you have Sadie?" He knew my name! And my name never sounded so sweet as when Hot Doug uttered it. So yeah, I had a bit of a crush on Doug, but who can blame me? He's creative, smart and runs a tight ship. And those nipsterish glasses, ohlala. Oh, so you want to hear about the food? The fries are crisp and tasty, and he offers tater tots as well, which are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The duck frites are all that that you've heard, and more. I normally ordered the Elvis-a polish with onions and mustard or a corndog, both of which I loved. I stayed away from the fancy dogs but if that's your think then you should definitely try them. Be prepared to wait, but Justin and the others do a great job of finding you a table, so don't worry about how busy it is, if you want to eat there, you will be able to do so. And believe it or not, if you want to go when its not busy, get there right at noon. It normally gets busier around 12:15 or so. And he carries fun Dr. Brown soda flavors like Celery. Ok, I don't drink it, but it's kinda cool knowing its around.
