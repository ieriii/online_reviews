Must have got the worst seat in the place. They have a bunch of tables for two where the neighbors literally have to move the table to let u slide in - and my wife weighs 120Ilbs! Really hate that! This was about 1.30 on a Sunday afternoon. Was ready to walk out at that point, but the day was saved by my wife's delight at her gluten-free burger which she claimed to be superb. .... by which time the crowd had thinned out. The draft Stella, however, wasn't quite right and it's unlikely I'll return.
