After living down the street for 4 years, I'm surprised it took me this long to come here. The rundown: Is there really good food? YES Is there good service? SORT OF Do they refill water regularly? NO (hence, service) Are the portions large? NO Is this place cramped? NO (Avec is my "cramped" standard) Is this place worth the money? NO I thought the food was actually quite overpriced for tapas-style dining. We ordered the spicy pork rinds (not spicy at all, more like sprinkled with cheese, not impressed). We also had charcuterie plate, steak tartare, and pork belly which were all excellent (4-star range). There were two of us gals sharing, and after this amount of food, we felt content and not overstuffed. Total: $66.60 (for 3.5 small plates, may I remind you) I expect to be overstuffed for that price. I'm Asian, so sue me. Therefore, I won't be coming back anytime soon. Sure the food is good, but not that good. P.S. Publican doesn't accept Discover Card. What restaurant these days doesn't accept Discover Card? Lame.
