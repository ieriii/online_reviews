I love you Rick Bayless even though you snubbed me at the GCM BBQ this year (long story, not going to get into it here, haha) Anyways, went back to XOCO again (how can one not?!) and this time had the pork belly caldo (they recently started serving this after 11am instead of 3pm) and boy was i happy to have the soup... rich, deep flavor and the pork belly, of course, was tasty as usual finished lunch with hot chocolate with soy milk and also a churro definitely the highlight of my day!!!
