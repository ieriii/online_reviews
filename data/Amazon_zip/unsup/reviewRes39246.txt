Oh, yum. I had a wonderful meal here last week. My boyfriend and I arrived at old-people time so we didn't have to wait for a seat, which was delightful. We started off with the pickles and marbled rye appetizer, which was a perfect little nibble. We also shared the pumpkin ravioli with browned butter, walnuts and huckleberries. This was exactly as tasty as it sounds and I wanted it to be my entree. However, because I have the appetite of three grown men, I also ordered the butternut squash risotto entree, which could have been a hair warmer but was rich and creamy deliciousness. The boyfriend was craving a burger and fries and was not disappointed. Finally, not satisfied with the amount of harm already perpetrated upon my body, I decided that we needed to share the crazy cheese doughnut dessert. It's just ridiculous and heavenly and wrong but very, very right. If you're into the sweet-savory thing, don't skip it.
