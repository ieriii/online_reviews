I love INDIE... have been there since it was a tiny room.... now indie is expanded, so I hardly have to wait to be seated anymore. The food is consistently good. I've had both Thai and sushi.I am a traditional sushi eater.. and was suspicious of this thai and sushi place at first... but wow!! the sushi-sashimi is always fresh at a reasonable price. Recently I am now more adventurous and try their tasty and creative rolls ... summer passion is my favorite. They always have special rolls, which make each visit more fun... the fun part is to decide if i am going with the special or the one I usually have. The Thai food is great too. Today I decided to go with their special, crispy chicken with curry... can't remember the name... but it tastes really really good. I'm excited to see their next special and to see if I am going with the sushi or the thai.
