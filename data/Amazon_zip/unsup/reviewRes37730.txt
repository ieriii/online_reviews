I don't get the appeal here. I was happy to give it a try, and pretty impressed by the back restaurant space since I had no clue it was there. I had passed it by many times thinking it was just a divey bar. It has a cool feel, and indeed one of the best beer lists I've ever seen and the menu is far more upscale then I expected. But honestly? The food just wasn't all THAT great. I was excited to see that they offer skatewing and gave it a try. It was good. But I make it better. I shouldn't make it better. I can't cook any better than I can name the entire Bears defensive line (which I can't).  My BF got the bouillabaisse and I think that overall, that was the dish that really brought it down for us. Ugh.  That's not to say I wouldn't go back, but I'd probably not have such high expectations.
