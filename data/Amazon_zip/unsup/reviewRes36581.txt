I have eaten here twice and I want to like this place but I just can't do it. I probably will never come back ever. The positives: great location, nice decor, large menu and food comes out incredibly fast. Now the negatives: this place is really expensive for breakfast it will cost 2 people around 40 bucks and this is only for 2 breakfasts, a coffe and a juice. This place also charges for everything. You want a little salsa on the side, bam you get charged...umm I just spent 15 bucks on eggs and you want another 2 bucks. Wow!!! Speaking of eggs it is $2.09 for an extra egg here...umm Trader Joe's sells a dozen for $1.29, maybe I should bring my own. This place also uses the small eggs too..no X-Large eggs here. It is all yolk and no white. Remember the positive on how fast your food comes, well there is a down side to that. The chefs do not put any love in what they are making. My Eggs Benedict came out with the yolks completely hard...I have never experienced that before. We also had to hunt down the waitress to show it to her, she never came back and said, "How is everything?". The yummy red potatoes that come with every dish had completely hard uncooked potatoes mixed with the cooked ones. Yummy!!! The sign of a lazy uncaring chef. This is unacceptable because it wasn't like there was a huge crowd or this was the weekend. Also when you pay the bill the lady at the register doesn't even ask you how everything was...she is cold and unpleasant...like the food here! I tried this place twice and had problems both times. Now for everyone giving this place 4 and 5 stars...do you know how to cook breakfast? For 40 bucks I will come over and cook for you in your kitchen ...don't waste your money here...plus you won't have to get out of bed and find a parking spot in the cold. Think about it!!!
