I was highly disappointed. The room itself and atmosphere was nice, but I had a terrible parking experience. Seems to be that b/c they're an expensive hotel they think they can absolutely gauge their guests on all fronts.  I paid for parking which I thought was $45 for 24 hours (still really high). Come to find out the hard way that it's 24 hours or up until 3 pm the next day, which comes first. In my case, I was parked for about 21 hours and paid $74!!!!!!!! Outrageous. I spoke to a couple different people and got no where. "it's the policy"  My policy - stay elsewhere. Nice hotels aren't hard to fine, go with one that has better service and concern for their guests.
