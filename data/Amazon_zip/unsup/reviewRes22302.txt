Well, we got in right away. We made the huge mistake of ordering as if we were at an Americanized Chinese restaurant. What we ordered was good, but I don't recommend the Mongolian Beef, Potsickers, Kung Pao, or Crab Rangoons. We actually received the CRs by mistake. We were told they would be taken off our bill, but they weren't. We didn't say anything, because we waited for what seemed like eons of looking around the room for our server, who was MIA for the entirety of our dinner. After doing some quick research, this is what I plan to order if we return: Dry Chili Chicken, pickled cabbage and Mo Po Tofu.
