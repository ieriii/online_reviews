I've only been here 1 time...some time ago...and I really liked it...but once I went to Texas de Brazil I changed my mind lol...well I kinda did...food was good...salad bar too but not much of a selection...and I really didn't like the location of the salad bar...one more thing...we had reservations and we still had like a 20min wait...
