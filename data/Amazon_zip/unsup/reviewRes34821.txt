Let me start by saying, I am no Sushi Connoseur however...I am a serious food lover! Not just any ol' food, good food...great food, orgasmic food. Ok, now thats out of the way...Sushi X has excellent quality Sushi. Did I mention that it is BYOB? Well in case you didnt know, now you do! I checked out Sushi X with a couple of my lush friends and we shut that mother DOWN! I am surprised we are still allowed in there! I had the Godzilla (so Americanized, I know) but it was so tasty. I also had wasabi mashed potatos, they were good but i have had better. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good quality sushi. Enjoy!
