I think I found my new home. But I didn't feel that way initially. After waiting in line for about forty-five minutes, I was growing frustrated (as an aside, they should re-design their entrance, or make another entrance, since they want to cater to so many VIPs). Finally they let us in and we luckily obtained some seats at the bar. The bartender was great, and the drinks were nothing less than exceptional. The music (a lot of Tom Waits) was at a perfect volume and allowed for conversation. I don't think I've ever waited so long and been so pleased by the end of the night. A nice change of pace from the other places in the neighborhood. If you don't like this place, I probably don't like you.
