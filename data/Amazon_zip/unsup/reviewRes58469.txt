I'm just going to bullet point my issues with The Gage...there are a few...1. Service is hard pressed to explain/give food pairings for their wine. They basically give the same flavor profile for every wine. Medium bodied, nice tannins with bold fruit...(sometimes they mention something like dark cherries or something..but this is basically what you are getting)2. The management appears to like to stand around in their shirts and ties and just stare at the tvs in the bar. What about getting dirty and helping your staff with their drink orders that (i agree with many previous statements) take a while.3. When asking my server if i could get more water, he responded I'll get the busser right away. Hey why don't you get the water yourself, you have been standing by the wall for the last 20 mins watching the tv with your boss.4. this is the worst one above all. Can someone explain to me way a nice place like this downtown has staff that can apparently smoke on the job. My server smelled of cigarette smoke so bad that i feel like a cloud was following him. Tacky i say...
