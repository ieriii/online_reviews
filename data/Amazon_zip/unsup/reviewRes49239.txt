Good coffee, the danishes/pastries look good (I didn't have one, but they look good), the music was nice and low until just now (Red Hot Chili Peppers- ew and no thanks), uncomfortable bench, but nice lounge area. The internet is super slow, though. It is really cramping my style. I have a ton of work stuff to do, and this is slowing me down. Almost to the point of me leaving and finding another wifi location. Lame. You have to spend more than $5 to use your credit/debit. This is a horrible review, but this place has made me crabby.
