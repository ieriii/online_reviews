Maybe it's just that at the end of a long, lazy Sunday afternoon of watching movies, pizza tastes really good, but I thought the pizza from this place was really delicious. We got a thin-crust one with sausage, onions & green peppers. Delivery took a little longer than expected but there was a snowstorm outside so I'll blame that. Need to check into whether Art of Pizza will deliver to my place in the West Loop...hope so!
