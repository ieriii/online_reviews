Wilde is awesome. The atmosphere is amazing, but unlike most pub joints, there's actually space in here so that you don't have to worry about some drunk Irish dude spilling his shitty Guinness all over you. (Hey, it happens). Have had many great meals here - the best things (in order) are the dill ranch dressing (bury me in it!), the curry, and the sticky toffee pudding. Would give it 5 stars but lots of things on the menu are kind of bland. This is probably just because Irish food (save for the curry) tends to be a bit bland. For great ambience and food and good people watching, you can't do wrong at Wilde.
