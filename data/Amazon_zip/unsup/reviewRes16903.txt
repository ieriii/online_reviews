Alice in Wonderland meets the fifties! The decor is amazing with the long draped curtains from ceiling to floor and the high backed chairs. Some people may not agree with the fact you have to wait in line to be seated, but I love it. It goes with the speakeasy mentality and also prevents drunkened idiots ruining a great experience for others. Most liquors are hand crafted and you can't find better cocktails anywhere else, but you are definitely paying for them. This is a great place to meet your friends for a cocktail, but not hang around all night unless money is not an issue.
