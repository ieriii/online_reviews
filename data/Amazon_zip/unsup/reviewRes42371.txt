i am a fan. finally some good pho - AND some. as always - i always go for the beef slice pho and some spring rolls. both were excellent. i like to dip my fresh spring rolls in the fish sauce - both were great. luckily my bf ordered the pork chop with rice - which is my second fave dish. both were very delicious. he ordered the one that came with eggs - i could do without the egg but it was great anyway. go here for pho!
