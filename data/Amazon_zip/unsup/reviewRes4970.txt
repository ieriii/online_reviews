This place gets packed during dinner and it's definitely a different dining experience than if you go for brunch. The one time we went for dinner we were squished between people on the communal table. This is why I now tend to come here only for weekend brunch right around 11:30 when they open. Note that you can go in through the building to the right of the outdoors entrance as sometimes they don't open the outdoors gate until a little bit after 11:30, doesn't matter in the summer, but on a cold winter day, waiting 5 mins outside matters. Service is great if you come early as there aren't as many patrons and the waiting staff isn't quite as swamped. The food has been very consistent in the now ~10 times I've been here. Recently I began trying some dishes that were off my list of staples for purple pig such as 1) Cauliflower- not a veggies kind of person, so normally I fill the table with meat dishes, but I was in a particular kind of mood for some cauliflower this past weekend and decided to give it a shot. It was delicious! I almost ordered another one. 2) Pork live pate- again a new dish for me, normally I go with the neck bone marrow spread but decided to try something new. Creamy, flavorful, until you realize just how much there is in an order. The fattiness of the pate becomes somewhat overwhelming at the end of the meal for the two of us as there was a very good portion given to us. So I do advise perhaps ordering this when you have a party of 3 or 4 so it doesn't get overwhelming.
