I was in town on business and had Yelped this restaurant ahead of time and put it on my "to do" list. I was glad I did. Although it was stiflingly hot outside and there was quite a wait for dinner, my companion and I waited only about 15 minutes before being escorted inside to a seat at a communal table. I'm all for communal tables but I was seated on the leg and with a short dress on it was going to be difficult for me to sit comfortably. Luckily my companion switched seats with me.  Before we even ordered my companion and I enquired about getting separate checks. We were told they don't do separate checks but we can pay with separate credit cards *puzzled look*. Since we both were on business accounts that was going to be a problem. Nevertheless, we ordered and shared our plates of peas and bacon (OMFG), cauliflower (meh), Taramosalata (yum), Octopus (delish) and Sepia with Almonds (ok). I still dream about the peas. I believe they were described as spring peas with fresh mint and bacon *drools*. I have seriously considered hanging out at the airport and accosting someone travelling to Chicago to bring me this dish upon their return. Of course there is probably a recipe I could get for this dish...I suspect I may even be able to make it myself.  But I digress. I also enjoyed two glasses of Vinho Verde which were perfect given the summer heat. I would have drunk the whole dang bottle but I was trying to impress my conference buddy. Go to the Purple Pig and enjoy. If you dine inside, the key (Rosetta Stone) for the ingredients is above your head written on the lampshades - no kidding!
