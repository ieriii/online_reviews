Still great pizza. But don't get onions. Ate there a couple Saturday's ago, ordered onions on a pizza, and I swear they were an inch high when the pizza came out. I love onions, but there were so many it ruined the pizza for me. Super nice hosting staff though. Very rare that the hosts of a busy restaurant would go out of their way to accommodate you while you're waiting for your party. A+ service.
