As a vegetarian and consummate neighborhood person, I was wary of going to eat downtown at a place that focuses on steaks. But I was pleasantly surprised. I've eaten veggie burgers in Chicago for nearly 8 years, and I'm usually disappointed (so basically stopped ordering them). But Wildfire has the best veggie burger I've ever had! Even in leftover form, which I just finished, the burger was still really flavorful and delicious. Oh, and my roasted veggies on the side were tasty, too. This really isn't the type of restaurant I usually go to, but I'd go back again for this burger. Server was really friendly and attentive, too, and we were seated immediately at 7:30pm on a weeknight.
