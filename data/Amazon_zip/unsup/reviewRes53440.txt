Can I really not give it 5?All the givens of a place like this are givens: brilliant service, perfect aroma as well as aromatics, and impeccable food.From the myriad of sensations of the first bite of fish roe to the powdering of a new take on A-1 Sauce all the way to slurping bubble gum tapioca from a straw, there is not a clunker in the menu. The experience is all you would expect and wish for, guaranteed. As for the boring, but all-important detail: I opted for the 12-course tasting, and it was plenty.I have nothing left to say. It really is a woohoo!
