Stayed here for a girls weekend because we got a great rate. Location was very good. We could walk to most of the Chicago tourist attractions. The decor is modern and cool. The rooms are tiny - I'd guess because it's a historic building - and there's no ventilation in the bathroom so everything stays wet all day. There's also no coffee maker in the room, because they have coffee service in the lobby every morning. They could use to update the elevator systems. They're extremely slow and everyone lines up to cram into a car because they'd rather be up against someone else than wait another 10 minutes for the next one to come along. A plus is the complimentary wine in the lobby every afternoon. Overall we had a good stay, but I do think the quality doesn't quite live up to the price. Oh, and sign up for Kimpton preferred guest program (free) to access free wifi.
