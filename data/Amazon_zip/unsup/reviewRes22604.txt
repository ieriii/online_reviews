Seeing as this is the first review I've written since taking down my original yelp account several years ago (don't ask me why), I'll state sarcastically, although emphatically, that I don't give out many five star ratings. This place though, took me by surprise. A good friend of mine who lives in SE China most of the year suggested it, as 'hotpot' for him now ranks up with the likes of (authentic) Philly Cheesesteak and Bourgogne escarcot in terms of preferred exceptional global regional cuisine. Magnific. My recommendation - go with the hotpot, and do forgo the option they provide to pick your own dishes (if you're not familiar, it's more or less a hot plate with a boiling cauldron of vegetables and broth of your choice which you... just think fondue. sort of). Get the sampler plate(?).. or whatever they call it. $17 / person, which - believe me - is incredibly reasonable considering the portions. Various vegetables, beef, veal, shrimp, squid, etc, etc (a smorgasbord). Anyway - as you can see, I enjoyed it. Just be prepared for a two to three hour dinner.
