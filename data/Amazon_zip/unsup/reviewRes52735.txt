My husband and I decided to have a night out when we received a buy one get one entree coupon in the mail. We couldn't have been happier that we tried it. The buffet alone was to die for. Then, the best part, the meat that they are known for - everything was wonderful. We felt SO SPOILED there. I particularly liked the pineapple, don't pass it up!!
