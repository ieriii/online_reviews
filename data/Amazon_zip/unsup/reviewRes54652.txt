I signed up here for the sole purpose of yelping about this place (i'm sure there will be others, but you get the idea).I have reservations and you make me wait 25 mins when there are 15 empty tables? Why? Did you think I wasn't going to notice them when you sat me? Service and Food average. Can't say I would go back.
