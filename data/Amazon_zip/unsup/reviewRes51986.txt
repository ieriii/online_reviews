"Worth the wait"? REALLY?? My first trip to Chicago obviously warranted a deep dish pizza experience. We ordered the Spinach sticks to hold us over for the 40 minutes it took for the small Supreme Pizza to fully cook. Spinach Sticks = Mozzarella Sticks with spinach mixed inside. I would've enjoyed this more if I wasn't constantly checking for embarrassing bits lodged between my teeth. I've got to say, I wasn't blown out of my Windy City mind. I'm willing to believe that this is a touristy out-of-towner stop and not quite indicative of the amazing pizza Chicago has to offer. Or I could just not be a Deep Dish type of person (my main gripe was with the crust). Years of low carb dieting can possibly traumatize a girl's eating preferences!
