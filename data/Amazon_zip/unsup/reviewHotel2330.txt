This review is for the public areas and meeting facilities only.  I just finished a two day class at this hotel which was held in its meeting/conference facility.  I loved it. The entire hotel layout is beautiful. It's bright, a bit busy and modernly decorated. All of the staff who I had interactions with, from concierge to the cleaners I passed in the hallway, were friendly and attentive. Although we were only provided coffee, tea and pastries in the morning and soda in the afternoon the spread was still exceptional. Everything was fresh and tasty, the coffee and hot water were refilled and kept hot. I passed another meeting room that had amazing a spread for lunch and then a spread that included cheese, ice cream or fruit for their afternoon snack (I was jealous but refrained from stealing their food). There is also a Starbucks in the hotel that makes quality drinks (unlike many hotel versions) so there is no need to hit the Starbucks across the street (like I did on my first day) before you arrive.  Another plus is it is in a very central location for shopping and eating downtown. I was very tempted to shop at Nordstrom during my lunch break.
