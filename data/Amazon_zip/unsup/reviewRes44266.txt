Oh Wakamono how I love thee! Why aren't you in my neighborhood but instead so far from me? If only we could be closer to each other so I could have you every day. Mmmm. At this point you realize that I love the food here. The scallop app is divine and I like to keep the spicy sauce to dip my sushi in after. So so good. If I had to choose between rolls then I would say my favorite roll is the snow white roll with super white tuna, almonds avocado oh my! I wish they delivered to me but the don't (big sighs). I hoped that when I moved from River West to East Village they would but alas, still no. The sad thing is they deliver to only a few blocks away. I tried to pull every trick in the book such as, "but you've delivered to my address before", and "I'll stand on the corner of the street" to, "please please I'll pay extra!" but no. I'll just have to wait till next time I'm in Boystown. Ultimately is worth the trip though especially because I would be one broke biatch if they did deliver! Go fill belly full of sushi and thank me later.
