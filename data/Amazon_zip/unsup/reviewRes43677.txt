So I've come around to thinking the food is better than 2 stars... but why are the hostesses/order-taker-people so curt, seemingly put-out by questions about the food, and generally unfriendly? If it was just directed at me, I'd guess it had something to do with my lack of good looks and possibly terrible breath, but I've seen perfectly friendly looking women and kindly old men get the same treatment.
