I loved the atmosphere of the lounge when I finally found the place. Without the little yellow light, this place would nearly be impossible to find. My friends and i passed it by at least 4 times. I felt quite stupid but oh well. Entering into the place and through the soft curtains, i felt like i was entering into a secret world. i absolutely loved the "alice in the wonderland" feel of the place, not to mention the purple and sky blue... Now to main and most important part of this review... THE DRINKS. $12 per drink is pretty hefty. Not sure if it was worth it but I still had a blast and the drinks were pretty good. The only thing I would complain about is the food. They definitely need to expand their food menu. I just wish they had french fries. it's a great place for a date esp if you're not paying :)
