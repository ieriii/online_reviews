My husband and I went here on a random Wednesday night. We didn't have many expectations, having read and heard about Graham Elliot a few times but not knowing about this particular restaurant. We were absolutely thrilled with the experience and can't wait to go back. The atmosphere was really cozy and laid back. The waiters were knowledgeable but not intimidating, with their converse sneakers and hipster haircuts. We didn't feel bad about asking for second of the "popcorn of the day" - a delicious white cheddar and truffle oil extravaganza. It was heavenly. I started with the wisconsin cheddar risotto----the one with the Cheez-its in it. It was pretty tasty, especially when you'd bite into a delicious nugget of bacon. Like a little bowl of Christmas cheer. The ceasar salad with the brioche twinkie was just outstanding. One of the best ceasar salads I've ever had. My husband had the Italian Beef, which he enjoyed-excellent beef tartar. We both had the Beef Stroganoff and agreed that it was one of the BEST steaks either of us had ever had, though mine was just a teenie tiny bit over-salted. :( Still and all, it was succulent and melted in our mouths.  I think it's a great sign that I can still recall these flavors all so vividly and cannot WAITTTTTT to go back. Well-worth the price!!!! Definitely will go back soon and get dessert!!!
