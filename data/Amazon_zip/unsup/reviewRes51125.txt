Visiting from DC, I've been looking online at some of my dining options in Chicago. I've heard a lot about Big Jones and decided to give a go this morning. It is this cute, boutique restaurant featuring Southern style/Creole dishes.  Being a beautiful Saturday morning we decided to sit on the cutest patio I have been on in a long time... as did everyone else. As soon as we sat down i noticed the entire, albeit small, patio completely fill up. I've been a server before and I was starting to get a little nervous for my dining experience. Thankfully, i had nothing to worry about. The food was absolutely amazing! I had the shrimp and grits, which was to die for and our server made sure the beignets (free!) were fresh. We all realized that our server was extremely busy, however, he never stopped taking care of us. It's been a really long time since I've had someone that was genuinely sincere and apologetic for the service taking a little longer than usual. It was refreshing that he actually had concern about us and went above and beyond his standard duties to ensure that we felt completely at home and well taken care of. This place has definitely lived up to it's reputation of "Southern Hospitality". After having some questionable experiences at other restaurants in Chicago, I would say hands down, that this place was the best. Southern food and the great hospitality; I would suggest this to anyone in the city or out......!!! Thanks to Big Jones for an amazing experience.
