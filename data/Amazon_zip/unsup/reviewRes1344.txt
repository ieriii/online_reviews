Oh. My. God. I rarely give 5 stars. But this was a no brainer. We were on a mission to find the perfect Chicago dog -- I've heard so much about it but have had yet to try it myself. We were determined. After a few flukes, I found this place. The line was long, which we took to be a good sign, bc heck, ppl wouldn't wait this long for a crappy dog right? The line moves fast, we were waiting 10 minutes, 15 mins tops. They have plenty of tables inside and an outdoor area too. And, after you order, it comes out within a few mins too - straight to your table. Talk about great service! - duck fat fries(3.50) - thin cut fries, not as much of the "duck" taste as i hoped there would be, but greasy and soggy all the same. yum! seriously! - lamb sausage($7) - with bits of mint in the sausage and topped with feta and crumbled kalamata olives. very very flavorful. - bratwurst (3.50) - wow. my fave BY FAR. slight beer flavor but in a good way. and when it's fully loaded with all the toppings - it really just can't be beat. - veggie dog (2.75) - he said it's better than most he's had. but c'mon, it's a veggie dog. whatever. - tator tots (2.50) - he was really excited when he heard someone in front of us ordering tator tots. so we got 'em too. but they're tator tots. nothing new or exciting here.. now if they dipped this in duck fat too, that's a whole new story... =D
