I was excited to try this place being billed as mexican street sandwiches, this was a sad disappointment. The suckling pig didn't have any flavor at all! Please put some salt or regular not pickeled jalapenos. Also, they didn't use a torta bun, the bread was some french loaf that was as hard as a rock. The price wasn't even close to street food, $12, thats crazy! The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because the churros and Aztec chocolate were very good.
