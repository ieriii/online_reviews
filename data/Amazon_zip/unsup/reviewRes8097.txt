Churrascos are always sating, and for me, the meat hangover the following day is really the measure of such an establishment. Though Chicago is well known for its meat, I was somewhat guarded about patronizing a brazilian restaurant in the Midwest. I will preface by saying that I have been to churrascos in Portugal, Spain, Brazil, California and Florida. They all have competition and a rich population of people familiar with and in demand of such a meal. Chicago has to be slightly different. The meat: High quality, well seasoned, and prepared on the salty side as they should be. The sides: I did not like all of the options, but the bananas were the best I have had in the U.S. The salad bar: An excellent combination of cool vegetables, as well as less traditional antipasta and other bits. I would say this restaurant keeps focus on the meat and sides. The drinks: Caiprihnas were very good but not that strong--my typical two turned into 4. This was overall the most expensive churrasco I have ever visited. The meal was $50 plus drinks. For Chicago, however, this was acceptable. I would give it 5 stars if the price were better.
