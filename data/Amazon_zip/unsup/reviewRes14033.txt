gary!!! i told gary i'd give him a shout out, he was our excellent server. we were that obnoxious table who showed up on a sunday night to celebrate a birthday an hour before the restaurant closed and then stayed and hour and a half after the restaurant closed and they were really very gracious about it.  the food was so good! only downside to showing up this late is watching the menu items get 86'ed right before your very eyes...there go the scallops! no, not the crab dip! regardless, i thoroughly enjoyed my whitefish except the coleslaw was god awful (way way way too much mayo). the crabcakes were another favorite, i recommend these as an app.  another downside - the music!  i swear to god i heard paula cole covering a u2 song, it was unbearable. i think they just played a lilith fair cd...i said something to the server about it and he said that's what the boss likes to listen to...iawn! i guess music shouldn't be important at a restaurant but it is to me.  music aside, glenn's has great food and great service.
