Meh. I agree with about every 5th or so review on here, that is to say I wasn't overly impressed. I agree that it's worth checking out because I'm not so sure how to aptly describe the ambiance and don't doubt that others have done so in the 800 or so reviews on here. That said, here's my thoughts: I love the birds on the wooden door that sort of blends in with the outside wall and almost pointed it out to my friends "isn't that a cool door?" (being in a group of 4 - the only first timer - and most of them go almost weekly). I'm thankful that one opened it before I opened my mouth. We waited to set up the table for 8 - meeting 4 people already there, and I checked out the front. Mixture of high backed chairs and booths for sitting. We were taken to the back. All interactions with the waiter were really awkward. He was too soft spoken for my liking. I enjoyed the music selection. My drink was good, and I did really appreciate that the waiter split the bill to charge all our credit cards - though I guess it's easy with each cocktail being exactly $12. Expensive, but not for what you get - an experience. Maybe I'll go again, but I definitely wouldn't go wait forever. 10pm on a Thursday worked for me... though it was a Thursday after the greatest Wednesday snowstorm in decades.
