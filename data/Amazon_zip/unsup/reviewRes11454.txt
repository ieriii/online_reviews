Take my advice, order carry out. My friend and I went there a couple of weeks ago and decided to get a drink at the bar before picking up the food. Yikes! It was like a sports bar inside: loud douchebags, unnecessary touching and it took forever to get a drink. I do like how they have those "growlers" of beer to go, but the atmosphere in the pick up area has good music and cute metal dudes to look at. I was forcibly shoved a piece of white pizza in the car on my way home and it was awesome. I will definitely not be visiting that bar anytime soon but will be carrying out again.
