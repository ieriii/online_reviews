The only words I muttered during the consumption of two (and a half... and the uneaten crust of my husbands fourth slice.. and would have been the crust of the adjacent table who didn't eat theirs if the waitress didn't swoop it away)... was "sweet baby jesus". I wish I had seven of these pizzas right now, just to get me through the night.
