Did not disappoint! I went to Bongo Room on a Saturday morning and timed it perfectly. I suggest getting there right at 9:00 if not a little before, that way you will be seated immediately.  My friends and I ordered the Breakfast Burrito, Chocolate French Toast Tower, and the Pumpkin Zucchini Flapjacks. All were excellent! The breakfast burrito came with a side of potatoes - absolutely phenomenal. I already ready to head back to the Bongo Room to try out some more tasty treats!
