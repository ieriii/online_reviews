I tried this place out because a friend of mine loves it. I knew before I went that he and I don't have completely overlapping taste in restaurants, but it's just a block from me so I figured I should try it sometime. The service was mediocre. Any place downtown that places a fork I've used back on the table isn't going to be making fast friends with me. Maybe that's picky, but I don't think a clean fork with each course is much to ask. The drink I ordered came back wrong. And the "butter" that was on the table wasn't actually butter. I like margarine - I have some in my fridge, next to the real butter - but at a steak place I kinda expect real butter because it goes better with meat than margarine does. If this place wasn't downtown I probably wouldn't have been quite so disappointed, but if you want a good steak and you're downtown, almost any other restaurant in River North can give you a better experience. Some will cost more, but there are still some places that aren't a lot more but are a lot better.
