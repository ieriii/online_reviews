Yum. This place was good. We ordered two dinners, two falafel and two beverages. My dining buddy had the lamb shawerma and I had the chicken shawerma. The dinners came with a pile of curry rice (delicious!) topped with the shawerma of our choice (I'm not a fan of lamb, but it was seasoned well, and my chicken shawerma which was served with sauteed onions was so good), hummus, pita bread, AND tabuli. The servings were huge. The falafel was really good but a little dry.  For everything we had, our dinner was less than $20. I would come back here in a heartbeat to try anything else on their menu, including their salad bar, their sandwiches, and their soups which all looked really good. This is a fast food joint and their service is what you would expect from that. Cash only- though there's an ATM on site if need be.
