A very special review for the short, brunette, female bartender: My friend and I ordered 2 vodka tonics at the Piece bar last night. When we got them, they were SUPER watered down. We kindly asked the bartender if she could make them a little bit stronger. She gave us a big smile, poured an extra shot in each glass, and then (to our surprise) turned to us and said, "that'll be $12." I'm sorry, but if you're going to charge extra to stiffen-up an extremely watered-down drink, at least give the patron some warning.
