Icosi-YUM! I am now an official member of the Clean Plate Club! Here's the scenario: Girls night out. Where oh where to eat? Italian? Done that. Mexican? Eh. Thai? Someone had it for lunch. I knowI I know I know! That funky little crepe place in Andersonvile! Savory crepes are ordered. Crepes arrive. EVERYONE is a member of the Clean Plate Club! Dessert crepes are ordered. Dessert crepes arrive. Now everyone has a CHARTER membership into the Clean Plate Club!  At the end of the meal I seriously thought Clean Plate Club membership cards were about to be handed out. Cannot wait to go back and renew my Clean Plate Club membership!
