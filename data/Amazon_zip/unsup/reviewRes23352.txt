Yum! Husband and I headed to Lao Sze Chuan to get our Chinese Food Fix on and glad we found a seat there! We started with the veg. spring rolls, quite good! Husband had the egg drop soup, which I couldn't recommend just by looking at it. It was VERY oily. He was only able to eat about 1/4 of the bowl, he realized that much oil would make him sick. Then we got our entrees. I had the three color bean curd which was really very very good. I'll go back, because I will absolutely be craving it within the next couple of weeks! Husband had the salt and pepper trio of shrimp, scallops and squid. He loved it. Really loved it! By far the most efficient, friendly, service we've had in Chinatown. And we've been just about everywhere in Chinatown, lol.
