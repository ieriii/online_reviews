My boyfriend, an avid beer aficionado, found this place and we were both excited to go - the reviews said it had great food and beer. We both ordered corn chowder soup (good) and two salads (both really bad). They didn't have a hefeweizen on tap (thumbs down from me), and their bottle list was significantly out of date. Add to that the slow service (although nice), it's highly unlikely I'll return.
