Very good. I like the niche that ge fills, bistronomic is a great term for it. Cutting edge appeal and playful attitude of moto but pared back a bit and at a price that is more affordable. Great execution on our dishes. The only lowlight (and it's only a relative one) was the pork loin. It had great flavor but it really suffered in comparison to the flat iron steak. Drinks and desserts were also great. Service was great, which seems par for the course judging by other reviews. I really liked the loud music but I could see that it isn't for everyone. If you like quieter meals than you probably would wish to be somewhere else. I, however, love restaurants that take chances like this with their atmosphere.
