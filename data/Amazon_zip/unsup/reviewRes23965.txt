Thursday night a couple of friends and I ate here. This was my sixth time eating here, so that should say something about how much I love this place and how delicious I think it is. Anyways, they have a nice assortment of sweet and savory crepes. The crepes are stuffed and nicely decorated. There was also a guitarist that night providing some entertainment. The crepe that I ordered was sooooo delicious. I created my own crepe, which included goat cheese, baby spinach, portabella mushrooms, roma tomatoes, red peppers, pine nuts, turkey ham, and their signature Icosium dressing, which I highly recommend. Creating a crepe costs $8.50 and the addition of meat is $2.99. Their sweet crepes cost a little less and are so good. My favorite sweet crepe is the banana with Belgium chocolate, coconut, and slivered hazelnuts (I think they're hazelnuts). Try this place out, it's great!!!
