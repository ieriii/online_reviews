Picture it: Taking my boyfriend to the auto show for Valentines Day as ever the good girlfriend. But good girlfriend had ulterior motives... Imagine me with my hands steepled mumbling "excellent" a la Mr. Burns possibly with a cat on my lap. I made it a stipulation that I would suffer through auto uninteresting-ness if he would let me pick the eatery for early dinner. So I finally got to go to one of the many places that has been on my "gotta try in Chicago" list. And this baby lives up to the excitement! Delicious food, amazing service, cozy atmosphere and fab drinks! We were there quite by accident during Restaurant Week so we did the whole tasting menu! Awesome! I can't wait to go back. The plates were so beautiful too!
