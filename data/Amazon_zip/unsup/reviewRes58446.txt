What a terrible experience. The manager was arrogant, rude, and would have nothing to do with any suggestions we gave him. We were placed directly next to a loudspeaker. Halfway through our dinner, this awful musician started playing music with the volume cranked up. The manager's response to us suggesting that he tell guests of the possibility of loud music in our ears in the middle of dinner was, Well you guys didn't have reservations anyway. Watery sauce on the pasta and ribs as tough as a hockey puck are just the tip of the iceberg.
