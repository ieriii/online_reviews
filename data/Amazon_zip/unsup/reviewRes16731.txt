I've been to Carnivale twice now and I think their food is quite delicious. Definitely try the guacamole and ceviche. I had their Bistek Palomilla and it was very flavorful - the fried yuca was amazing. My sister had the Arrachera and simply loved it - could not get enough! My boyfriend tried their Paella and that was plentiful and moist. I wasn't a fan of their mojitos, I found them to be too sweet. Their drinks aren't really that memorable, neither are the desserts. Stick to the appetizers and entrees. It's a bit overpriced as well, definitely make reservations regardless of what day you decide to go. The dining room is gorgeous and a 'must see.'
