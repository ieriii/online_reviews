Gorgeous outdoor space, perhaps the best in Chicago. The food is nothing spectacular but more than serviceable. Pastas were a tad overcooked. Our antipasti were quite good, especially the grilled vegetables. The bar area is an inviting space for pre-dinner drinks, and the crowd is lively and diverse. A winning spot.
