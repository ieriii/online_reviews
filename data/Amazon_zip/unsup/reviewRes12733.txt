I am shocked that anyone would give this place higher than 3 stars. This place is the worst restaurant I've been to in Chicago so far. Here's why: - Our waitress was atrocious. We waited 20 minutes for her to come to our table and the place wasn't even busy! - Drinks were bland. So bland I made her take mine back and told her I didn't want another. - Food was bland. Much like an earlier review, the best thing on my plate was the rice and beans. Oh, the bread and butter was decent, but definitely did not make up for the rest of the meal. - Food is way overpriced. You're paying for the ambience and that's about it. I've asked some of my friends about it and they've all had similar experiences. Will never go back there again.
