Wow! I'm reading some of the reviews off to my right, and there are some angry people out there. Goodness. Anywho, I had breakfast here recently, and I'd heard that the food was good, if not a bit expensive. And I couldn't agree more! I had the Gunthorp Farm Chicken Enchilada Skillet, and it was sooooooo gooooooooood! And the iced tea with special herbal additions was also very tasty, and perfect for a brunchy drink. I love the decor, and having this place near my house is a plus. I really appreciate that they grow so much of their own food. That's really cool! The only thing is that the price, for my wallet at least, is a bit high. We didn't pay for breakfast (father-in-law in town) but had we, I would have been sweating a little bit. This is definitely for richer folks, or as a once in a while breakfast treat.
