I LOVE fried chicken and so I was so excited to see this place open up in my neighborhood. Saw that Yahoo rated them the best fried chicken in the country. And I'm Asian, so I figure an Asian twist on fried chicken should be good, right? Well, I've been there twice now and I am sorry but I just don't get it. It's very bony, greasy, fried chicken. The sauces are not particularly memorable, and I've tried both. Over $10 for a half chicken (and that's the smallest fried chicken order you can get, I even asked if I could get less than the 6 piece half chicken order and they told me no because it would screw up their inventory). Oh, and when I think of a half chicken, I'm thinking I'm going to get half a chicken, meaning that I would get ONE leg, One wing, One breast, etc., Somehow my half chicken had 2 wings, 2 legs, and 1 breast and 1 other indistinguishable piece. Interesting interpretation of what "half a chicken" is, my half has 2 legs and 2 wings? The eat in area is tiny and the atmosphere is for a dive-y kind of place that should charge far less. Don't get me wrong, I LIKE dive-y places, if the food is good and the price is right. This place has you squished in picnic tables that you share with others with a big roll of paper towels that you share with everyone else, and I paid over $10 for my bony fried chicken.
