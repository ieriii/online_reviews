Best. Authentic. Inexpensive. Mexican. I've been to this Pilsen gem several times, and I've done take out even more times. Never disappointed. Some of my favorites include: asado de puerco, bistec tacos, tacos sabinas, and pollo al horno (half a baked chicken; this is not on the menu, you have to ask if they are serving it that day). Here's a tip: Whatever you order, get the FLOUR tortillas, trust me. They are the best you'll ever have, that's my promise to you. I believe they make them themselves, as opposed to having them delivered from a vendor. You will be sorry if you don't order them. Another *tip*: while the salsa that they give you with the complimentary chips and salsa (dine-in only) is great, ask for the "molcajete" salsa, a smoky salsa in which the ingredients are roasted and then ground in a stone mortar and pestle. YUM. Parking in the neighborhood is tough. Luckily, they have a free (albeit small) lot on the side street just east of the restaurant.
