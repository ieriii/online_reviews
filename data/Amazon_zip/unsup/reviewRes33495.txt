solid itialian cuisine! having recently visited rome and pompei i wasnt sure what to expect at mia. the reviews are very good and i would agree with them. i read a lot of complaints about the space and the tables being on top of one another. i felt there was adequate room and actually this place is quite spacious as compared with restaurants in rome so this was a non issue. we went here with a party of 12 and had extremely good service. the drinks were never empty and the serving of the food was timed right. we went with teh fantasia pizza and half chicken and potatoes. the chicken portion was quite generous and did not get completely eaten. the pizza hit the spot - very very good thin crust pizza. the serving sizes did not seem consistent - the spaghetti was an extremely large portion where as the tortellini was quite small. appetizers were all worthwhile from the calamari to different types of bruschette.
