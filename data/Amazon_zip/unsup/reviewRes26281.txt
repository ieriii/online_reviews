Finally tried mercat for brunch!!! so for some reason i goofed up on opentable and made the reservation for a different date but they were really cool about it and still gave us a great table that i asked for (hate communal seating) ... it took kinda forever to get our first mimosas, but things got much better as the meal went on. our waitress was nice enough to bring out just the champagne without the orange juice (who needs fillers right?!) the food was really great.. i loved all the dishes.. but the eggs and tomato sauce dish was not that great. best dish was the eggs benedict... but im a sucker for all benedicts so who knows. but u def get a lot for ur money, which is great. service was alright.. but we had to ask several times to get our table cleared of empty glasses and plates. this is def a place to come with the girls... if u havent tried it, u must.. bottomless drinks..good food.. what more could u ask for ;)
