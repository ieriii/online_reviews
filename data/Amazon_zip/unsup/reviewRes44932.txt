Yum! Such a mouthful of deep dish pizza can only spell out one thing in the end: F-O-O-D C-O-M-A. Literally, I think I napped after just one slice of these bad boys. Who cares if you don't finish the whole thing? It's still amazing after a day in the fridge, and Giordano's for leftovers is surely better than what I can make for lunch.
