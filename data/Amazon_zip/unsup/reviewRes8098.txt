I visited Fogo de Chao about a year ago and just realized that I never reviewed it... gasp! I like it very much. I went for lunch with a group of co-workers. It was great and as far as I know it's the exact same menu that they offer for dinner except that it's about $10-$15 cheaper. Plus, it gives you the rest of the day to try to digest all of that food rather than falling asleep with it. The food was great, the buffet was huge, the meats are tasty and they have an extensive variety (so pace yourselves), and the service was great. The first gaucho asked me how I liked my meat cooked and returned every time with what seemed like specially cooked meats just for me. I will definitely return. We all had a great time and returned to work in a food coma.
