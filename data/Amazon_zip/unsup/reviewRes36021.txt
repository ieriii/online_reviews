I have been a zealot of the Sun Wah Beijing Duck Dinner for almost two years. If I have a friend in town who eats meat, SW is first on the tour stop. The meal is $30 and can be split between 4-2 people. The amount of bang for your duck-buck is just plain silly. The server hand carves a whole duck at your table, providing you with delicious puffed buns and pickled daikon to make duck sandwiches. Duck soup, duck fried rice and homemade sorbet follow. The woman who serves your Duck (I believe she's the daughter of the owner/founder) is a master of the celestial art of fowl carving and should be treated and tipped accordingly.  PS this dinner was noted in Time Out Chicago as one of the BEST DISHES OF '09. I cannot agree more, it's one of my top five in the whole city! http://chicago.timeout.c
