I ate here at a friend's suggestion. I tend to stay away from those restaurants described as gastropubs or "fancy" places because although the food tends to be great, I really don't care for the atmosphere or the amount of money I have to dish out. For me this was truly a great experience, I just couldn't stop eating. It was simply delicious. I acknowledge that I didn't recognize half the ingredients, but I ordered what I thought sounded good. We had the cauliflower with lentils dish and French toast with rhubarb, blood orange, and this awesome cream topping. I apologize I don't know the actual terms, but it was hands down delicious. It is very reasonably priced and we had great service. I will go back and continue to be wowed.
