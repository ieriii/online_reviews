I've been going to MP for a few years and didn't know I hadn't written a review. I came here to update what I thought was a lukewarm review, but I never actually wrote one. Even better ... because the review I thought I had written would not have been fair. I've always liked it there, but now I really love it. On my last, recent trip, my food was truly outstanding. I had shrimp/fish tacos and they were sooo good. The fish was grilled and very cumin-colored. I am not sure what the marinade was, but that particular day, anyway, I will say they were the best I ever had. I am not a fan of radishes, but the radishes on top worked. I devoured my meal and thought of Yelping throughout. As good as our food was, the service was even better. We had two waiters constantly coming to our table which was far, far away in the back, the only people way back there. You know, the sort of seating where the waiter does the three-stop only: Take the order, bring the food, bring the check. Not so! Someone was always making the hike to us without fail. Not at all intrusive, but we never wanted for water, chips, margs, or anything. I cannot say enough about how nice our service was. I would go back for the kind service alone, but that crazy fish marinade seals the deal. We went with a http://Restaurant.com certificate. No issues or attitude with accepting it. If you haven't been and are a gc user, definitely give them a try.
