Despite myself, I have to give this place a good review. It really pains me to be positive about this hub of all things that piss me off, but I have to be honest. The crowd sucks. It's basically a frat party for 25-30 year olds and is always crowded with drunken patrons. The beer selection is ok, bartenders are decent, and the music is ok to good, at best. The name of the bar annoys me. The people annoy me, most of the wall space is dedicated to plasma tv's eternally set on ESPN, and it's the only place I can think of that has a constant line for the men's bathroom.... So why in the hell would I give this place a good review??  I think I have to do some soul-searching, but for some unknown reason I have had a very good time at 50/50 almost every time I've been forced to meet up there (about 5 times). I never have and never will go voluntarily, but it seems to come out a win whenever I go.  Please excuse me now, I have to go flagellate myself.
