Perfect place to stay in downtown Chicago. Just stayed here for 3 nights this past weekend and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Being my first time ever staying in a Holiday Inn, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but we were greeted with genuinely friendly staff who were more than happy to hold our luggage (we arrived earlier than check in time) and suggest things for us to do and places to eat while we waited for our room to be cleaned. Free hot breakfast in the morning was better than the usual continental breakfast they offer at other hotels..complete with cereal, eggs filled with cheese, pancakes, bagels, sausage, muffins, biscuits, assorted juices, and hot cinnamon rolls (although we didn't take advantage of this every morning since Chicago has so many yummy breakfast spots). Staff were always available to hail cabs for us. One guy even went down the block to flag one down! Extra tip for him of course. Hotel is walking distance to some nightlife, restaurants, and shopping. If you get the GO Chicago card, the greyline will pick you up a few blocks from the hotel so you can save money on transportation there. Only complaints: small hallways and small rooms! Super cramped. But I guess for the location and price, you can't really expect much more.
