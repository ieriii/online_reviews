Yes, yes, greatest hot dog in Chicago, wide variety of encased meats with exotic toppings, etc. If you're reading this review, you know that already. The customer service here is definitely worth Yelping about. Given this place's insane popularity and its hole-in-the-wall location, I expected the owner to be a surly Soup Nazi, whipping people through orders with terse frustration. But Doug greeted every customer with a simple, sincere joy. He was genuinely happy that we showed up. Protip: get there at 10:50 AM. You'll miss the crowds who line up right when it opens (at 10:30) and beat the lunch rush.
