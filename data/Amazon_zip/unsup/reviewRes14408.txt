We went to Glenn's Diner on the recommendation of a relative, and boy am I glad we did! We visited on a Sat. night. It was pretty busy so I will make reservations ahead of time for our next visit (I didn't know they took them) but we only had to wait 10-15 min. to be seated for a table for two. The seafood was super fresh and tasty and the prices were very reasonable based on the quality of the food. The service was very attentive and friendly. From the moment I set foot in the place I knew I was going to like it - the vibe is really fun and cool. It is family friendly and I would suggest this to anyone. I can't wait to return!
