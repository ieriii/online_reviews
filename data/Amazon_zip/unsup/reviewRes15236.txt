Meh. It was OK. The guy at the door was trying way too hard to make this place a "scene" - it was a Tuesday night , calm down buddy. When 3 out of 5 of us were there, the hostess came to seat us (after getting herself lost in the way over-draped curtain) and door guy acted like he was hesitant for her to seat us without the full party. Again, calm down dude....Tuesday night, the place was not exactly hopping. We waited about 20 minutes before a server came to our table, about 15 to get our drinks, and I had to chase our server through the massive high back chair maze to give him my credit card to pay because we had waited about 20 minutes again after he gave us the check. By the end, I felt like this may have been a hostage situation to cause tables to remain full so the line can form outside the bar.....or lounge.....or speakeasy.....or dimly lit, heavily draped in grey (I am guessing that was the color....too dark in there to see). If you go, go with a sense of humor and don't let this place take itself too seriously, if you feed into the pretension, they will not like you any more than the next dude in skinny jeans behind you.
