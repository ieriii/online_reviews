My boyfriend and I just had breakfast at Wishbone and I was disappointed for the last time. The service was good, but the food was just as bland and boring as ever. The final straw for me was that I was charged a dollar to get some hot water. That is so utterly ridiculous I cannot believe it. When a restaurant charges for hot tap water it is just unacceptable. I won't be back.
