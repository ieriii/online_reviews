Nina's Criteria for a 5 Star Restaurant: 1. Salad...CHECK 2. Meat...CHECK 3. Good dessert...CHECK 4. Guys in authentic Brazilian dress offering you their huge amounts of meat...CHECK [oh! i gave myself a chub!] 5. An entire cart filled with liquor...CHECK 6. A guy who pushes the cart around and talks you into getting an ice wine that is amazing that ends up being $21 for about 2 shots worth of wine...CHECK Seriously, how can you not like this place...even if you don't eat meat they have a huge @$$ salad bar that you can eat all you want from. If you are worried about the money, go during lunch, it's way cheaper.
