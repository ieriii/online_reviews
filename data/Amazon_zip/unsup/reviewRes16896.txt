I read all these reviews, but I don't really get why all these people love this place. The service was in-attentive and the drinks were eh - ok. There were HUGE frozen ice things inside the drinks which made a bout a half a glass look like it was more. I had the Romeo and Juliet and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about. Also, I don't think there was very much liquor in it. I won't be going back. The line was long too.
