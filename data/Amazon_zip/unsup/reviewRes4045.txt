This was the most amazing dining experience I have ever had. Friends of mine were original diners when it opened and being crazy foodies raved and raved. They finally (and it is true it takes forever to secure a reservation) got a hold of someone for a reservation and made it for 4. The whole thing with it being difficult to get a reservation..well, it's part of the fun if you ask me. I heard from an inside source that after all the recent publicity they are looking into having someone do phones on more regular basis..so don't worry. As I mentioned there seems to be so much written in the last month about this restaurant so no need to get into details on the food.. but I will say that this restaurant opened a whole new world of food to me...it was spectacular. Two of us do not eat any meat aside from seafood and the chefs were seemingly excited about this and provided us with amazing variations on the meat dishes our dining friends had.  Yes there was rap music playing pretty loud but I found it to be hilarious and fun, the place is small, so you feel like you are dining in a living room and though we didn't speak to any other diners, you felt a sort of communal energy.  It's pricey but well worth it! I could go on, but so many have covered it better. I hope this restaurant starts a trend of amazingly creative, mind blowing food in small intimate restaurants in Chicago. It was more than just eating food and more like experiencing art.
