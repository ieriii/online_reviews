The concierge recommended Piccolo Sogno. I suggest you go there. It's a huge value, just like eating in Rome, no lie. Big TIP: Pastas are available in appetizer sizes so go small plates! Piccolo Sogno delighted and amazed. The pastas are exotic, rich and right on, not too salty or over spiced. The wine selection, mostly Italian, features gems between $30-$70. The WHOLE tab for two (2 appetizers, 2 pastas, the amazing short rib entree, and two desserts ranged from excellent to stunning. Let them know you're doing a Yelp review. They took amazing care of us. Reports of service issues with Piccolo Sogno don't jive with what we experienced. There were groups of young men hanging out, barely letting a crumb hit the table.
