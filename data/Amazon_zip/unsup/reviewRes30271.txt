I hate hate HATE doing this. I really do. A restaurant that magically turns every hot-dog, hamburger, and chicken into a vegan friendly meal couldn't possibly be bad. In fact, as a vegetarian of 10+ years, I was kind of expected to love it, wasn't I? I wish I could say that I'd found my safe haven from all meat-eaters, but instead I'd found a restaurant that specializes in fake meat. First I blamed this on the fact that I'd been so conditioned to skip over such items as a cheeseburger that I kind of skipped over the whole menu. Going back to revise it, I did settle on one of their soy, fake, imitation meats. I love tofu. Soy has always been a true friend to me, but I just could not get into it here. Even if I didn't have the best experience, I'm really happy this restaurant is popular and hope it continues doing well. I love it when people are surprised how good something tastes without meat. I hope we can still be friends, CD.
