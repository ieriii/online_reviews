Hip, trendy, and happening are all words I would use to describe Sunda. Typically I do not expect restaurants that can be described with those words to have good food...but Sunda's food was great. I only ate sushi and it was amazing. The sushi was fresh and different. The crowd was a mixture of your older business men and the hip and trendy of Chicago. The decor was very modern with a real Asian feel. I will go back, probably with my girlfriends on a Friday or Saturday night before we hit the town.
