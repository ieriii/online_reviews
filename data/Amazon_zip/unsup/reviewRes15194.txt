great cocktails. great ambiance for conversation. bouncing was cool just chillin out front in the shadows. you need patience for the service here. drinks are crafted so they take forever, but if you like conversation then this shouldnt be a big problem. faster drinks would have given this place 5 stars. if youre looking for beer, loud music, vodka redbull, unpretentious service/people, then youre going to the wrong place.
