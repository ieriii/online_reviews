Considering I was born in Chicago - you'd think I'd LOVE Chicago deep dish pizza...but I don't. I'm a traitor and love NY-style pizza instead. So...considering that I don't LOVE deep dish pizza to begin with...Pequod's isn't my favorite - and their thin crust pizza isn't fabulous by any means...  BUT...in all fairness...the CARMELIZED CRUST of their deep dish pizzas are AWESOME. There's a good reason why they're famous for their carmelized crust! Instead of making sm/med/lg-sized pizzas, they should just make all personalized sized pizzas so you can get more crust with your pizza! :)  The place is kinda small and really packed during dinnertime on the weekends, so be prepared to wait a little or call ahead and make reservations! It's a great place to take visitors who are in town and want to try Chicago-style pizza - all my guests have really enjoyed it! Overall: Atmosphere - fun, loud, busy Service - decent for such a busy place Parking - can be hard to find street parking Groups - great for groups and in town visitors...make reservations if you can cuz this place sure gets packed quickly! Food - great for the deep dish pizza! Regular pizza, not so great.
