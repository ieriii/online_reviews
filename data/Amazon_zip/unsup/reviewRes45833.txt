When I finally have an opportunity to stop in for lunch, I am seated at one of the tables along the perimeter of the circular room which faces Michigan and Grand Avenues. Oh, what a view from the wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling windows! I ordered the $10.95 Lunch Sandwich Special. It's more than fair a price for its portions! I asked for a 1/2 Chicken Salad Sandwich on Whole Wheat Bread with Lettuce, Tomato and Mayonnaise, a Cup of Cream Chicken and Mushroom Soup and an Organic Green Salad with Vinagrette Dressing. Warm bread and butter is served while you wait. It's crispy crust and warm center is perfect for dipping in any one of the soups you choose to have with your order. I wrapped up the 1/2 sandwich and gave it to a vagrant a couple blocks away. You're guaranteed to find one peddling for spare change in the city. Want not, waste not. While GLC is affiliated with The Cheesecake Factory, their desserts stand on their own merits. We ordered the Molten Chocolate Cake with its surprise Melted Chocolate Center and served with Vanilla Ice Cream. This is one of a few desserts that are baked-to-order so GLC recommends you request one at the time you order your entree. Their strong coffee is a good pairing with any dessert. It will help you get to your next destination, even if that means heading home. An overall pleasant dining and people watching experience.
