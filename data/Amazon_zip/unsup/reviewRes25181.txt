Because nothing beats ruminating over a perverted puppet musical while eating tapas, we headed here after Avenue Q. I find most tapas places to be fine at best, it's the nature of the cuisine. Mercat was a little bit better then fine, and you can't ask for more. To start, it provides a splash of dramatic scene rare on this strip of south Michigan- jarringly high ceilings, cool booths and even a curiously isolated, semi-suspended table for 2 that I'm fascinated by. I would like to play chess there. This place had me at the wonderfully warm tomato bread it served gratis to start. Excellent sangria, margaritas and recommended wine pairings. Yes, we did end up closing the place down in the process of enjoying a full roster of drink. The cheese plate paired with jams is a great start, especially the nutella one. The tuna (or was it hamachi? can't remember, i waited too long to write this...) was superb as well as the pasta with rabbit. They even do an interesting upscale spin on those standard potatoes all tapas places serve. You know, the ones that usually end up on your table because someone is compelled to order them.
