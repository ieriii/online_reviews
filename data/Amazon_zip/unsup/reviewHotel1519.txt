Completely new find for me on a recent business trip to Chicago. On the Chicago River, it has AMAZING views of the river and city at night. Gorgeous, large rooms, great bathrooms, fantastic decor and a staff that couldn't have been nicer. A fabulous bar inside of the hotel, Hoyt's....not as intimate or cozy as I would have liked, but since I was solo, not as important. More of a sports bar. Good calamari. Located on East Wacker, you can get to a lot of really cool places, easily from this location. The modern, warm vibe of the hotel also makes you feel as if you are more important than you really are...:) They let me sleep in til 1:30pm the next day for late check out. Superb! I'd definitely come back and take in more of the town.
