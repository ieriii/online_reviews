One of the best bakeries in the neighborhood. I always get the chocolate croissants. They sell Intellegentsia coffee by the bag. They make excellent chocolate cake. The staff make this place cool and hip. The minus one star is for not stocking up on baked good and opening late on weekends. They do not open until 7 A.M. I understand the yuppies in wicker park do not get up early on the weekends because they are out all night but, there are people like me who get up early. Also, they run out of most pastries before 11:00 a.m. on a weekday or 10:00 a.m. on a weekend.
