After a string of bad service and bad food for the last couple of weeks, it came to a halt at Glenn's Diner. The egg's benedict - yum. Tried the french onion soup and hot DAMN, I haven't had french onion soup like that before. Very tasty. Everyone at the table was pleased with their choices, the service was fast, and overall good experience.
