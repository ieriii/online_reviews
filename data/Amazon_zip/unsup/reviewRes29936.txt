For some reason, I've been wanting fake meat really badly, and I knew the Chicago Diner could answer the call. My last experience at the Chicago Diner was very 'meh', but that was years ago, and I was ready to give it another chance. It was a warm, summer night and I opted to sit on the patio. I started off with a vegan chocolate peanut butter shake. HOLY SMOKES. HOW THE F IS THIS VEGAN?! It was really fantastic. I try not to say this often, because I fear people won't take me seriously, but this really does taste similar to the real thing. Really good stuff. I ordered the california reuben for my main course, which is 'corned beef', cheese (I opted for the dairy variety), a california slaw on delicious marbled rye. I also got mashed potatoes and gravy as a side. Mmmmm. The sammich was as big as my head, so I was only able to eat about half of it, but it was super tasty. I also fell i love with the mashed potatoes and gravy - I haven't eaten gravy since I went vegetarian (11 years ago), so that was a nice treat. Service was great. Ambience was easy-going. I am very happy I made the trip out and I'm happy the Chicago Diner redeemed itself. I SHALL RETURN.
