I've been meaning to write this review for a while now. I got married in September 2011 and we had our reception here after the wedding in their upstairs private room. We had about 70 guests, some vegetarians, some vegans, and really, they took care of it all. It was probably the least stressful part of planning. We picked out a signature drink to serve for the first few hours and got the wine/beer package for guests to booze on. From the get-go, people were impressed with the classy fire places, the delicious hors'douvres and the unlimited salad bar (which really included so much more than salads). Someone described the biscuits as crack. But when that meat started coming out, I saw people's mouths drop. There's actually quite a funny photo of my husband's cousin gaping at some food. I only wish my adrenaline wasn't so high and my dress wasn't so fitted that I could have pigged out more. We had a pretty modest wedding ceremony, but decided to splurge on this dinner experience and it was worth every penny. The best part was that guests commented on how it was some of the best food they'd had at a wedding. Since then, I've been back many times to have a great cocktail with some of sophisticated bar snacks. The rooftop is a great place to be in the summer and the fireplaces make it cozy in the winter. I would definitely go back for their normal all-you-can-eat dinner when I have sufficiently prepared my stomach.
