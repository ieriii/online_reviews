I appreciate attention to detail (ATD) so much that it's all I can think of when I stay at a hotel. I could care less about the amenities, but if they do pay attention to details, they win over me. The gym: it's gorgeous for a hotel gym. It has almost all the machines/equipment that you would need or could think of. It's clean and well-maintained. There are jars of ice-cold fruit-infused water with to keep you hydrated, and they get replenished frequently. They even provide you with wrapped earphones in case you forget to bring yours. Now, THAT is ATD. Instead of the traditional folio for your card keys, they have a mock-leather card wallet which includes a card-size street map. Very cute. ATD again. The room was clean, so very clean--spotless and odor-less. It's sort of ATD. I love that they don't have any bed spreads. They are gross and I hate them. Yay, I could just dive right into the bed without pulling it off first. Now, for the nitpicking items: I would've liked that the cute little "dining nook" (as they called it) would have some lighting in there for laptop or reading activities. Concierge, eh, that, we could live without. We felt that he was more about pushing his list onto us, rather than listening to us the sort of activities we'd love to do. Tips: We asked for higher floors and I was glad. We didn't have a view of the mile or downtown but it was bright and open. There were TONS of alcohol in the room; it was definitely a mega bar. I kid you not.
