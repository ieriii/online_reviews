I was with a party of ten; we came for the famed Peking Duck feast. Most of the time I don't like eating duck since I usually find it to be some undesirable combination of dry and greasy and chewy. But the duck here is juicy with a nice, crispy skin and goes perfectly with the sauce and buns that come with.  What really bothers me about this place is the service. We had to hunt down a waiter to put in our order. When the roast duck came out, the waitress originally came with four plates of five buns each, but took one of the plates back to the kitchen and returned it with two buns on the plate. Seventeen buns for ten people.  And each duck feast (meant to serve at least four) comes with two skimpy servings of mango sorbet. Whyyy would you make people fight over who gets sorbet?? Like the bun incident, this doesn't really make sense to me. All in all: food is good, service is frustrating. Although I may be back if I get a mad hankering for some good duck in the Chicagoland area.
