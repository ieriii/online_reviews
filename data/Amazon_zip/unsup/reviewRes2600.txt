we finally tried this legendary house of encased meats. and i live very close. on our way to pick up some banh mi from nhu lan, we passed hot dougs and for the first time ever there was no line. and a parking spot right at the door. we had to quick change our plans cause it was long overdue. i was very impressed with the choice of colors of the interior. beautiful bright yellows & reds & very clean. an impressive array of encased meat sandwiches for every walk of life-veggie stuff, chicken, elk. i got the smoked chipotle chicken sausage in mole poblano w/queso fresco, my hubs got elk sausage with goose island brown mustard & madrigal cheese. and a classic chicago style dog. all of the sandwiches were excellent and good portion size imo. it would be easy to eat 2 because they aren't very filling. we had the regular fries and i especially liked them & i'm not even a lover of french fries. the grease was extremely fresh, the fries were not greasy & cooked to crisp perfection. there is definitely an art to that. it would seem there's nowhere to go but down from those, but i've yet to try them fried in duck fat. so yea, i didn't want to like you, hot doug. cause you don't need my biz. but i suppose that's not the point. i can see that it may be possible to dine in your establishment each day and never eat the same meal twice. but i will not wait in that line....or will i?
