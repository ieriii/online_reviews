finally tried the poutine. i can only see loving this stuff if you were raised on it. i will stick with my fried curds, thank you. and speaking of, i ate some of those delicious curds just yesterday and am craving them again as i type this. yeah, so what, leave me alone. i'm also lovin' me some two brothers brewing company as of late. it's local (yay!) and has a gluten-free option (i'm sayin'!). what's not to love? i enjoyed the ebel's weiss and the monarch white and my friends drank more prairie path ales than they could count. cheers to bad apple for another enjoyable evening!
