After a year and a half of asking The Boy to get Indian food with me, he finally agreed to, and we decided to try India House. And now we can't wait to go back! The service was absolutely spot-on, and the food was deliciously good (and we both had lunch for the next day). The starting naan was amazing - we ate it all in about 2 minutes, and then we tried the vegetable pakora. The potato and onion pakoras were just okay, but the spinach ones were soooo tasty, I think next time we would just order the spinach ones. I stuck with my usual, minimally spicy (interesting how I love Indian food, but don't really like spicy things) chicken tikka masala, which was so flavorful - lots of fennel and tomato flavors, and the chicken was incredibly tender. The Boy had chicken vindaloo, which our waiter was very excited about. He practically exclaimed, "Oh! Excellent selection! Very spicy!" when Mike ordered. It was clearly going to be too spicy for me to eat, but he said it was excellent. We decided to skip dessert, but I can say this was one of the best nights out we've had in a while, and we can't wait to go back to India House!
