First and foremost, Hot Doug's closes at 4pm!!! If you're planning on going there on Friday or Saturday, ensure you get there early enough. We got there at 3pm on a Saturday and fortunately Doug was cool enough to serve us at 5pm. Yes, that's right folks, we waited in-line for 2 hours. Can't say that I will do that again but the experience was worth it. We got several dogs and they were all good. The crawfish sausage with peppercorn remoulade and blue cheese was an absolute winner and my favorite. The sausage topped with fois gras was also ridiculously rich and delicious. If visiting Chicago.. this place is a must!
