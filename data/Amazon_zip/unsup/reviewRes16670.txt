The few times I've been to Violet Hour, I've enjoyed very much. It strikes me as a place that's good for a pre or post dinner drinks. I wouldn't linger too long unless I feel like spending an exhorbitant amount of money on experimental cocktails created by some of Chicago's best "mixologists" - which honestly, I'll never feel like doing. Once you make it past the purple velvet curtains you're led your table - either to a booth or to a set of high-backed chairs that make you feel like you're Alice in a purple wonderland. The three times I've been have been on weekday evenings so I never had to deal with a wait or snobby/fed up servers. Each time I've had a female server who was very knowledgable about the types of drinks they have. Instead of going off the menu, I've asked the different waitresses for their recommendations and they have never let me down! I also like how they give you the over-pour in a mini decanter. It makes you feel like you get two drinks in one. I haven't tried any of their food but I think it's a unique experience and fun to visit once in a while.
