Our group of 6 landed there last night. We expected more people and were seated at a large round table. Still we had no problem hearing each other without shouting, a big plus in my book. We ordered the spiciest chicken on the manue and it arrived packed with hot red pappers. Tofu special hapened to be even spicier. Mongolian beef and garlik speanach were comparitively not that spicy. A good company with good food, what can be better. Well, I probably can think of a thing or two ... still, we had quite an enjoyable night.
