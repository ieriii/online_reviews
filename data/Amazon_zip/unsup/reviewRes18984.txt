I feel pretty comfortable claiming The Gage as pretty pretentious. These servers need to learn how to smile or even grunt to communicate without the empty eyes expressions. And no, not only when the bill comes out and the tip salvaging measures are in effect. Then again, I might be a little dead inside too if my normal crowd was corporate warriors in khaki trying to erase the workday while simultaneously catch the eye of another wage slave cub or cougar. From the work desk to the dating den, the clientel in here is young (in some cases), professional and lookin' for love. Read the body language, believe me. The owner walks around in a suit checking on things. It's very obvious he's the owner and it's very obvious he's living well. He stopped by our table out of about twenty to comment on the traditional German beers we ordered and mentioned that we'd both be singing songs later. Everyone else just got a little head nod or a smile. I get the impression he's German. There's a private room downstairs where the restrooms are. Dinner waits are long so you can leave your name at the front and go hit the bar. If and when your table comes up (if you haven't already ordered in the bar) one of the long legged hostesses will come find you to ask if you're still interested in your table. No buzzers to be found, just old fashioned memory. Kind of cool. I had the burger and it was pretty awesome. Of course the beer was good as well.
