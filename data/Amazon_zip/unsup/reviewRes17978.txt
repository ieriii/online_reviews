The burgers are outstanding! I always get the Strange Famous. This is the perfect blend of deliciousness. The only reason Bad Apple doesn't get their five (deserved) stars is because of the ketchup situation. I must say that I always think once I sit done to eat, "ah! I forgot to bring ketchup." Customer service is great. I love that there is a quieter seating section in back to the right and they have board games.
