Irazu is one of my local Logan Square/Bucktown favorite, cheap places to get Latin American fare. My wife and I go there frequently, and I've tried many of their sandwiches and entrees. Their steak sandwiches are excellent, and are made even better with a side of sweet plantains. If you like liver, definitely try their liver and onions.  Not to miss: Oatmeal shake, chicken soup (I had this when I was sick and it made me feel much better), Pepito sandwich I can't wait to go back!
