Wishbone is a great place for brunch (never been for dinner). The salmon cakes with hollandaise, poached eggs and cheese grits is my go-to breakfast. I LOVE how they put the poached eggs in a separate little dish so that they don't get all over the salmon. The cheese grits are absolutely delicious. There is usually a little wait, but we put our names in and head over to Whole Foods to pick up some groceries while we wait. No big deal.
