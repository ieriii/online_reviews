LOVE, LOVE, LOVE RJ Grunts! They have the best burgers, sandwiches, salad bar, soups... the service is great and the atmosphere is fun. I love that the price for the soup is whatever the temperature is outside. The cream cheese-cheesecake-chocolate chip pudding from the salad bar is AMAZING! Parking in the area is difficult but valet is reasonably priced. RJ's is one of my favorite restaurants!
