This place is good for studying/working. The space is next to the actual bakery- which has GREAT baked goods and coffee. This is not a place to get a lunch with coffee- but the baked goods rock and on occasion I have some of their pre-made lunch items (there is usually a limited variety). The working space is large and the noise and music is maintained at a working level. Plus the cakes in the window look awesome.
