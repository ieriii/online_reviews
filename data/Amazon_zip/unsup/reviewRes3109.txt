I came to this place with my friend to try the korean "bowls"(it is a bimbibap right?), and I was honestly fascinated. My friend and I both enjoyed our times here. It is a self-served, narrow place with dim lighting, but the workers are very friendly and water is free. My friend ordered the "Original Big Boy Buddha" and I got the "Seoul Steak Bowl". Their homemade marinated bulgogi(korean beef) is extravagant! I'm slightly addicted to the unique flavor. The vegetables that they used were also very fresh. The egg on top was perfectly made, for me at least, because I like my eggs not too raw but not too cooked either (about 85% cooked). The fries are well salted, crispy, and thin, just exactly how I like my fries. (They would come in second for me, after Popeyes' Fries.) The food is decently priced, I would not consider this place "expansive", for a full bowl of varieties and flavors, that will actually fill you. It's around $8-$13/person. I'm hoping to come back soon for more "heaven", from the buddha bowls!
