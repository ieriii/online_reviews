Can't stop talking about it! Went with my Boss and my Boss's Boss and had the best time in a long time. I admit I was a little scared when I walked up to the whole-in-the-wall dive. I didn't truly relax until the second course. they said it would be nine but I think it was more like 15. The food was amazing. The staff was inept yet charming.  We drank way too much and had a great time! I can't wait to go back.
