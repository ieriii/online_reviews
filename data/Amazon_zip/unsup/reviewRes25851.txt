Goosebumps...not from the food so much...but the flamenco guitar player who was flawlessly playing "classical gas" by mason williams. Ugh, that damn song gets me every time!!! I like the interactive aspect of fondue, but it's definately a process. Very romantic and I could bathe in that chocolate fondue. Definately worth checking out.
