I like this place! The drinks were creative, but the food is great. Honestly, the music is a unique plus, and the things this place stands for are pretty cool. The ravioli, the artichoke dip appetizer, the gnocchi, these things are straight up awesome. Portion sizes are actually kinda small, but the food is excellent. I guess I don't have much to say other than that it's a simple, nice place to go with good food and the option of some music depending on the night/event. Nothing really stuck out about the place.
