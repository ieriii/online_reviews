Maybe our expectations were too high because this was the very first restaurant we ate at based on the glowing recommendation from our apartment finder person (Thanks J.T.!) Cafe 28 was definitely a very good meal, but I wouldn't say it was the best thing I've ever had nor that it was the most perfect dining experience. The table they sat us at was right next to the bathroom, so that wasn't ideal. Our waiter was pleasant but a little too suave for his own good - I think he was more interested in chatting up the group of single ladies near us than paying attention to our water glasses. We ordered Cuban Pork and Chicken Comal, and both were very good. Nice and tender and flavorful, but not the life-changing experience that I thought might have occurred. After we finished it took forever to get the bill, and it was a little more pricey than what we usually like to pay for a night out. It was a nice enough dinner, but I don't feel compelled to go back there when there are so many other restaurant options in Chicago.
