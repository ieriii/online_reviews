I have lived in the neighborhood for over 15 years and was a frequent customer of the old Aliiance Bakery. I have tried this new one several times and have been very disappointed. The bakery is stale and dry. The staff is not helpful and rude. I was just there last week to buy a fruit strudel to take as a hostess gift and when we ate it, i was so embarrassed. The strudel was tasteless and stale. I also couldn't get the employee to put it in the proper size of bag so it would close. Frankly you can get macaroons anywhere these days and I've tried theirs-nothing to write home about. Cupcakes and cookies are also substandard.  Aliiance is not a good bakery and I would really discourage people from going there. It is too expensive and their stuff is just not good.
