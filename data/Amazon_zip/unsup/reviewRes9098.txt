I found out about this place from a friend prior to its television debut on Check Please (and subsequent popularity). Every time I go I am pleasantly greeted by the very friendly staff and owner. They offer some great starters like hummus and baba ganoush which are SO fresh and tasty. I cannot recommend the Shirin Polo (Sweet & Sour Persian Rice) w/ Chicken Tender highly enough. This dish is absolutely amazing and it is hard for me to stray from it. Usually I am all for trying different items on the menu...but this dish is so good I end up getting it every time I go! The atmosphere is ethnic and very clean, and the customers are usually a broad range of ages. One of the best features....prices are very reasonable. Definitely worth a try for you persian lovers out there.
