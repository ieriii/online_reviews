The only Korean BBQ restaurant I've been to in Chicago. First time, we had kalbi and samgyeopsal (pork belly). Kalbi wasn't flavorful enough, I thought - seems like it needed to be marinated longer. Samgyeopsal was good - but it's not marinated, so as long as they use high-quality pork, it will be good. The second time we went here, the Kalbi was so much better - more tender and more flavorful! I was happy. Per usual, they gave us ridiculous amounts of banchans which we all enjoyed - all were delicious! My only gripe about this place is that the price seems way too steep for what you get. Not sure if it's reasonable for me to compare it to LA KBBQ restaurants, but good ones in LA are ~$17 for AYCE. 1 serving of meat here is ~$20. I will always go back here because it's open late and it's good KBBQ.
