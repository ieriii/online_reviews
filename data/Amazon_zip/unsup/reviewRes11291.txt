OVERRATED! If I waited for seating here... I would have been even more pissed. I heard alot of good things about this place and we live a couple blocks away so we gave it a try.  The food is nothing special. Service was good though. I had one of the specials... I make a better omelete at home. My wife had the pancakes with apple and toasted walnut, which sounded great. When they brought them over they were covered with this sugary sauce that make them way to sweet.  Like a said NOT terrible, but I will not go back either.  Not to mention a $48 bill for brunch... I had 2 bloodys that upped the bill, but still... AND they don't sell BEER? Come on! You're known for BRUNCH and you can't get a bloody and a beer?
