YUM! I know this is a simple word, but the food here is just that! Yum! Everything I have ever eaten here has been great! We have had dinners and lunch on occasion and never been disappointed. The food is well prepared, tasty and plentiful. The service has always been great, with helpful suggestions from the staff if you are stumped on what to eat. The Cuban coffee is almost as good as what I used to drink every morning in Ibor City in Tampa when I lived there. all in all a pleasurable experience every time!
