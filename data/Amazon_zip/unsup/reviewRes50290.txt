When my GF told me we were having dinner with a friend at a sports bar I set the bar pretty low. This place far exceeded my expectations, the food was delicious while still qualifying as bar food. The wings have a cornmeal crust and reminded me of the southern fried chicken from back home. The mac and cheese here will change your life, we had the plain mac without an add-ons and it was awesome, can only imagine it with pulled pork and jalapenos in it. The burger was good but the cole slaw on it was great, changed my view forever about a mediocre veggie side. We got a $25 off coupon from http://restaurants.com and it basically meant free beer for us. Service was also excellent, servers are friendly, bright, and always there when you need them, don't think a dirty dish stayed on the table for 2 seconds after we finished with it. Finally a place to watch the game were food isn't an afterthought.
