We had a group of 8 come here for my birthday Friday. We had a few issues along the way, but none of it bothered me too much (probably because everything worked out well in the end, and I wasn't paying for anything so the issues with the bill didn't bother me as much as they would have if I had been paying). Online it says that take limited reservations day of, so I tried to call them on Friday to reserve a table for 8 people at 7pm. I was told to call back between 4 and 5 and talk to the manager. That seemed a little odd to me, but it worked just fine. They had our reservation, so it did work. I tried some of the beef empanada and fries for appetizers. Both were very tasty. I wanted the picadillo dinner but they just ran out, so I got by other favorite, Ropa Vieja. It was wonderful. For desert they brought me a flan covered in chocolate syrup. That was very nice! I thought the flan would have tasted better without the chocolate syrup, but who am I to complain about a free birthday desert. Our food also came out insanely fast. Our server was nice enough to us, event though we asked for glass after glass to go with our pre-made mojitios. (I didn't know they would make mojitios for you! They will make a pitcher of mojitos for $10 if you bring a bottle of rum. Next time I will do that instead of bringing the pre-made Bacardi Mojitos!) I love BYOB places, and I think this is a great one!
