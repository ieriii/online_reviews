Good but not great. It's kind of pricy, but definitely more than enough food. It is a very cozy, romantic space. I came with a couple girl friends though and we still had a blast. I'd recommend it if you're getting some kind of deal, but otherwise there are nicer/more delicious restaurants to blow your cash on.
