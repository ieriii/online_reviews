This place is great if you want some solid good breakfast food. I think the jams are what won me over to give it another star, especially the raspberry! I got a little sad when I started running out of my English muffin and was debating on ordering more bread even though I was stuffed. We had the gouda omelet which was pretty yummy and the chocolate strawberry crepe. Was not too big of a fan of their smoothies though...it was too thick and sweet. Corn beef hash was awesome though!
