i've been here a few times and have never been disappointed with what i ordered. very delicious.. from the complimentary bread (when its fresh.. i've had cold, hard loafs before), to appetizers, to entrees, to desserts. oddly enough, i haven't tried any of the steaks here, but everyone i dined with who did have it loved it. i will defintely need to order a filet next time i come back after reading all these reviews though!
