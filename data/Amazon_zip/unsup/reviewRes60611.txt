It seems that many reviewers sharpen their butter knives ripping into Grand Lux's eight-page menu, the occasional wait for a table, and absurd and playful dcor. The fact remains: if you can get over the fact that Grand Lux is owned/operated by the mustache-twisting Cheese Cake Factory, you can have a really good time, and some pretty decent food there.The whole concept of the restaurant seems like the idea of a couple of stoners who then hired the Olive Garden people to bring it to life. But stoners really know how to eat well.Where else could we have ordered Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls, Mini Pastrami Reuben Sliders, Pot Roast Cheese Fries and an Ahi Ceviche? I assure you we weren't high, but merely unable to decide which continent's cuisine we wanted for our entre. This is a Michigan Ave restaurant without nosebleed prices. So expect tourists and an occasional wait. But if you can get over the initial knee-jerk reaction to make fun absolutely everything about it, expect to have a lot of fun at Grand Lux.
