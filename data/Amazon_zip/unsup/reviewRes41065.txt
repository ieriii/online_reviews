The only reason this place isn't a 5 of 5 is because they keep changing the business plan and eliminating my favorite things. When they first opened, they did a really cool gourmet takeout, where you could pick and choose from a variety of a la carte items to bring home and warm in the oven. I can understand, though, that it's pretty much impossible to push the kind of volume on that to prevent hemorrhaging money. After falling in love with the weekend brunch menu, they've now discontinued brunch. That boggles the mind, as the place seemed to have a lot of weekend business. Either way, Bonsoiree has the most delicious food in Logan Square. Every item on the menu is perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. Even though the price on the 3-course dinner menu seems to increase every season (now stands at $24), it is still an absolute steal. The banana bread pudding with white chocolate creme anglais (or was it fraiche?) is amazing. Atmosphere-wise, this place is also a winner. Nice laid back space, open and airy, with a nice patio in the back. Table presentation is great, with all the centerpieces arranged by Chef Shin's mother, I believe. Both of the chefs are incredibly friendly, and remember faces and food preferences, which is nice. Also, it's BYOB, and with Vas Foremost Liquors right around the corner, you can have a phenomenal, intimate dinner for 2, with great wine, for well under $100. Here's hoping that brunch returns soon! Update (7/30/07): Apparently, now they are charging a $5 corkage fee per bottle. I suppose the place is popular enough to raise prices and add fees like this, but it's still very disappointing. At least the money is going to good people.
