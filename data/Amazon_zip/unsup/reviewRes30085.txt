I've been a customer for several years and yet to have a bad experience. Nothing fancy about dining here--the restaurant is clean, the tables close together, the crowd varied yet friendly and the prices are very approachable. My favorite lately is the Gaeng Panang which is described in their menu as panang curry and Thai basil leaves sauteed in coconut milk with a choice of meat is just being modest.  This curry is a miracle of creamy and spicy flavors. Favorite appetizer is the Tiger Cry-- seared beef with a hot sauce. Like other Yelpers, I have introduced many people to this restaurant and all have said they enjoyed the experience. If you've not had much experience with Thai food I will say the waitstaff isn't the sort to make recommendations or offer much in the way of menu explainations to the uninitiated. However they are efficient and thankfully the menu items are very affordable so taking a new dish for a spin isn't a hefty investment.
