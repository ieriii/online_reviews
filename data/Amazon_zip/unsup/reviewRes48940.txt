I love this restaurant. Its easy, casual, delicious, has a great beer list, and I can come in at 5, sit at the oyster bar and watch the kitchen work its magic. Paul Kahan is my hero, and the guys (and gals) in the kitchen are fantastic.. My highlights? Pork Rinds, Frites (sans egg), mussels, oysters, pork anything.Go early, go with friends you see often - its communal seating, so you don't want to head here if you haven't seen someone in a while or for grandmas 70th birthday.  I prefer the bar, because I'm a sit at the bar kinda girl. If you appreciate food, my thoughts are that you will definitely appreciate publican.
