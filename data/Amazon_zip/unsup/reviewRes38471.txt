This bar does so many things right...it's just a shame it gets so crowded. The beer selection is almost unparalleled, and the Hopleaf's menu goes far beyond one's expectations for typical bar food -- honestly, it's very high quality dining and worth visiting just for a meal...although you'd be foolish not to stay for a few beers. My only complaint about the place is that it can get packed beyond any reasonable standard, and on weekend nights you sometimes have to wait fifteen minutes just to get a bartender's attention. Not that the service is at all bad, but it's just an insanely popular bar. It's best to go early on a weeknight if you can.
