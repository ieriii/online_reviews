Wow, this place was completely overrated. Sure the hot dog was huge, but not nearly as good as the ones at the Cubs game. The fries in my box were also those bottom of the barrel, been sitting there for an hour dark dark brown yick things.  What a waste of gas to make it to this place. Seriously overhyped. I was anticipating the best hot dog ever, but honestly, I make better 'dogs. At least it's super cheap....
