4 stars for Chinese food in Chicago, 3 stars for Chinese food overall. Having been raised on Chinese food, I guess I can vouch for the authenticity of it. But again, having been raised on Chinese food, I can't give it more stars. Lao Sze Chuan is a great place to get real Chinese food- none of that Panda Express nonsense but alas, the portions are on the petite side and the prices, definitely inflated. Don't get me wrong, the food tastes good. My complaint really, is for the prices. That and perhaps the lack of intense spice that a true Sze Chuan menu should carry. But since I really don't have many other options in the area, I do frequent this restaurant and suggest the hot pot, dumplings, or if you're going for adventurous: spicy pot of pork blood and intestine. Follow the crowd and follow your nose. Lao Sze Chuan is the place to be in Chicago's Chinatown.
