Just tucked away off the ever tourist-popular Michigan Avenue is The Purple Pig, a true diamond in the rough. All I'll say is that I wish I knew about this place a lot sooner. It's a great place to grab a nice glass of wine and nosh on some pork liver patte and marinated roasted eggplant (two dishes that I would highly recommend).  The menu is relatively easy to navigate, but if you're not sure what to get feel free to ask the staff. They are some of the most helpful and friendly restaurant workers around.  Whatever brings you to the Miracle Mile, this is the perfect place to go and relax...and on an affordable budget.
