Noisy, noisy, noisy, this trendy restaurant is a great place to meet friends, just don't expect to hear what they have to say. Not a great place for a first date either IMO if you want to get to know each other. The decor was very warm and cozy. The non-traditional oxtail potstickers was a first for me and pretty good. The Loompya was crispy but bland and a little on the dry side even with the dipping sauces. The Kobe beef tartare was very tasty. My wife had the braised pork belly and I had the braised short ribs, both good but we both agreed it could have been more tender.
