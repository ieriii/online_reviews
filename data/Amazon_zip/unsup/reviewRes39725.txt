Love the food.  I've liked everything I've had here. I'm Taiwanese and hadn't really had KBBQ until moving to Chicago, and I love it. I took my parents here and they like it too. You get tons of sides, and the meat portions are reasonably large too. I was surprised how good the squid was, very tender. Great place to go after a night out as it's open pretty late, although the sign says open til 5, a few friends and I tried to go at 4:30 and they said that they were close. Not a huge deal. The servers are pretty Korean, so it wouldn't hurt to bring a Korean friend along, but they were friendly enough for my parents and I, on par for most asian restaurants at least. As with any KBBQ place, you'll smell like smoke for the rest of the day :)
