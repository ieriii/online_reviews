I love cheap food. I love burritos and platanos. I love soy shakes. I love Irazu more than my boyfriend (and vice versa). I live for their mango oatmeal soy shakes so much so that my boyfriend and I have to order two because I refuse to share even a sip of my delicious nectar from heaven. While I love the food, I hate the crowds. I wouldn't have such an issue with it if I could leave the restaurant without having to wade through 20 people in the front. Honestly, I think the owners should really discourage their patrons from drinking Rolling Rock beers while standing directly in front of the door. Try the casado. It's a little more than a burrito (about nine bucks), but you won't be disappointed.
