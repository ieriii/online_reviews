eh-lo. I went for the mothers day brunch today with my mom because I felt that was most appropriate. I'm not much for describing things and writing long novels so here is what you get. I have read that GEB doesnt like yelp so I'm extremely happy to be the first to write about his brunch. Ok. so 45 dollars. three courses. 3 choices for each course. I dont remember them all. I got the Asparagus Salad for the 1st course and it was perfect. My mom ate the Bacon powder that was on it which means she sinned. 2nd course was the Chicken and Waffles. Perfectly cooked chicken, crispy, tastey, yummy. The waffle was a bit dense for me but then again I just came off of the Publican waffle from a couple weeks ago. great pieces of pecan, foie graviness. 3rd course was a mexicanish moltonish chocolate cake. it was good but disappointing because it was on the menu and everyone has that, but I ordered it so it was there because people order it so how can I say anything different. thinking the deconstructed strawberry shortcake would have been interesting. I'll definitely go back for dinner if I get the chance. I felt it was a bit to expensive for what I had but it was mothers day.
