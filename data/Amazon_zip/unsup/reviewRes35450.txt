Took my mom here for her Birthday dinner! Obviously it is going to be pricey, but I HATE when downtown restaurants charge a fortune for tiny portions and OK food. Shaw's is definitely not one of those - the food was incredible, great portions, and great service! At the end the waiter brought us over a dessert sample on the house with a candle to my mom's birthday. It had raspberry pie, key lime pie, pecan pie, and creme brulee. I think we said "mmm" about 100 times as we polished the plate off. For dinner we got the parmesan-crusted haddock, which melted in my mouth! Soo delicious. And my mom got the pumpkin seed encrusted grouper, which was a very light, delicious fall dish. We split the salad with apples, dried cranberries, etc which was so delicious. I will definitely go back!
