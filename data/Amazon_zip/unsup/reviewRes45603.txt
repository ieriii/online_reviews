I went here with a large group from work for a farewell luncheon today. We were seated right away (great), ordered appetizers (okay), & I had the chopped salad with honey mustard dressing (meh, very onion-y). The service was fine but more than anything, I liked the restaurant decor (poetic eclectic-ism?). Overall, the place is okay, but I won't be heartbroken if I don't get back there ASAP.
