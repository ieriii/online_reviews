The food was tasty and the service very friendly. PROS: Vegetarian options, empanadas were the best, they don't sell alcohol but they allow you to bring your own. The salsa was tasty and the food ingredients tasted fresh. CONS: The bathroom had some kind of leak, they don't accept credit cards and the vegan taco lacked some imagination.
