I have been going to Noon O Kabab when it was just a hole in the wall with only 4-5 tables, and the only thing that keeps me coming back for more is the wonderful food. Evevrything on the menu is great, but I would recommend trying the kefta kabobs, shwarma, chicken and shrimp kabobs, and all the appetizers. Everything is fresh and cooked to order, for the best Persian food in town try this place, you will not be dissapointed!
