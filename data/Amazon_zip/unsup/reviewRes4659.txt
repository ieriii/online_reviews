Another one on my "list" of places to try in Chicago. The place was packed, but we were able to get seated in a fair amount of time. The wait time for food/drinks was a little slow and for some reason our waitress got our drink orders wrong a couple times, but I'll give her a break since it was busy. We tried a couple of appetizers and I got a delicious salad with hazelnuts, which doesn't seem to be on the menu any longer, so they must change it up. This would be a great spot to meet for drinks and if you want a small meal.
