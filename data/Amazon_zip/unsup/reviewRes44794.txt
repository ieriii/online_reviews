If I had a small child I would sell it for deep dish pizza. Ok I'm exagerrating, but I love love love deep dish pizza and live in the Northeast where they cling to their love of New York style pizza. So I'm in Chicago for Lollapallooza and what am I going to do?? Stuff myself silly with the best deep dish in the world..  Unfortunately Giordano's did not deliver. The pizza was good, but the crust wasn't nearly as crispy as deep dish places in San Francisco (of all places) and the toppings seemed a bit soggy. I would certainly come back here but Chicago must have better...
