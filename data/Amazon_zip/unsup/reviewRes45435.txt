is Wilde too expensive? Absolutely! Why am I able to forgive them for that? Two words: Shephard's pie. is it spelled "Shepherd's" pie? I googled it and everyone spells it differently. Anyway, you know what dish I speak of. Every time I go to Wilde, which is probably twice a year since it opened, they've tweaked their Shepard's pie a little here and a little there. When I'm convinced it can't get any better, they make it better! From the thickness of the stew to the flavorful mashed potatoes...to the variety of vegetables in it...they do a damn good job with their Shepard's pie. I've also had their fish and chips...and so has my uncle Joe from Scotland. He said they were the best fish and chips he's had in a long time. There ya go! How can you argue with a 67-year-old Scottsman over fish and chips? You just can't. The decor is awesome, as is the atmosphere. The servers do a great job. It's a great place for any occasion. I've come with friends, I've come with family, and I've come with hubby...and there was never a bad experience. For some reason, I'm more inclined to come to Wilde on a cold winter's day. Maybe it's the undeniable fact that a Magners tastes much better infront of a huge decorative fireplace.  So anyway, back to the original point. It's way to expensive, but I can't help but love it.
