did my birthday dinner here...YUM. ive seen this ginormous place time and time again while driving home from indiana/michigan and had heard great things, so finally to celebrate my birth, i dragged my friends to sample carnivale's nuevo latino flavas! we all started with drinks- i opted for the traditional margarita, which was awesome. we went for guac to start, which, though not made at the table was very fresh. i then went for 2 appetizers because i couldn't decide- the ropa vieja and the fish tacos. both were awesome. the food was really delicious, but the atmosphere is what really makes this place extra special. the large dining room is a sight to see. there are few places in chicago with as much presence. the colorful decor just adds to the fun of your experience here. go and enjoy- you won't regret it.
