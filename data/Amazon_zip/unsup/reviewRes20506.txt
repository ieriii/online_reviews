I was underwhelmed by my food at Xoco. My expectations were definitely high, but no more so than when I dine at any restaurant helmed by a well-known chef.  I ordered a side salad, the Choriqueso torta, the limonada and an Orange-Mango cupcake. The side salad was light and refreshing though the avocado-lime dressing fell a little flat. The contents of the torta (chorizo sausage, poblano peppers, jack cheese and tomatillo salsa) were very flavorful however the bread quickly became soggy which detracted from my enjoyment of the sandwich. The limonada was a true bright spot! It was lemon-limey but not too tart; sweet but not saccharine. Love it! My dining companion and I were really disappointed with the cupcake. I'm not sure if those are done in-house but the flavor did not suit either of our tastebuds. The frosting (usually my FAVORITE part!) was off and the cake itself was dry and lacked poignant flavors.  We dined al fresco which in theory is a wonderful thing to do on a breezy summer afternoon. The one drawback to Xoco's outdoor set up is the layout of the seating. Their tables and barstools are set up in an extremely tight U-shaped pattern so that one must squeeze past others to be seated, an inconvenience for all. Additionally, the poor diners who must sit on the inside of the U are virtually trapped. I couldn't help but wonder why someone chose to design the seating that way. Overall my dining experience at Xoco was average. I'm willing to give it (and Rick's other restaurants) a try, however, I'll take my time there.
