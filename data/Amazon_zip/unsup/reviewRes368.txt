Alinea has been my "Mecca" for years. I booked a trip to Chicago for the sole purpose of eating here. This led me to fear that I had built it up so much in my head that it could and would only disappoint. Oh how wrong I was. This restaurant exceeding my exceedingly high expectations. As a chef myself, I can only aspire to be half as brilliant as Chef Achatz and his staff. Every dish was impeccable (the most perfectly cooked foie I've had in my life). And the staff was very accommodating, tolerating my need to photograph both every course and every wine pairing. I even took a pic of the crazy-haired sommelier, who took my experience from amazing to out of this world! In my opinion, the only way to eat here is to do the full 24 courses. If you are going to go big, go big! Worth every penny and even more. The creativity behind every course may possibly blow your mind. I know for me, it took me from on the verge of burnout to highly inspired to just... cook!
