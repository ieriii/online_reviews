Thank you Zed 451 for a great time on Friday night. We had a party of 15 and everyone had a wonderful time. Thank you so much to Sammy for setting up the Zed bus to pick us up, it was nice that we could all ride together! The dining experience was really great. The food and presentation was fantastic and price points for all budgets. We really appreciate all the attentive service by the entire staff, but a special thanks to Jennifer and Katie for taking good care of us. We will happily come back. Thanks again Zed!
