YUM YUM YUM. I would actually say 4 1/2 stars - the only drawbacks to this place were: a) it was uncomfortably hot in the back room - not sure if they don't have AC there or if it's just poor air circulation and b) there was supposed to be live music, and we saw the guys setting up and then 2 hours later, packing up, without ever playing anything. all this however, is of no consequence when you consider the food and the atmosphere. We first went to Demera a month ago and were turned away after an hour's wait because the reservations were backed up. (note to self - wait a week after the groupon comes out to try the restaurant!) The manager felt so bad that he gave us his card and told us he'd "take care" of us next time. Indeed he did - two bottles of wine, on the house, and he came back several times throughout the evening to chat and check up on us. The waitstaff was equally wonderful - so, so friendly and helpful with decision making. And the food - I thought I had died and gone to heaven - EVERYTHING was fabulous - the sambussa apetizers and special cottage cheese, amazing. Our family style platter had ample options for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike, and though everything was on the same platter, the chef would have gladly separated meat from veg if we had asked. The chickpeas and beef dishes were my faves, but everything was flavorful and delicious. They even have gluten free injera (spongy bread that you use to scoop the food) if you call ahead. As usual, my biggest regret is not saving room for dessert. Another bonus, there is a parking lot on Lawrence behind the restaurant that is only $1 an hour. Demera is awesome.
