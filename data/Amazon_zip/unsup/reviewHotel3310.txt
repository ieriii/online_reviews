For the money, I don't think you can beat the Hard Rock hotel. The location is great; right down the street from Millenium Park and walking distance to everything. The rooms are very nice size and have lots of amenities; free wifi; large flat screen TV with DVD player; stereo system; sitting area; and a nice size bathroom. I asked for a corner room and I'm glad I did; it had windows all around and a great view.
