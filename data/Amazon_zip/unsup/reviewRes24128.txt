Went here today for lunch with my boyfriend. We ordered the sesame chicken, sweet and sour pork ribs and the garlic eggplant. About 15 minutes after we ordered I was told they were out of eggplant. I was a little annoyed by this development because, 1) garlic eggplant is one of my favorite dishes and 2) it was only 1pm. To replace the eggplant I got an order of spring rolls. The spring rolls were mediocre, I have definitely had better. The pork ribs were good, but nothing special. The sesame chicken was a definite let down Everything about the meal seemed half-backed. I don't know if my experience was a one-off event, but I will not be returning to confirm my initial judgment.
