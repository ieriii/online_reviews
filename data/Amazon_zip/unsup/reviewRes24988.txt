Chorizo burrito is the best burrito I have ever had. The steak casado is awesome and of course the oatmeal shake. I love their guac and the guys here are SO nice. You always feel right at home rather if you are coming in to eat for a BYO dinner with friends, or if you are just stopping in to pick up a carry out order. It is one of our favorites in the neighborhood and has been for some time now!
