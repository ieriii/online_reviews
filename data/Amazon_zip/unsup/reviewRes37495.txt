Specialty gourmet grocery store- lots of fun, spendy stuff. Disappointed by the produce section; 'organics' (oranges, apples, and some badly bruised pears) all lumped into a small basket in the corner. But the cafe made our stay at the nearby Sheraton so much nicer! Great breakfasts, lunches and dinners. The 2 out of 3 combo lets you pick a sandwhich, soup or salad combo that was delicious and filling for less than $8. Great service. It's weird that the cool bulk candy section is right next to the meat dept and smells like fish...
