I really like coming here even all the way from suburbia. I came to pick up a birthday cake: Chocolate rasberry truffle (you can call and reserve the cake). The almond cookies are to die for. You bite into it's softness and all you do is smell and taste the almonds. My son's favorite and mine too. At 2pm, it was busy and if it wasn't because I was in a hurry to get back home that I would have sat down and had a salad. It looked fresh, the chunk of feta cheese and the aroma of the salad dressing, goodness, I almost took a fork and plunged into a stranger's plate! I have eaten there for other items, and the food really is fresh with a Greek flair to it. The artisan breads are freshly baked daily and there is a 15 minute parking out front for take-out only. Oh, and the staff has always been friendly every time I visit.
