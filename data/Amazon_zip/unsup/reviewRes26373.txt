Moving soon from Atlanta where I live by several fantastic Vietnamese restaurants on Buford Hwy which is certainly the most glorious stretch of ethnic eating in the Southeast. I'd give the food here 3-3.5 stars because while it is flavorful & interesting, the ingredients used don't always seem to be the absolute greatest. That being said, everything was very satisfying and even better that it was very economical (hence the extra points that make it a 4 star spot for me). Lemongrass beef was nicely seasoned and always love the various herbs/vegetables that come with this dish but it takes a bit of assembly. If you've never done the manual rice paper roll-up, I'd suggest asking for a little demo. Mmm. I've had better rice paper at other restaurants but that didn't take away too much . . . The main thing that attracted us to this place was the soup options. Beef pho hit the spot but I've had it at some places where the beef cooks in the broth immediately before serving and didn't seem to be the case here. There was also a shrimp soup with pineapple, celery, tomato, okra that had kind of a sweet/sour broth that I liked. Many more enticing options on the menu which is always a plus. The bit o' watermelon and orange brought out with the bill was a nice final touch. Not to mention the barrage of thank-you's we received from 4 or 5 employees on our way out! Love BYOB option and only paying $25 to get a more than filling dinner
