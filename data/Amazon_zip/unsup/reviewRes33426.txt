Francesca's in Lakeview has great food, always large crowds (not first date appropriate, at least not the Lakeview location), a cozy feel, and just damn great prices. I wouldn't claim Francesca's as being the most authentic Italian in the city but their food is awesome and they have very wallet friendly prices. Their mussels in tomato sauce are so yummy! The sauce was so good that I sneakily added some into my non-tomato sauce pasta.  Their wine selection is okay but nothing to be excited about. I can only speak for the Creme Brule when talking deserts but it was creamy, perfectly caramelized, and just the right size (okay, I like my things a bit bigger but hey, the longer the time I can spend with such a wonderfully crafted dessert, the better).
