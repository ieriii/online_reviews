I have been here twice and both times left me feeling not quite right. The first time we have a lovely dinner, but there was a mix up with our reservation and we had to wait for a table. Once seated, our service was so slow, we were there after closing time, rushing through our food. At the time, I thought the food was okay, but I wouldn't recommend Geja's. On my second visit, my boyfriend and I arrived early. While we did have a reservation, they placed us at a cramped table in the back. We ordered the cheese, chocolate, beef and chicken. Our waitress was very inattentive. I ordered a drink and she brought me the wrong one- twice! Service was again slow and we were virtually ignored the entire time we were there (and not in a good way). Our burner even went out a few times and it took quite a while to get her to come back to relight it. I want to like Geja's. The ambiance is unbeatable and the cheese fondue is actually quite delicious, but I've had better elsewhere, so that doesn't make up for the consistently awful service.
