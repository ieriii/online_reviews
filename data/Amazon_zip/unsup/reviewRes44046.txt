Oh, HELLWakamoNO. I used to love this place. I swore by this place. And then it...changed. I was willing to look past the somewhat pretentious environment of the place for the amazing sushi. But something shifted in the quality of the food a little while ago. It stopped seeming as fresh, and the mind-numbing deliciousness quieted down to a dull roar...at best. The kicker was one night I called for delivery, and asked for the order to be read back to me several times, as the price I was quoted seemed too high (even for this place, which can tend toward the spendier end of the mid-spectrum for sushi). Being assured everything was fine, I received my order with 3 extra orders of edamame. When I called to explain I'd wanted to "free" edamame that came with delivery, the girl on the other end profusely apologized. But when I asked to speak with the manager, s/he happened to be conveniently "out" and would have to call me back. And when I did get a call back? It was the same poor girl I'd spoken to before calling to tell me the manager said they couldn't refund the money I'd been overcharged, but they would "credit my account"...? And then informed me someone would be coming to pick up the extra edamame. Because, apparently, it's totally reusable. So, while the sushi is good (again, at best), the management is crap, and I have not - and will not - visit this establishment again. There are far too many other sushi spots in the city that won't repo appetizers. Which, consequently, they never showed up for. But, from what I hear, the chef that used to work here moved to a place in Logan Square. So, hope lives!
