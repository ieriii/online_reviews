Huge selection of vegetarian and vegan foods! All of which have been delicious so far, by the way. Their menu is so huge, it is safe to say you could be a regular and still need a few weeks or months to try everything. I was pleased with their breakfast selections as well, which had many egg free options, which is oftentimes an obstacle even at other vegetarian spots. I wish there was more parking but the place is always bustling, and it is safe to say anyone from the Chicago area is used to the fact that there's generally limited parking in the city, period. That is certainly never a detractor for me, I drive to the Diner all the way from the northwest suburbs and I'd walk several blocks if I had to in order to get a bite to eat here. Be forewarned, everyone loves this place, it's always full, but in general I've managed to nab a spot to sit every time I have come here, whether outside or inside. The deserts are phenomenal, their portion sizes are generous, and they have a great beer selection too.
