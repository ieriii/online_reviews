5 stars. My wife and I were having our date night and wanted authentic Italian food. We decided to try to something close to her work when I picked her up. It was right by her job and this place was exactly what we looked for. The valet guy was not working because it was on a weekday, and the manager was nice enough to find us a free parking spot. The prices are reasonable and the menu was great. Service was amazing. Our favorite thing about a restaurant is good service, we will definitely be back.
