You know what Calo? I'm actually happy for a change that you've continued to tie your otherwise annoying advertisements to the gate in front of my house. Seriously. The wife and I, in our continued search for a "compromise pizza" that doesn't feel like either of us are compromising were pleasantly pleased with the proscuitto, pineapple and parmesean pie that you brought to our place the other night. The thin crust wasn't cardboard but also wasn't doughy. We were happy. We were especially happy with the $23 pricetag for the 18" "XL", after coupon, with delivery. Fed us for three days! Thanks. We'll try you again soon.
