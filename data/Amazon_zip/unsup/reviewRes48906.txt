Good overall experience at the Publican. I like the beer hall atmosphere with the communal tables and pig pen booths. Beer list is impressive and has great breadth. I loved the Indiana beer on draught. The menu is interesting and of course heavy on the pork offerings. Oysters were decent, not great. I had shell fragments in one of my two. Oops. All of the dishes were good, none great. Overall, it is a fun place to come with a group and share a bunch of food and drink some killer beers. Not the type of place that will wow you. A bit on the pricey side.
