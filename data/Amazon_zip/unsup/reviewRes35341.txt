I've had the Beijing Duck dinner and also a scallop dish here. Both are SOOOOO good. My favorite part of the duck dinner is the first~~!! Freshly sliced up beijing duck with mantou. The duck is deeeelicious, but the MANTOU is oh-so-good. My friends and I all agreed that it's hard to get a good mantou in Chicago (unless your Mom makes it!) and this place makes it perfectly. It is not too hard, not too soft, or to sweet or too dry. It is perfect! Especially with the combo of duck, plum sauce, daikon,... oooh sooo goood. The soup is nice, but not to die for... same with the duck fried rice. I love scallops so it's hard to find a scallop dish I don't like, but I was definitely a fan. I feel like Sun Wah could definitely transport itself to Asia and fit in well. I love their new (ish) location, with a airy, light, and open design. I feel at home when I go there... is that weird? (yes.. i know.) Maybe it's because my house has a lot of exposed brick. Anyway, I'm going to beijing in a few weeks so I will tell you how the duck measures up. :D
