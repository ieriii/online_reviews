I have been here twice now and am hooked. The first time was the Cuban Style Chicken, very very tasty and the mojitos are perfection. The second time I came I had the Pistachio Crusted Chicken which is my absolute favorite. It was very tender and flavorful. Top off your meal with the Guava cheesecake - absolutely divine!
