Move over Smoque, Chicago Q is now my favorite BBQ in Chicago. Though the decor was confusing (a little upscale, a little sports bar, a little call back to old school bbq joints) the food was amazing. We started with the Bacon Hush Puppies which were amazing. We then ordered two meats plus a half slap of ribs. The pulled pork was terrific and the sauce for it was amazing. The brisket was really good as well. The only think we thought was just average were the baby back ribs (non competition). The meat fell off the rib way to easy. Next time we go we will make sure to get the competition style ribs.
