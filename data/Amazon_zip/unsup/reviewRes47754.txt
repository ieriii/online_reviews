Okay, I really liked this place! I have been twice now, and each time I had a few drinks and appetizers in the downstairs bar area(s).  The martinis are delish! The atmosphere is sexy! The crowd is very stylish and not too old, not too young!  The service is great! I am not crazy about the idea of the buffet style menu, so I doubt that I would go back for dinner. But, the fondue is outstanding and I am plotting my return.
