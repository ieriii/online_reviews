Had a delicious breakfast this morning after we ran the Wrigley run. It was our first time there and I was curious about the organic southern food mix. Our timing was perfect as we comfortably found parking on the street right outside the restaurant (it was about 10 am) and were seated near the window. We had the pulled pork and grits ($11), crabcakes in popovers ($15), and the Omelet La Forche (with crawfish, jalapenos, cheese, light bearnaise sauce and served with grits or something else - I don't remember because we chose grits - $15). The coffee was great (Intelligentsia) and the food was fresh and thoughtful. It was quantity and quality which is so excellent after a 5K.
