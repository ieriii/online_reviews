Might have given 5 stars if I was able to get something from the lunch menu. Only had 1/2 hour to spare for a snack and the line was too long. Got the delicious Iced Chocolate drink and churros. The drink was almost like a shake. It was an interesting combination of chocolate, mint and apple.  Was surprised to see Rick's daughter at the front counter. I was there at 12:30 pm.
