The first time I ate here, I loved this place, but in subsequent visits, I have found it to be somewhat of a let down. The food is decent, but not spectacular, and it's kind of expensive for what you get. The up-side is that Sapori Trattoria manages to send us dozens of pieces of mail every year offering us discounts since we signed up for their mailing list.
