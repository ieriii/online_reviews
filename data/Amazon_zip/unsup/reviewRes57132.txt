Living down the street from revolution means I'm here allot. Ive brought friends here, brought my parents here, Ive even brought my grandparents here. Great beer (though sometimes they're out of allot of things on the list) and fantastic food. There was a day where all I wanted was a chicken salad. I sat down at revolution by myself, had a beer, and ate this salad that was almost exactly how I imagined it in my head. It was week changing... Good story right? : p
