I made a dinner reservation via OpenTable at Gilt bar for two almost two weeks in advance, friend in from out of town. Gilt called me an hour prior to my reservation and advised if I did not call them back immediately to confirm they would cancel my reservation. Since I was getting ready and my phone was in my bag, I did not get the message until I was driving there...needless to say-reservation cancelled. Two weeks later I stopped in after the Ricky Gervais show around 9:00pm with two others for drinks. I was advised by a hostess that we could not be in the bar area so to please go downstairs where there is additional seating. She showed us to the staircase leading down to what looked like a pretty chill and cool spot to swill. We stood in front of a chalkboard sign for 5 minutes that said "please wait to be seated" while we stared at an open table. Finally a waitress apologized that we were standing there so long, seated us at the open table, gave us menus and said she would be back shortly. Another 5 minutes pass and the downstairs hostess shows up and advised we needed to vacate. I nicely explaned we were told to go downstairs and waited, and the waitress seated us( with menus)...she again, and more rudely this time demanded we get up as the table is "RESERVED FOR GUESTS". WTF? Were we NOT guests? No apology, no thank you for your understanding, in fact, I am surprised she did not kick us in the ass on the way out.  Back upstairs my friend asked for a manager who then told us we could sit single file on a bench in the back of the restaurant completely opposite the bar. That seemed like fun, try holding a conversation with three people sitting single file on a bench. Again, no apology.  The space is really nice and it warrants a star, the management and service are perhaps the worst I have experienced. It's really a shame.
