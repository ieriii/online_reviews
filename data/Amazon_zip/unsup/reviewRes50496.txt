Wishbone has always been a favorite of mine, especially for breakfast on a Sunday morning. Most of the food is standard; they have plenty of food options available. Occasionally I'd order the berry pancakes or the basic omelette/sausage/grits combo. You can't really go wrong with anything that you order from here. Service here is always excellent. Keep in mind that you'd definitely have to come here before the breakfast crowds file in; especially on weekends. You also can't help but stare at the southern-themed decor all throughout the restaurant: from the paintings along the walls to the rooster sculptures. Is this place unique? Probably not. But I'm fine with that. Great down-to-earth cooking is sometimes satisfying enough.
