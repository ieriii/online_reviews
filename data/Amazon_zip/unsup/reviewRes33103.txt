Veni, Vidi, Devour (I came, I saw, I ate.) I woke up hungry; I did my morning cardio/weight routine; I left the condo famished. This place is relatively convenient to the office. I got to the office and was ready for a nap. This place has an extensive menu. They also have an auxiliary Seasonal menu. I spent a fair amount of time making a decision. I opted for the "Porky Benedict" from the seasonal menu. Pulled pork, and lots of it, replaced the traditional Canadian Bacon. It wasn't smoked like one might expect from a BBQ joint, but it was very tasty. The description mentioned that it came with fresh fruit. I was expecting an orange wedge and perhaps a few bits of melon. What I got was orange slices, two good sized chunks of fresh pineapple, a big chunk of melon, and a handful of grapes. There was also an ample portion of diced red potatoes. The space is open and bright. The staff is friendly and attentive. Partner doesn't know it yet, but Yolk has been added to our brunch rotation.
