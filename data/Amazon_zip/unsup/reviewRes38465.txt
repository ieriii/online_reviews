A quintessential Chicago craft beer destination complete with outstanding food, Andersonville's Hopleaf Bar is where its at for Belgian fare in Chi-town. Try the mussels, sausages, sandwiches (CBJ, Talapia, montreal brisket, nueske ham are all awesome), as well as all (yes I said try all) of the entrees. I really like the braised beef cheeks with a side of stilton mac'n cheese as well as any of the specials. All the food here is excellent. Of course this comes at a price and with a wait. Expect to wait awhile for your table (up to hours of you try late on a Saturday evening), but that's A-OK, as the upstairs beer room will allow you to get comfortably numb on big bad Belgian beast brews beforehand. Don't forget to swig on one of many choice Belgian drafts over dinner with friends and save room for dessert if you think you have room (bourbon county stout choc mousse with framboise, yes please). Hopleaf is a must go to for all belgian beer and food lovers.
