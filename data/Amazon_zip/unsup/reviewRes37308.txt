Great market for foodies. They have hard to find spices, meats, cheeses and more. They also have a great little cafe that serves up a yummy breakfast on a cold Chicago morning. One of my favorite items they sell are soup kits. They are great starters for creating a pot of gourmet chowders, soups and stews at home.
