Last week me and my friend went to downtown Chicago to visit the Greek and Italian neighborhood. It was Sunday night so we decided to eat diner in one of the restaurants in Greektown. Our eyes were drawn to this restaurant.When we entered the restaurant one of the waiters came to us and showed us our seats. She gave us the menu cart and we decided to choose a signature sandwich: the Norwegian crest. This is a sandwich with house smoked salmon, capers, shaved onion and a cream sauce on Caraway Dark Rye Bread. The presentation of the plate was good and you could taste that the bread was freshly baked. We also decided to try a typical traditional Greek dessert, called Loukoumades, which wasn't really my thing.The service was good and the food was nice, so I would like to recommend this place to everybody!
