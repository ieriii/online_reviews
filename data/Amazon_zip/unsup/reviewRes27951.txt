Went here on a recommendation for a friend's birthday, August 17. We had a kick-ass time!  The salsa rocks, the service was awesome, and the prices were unbelievably cheap. I was embarassed asking whether my meal was, in fact, an appetizer.  It was like $4.95.  It was an entree and filling, too. At the end of the meal they killed every light in the place and sang happy birthday to our friend.  It was adorable.  It's BYOB, but there's a liquor store two doors down and it's easily accessible from the green line.  Only cons:  creepy guy at L station and kinda nasty banos:-)
