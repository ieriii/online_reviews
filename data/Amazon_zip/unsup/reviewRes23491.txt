Best I've had so far in Greek town! Came here for lunch and we got seated right away; service was great - fast and attentive, and my water glass was refilled almost every time I took a sip! The greek salad had an amazing dressing and was very fresh; dolmades were hot and delicious; the avgolemono (sp?) was awesome - a chicken and rice lemony soup that was perfect on a cold day. My sister ordered a grilled chicken sandwich on a pita and the chicken was moist and very flavorful, and the pita bread was amazing! Prices are reasonable too.
