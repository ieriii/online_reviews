This place is a great choice for pizza by the slice, and they have this brazilian grilled chicken that is incredible!!! Pizza is really good and very reasonably priced. Only complaint is that sometimes they let it sit out under the lights a little long. My experience here has almost always been fantastic and the food is really good for how inexpensive it is.
