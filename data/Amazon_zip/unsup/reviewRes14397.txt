My first time experiencing Cuban food and it was an overall good experience. I'd return to eat there. I went for dinner. Very different atmosphere according to my friend who went for lunch. There were a few birthday parties and it was constantly loud and festive. Not a bad thing, but not for those who like to dine in silence. Also, prices for the same items are higher at dinner than at lunch. Interior is festive; gives the restaurant a lot of character. They use jars as water cups! Love it. I tried their sweet plaintains (maduros) as an appetizer -- but it was a hefty portion that my two friends and I could not finish. Got the bistec sandwich -- very tasty. Full of meat and ingredients. Meat was very thick and juicy -- a little too greasy. My bread started to fall apart on account of the grease. Also offers shakes.
