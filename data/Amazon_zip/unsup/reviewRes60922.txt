I love, love, love BIN 36! Hands down the best Cheese and Wine in the city- and the other food ain't bad either. I eat at the bar mostly, it's comfortable and inviting and the bartenders are very friendly, I would definitely recommend it to single diners. I've also been to the Movies in the Loft and it's a blast. Try the Bin 36 Cheese flight and the Red Hot South America Wine Flight or the Well Traveled Whites- all my favorites.
