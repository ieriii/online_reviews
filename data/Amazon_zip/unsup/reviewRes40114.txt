To date San Soo Gab San is still my favorite late-night Korean BBQ joint. My usual order with newbies is an order of spicy chicken and sliced beef. But once you've been a few times, push past the temptation to grill and try the stews. Try them all, but start with the kimchi stew. You won't be disappointed when a volcanically hot bowl of bubbling noodles, meat, and spicy rich sauce arrives on the table. Be sure you have a couple bottles of OB to wash it down with. But the pachan are really the draw. Suddenly, without warning, after you are seated, the entire table is covered in tiny dishes of delicious bits of this and that. A few pickles, some spicy, some not, crunchy veggies, the ubiquitous potato salad, some sweet sauced veggies, various fish or shrimp bits, and a square mound of kimchi. Picking at these is just about the most fun part of the experience.
