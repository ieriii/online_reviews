Tank is my go-to place whenever I'm in the mood for a big ass bowl of pho. I've been here a gazillion times, but sadly to say, I haven't tried much else other than the pho. By the time I get off the train at Argyle, I'm usually craving pho specifically and I'm not in the mood for anything else! Portions are good, service is quick, and the food is filling. I usually get the #42, which is the typical pho but seems to have some extra tendon and brisket, which I loooove. I would definitely also try the Vietnamese iced coffee if you're in the need of a caffeine fix. It's incredibly strong, but also incredibly sweet -- not your typical Starbucks-esque drink, but definitely gives you an effective jolt in your nerves if you need one!
