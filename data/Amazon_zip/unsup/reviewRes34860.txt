I've just started getting into Middle Eastern food, and I have to say that Sultan's Market is a great place to start (and finish!) for those new to the cuisine. If it's any indication of how good the food is, we make special trips to Wicker Park just to eat there (it's a bonus that we can usually find street parking nearby). There is a great salad bar where you can select your own food--I really appreciate being able to view the food (especially unfamiliar food) before it's served and also being able to select portion sizes. I always order the spicy falafel sandwich minus the Jerusalem salad (Note: there is nothing wrong with the salad--it's just a preference. You can also swap out the salad with tabouli, if you prefer.). It's just falafel, hummus and a spicy chili sauce in a pita. Delish. My boyfriend goes back and forth between the falafel and lamb sandwiches. This place is great for meatlovers and vegans alike!
