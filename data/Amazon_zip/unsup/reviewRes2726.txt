Though Tru was a great meal, you should never go to Tru after going to Alinea. Tru had a great multi-course menu with some amazing flavors. The waiting staff were very kind, which you should expect for the price of the luxurious meal. The decor was very modern and relaxing. I went to Tru with three of my other upper 20's friends and we notice very quickly that we were the youngest people in the place. Tru was a great dinning experience for those who can't afford Alinea. I would recommend experiencing Tru at least once while you are in Chicago.
