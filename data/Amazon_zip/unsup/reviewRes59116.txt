If you're visiting Chicago and looking for a great place to have breakfast near the the Loop and Grant Park, I don't think there is a better place. My mom would come to visit me while I attended school, and she not only remembered, but requested it whenever she would visit. What a great place, with great food and an excellent morning atmosphere. Start your day off right!
