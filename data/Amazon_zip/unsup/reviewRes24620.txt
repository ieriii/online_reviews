Oh boy do i have mixed feelings about this place. My Asian side is screaming "Holy god! overpriced hot pot dinner." But my American-educated side is telling me "It's called fondue. It's supposed to be expensive." Think: A cozier, more romantic, Melting Pot. Just don't let them turn the lights up. We started off with a small salad and a basket of grapes, apples, and cubed bread. This was all to be dipped in super hot Gruyere cheese flaming in a little Le Creuset pot. Adorable and surprisingly delicious. The cheese was really strong, but I was shocked at how tasty sweet plump grapes go with stinky melted cheese. The $50 seafood deluxe platter comes with 2 scallops, a lobster tail, and 2 prawns. The sides also include an assortment of raw veggies, including potatoes, broccoli, mushrooms and peppers. The bf and i ordered the broth, which our server said would take 2x the amount of time oil would take. I'm glad we still picked broth!!! The huge assortment of sauces we fun! Without it, the food would have been bland. My favorite combo: Horseradish + BBQ. The best part is most definitely dessert. DO NOT PUT THE MARSHMALLOW SKEWER DIRECTLY IN YOUR MOUTH POST-ROASTING. I had a big fat blister to show for it. A small platter of bananas, strawberries, pineapple and poundcake. Plus 2 marshmallows each. A tiny bowl of crushed graham cracker crumbs so you can make your own "smore". I managed to lick the chocolate-filled Le Creuset clean...with a spoon of course. P.s. You can ask nicely for some extra fruit. :) The bf and I were...70% full. The way it should be if your goal is not to become obese. But dang, the price is just surreal (read: too much!) for what we got.
