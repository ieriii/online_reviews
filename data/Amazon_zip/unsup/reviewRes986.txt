Where else can you pick up strange game sausage dogs in Chicago? And Doug, himself, even takes the order. You'll read a lot about the foie gras and duck sausage and for good reason, it's a peculiar blend of flavors for a dog, but it works and works well. I felt like I was tasting it for the first time with each bite. It's amazing how cheap the Chicago dog is considering how popular this place is. I went on a deep dish binge this trip trying to find the best and maybe next time I'll seek out the best Chicago dog, but I feel like this place serves up a very solid rendition of it.
