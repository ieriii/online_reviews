I have only been here once, but I think the line that I had to wait in speaks for itself! If you wanted to sit it was a half hour plus on a Wednesday! Ordering to-go was much quicker and there was no way I wasn't going to try a torta! I ordered the chicken tinga wood burning oven torta. So delicious! The torta had this beautiful smokey taste to it while maintaining the proper spicy kick that every torta should have. Spot on with the chicken tinga Rick! Well done. Will return next time I am in Chicago!!
