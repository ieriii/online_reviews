Nice property. Slammin' breakfast for a hotel complimentary meal. Incredibly friendly staff. They seem to know where everything is. Comfy beds. Pretty decently priced which is astounding. Love the kurig in the room. Nice TV's in the room too. Walgreens right next door to buy your CTA cards and if you get here before 6 on a friday I would suggest hitting up the cute little cupcake store right next to the Madison st. entrance. It's super cute. Free wifi with great connection. I can really only take one star for the location. It is right next to an L stop but on the weekends there is nothing open on this side of town and the L lines that go to that station are only open until 12 so if you are a night owl like me you will end up spending some dough on cabs. Not their fault but definitely a downside. I would stay on the Mag Mile next time even though i despise shopping and that area in general. I also wish they had a mini fridge in the room. We left enough food at every place we went out to eat to half of the hungry in the city. Plus it would have been nice to be able to chill the drinks we brought into the room.
