Last time I was in Chicago, Hot Doug's was closed because Doug was on vacation. TRAVESTY! On my next trip to Chicago, I knew that I had to go here. My friend and I came here at 9:45am and we were third in line. Yes! When I was looking at the menu, I had a hard time deciding what to get because everything looked good. I decided to get 2 of their specials: the Foie Gras sausage and the bacon and cheddar elk sausage along with an order of duck fat fries and a small Coke. I figured if I was going to eat unhealthy, might as well go all out. By far, my favorite was the elk. The raclette cheese and bacon-garlic mayo they used was so delicious. I could definitely see why everyone raves about the Foie Gras. Personally I thought the duck fat fries was okay, but I could see why everyone likes them. Definitely more savory than the regular fries. Hot Doug's for breakfast put me into a food coma for the rest of the day, but it was worth it. Worth the hype!
