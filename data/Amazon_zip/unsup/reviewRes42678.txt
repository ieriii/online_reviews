No relation to Fogo de Chao, "fogo" means fire in Portuguese (no, I didn't know that- yes, I did google "fogo translation"). And that's exactly what you get at Fogo 2 Go- fire roasted chicken and brick oven pizzas, priced to move! After walking by here 1000 times we finally stopped by for some slices (buy two and you get a free drink!) and chicken. To go, naturally. I didn't have the chicken but the pizza was delish. If you order a whole pie they have over 60 different varieties, or you can choose from the few they have in the store (when we came they had veggie, pepperoni, cheese and meatball). F2G is so good I'll def be back, but as Tristan P. says, "It's pizza, baby. It's good no matter what!"
