The thin crust pizza is to die for. Period. The sauce is perfect and the meats are so flavorful, this is the real chicago pizza. I discovered this place because there was a drawer full of menus left in my new apartment(20 menus gets you a free pizza). And thank God I tried it, because I haven't ordered from another pizza place since. Eating in is also really great; good atmosphere, decent wine list, and excellent pasta dishes.
