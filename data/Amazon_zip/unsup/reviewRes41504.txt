Bea likes pho so much that we are here twice a week for lunch. I especially like the seafood and the beef pho. Definitely try the beef pho with star anise in it as its an excellent choice. Very complex flavors and good depth of flavor as well. The atmosphere is very Ho Chi Minh meets Ho Jo's but look past it to find a great culinary treat at a really decent price.
