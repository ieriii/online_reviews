Violet Hour is my happy place. I can't get enough of this place and make it a point to go there whenever I am in Chicago. It's one of my favorite cocktail lounges in the world. Let's just say it's somewhere in my top 5 from around the world. The decor and ambiance is stunning and relaxing. You are better off avoiding this place on the weekend. Otherwise, expect to stand in line a long time. Best to visit on a Sunday night or during the week.
