Look everyone. Yes, they make the best hot dawgs i know of in Chicago. (I know there is one guy where you have to wait 2 hours in line, i'm too busy for that). But PLEASE, if you want to do yourself a favor, try the burgers. The Whoopercheesie on dark bread is one of those things you will never forget.
