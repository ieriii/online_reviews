Everything that's great about this place has already been said.  But as a long-time, sometimes solitary, all-girl patron, let me give you a few tips: 1. Don't walk home from here late at night by yourself, no matter how street savvy you think you are, or how tightly you hold your handbag. I can't tell you how many nice conversations I've had with rock dealers after a show. I used to talk to anyone because I was a 22 year old IDIOT. I'm lucky that naivety didn't land me in the gutter. (Those guys always tried to cut me a good deal, though, I gotta say.) 2. This is not a place to come get wasted, unless you do it quietly and to better enjoy the music. 3. It's worth it to take an evening nap and stick around for the post-midnight shows. 4. Please take a Tuesday night and listen to the Deep Blue Organ Trio. You won't be able to fully appreciate Prince until you hear that amazing cover of "Raspberry Beret." Truly, truly makes me happy. 5. If you bring a date and get a booth for the evening, you are guaranteed to fall in love. And, OK, if that doesn't work, get a vodka gimlet. I swear, the way they make them here, that's a love affair in and of itself.
