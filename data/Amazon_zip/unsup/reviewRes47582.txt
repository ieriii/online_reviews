Honestly an amazing deal for $48. I would definitely go back there again. So fresh and delish. Loved the salmon ceviche. The soup was no good at all. Would be nice to include dessert, but totally worth it nonetheless especially if you are a meat eater. I only eat fish, but they tried to accommodate.
