Wow...what a wonderful experience! We had a two-for-one coupon and were looking forward to the dining experience. (Unfortunately, the lobster had been taken off the menu due to the oil spill in the Gulf.) We were not disappointed! The meat and the 60 item salad bar were better than I remembered. We met many of the wonderful staff including but not limited to, the GM, Dimitri Poulos. We had another set of servers that was always there at just the right time. So a special thanks to Vincent, Hugo, Ozzy, and especially Nicolas! You all made our visit a great memory.Will definitely bring back friends during out next visit...
