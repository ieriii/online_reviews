You will wait. This wait can be a fun group experience, or at least a chance to catch up with your friends. Unless you came alone. Either way, the food makes it worth it. The menu is wonderfully ridiculous. Doug puts together food combinations I didn't know I wanted until I read the specials. It changes constantly, and I make it an effort to try something different every time I visit, and I have not ever been let down. Not once. The eclectic menu would not be worth much if it didn't translate to good food, but fortunately, it does. Seriously, every time I go, I'm savoring it for the rest of the day. It's that good. It's why I, and the many patrons who visit put up with the sometimes insane lines. Oh, and Friday & Saturday, they have Duck Fat Fries. You have to try the Duck Fat Fries. The place is also full of character and charm. It has these attributes in droves. If you don't like it, I attribute it to a fault in character. You and I could not be friends.
