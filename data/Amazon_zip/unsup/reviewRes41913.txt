This place is the best steak house for filet mignon ever. We have been coming here for the past 5 years and the consistancy is stable. We always had the filet mignon and it is cooked to perfection and just melts in your mouth. It must be the way they age the steaks and the way you want it is always fantastic. We were here this past saturday and as always the steak was fabulous and the staff was fantastic. Thank you Ruth Chris, you are fantastic!
