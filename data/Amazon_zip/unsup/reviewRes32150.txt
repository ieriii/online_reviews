I'm not a vegetarian, BUT... I read this place had great food and it didn't disappoint! I had the 'breakfast bowl' at lunch today, was the tastiest breakfast i'd had in a while! For a weekday at lunch, I was surprised that there we so few people in the place and so service was extremely quick and attentive. I'll be back to try more!
