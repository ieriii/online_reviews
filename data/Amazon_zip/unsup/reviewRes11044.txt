The Bongo Room doesn't necessarily need another review but I'll add my two cents. I usually only eat here the day after running the Chicago Marathon but indulged on a recent Sunday morning; it was delicious per usual. I went with my usual strategy, order a normal breakfast (an egg dish) and then get a 1/2 order of one of the fantastic, dessert like pancake dishes and split it with my co-diner. While I love the Bongo Room, I do have two caution flags: 1. Get ready to wait on the weekend; don't get to the restaurant already famished...it'll be a wait. 2. Prepare to be full; it usually takes some time to feel like I want to eat again.
