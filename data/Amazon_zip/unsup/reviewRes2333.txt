Is everyone missing the obvious? Its a hot dog in a bun. I have been to Hot Dougs twice the 1st time after we closed on our condo and our real estate agent kept raving about the place. Then I went for lunch to see if maybe I missed something the first time. Nope! Its still a hot dog on a bun. I guess the different sausages are interesting but overall I could ditch the line and get a good hot dog just down the street from where I live. I don't think the third time would be the charm so I will not be back. Come on people a line for Hot dogs. What's next?
