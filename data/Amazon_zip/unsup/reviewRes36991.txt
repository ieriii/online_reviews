Triple D brought me to Hopleaf and I am so glad it did! This place is cozy and has really decadent and delicious food. We came for lunch on a Sunday and though the menu was abbreviated and we had no waitperson (you order at the bar) this was fine and dandy for us. The beer selection is overwhelming, but I am sure the bartenders are really helpful if you are undecided. I wish Hopleaf was closer, I'd definitely be a regular here if it were.
