Some of the best tortas ever created. Better than Cook's Torta in Monterey Park, CA. Rick Bayless is a genius with his cooking style. The Ahogada is a dine-in only item and a must order item. The broth and chile sauce is a great complement to the pork carnitas. The Cubana was also an excellent choice with spicy sauce on the side. Next time I'm back in Chicago, I'll definitely try other sandwiches.
