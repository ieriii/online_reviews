We tried to stay here for our anniversary. We stay at LaQuintas frequently and are members of their rewards club. This time our experience was dreadful. There were some young women in a room across the hall partying loudly. We called twice to complain. The first time nothing happened. The second time security came, but as soon as he left, the party started up again. So we packed up and checked out. LaQuinta had obviously decided which customers they wanted to keep. So, the formerly loyal customers are sitting in Union Station waiting for a train. Thanks for giving us a memorable anniversary night, La Quinta.
