We stayed at this location for a conference for 5 days in June 07. The location was nice but I was not impress with the hotel at all. I rather stay off of Michigan Ave. if it meant we can stay at a hotel where it is cleaner and spacious. We arrived during the conference and it took awhile for us to check-in. Unfortunately, it was during high school proms, the lobby was swamped with 4 different proms the weekend and the attendees of the conference (McCormick Convention Center). I was not impress with the wait in the elevators and because it was so crowded with unsupervised teenagers and professionals, getting to the top floor was a hike. The hallway was very narrow and gloomy with unattractive 70's carpet. The room was very tight. It was two double with a 'view' but it was not much of a view. The got us excited during check in but the room/ window was against a wall so we can only see out at an angle. The bathroom was very ugly. The tub was standard and small. Very dated. The toilet was old and the seat was chipping so I can't tell if they cleaned the toilet or not. The closet door did not slide; we called someone to fix it and not one came by to fix the door during our stay. (5 days of neglect). The iron did not work so we had to call for another one. We needed to iron our clothes for work. That was also a drag. Bar was small and dingy. The desk did not know of late night restaurants. Getting a cab was about 20-30 minute wait. I was not impressed at all. The city is full of fun things to do but at the end of the day, we dreaded coming back to our room. I have to go to Chicago every year for the hubby's conference and this is one hotel I plan on never returning to. I felt like I was in a run down old Vegas casino-hotel. ****Update**** as of Summer 2008, this Marriott Downtown location went through a major renovation. Looks amazing and with a sexy bar - t.v.'s everywhere. I would stay here again if Amalfi's booked.
