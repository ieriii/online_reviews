texas de brazil has some of the best food i have had the privelege of tasting. all the meats served were piping hot, and succulent almost to a fault. our waiter was terrificly attentive, with our beverage glasses never reaching below half full. this was quite a feat as it seemed quite busy for a monday evening. the man who seemed to be the manager greeted us warmly and saw to it that we were brought the cuts of meat we wanted to re-taste, and the gauchos (meat servers) were more than happy to oblige. the building itself was probably the classiest place i have ever been, with an entire wall dedicated to wine and a trapeze-artist type lady gliding up the wall to grab wine selections. also, all of the furniture was fabulous yet functional. a silly thing did catch my eye, however. i was told that the gauchos converse mostly in portuguese, so the cards must be flipped so they know if they should bring more meat or not. i did not hear a word of portuguese spoken in the place, and a few of the gauchos did not even look of any sort of latin descent whatsoever. also, the price was quite high for somebody with a small income. if you are going to go, i suggest joing their email club and recieving a 25% off your entire dinner coupon. texas de brazil is worth visiting at least once!
