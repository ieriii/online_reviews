Not...bad... Not...great... Good...sure. We stopped in for a late lunch one Saturday afternoon. It was grey outside, it was raining outside, and it was trying to snow. Did I mention it was in April? Anyway, we were hungry-ish, and looking for a place to get our grub on and get out of the shiteous weather. As for the latter half our our aforementioned list of needs, Wilde delivered all-too-well. It was amazingly cozy, warm, and comfy, thanks to the dark wood interiors and roaring fireplace. The first part of our needs were met shortly after we sat down, but not without some missed notes. The potato leek soup was tasty...serviceable pub-fare. The Buffalo Chicken sandwich I had, wasn't half-bad, but it was enough for 2 people, easy. I think each half of the sammy had a whole chicken breast on it.  The curry chips that we started with were ok, but after about half a bowl full of chips, only to be met with MORE chips on my plate with my sandwich, I was fried puhtaytuh'd out. It wasn't bad...it wasn't great...it serviced a need. Will we go back? More than likely not. Or maybe. Who knows. I need to get some new glasses over at New Days Optical across the street. Maybe another run at lunch will be in order.
