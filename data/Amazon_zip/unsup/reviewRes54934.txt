I will keep it brief. I love my neighborhood and I want to support any independently owned business in it but I will not do this blindly. But when you feel like a restaurant is really working hard to do it right, you can't help but fall in love with it. Ths place simply gets it. From the design to the menu to the service, we just really felt like this was a place that really cares. We ordered lightly and cautiously but everything we had was creative and perfectly done and we will back to try everything. The staff was warm and humble. Bravo!
