I finally made the trek over to 18th street after talking about going for over a year. Bought some beer at the liquor store next door and headed over to Nuevo Leon for some cheap Mexican food. I was a bit nervous when I ordered 3 enchiladas for $5, but the food was great and I couldnt even finish my meal. The service was very slow, but you can't beat a place that serves a yummy, stomach filling dinner for $12. BYOB, cash only.
