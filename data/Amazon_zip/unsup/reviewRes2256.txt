What can I say about the wonder that is Hot Doug's that hasn't already been said? Just plain delicious. It makes me ridiculously happy that I work in Logan Square becasue its a less than five minute drive away. Sure, I've only been there twice but I'm glad to know its there. The specials are where its at. Last time I was there I had a chicken sausage with red peppers and some sort of cheese. Sweet holy mother was that the best sausage I've ever had. Just insanely good. Yes, its crowded, and yes, I had to wait in line outside but it was totally worth it.
