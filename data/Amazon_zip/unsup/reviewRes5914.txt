What stands out most to me is Wildfire's consistent quality. All the dishes I've tried have been great. Personal faves include: the wildfire chopped salad (great with steak on top), the spinach salad, the bone in fillet, the planked salmon, the oatmeal crips desert, and their creamed spinach. They are great for take-out too and have dedicated take-out staff to ensure it runs smoothly.
