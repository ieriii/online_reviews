I love these kinds of places with milkshakes and salad bars. We had a chocolate on chocolate shake to split. That salad bar is said to have originated right here too. Our waiter was extremely enthusiastic and went over and beyond in his job. One great thing about this place is the soup. The price correlates with the weather. I asked him what about last week when it was -6 degrees. He said they wouldn't pay me to eat, unless I complain enough. Haha. I guess I wasn't original though because it is clearly printed on the menu.  The burges was great, they have shoe string fries which were great. And the overall atmosphere is nice and cozy, down to earth, normal place. I would give a minus 1 star to the host who broke up our group into two adjacent tables. She didn't even try to sit us together. I mean 7 people isn't that large of a group. I won't do that though because RJ Grunts is the first Lettuce Entertain you, a landmark almost, and she is replaceable and probably won't be there for too long. Check it out. And I love the music playing too!
