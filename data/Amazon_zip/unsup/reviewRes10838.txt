One of those places that turns the average pancakes and french toast into decadent and highly caloric desserts. I swear its like eating a frosted sheet cake from Jewel. Might just be worth the hour on the treadmill you'll have to do just to recover from it. I also really, really like the fact that they have a full bar. I bet a shot of Whiskey would go great with the White Chocolate & Caramel Covered Pretzel Pancakes or perhaps a glass of Shiraz with the Raspberry Oreo Flapjacks. The one thing I do know is that the breakfast burrito went divinely with a can of Half Acre Daisy Cutter.
