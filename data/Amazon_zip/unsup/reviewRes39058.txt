Oh yum. Seriously, yum. I recently enjoyed a very nice brunch with one of my big brothers at Longman & Eagle. Apparently my brother is a regular, they knew him by name, but even before he arrived the service was warm and welcoming.  He said to meet him at "11ish" on Saturday morning, of course they were packed. I waited at the bar for him and the bartender asked if I wanted a drink or to peruse a menu. When Robert arrived we decided to sit at the bar instead of wait for a table. The service at the bar was fantastic and it was just as comfortable as a table, if you're in a hurry to sit down head to the bar, you won't be disappointed. One of the bartenders said "if I knew you were Robert's sister I would've been nicer to you!" and I honestly thought "how could y'all be *nicer*?!" The brunch menu made my head spin, too many delicious choices. Of course, my hobo blood will out and so I chose the closest thing to corned beef hash...the sunny side duck egg hash. Duck confit, spring onions, potatoes, and a black truffle vinaigrette blanketed by two perfectly cooked sunny side up duck eggs. Oh man it was delicious. It was gorgeous too. It might be rare to find beauty in breakfast foods, but seriously, those were some good lookin' eggs. Robert had some kind of deliciousness that I can't remember the name of. I get the feeling no matter what you order here it's going to be good.  Longman & Eagle would be a great date spot, be it breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It's a warm and inviting atmosphere with dark wood, exposed brick, and hipster chic touches. The outdoor space would be a great spot for a spring or summer dinner date...
