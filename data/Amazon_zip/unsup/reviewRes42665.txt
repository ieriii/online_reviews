The look and feel of this place was great-- cozy yet modern, being in a log cabin slash hotel in Aspen. The cocktail lounge area was great and very appealing. I had the diablo drink and was pleasantly suprised at the uniqueness of the taste. I have yet to try the food which is the only reason why I did not give Gilt 5 stars but I will definitely be back! I think this place is good for groups and for you and a friend!
