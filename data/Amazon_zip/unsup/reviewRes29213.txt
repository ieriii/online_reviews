I LOOOOOVE Frontera Grill. I love Rick Bayless so I had been dying to try this place. It was everything I had hoped. Granted, we did get there at 4:45 on a Saturday in order to get seated without a 2-hour wait... We sat outside which was great, although I would like to try the main dining room at some time. The margaritas were phenomenal. The ceviche sampler was delicious. Friends said the oysters were great too (though I didn't eat them). I had the duck and it was awesome. The after-dinner coffee was great too, but I can't remember what it was called... In all, an outstanding dinner and I can't wait to go back!
