Graham Elliot really deserves 4 1/2 stars, unfortunately this rating system only allows whole stars. It's a wonderful experience to dine here. From the atmosphere, attentive wait staff, to the interesting, flavorful, artful combination of food. The food tastes as good as the presentation is received which is outstanding. If you go soon, I highly recommend the onion soup...the online menu is not updated. For summer it's a very fresh onion soup with pickled ramp which is just delicious and adds a nice sweet contrast to the savory nature of onions. The creativeness is in creating dishes with the same ingredient in different ways. For example the jidori chicken has carrots 4 ways (roasted, pureed, foamed, and cereal) all unique texture and tastes which combined with the other flavorful foods in the dishes makes for one excellent meal. Will be back.
