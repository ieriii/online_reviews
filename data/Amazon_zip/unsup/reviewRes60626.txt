Absolutely LOVEd this place! The food was amazing and in HUGE quantities. Plus, considering the area, the prices were pretty cheap. If you go with only one other person ask for a window seat. They overlook Michigan Avenue and it's a wonderful view while you're eating. The first time I was there I ordered the Bento Box lunch special. It was awesome! The next time I ordered some chicken but I can't remember what kind. Again, AWESOME! So much food I couldn't possibly finish it! I loved everything about this place and will definitely be returning next time I'm downtown.
