Just minutes into my weekend in Chicago, I stepped into the Hyatt Regency and thought, wait a minute, did I just walk into Las Vegas? The massive hotel is a conventioneer's dream. Two huge towers of rooms and an atrium that was so big it had me looking around for the missing slot machines. I was lucky to be attending along with a tattoo convention...a very large tattoo convention. The cheesiness of the lobby continued on to my first room that reeked of the strongest cleaner ever created. Luckily, they were very nice about changing my room. The view of the Chicago River and out to the lake was probably the greatest part of my room. Even with a fancy flat screen tv, I felt like I might as be in a Holiday Inn. Also, $13.50 for wifi? Really? I think I would rank this hotel as two stars but the price can't be beat for its great location.  I was blocks away from Michigan Ave, the Art Institute and Millennium Park. Also, I admit I can't really complain since I got a great deal for his hotel through Priceline. If you are on a budget or just looking for a place to crash then is the hotel for you.
