I saw a show here last Sunday night and really enjoyed it. My parents were in town and I wanted to take them to a real Chicago Jazz club that had a lot of history and this was the place. I took them to an 11pm show on a Sunday night and was glad we got there early to find a seat because halfway through the first set, the place was packed. The atmosphere was really something, my dad mentioned how the booths looked exactly like the ones in the gangster films.  All to often I go to see live music that I can't even hear because the people in the bar are talking too loudly, but the Green Mill was refreshingly different. The Green Mill wants to respect the musicians by asking patrons to keep a quiet conversation during performances so people can enjoy the music. We originally came to see the Kimberley Gordan trio because we heard great things, but Kim was sick and it was just Chris and Andy. They were set up in the center of the bar, which I thought was pretty cool and the music was great. I will definitely be back!
