2nd visit to the Lao family of restaurants...  and it was...  awesome!  It was more crowded than Lao Shanghai, but they were definitely on their game last night.  We had: - Spicy cabbage appetizer that every table gets - like kimchi, but crunchier, with dried shrimp flakes and so good. - Hot and sour soup - excellent. Would've liked to see more mushrooms in it, but still great - Crab rangoon - lots of people seem to love this appetizer. I am a newcomer to it, so dont really have a basis of comparison for Lao Sze Chuan's version. Alls I know is that I liked it. Suuuuper fried though. - Moo Shu Shrimp - probably my favorite of the meal. Their cabbage isn't as finely chopped up as other Moo Shu [anything] I've had, and I think it works. Also, plenty of yummy mushrooms. An order comes with 4 HUGE pancakes to roll up, and the plum sauce was lighter than most I've had. Suuuuuper tasty. I'd definitely recommend. - Ma Po Tofu - It was really really really spicy, and the tofu was much softer than versions I've had in the past. However, the color is this fantastic bright red with green shoots and the white tofu. Probably the most photogenic dish on the table.. really good. Fortune cookies were mealy, but I'm not a huge fortune cookie guy, and that really has no bearing on my view of this restaurant as a 4-star experience.  Go there. It's awesome! The menu is so huge that last night's meal is only the top o' the iceberg. I'm definitely going back.
