I was visiting Chicago this past weekend and kept passing by this place and it was always packed. The name Purple Pig kept ringing in my ear, so I decided to pop in. Lucky for me, there was one lone seat left at the bar. I started chatting up the guy next to me and he was alone too so we decided to share a bunch of small plates. Most everything here was just delicious! I tried things I would never try so as not to look like a wimp and I loved them. The yummy factor: 1) Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios 2) Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (I never would  have picked this or tried it, but it was so freaking amazing) 3) Foie Gras & Membrillo 4) Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots 5) Sicilian Iris - Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche The nothing special factor: 1) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - was good but nothing special 2) Petit Basque Cheese with Membrillo - again same. Was like fried mozzarella. I had a fabulous wine along with the food. The service was great, atmosphere was perfect. If not for the ok/bland factor of the two dishes above, I would have given 5 stars.
