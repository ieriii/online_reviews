I'm going to make this short and simple. The food was ok nothing spectacular. On it's own I'd rate it a solid 3 maybe even a 4. The service here was horrendous. In my time here in Chicago (over a year and a half) this was the only restaurant where the service ruined my dining experience. The server was rude, pretentious, unresponsive, and acted like we just didn't belong there. The thing is, I'm one of those people that can care less about service in the scheme of dining experience. But I found out, if you don't have service at all, it'll ruin everything. So to sum it up, if you are into horrible service and over-priced average food, Le Colonial is the place for you. To the restaurant's defense, my bf didn't exactly look like one of the Gold Coast snobs with a shiny Bentley parked in front of the restaurant, nor did I look like one of the shallow housewives that feels home at "Viagra triangle". But here's to the restaurant owner--teach your waitress what "customer lifetime value" means. Older and richer people won't return in 30 years, unfortunately, we won't either.
