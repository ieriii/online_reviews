Can't really say much more than all of the reviewers...guacamole and tamal de puerco were amazing. Dessert was equally as fabulous. I'm not a fan of margaritas, and I had two since they were so smooth. Duck was a miss since it was chewy. But one thing that surprised us was our waiter. I told him that I am usually a wine drinker and he stated that they are trained to pair wines with their foods. That is one thing I have never had, a wine pairing with Mexican food. I have to say that he did an amazing job and paired well for our ceviche, tamale, our "Enchiladas" Potosinas, sopes rancheros and our duck. It was worth it just for that. And also to see the chef himself at the bar eating. I'm getting a little worn out by going to a restaurant of the particular chef, and them not being there. It is good to see that he stays with his roots. And also, the best of all, eat a breakfast "sandwich" at his little jaunt in the airport (called Frontera). I wasn't even in the mood for anything like that and with one bite, I was hooked. Go Rick! PS-the reason for my 4 rating was simple, there were two bright flood lights shining down on our table and in our eyes the whole time and it detracted from the meal......
