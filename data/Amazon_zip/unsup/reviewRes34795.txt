Sushi-X has a pretty unbelievable happy hour. Sunday - Wednesday, from 5-7 pm (as long as you are seated by 7 pm) you get half off all sushi. Two friends and I end up their last night around 6:30. The place is fairly small, maybe about 10 tables. It also features Japanese anime projected on to a wall. It is a pretty dark place. When we arrive, there are two two-tops in front of us. In about 5 minutes, those two tables are sat so we should be next. Well because of the configuration of Sushi-X two tables got up and they sat another two two-tops after us. So we finally get seated around 7:05 after the 7 pm happy hour time and I must admit I had a little chip on my shoulder. The table we were seated at had cleared out about 10 minutes prior and the servers made no attempt to clean the table so we could sit down. They really could use a bus boy at Sushi X. From a business perespective I understand it but as a customer I was a little annoyed. Once I got over it, I ordered a philly roll and a Five-O roll. The Philly was pretty standard, cream cheese, salmon and avocado. The Five- O features bacon, hamachi, avocado, cilantro, scallions, pineapple mustard mayo, rolled in bacon bits, wrapped with proscuitto. All it was missing was a little spam and it would have reminded me of Hawaii! The roll was huge and filling; there must have been about 8 pieces. In hindsight, I didn't really need the Philly roll. I also had the miso soup which was served in a big coffee cup. Very tasty. The bill comes and the staff at Sushi-X was kind enough to give us the happy hour prices....which made me very happy. Sushi-X is a good BYOB place with a great happy hour deal. I wouldn't go out of my way to get here but the food is pretty good. If you are going to go for happy hour be sure to get there early. The place is tiny but it is worth the deal.
