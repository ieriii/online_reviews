You have to get the wings. No question. These were my favorites at this year's Wing Fest. You have never seen wings this size and this tasty. The sauces offer great flavor - try asking for 1/2 buffalo 1/2 bbq sauce for a seriously fantastic combination. You also can't go wrong with the Triple Secret make-your-own burger and the Grilled Cheese. Always have had prompt and friendly service, and even when it has been busy, the servers did a great job.
