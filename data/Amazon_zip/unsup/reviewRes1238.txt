Here's what you need to know: Everyone says that you are going to wait in a long long line. On a Friday or Saturday, that is true. Go on a weekday and you are likely not to wait more than ten or fifteen minutes! Hot Doug's is hidden. People need to search to find it. It is a mecca in a barren land of large manufacturing/electric companies.  It is only open 10:30-4pm. Check out their website for what is going to be on the menu that day. You can go one week and have a completely different experience the next week. You can order ahead and pick up if you order more than $25. If you have 2 or 3 people ordering, that shouldn't be a problem. Everything that everyone else says is true. You will not regret this. My highlight last time: white wine rabbit sausage with caprese peppers and goat cheese.
