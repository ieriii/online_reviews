After a late night meeting, we decided to go to Pequod's recently due to good recommendations. I recall maybe going to this place years ago but I can't remember. Maybe it was another pizza place nearby. We ordered bruscetta for our appetizer, which was very good. The perfect portions for the two of us. We ordered a sausage/mushroom pizza which was a great pizza, among one of my favorites around Chicago. Wash it down with a cold beer and that makes me happy.
