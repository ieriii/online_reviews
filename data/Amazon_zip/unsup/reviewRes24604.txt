This place is amazing but it sends me into a food coma. You get so much food and it all tastes fantastic that it's hard to stop eating. The steak casado is excellent. I can't remember ever raving about cabbage so much but god, it's like heaven and when mixed with the mountain of fried onions and egg on my plate it's even better. There is so much steak it seems insane to try and finish it all and it goes so well with the fried plantains. After eating here I can't even think about food for about 24 hours. I love that this place is BYOB and the service is very laid back and friendly. I am dying to try the shakes but really, there is just no way I can eat a meal here and also have a shake. That is crazy talk.
