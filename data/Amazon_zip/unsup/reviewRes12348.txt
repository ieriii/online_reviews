Went here today (early Sunday brunch) after a race with a bunch of running buddies as a celebration for a recent birthday (not mine). Oh. My. GOD. Where has this place been all of my eating career? Everything on the menu looked delicious. Presentation was amazing, and it didn't disappoint! I got something with asparagus, ham, and poached eggs, and hollandaise on the side--YUMMMMMMMM! I did get a couple of sips of my friend's mimosa, and thought it was good enough that I would order my own next time. What else...excellent location right by the Irving Park El, cute atmosphere with simple but classy decor. Waitstaff was very personable and helpful. They took care of the birthday cake we brought in, with a $1 plating fee. It was probably on the pricier side for brunch, but man was it worth it! We're going back as soon as possible
