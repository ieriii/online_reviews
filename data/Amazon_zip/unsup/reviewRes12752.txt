A nice decor doesn't make up for hostile service and very disappointing food (possibly FOOD POISONING). I knew something was up when the hostess wouldn't tell us how long of a wait we'd have until the 5th of our party of 5 walked in the door. Unfortunately, the sour taste left in my mouth by our unnecessarily aggressive hostess was just a first course to an awful meal. My friends ordered a vegetarian comal, which is a fancy way of saying "flavorless sauteed veggies with tortillas." I had the flank steak which was unimaginatively sauced with a simple guajillo puree, and I'm fairly certain I got FOOD POISONING from the ceviche. To top it all off, our waitress couldn't care less about us, and frequently forgot to bring things we had ordered (food, drinks, etc.) AVOID!!
