Went here with friends a few weeks ago for dinner on a Saturday night. They did not take reservations, which was not great. I arrived a little early to get on the list and when my friends arrived we were seated right away, so that was nice. The valet was free and was pretty quick, which is awesome. The place was extremely crowded and the seating was cramped. We could barely get our chair out to sit down without hitting the people behind us. The service was ok. The waiter was pretty nice (when he was around). The strange thing about this place is that they really seem like they want you to eat and leave immediately. It felt like I was being rushed constantly. I also witnessed some of the employees being quite rude to people when I was waiting to be seated. I was turned off by that. The food is where this place falls apart. I love lamb and decided that since I was eating in Greek Town, I'd definitely be ordering lamb. I did and it was terrible. Some of the worst lamb I've ever had. It was quite fatty and cold when brought to the table. The best part of my dinner entree was the rice (pathetic). All four of us ordered dessert as well. None of them were any good. While the free valet was a plus, I don't think I'll be back. I can get better lamb in a million other places and the crowded atmosphere and rude employees didn't make me want to return.
