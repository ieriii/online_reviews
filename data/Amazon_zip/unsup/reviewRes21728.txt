First thing's first- Superdawg is overrated. Having said that, Superdawg is indeed very good. I really enjoy a hot dog from there, or a shake on a warm summer day. A very unique place that has been around for a long, long time, and has held a strong fan base for just as long.  The best part of this place is the method by which they operate. Very old-school. The owners are stubborn, thank God. Who needs just another hot dog place? They have capitalized on being one of the very few places left that serves food to your car. You can order your food from a call window and then they arrive with the order and place the tray on your window. Pretty cool! And, you cannot forget the anthropomorphic hot dogs atop the roof, calling out to drivers on Milwaukee, Nagle, and Devon, to stop by and eat a hot dog. I give this place three stars because I'm sick of everyone calling Superdawg "the best hot dog in the city". It has been on TV and in documentaries because of the way they operate, but I think better hot dogs can be found elsewhere. Still, a timeless classic in the age of drive-thrus and modern amenities.
