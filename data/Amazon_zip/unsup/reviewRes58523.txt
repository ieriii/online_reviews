We first went to Mastos for a business dinner, we sat at the Bar. Ryan was our server, she introduced herself, and made us feel welcome. We were unsure on cocktails and appetizers, Ryan made wonderful suggestions and made the evening a great success ! On the next trip into Chicago, we again visitied Mastro's. We again sat in the Bar area, this time at one of the tables, our server was Leigh, she like Ryan, introduced herself. Leigh helped us with our selections for drinks and dinner, once more a very enjoyable evening. Great food, excellant service!
