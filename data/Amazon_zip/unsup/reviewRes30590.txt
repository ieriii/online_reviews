The location is great parking on the street. Inside, it is the size of a typical cafe. I like the fact that the kitchen is open where you can see the employees working and getting out customers' orders out quickly. I ordered the garden omelet, a pancake and poblano and cheese grits. Everything was very tasty and the service was on point. This why I love local small restaurants because you get a more personalized/down to earth experience. I will definitely take my Dad here one day, because he refuses to go to chain/franchise restaurants. This is right up his alley!
