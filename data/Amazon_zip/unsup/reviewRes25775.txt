This pizza just oozes and oozes cheese, which is great! Even better is the burnt, crispy cheese bits around the edges of the crust. Speaking of the crust - it was buttery, thick without being too thick, delicious! I was able to get a piece of every ingredient (ground beef, mushrooms & spinach). I was stuffed after 2 slices (without eating the side crust). Simply yummy.
