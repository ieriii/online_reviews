I live right by here and am so glad to have a simple and enjoyable neighborhood joint to add to my dining-out rotation now. The restaurant space is spacious, warm and inviting, if a little dated. The waitstaff is good, always friendly and informative. And the food is definitely serviceable. It's not phenomenal but it's always two notches above decent. 3rd coast isn't trying to serve the best mindblowing food ever; it's just trying to serve good food that you can take a moment or two to enjoy. But I do declare that their chopped cobb salad is the best. :p
