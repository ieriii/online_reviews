Outdoor patio was nice but not a run away "10" in Chicago. View back towards the buidling was kind of an eyesore and every ambulance/fire truck that went by let you know the little dream was indeed little. My penne sausauge special looked and tasted bland. My wife's black spaghetti was much better and loaded with shrimp for the same price.  Waitstaff being mostly native Italian guys added to charm of the place. Bottom Line - check out at lunch for $30 - $50 a couple w/free valet parking before investing on a full blown dinner and long wait.
