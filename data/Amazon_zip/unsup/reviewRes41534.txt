The pho is not that great. I went on a sunday afternoon and i felt like the broth was watered down. The noodles were overcooked. The grilled pork chop rice dish is an excellent choice for people not desiring Pho. Great menu selection - this is a good place to take people who are new to vietnamese cuisine.  Very hard to find a table if you go during rush hours. Its always packed on the weekend.
