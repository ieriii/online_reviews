If I'd only eaten here for brunch, The Gage would have gotten three stars. Luckily, my companion and I stopped there for a few beers and appetizers the night before, so I know I'll be back. Everyone sings the praises of the scotch egg. It was delicious! Amazing! A feat of awesomeness. (However the scotch egg we split for breakfast was about half the size of the one we had for dinner. Weird.) The pickles and olives were also awesome--lots of pickle, not enough olives, but my friend actually liked the olives I shared with him (he swears he hates olives. Well no more!). The smoked salmon appetizer was really good as well.  On to brunch. After splitting a disappointingly small scotch egg, I dove in to my bloody mary (good, but not the best I've had) and he into his latte (he couldn't stop talking about how good the coffee was). Then he saw the chips with curry gravy, so that was ordered. It was good, but we were both expecting a yellow curry gravy, not the red one we ended up with. A little spicier than we'd anticipated, but we managed to finish the entire order. For breakfast he ordered the roasted corn soup and beet salad--both delicious. I got the irish breakfast and to be honest, I was disapopinted. The sausage links were that really fine ground consistency I can't stand in a sausage link. The white and red puddings were bland (the red was really dry), the bread was dry, the beans were just ok. However, the eggs were perfectly over easy, and the rashers were salty deliciousness.  In all, it's a wonderful place, and I highly recommend it. However, I'd say that if you have the option, get the lunch/dinner foods from The Gage, and forget about the brunch options.
