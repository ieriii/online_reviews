I had been to Graham Elliot a few times over the past couple of years, and I always had a great experience. The food was great, and unique, and the servers were friendly/knowledgeable. After going this past weekend, however, I don't think I'll ever be back again. Graham Elliot apparently has a new chef, and I am not a fan to say the least. The food was, while still expensive, bland and uninspiring. The menu has shrunk considerably, and there are barely any a la carte items. The sense of joy and experimentation that the food previously had is completely gone. The service was apathetic bordering on rude and nobody seemed like they wanted to be there, employees or diners. I know I didn't.
