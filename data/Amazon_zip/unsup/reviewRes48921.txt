I'd definitely recommend the Publican. The service was really great and the food was delicious. Unfortunately I waited too long to write this so I don't exactly remember what we had....the pork dish with pork done several ways that was my favorite. The chicken that was highly recommended by in some article I read (Time Out Chicago maybe?) was not very special. I'm not much of a beer drinker and their extensive list overwhelmed me, so I went with wine. I love the location because it's easy walking distance to places like Fulton Lounge for after dinner drinks, not to mention my apartment. Also the night we were there they had all the doors open so the atmosphere was really nice.
