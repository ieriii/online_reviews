I guess this place holds a special place in my heart since I've been coming here since I was a kid and have had some really great times here. During my younger years I used to get the lasagna (and since they knew who my family was they would really hook it up). At that point they didn't offer complementary pizza bread, which is something I definitely look forward to these days. I really like getting the delicious Rich's special now which is a combination of filet mignon, breaded shrimp and veal for 19.99... now thats a good meal. WIth all the entrees you also get a soup and salad. I always make sure I get the cozy little side booths when I'm with a lady for a nice evening out. To me I'll always come here,even though they've been cited for things in the not to distant past. I know plenty of people that frequent this place and believe you should at least give it a try.
