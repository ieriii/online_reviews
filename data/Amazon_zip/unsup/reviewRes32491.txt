This was my first taste of Ethiopian dining, and I absolutely LOVED it. We went as part of a large group (10 people) and everyone left extremely happy. The restaurant itself is fairly spacious and quiet. On the weekends they have live music, which - at first - I thought was being piped over the speakers. It was a great touch to the experience. We ordered 4 veggie and 4 meat dishes and also shared 4 bottles of wine. When splitting everything amongst a large group, the bill was surprisingly low. For the great price, atmosphere, and amazing food, I would definitely go back.
