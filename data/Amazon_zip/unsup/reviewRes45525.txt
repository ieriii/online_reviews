atmosphere: 4 spacious, comfortable, cute. if i come back i will be sure to sit in the library. food: 4 the mac & cheese was wonderful. ham, tomatoes, chunks of garlic and other seasonings. not the best i've ever had (t's and charlie's are better), but definitely up there. how else can i explain that i cleaned my plate even though i wasn't at all hungry? my girlfriend had the mussels, which were the tiniest things i've ever seen. drinks: 2 the mixed drinks were horrible. they have a great beer selection, but i wasn't in the mood for beer. so between my friends & me i was able to try a couple of the martinis and champagne drink. blech. they were just not good. so i followed that up with a vodka & lemonade and then a vodka & red bull. both tasted weak and the red bull was flat. best to stick with beer. service: 3 our server always seemed in a hurry to walk away from the table. i went a long time in between drinks.
