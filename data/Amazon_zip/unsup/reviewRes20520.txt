We got a "snack" at here during our 1 1/2 hour wait at Frontera Grill (next door). If Bayless' celebrated mole hadn't looked so damned good on Top Chef Masters, I would've skipped Frontera all together and gotten my fill at XOCO. XOCO is a very casual restaurant. You stand in line to order your food, and there are a few small tables inside and outside available for seating. The menu is primarily composed of tortas (sandwiches) and caldos (hearty soups). I ordered the Ahogada since the cashier told us it was one of their specialties, and it was a cross between a torta and a caldo (a carnita sandwich in a bowl of super spicy tomato broth)... The Ahogada was a fiery explosion of flavor in my mouth! I enjoyed the contrast of the crunchy bread with the spicy tomato broth, creamy black beans, and tart pickled onions...like a French dip sandwich, but with a spicy personality. The carnitas was tender and delicious, but it was difficult to distinguish its flavor amidst the intensely hot chile sauce. After eating at both XOCO and Frontera, my recommendation would be to skip the looooong wait at Frontera and eat at XOCO instead. both restaurants deliver lots of bold, in-your-face flavors and spices in a wide variety of Mexican dishes.
