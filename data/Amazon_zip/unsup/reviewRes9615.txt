Had a lovely dinner on a breezy, warm Tuesday night sans a reservation. We were the first to be seated for dinner, which meant we got the best table in the outdoor seating. We began with the chao tom (ground shrimp wrapped in sugarcane with rice noodles and lettuce wrap). It was delicious and fresh. The chicken with mango, sweet potato, and string beans in curry sauce for entree was really yummy. Sure, being Asian and all, Le Colonial is perhaps a bit spendy for Asian food - albeit French fusion - and I probably wouldn't frequent it for dinner. But I must say the food was delicious, and the service was unmatched. We finished off the meal with the delicious Vietnamese coffee (filtered coffee with condensed milk). It was a perfect meal, and I'm glad our spontaneity took us there on this night. I definitely will return for the coffee and desserts - and the ambiance!
