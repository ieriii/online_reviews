Third coast is fantastic! I have been hesitant to write a review for fear that it will become something different! So nice to live in a touristy neighborhood and have a locals restaurant right down the street. Excited for the Chinese chicken soup to be back now that it is fall:) On my own or with my husband what a GREAT find!
