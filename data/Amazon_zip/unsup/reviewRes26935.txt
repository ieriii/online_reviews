The first thing that caught my attention about this place besides the great paint job outside was the outfit my waitress was wearing. Bright blue skirt and big puffy top. I just want to say that women in Mexico are not walking around in these outfits. LOL. The atmosphere inside was pretty nice. I ordered the enchiladas in mole and yea. Presentation was terrible. The cheese and mole were cold. Honestly I could have had better enchiladas at home. They were simply lacking flavor. My beans were salty and dry. They looked kinda scary. Just a big pile of dried, dead, cold beans. The rice however was pretty good. Had a little spicy flavor to them. Horchata was ok. I've had better. It wasnt an expensive dinner but I will not be returning. Ahh!!! Also they don't take credit or checks...just cash. Boo.
