You'll have to understand that I'm ranking this place on my experiences on lunch alone. The reason I say that is because I've gone to lunch here a number of times, and have come back to work ready to pass out from all the food I just had. $20 lunch special at Brazzaz has to be the greatest thing ever invented. I heard that there are a few differences between the lunch/dinner line-up of meat, but I'm quite content dishing out twenty bucks for what I got. Not only do you get the unlimited meat, but you get unlimited garlic mashed potatoes, and cheesy bread. Oh, they have an unlimited salad bar there too? Couldn't tell ya...I've never even considered seeing it. I think the goucho guy who always says "Try the (whatever steak/pork/chicken he's carrying that particular day), it's my favorite," is hilarious. I'd have to say that I agree with him. Everything's my favorite!
