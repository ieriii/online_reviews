Really lovely decor and lovely staff. Our waitress was absolutely charming and very knowledgeable. She had great suggestions on their rather large menu. The restaurant is definitely a big tourist spot being how it overlooks Michigan Ave. and a lot of shops. So if you can get past that, you'll be in good shape. The food was really delicious and the portions are generous. The seared rare ahi tuna salad is really yummy as well as the shaking beef and chicken parm. The deserts, which some are baked to order, are to die for. If you want desert, try one of these. You really can't go wrong.
