Bring your friends here and get the duck. You get duck roll-ups, duck soup, and duck noodles. All of it is fantastic. Service... not so much. We pre-ordered our ducks, but we still had to wait almost an hour from when we sat down. The decor is like a fancied-up Chinatown restaurant. There is an awesome barbecue pit in the window as you walk in.
