Alinea is an interesting restaurant experience. The creativity and innovation are probably unmatched in the U.S, so it's worth checking out. But I can't say that it was the greatest meal that I've ever had. You have to have a good idea of what you're signing up for. First, the portion sizes are quite small, so you wonder if you'll be full by the end of the meal. I will temper this first critique a bit, since it is a twenty course meal and they don't want people to feel uncomfortable. Next, I thought that a lot of the dishes were quite complex and had too many ingredients battling for center stage, which dilutes the impact of those certain flavors that may not need to share the spotlight. Additionally, the "hands on" experience of some of the dishes may generate "oohs" and "aahhs" from some diners, but can just as easily be viewed as smug and contrived by others. Lastly, I found the service to be just average; many of our servers were twenty-something males that exuded a vibe that was a bit frat-boy/haughty/irreverent as opposed to my expectation of a more gracious/respectful experience. What really got to me was that after we left an 18% tip on the pre-tax bill - which I thought was more than sufficient given the $195 prix fixe - one of the servers voiced his displeasure about the gratuity to his colleague, who gave him a compassionate "That sucks", all while we were still within earshot. Not cool. In sum, Chef Achatz's mastery of the food arts is worth experiencing, and Alinea's reputation as a culinary Mecca for food enthusiasts is well-deserved. But if you're looking for a simple, well-executed, hunger-satisfying meal, then you may want to consider other options.
