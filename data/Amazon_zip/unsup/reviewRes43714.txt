We are new to the hood and were recommended Milk & Honey for the huevos rancheros and the other good food. The place is really cute for sure and I hear that the food is pretty good too. That being said, it's not super lactose intolerant friendly which was a bummer. They couldn't make eggs without milk and there were only a couple of things on the menu that I could eat. I thought I'd be good after seeing vegan treats in the display case earlier that week. Bring your lactaid.
