When I visit Chicago, this is my favorite Sunday brunch spot. My friend loves the Eggs Benedict so much she will order nothing other than that. I've tried several things on the Brunch menu, but the Crab and Asparagus Omelette is a "must-try", yum! We also love the champagne cocktails, very flavorful and different. My steady order on the drink menu is the Blood Orange Mimosa, to die for... my Eggs-Benedict-loving friend won't miss the Pomegranate Champagne Cocktail. But I don't think you could go wrong with any of their recipes. Try it, you'll like it!!!  :-)
