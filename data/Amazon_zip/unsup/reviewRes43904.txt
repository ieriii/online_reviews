TERRIBLE service. For the amount of traffic this place gets during breakfast and lunchtime, they should really rethink the ordering sequence. Also, ordered a beer, and couldn't even have it until I waited 15 minutes for a table. Very disorganized and staff is somewhat unfriendly. On the upside, all of the sandwiches sound good, unfortunately didn't taste as good as I had hoped. Best pickles I've ever had in my life--seriously.
