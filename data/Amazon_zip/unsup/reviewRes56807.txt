I have never been more disappointed then my evening last night at Spacca Napoli. We've heard so many great reviews about this pizza restaurant that we finally got a chance to try it. The pizza was the worst pizza I've ever had....under cooked crust, salty and not worth the price. I've lived in Italy, tried other new pizza places in Chicago and never complain about anything - this was worth writing a review about. To make matters worse, we had to wait in line for 30 minutes and got sat at a table that was near a messy floor (never cleaned from the kids who dumped water all over the floor). I would not recommend this place!
