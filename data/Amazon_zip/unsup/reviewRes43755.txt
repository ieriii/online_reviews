If I were to open a coffee/breakfast shop, it'd look something like this place. The food is fresh, the decor clean and simple, and the staff were friendly. Came here with my brother and we had an ample sunday morning...sunday paper and french toast...how can you go wrong?? There were a lot of babies and some stroller hurdling was required, but once you're settled you won't want to leave.
