We had a wonderful night outside on the patio. Food was interesting, amazing bourbon and beer list. I thought the presentation was just a wee bit affected (reminded me of the episode from Porltandia when the couple goes to visit the farm where the chicken they're about to eat was raised). Other than that, full speed ahead.
