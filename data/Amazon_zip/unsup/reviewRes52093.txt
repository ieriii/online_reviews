We tried this place as part of the duty to eating a real deep dish pizza. Don't get me wrong, it was good but it was overwhelming. I come from the land of gourmet thing pizzas so anything that rich and meaty is a bit intense for my palette.  We sat at the bar because there was a wait for regular tables. The bartender was very attentive and guided us through the menu. He was upfront with the 40 minute time to get the pizza, which was cool to know. Our hotel was right next to it, so I did see the lines mentioned in other reviews.
