I have been to almost every Mexican restaurant in Chicago(Funny since I live here) and all I could say is Wow. This is authentic as it gets....take it from me I am a Mexi-can. enough said. I def recommend the Tampiquena if you are a meat eater....and the Shrimp Fajitas if you like sea food... the Chicken soup does not get more authentic and the flautas are plain delicious....but my favorite has to be their home made flour tortillas...and I hate flour tortillas otherwise.....
