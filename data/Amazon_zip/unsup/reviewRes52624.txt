We've only been to Brazzaz for the half price lunch however, we were impressed! The service and atmosphere were great. I am not a red meateater and found much of the salad bar to my liking as well as the bacon wrapped chicken, pork roast, leg of lamb and the oh so tasty sides! Well worth the lunch price. Remember that kids 10 and under eat for half the price for lunch or dinner!!
