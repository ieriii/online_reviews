There are too many great restaurants in Chicago to go back here. The food was very mediocre. It's hard to go wrong with caprese salad, but their tomatoes were cooked and small. We had a side of broccoli that was totally limp & tasteless. Both of our dishes were bland (risotto and fish). Yes, the decor is very cute and the outdoor patio is fabulous, but the food has to come first. The service personnel also hovered, which is annoying.
