Went back for a second time with much better company - a lovely lady friend - and had an even better experience than the first time around! This time I started with a brandy drink, the Valley Forge - absolutely delicious. My friend had the Dark and Stormy, upon my recommendation and the fact that she lives for this cocktail, and she said it was the best she'd ever had. We ordered some food this time - crostini with red squash spread and grilled baby octopus and the onion soup (soup of the day) with grilled cheese and both were fantastic - as if this place needed to give me another reason to come here! For our second round, I made an even BETTER choice and had the Perennial, a gin drink with apple and sherry - absolutely scrumptious. My friend had the gilded cage, our most daring venture of the evening since it included egg white (we were both a little worried) and it was great! Huge bonus: the waiter spilled a bit of my friend's first drink so he brought us two complimentary glasses of a lovely sparkling rose'. Doesn't get any better than this folks - I don't think you can go wrong here.
