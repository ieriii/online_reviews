I have been to Tank Noodle twice, and both times the food was very simple and delicious, with bright flavors and not too much grease. I've ordered extensively within the menu (having gone there with a large group of friends and tasted their dishes), and I would say that this is a great place to bring a date, some friends, or your parents. It's more homey than it is classy, but it's fairly inexpensive and has so many items to offer. Quite good.
