The best oysters EVAH.  The most sour-puss waiter ever. He was just too cool for school- please remember you are in the SERVICE industry not " I work in the hipster- scene therefore-I-can have a crap demeanor while YOU pay for me to serve you and give me a nice tip because Paul Kahan is cool"- that is not how we roll in Chi. Just ask Grant Achatz. Happy Eating! "Primetime"
