I was expecting another overpriced and overhyped restaurant.....and I was wrong. Went here tonight with my dinner club. We had a 5:30 reservation. I got their early, sat at the bar and had the Sunda Solstice. Really well made drink, but I struggle with the $13 price tag. The drinks are overpriced, that is my negative on this place. We ordered 4 different apps - Pig Sticks, Steamed Pork Buns, Duck Hash and Oxtail Potstickers.  All were really, really great. The duck hash was amazingly flavorful and I could have made a meal of the potstickers. The adobo rice and 7 spiced chicken were great. I had the pancit canton, which was delicious, and I had to take 1/2 home - large portion.  Someone in our group ordered the sushi and the seafood toban.  Everyone in the party enjoyed their food and agreed that this is a place we'd go back to.  Without drinks, you'd be paying $40ish for the food, but it is worth it.  I don't think the place is overhyped and the food is worth the money.  Atmosphere/Ambiance is nice, but not all that people rave about. It was just average to me. The place is quite loud.
