One thing I noted the last time I visited Chicago: you end up waiting for a long time for a lot of things in this tourist town, especially the traps like Gino's East. Which isn't meant to take anything away from this restaurant; it is popular for a reason. And that reason is pretty damn good deep dish pizza. The good thing about the wait is they go pretty fast, because the employees go outside and look for group sizes that fit whatever table they have open. For a table of three on a warm Saturday afternoon in April, that wait was about 20-30 minutes. Once seated, the additional wait time for the pizza itself was an additional 40 minutes. That's because they make it to order, which I appreciate. To stave off our hunger for those 40 minutes, my friend ordered a caesar salad, which was actually quite yummy and shareable. I ordered the deep dish with the classic crumbled sausage, and my friends got the spinach and mushroom combo (customized). The pizza was definitely steaming hot when it arrived at our table, and the experience was pure deliciousness. The crust tasted different from other deep dish pizzas I've had: it had more of a crumbly, almost cornbread texture and taste to it, which I appreciated. It actually made for a really good leftover pizza the next day, and you can almost make the crust into a side dish of its own with some butter slathered on it. nom nom. The waiter was accommodating, but not really attentive. He did turn up the A/C temp when we asked, which was nice, but it took him a while to get our order and our water. Overall, though, a good experience of Chicago deep dish.
