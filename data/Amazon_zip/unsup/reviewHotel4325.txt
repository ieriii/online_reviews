Three dollar signs is right! Historic building right smack in downtown Chicago? Yup, you get what you pay for. Swaaaaaaaan-ky! Luckily the university program I was with helped with costs, and even then, G-W-0-W! But all that aside, if you decide to treat yourself, definitely do Palmer House. Millenium Park, Chicago Institue of Art, Michigan Avenue, metro stops, & yummy eateries are ALL within walking distance. The hotel rooms are nice and cozy, the light up mirror in the bathroom help you see every pore on your face --perfect for tweezing eyebrows & perfecting your make-up, the bath towels are super soft, the hallways are covered with old photographs, the lobby is beautifully & elegantly decorated and the staff are super helpful.
