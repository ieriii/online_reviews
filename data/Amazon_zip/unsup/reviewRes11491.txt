One of my top three favorite pizza places in the U.S. after Two Amy's in Washington, DC (there is no better pizza anywhere) and Pi in Kirkwood, MO. Piece gets crowded with college kids and the Bucktown grunge patrol, but if you get there by 6:30 the wait for a table is generally less than 20-25 mins. Bouncer at the door cards everybody, even if you're geriatric. If you can nab a spot at the bar while you're waiting for a table, it's a good place to grab one of the house brewed beers, but don't order pizza at the bar. The bartender girls are incredibly unfriendly and angry. The waiters who handle tables are far friendlier. The menu has weird stuff for a pizza place, like guacamole and tortilla chips. Otherwise, there are a few stray salads--all good--and a dozen pizzas. Crust is unbelievably good, on the thin side.
