The food is delicious and reasonably priced for the quality and location. The daily special tortas are my favorite on the menu, especially the smoky garlic shrimp and the goat barbacoa. The churros are also delicious, especially when dipped into a mug of their (excellent) hot chocolate. The guacamole isn't bad either. The only thing that keeps this from a 5-star rating is the crowd and the wait - if you come in here at any point during regular dining hours, there will be an incredibly long line and if you come as part of a small group it is very likely that you will have to sit with strangers in the (loud) seating area.
