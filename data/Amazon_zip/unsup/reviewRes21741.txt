When I crave really good mexican, this is where I go. My boyfriend loves this place too and he's hispanic. The restaurant is tiny but we've always made reservations even though there has never been a wait. Cute small outdoor deck in the back. Guacamole was super fresh, portions are huge, margaritas are strong. Their skirt steak is delicious, soo tender and juicy. Prices are so reasonable and you'll always end up having leftovers. Another great yelp recommendation!
