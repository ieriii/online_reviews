My brother just moved into this neighborhood and says to me, I know you like Cuban food, you need to check this place out. The place is a lot bigger than you would think. There is a 4 season seating area, a few tables actually inside, and there is a nice outdoor seating area right at the corner of two streets.  We had empanada's (goat cheese is the best, although the beef was good too). They were perfect. Not over fried or too much breading, perfect. The calamari was incredible. The chicken tomale was great, although they spread a TON of minced garlic on top, that's a little over the top. The ropa vieja was a perfect mixture of pork and onions and peppers.  The best way to end this meal was a Cuban espresso......and for less than a dollar, you can get one! Perfectly sweet. This is a hidden gem in the city. If you like Cuban food, this is your place. If you're taking a date there, and expect to have a nice wine with dinner, you'd better stop at the store before you get there. It's BYOB.
