We visited the Allerton while searching for our wedding venue. The penthouse floor was really nice, but something that they go out of their way to keep from you until you visit is that the beautiful reception (could also be ceremony) area has a pretty low ceiling in the center of the room. It's pretty on either end, but it isn't large enough to dip down that much in the center without it being pretty noticeable. The whole floor is yours, though, and there was something about that floor that would have made it feel like you had the whole building to yourself. They were doing some renovation downtstairs when we visited, so the entrance and elevators were a bit awkward. Valet lot is across the street and took forever. Overall, it seemed to have its charm. It was different than most of typical upscale hotels and wasn't insanely priced for rental (compared to other options downtown, at least).
