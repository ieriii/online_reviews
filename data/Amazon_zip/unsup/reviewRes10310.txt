I LOVE Piccolo Sogno. I visited with 3 friends and had an unbelievable meal. I'm so sad that I lost the slip of paper that the server gave me with the Primitivo name on it. It is seriously my new dream wine, I can't stop thinking about it. Our service was excellent, the meal impecable and even though we sat inside (yes I know it's the best patio in the city) the ambiance was just what we were looking for. Definitely check out Piccolo for authentic, delicious, craft Italian fare and amazing wine. I recommend the whole fish special. I love how they brought it out for my inspection before deboning it for me. They didn't even do that in Italy.
