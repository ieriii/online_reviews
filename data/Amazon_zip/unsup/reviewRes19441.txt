OK, so the place has nearly a thousand reviews on Yelp and I finally am getting around to reviewing it. I'm a little behind the curve here. I went mid afternoon on a weekday but it didn't help too much. All the tables were filled and there was a line, although it didn't go out the door. I had tastes of a number of sandwiches. The pork carnitas had some zip to it but I could have used a little more meat. The mushroom torta, however, blew me away. I thought the Cuban was good but essentially meh - I think I can get a similar sandwich all over the north side for about a third less. And that's my only gripe - each sandwich is about a buck or two higher than you'd expect. I consider that the Rick Bayless tax. But throw in the locally sourced ingredients and the wood burning oven its worth the premium. I'll be back. My next trip here will be to check out the breakfast menu.
