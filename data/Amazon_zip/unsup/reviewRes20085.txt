I've been here twice now, once for drinks and appetizers after hitting the museum, and more recently for brunch. Bottomline: Surprised, in a good way. I have been passing this place, writing it off as another mag mile tourist hole. While the crowd is expectedly a mix of locals, tourists, and the hotel business circuit it held its own personality (read: not Bennigans). The beer and cocktail menu is great. One of the managers (owners) stopped by and chatted briefly without shilling his own place and commented that they try to keep the draft list interesting with lots of small or local infusion to the mix. Specifically for brunch, I was shocked to get a reservation on a Sunday morning, given how crowded it was in the afternoon last I had been there. It was pretty empty at 10:30ish, but slowly added people towards noon. So, little worries on getting a seat if you're running into long waits at Yolk a bit further South on Michigan. I had the Buckwheat Waffles + Ricotta Cheese. Oh, and a side of Irish Bacon. Simple, very good, but quite cheesy. Large portion for what you're paying. Had a Bloody Caesar which was not so great. I've been hooked on these for a long time, and while the Gage gets bonus points for bumping up the horseradish, the overall drink was thin and watery. Too much lime juice, too little tomato. Another place that makes my new 'safe' list for when you need something consistently good without blowing the doors off the hinges.
