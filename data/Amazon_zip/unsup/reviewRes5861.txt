This review is for their banquet-style lunch menu, since I couldn't find many of those on here before coming in. For ~$25 a person, this is the menu we ended up with: spinach & artichoke fondue, house salad bowl, cedar planked salmon, basil hayden's bourbon tenderloin tips, redskin mashed potatoes, wild rice, triple layer chocolate cake, and classic cheesecake with mixed berries. With a bonus wrapped cinnamon sugar cookie as a parting gift. Now I don't know about you, but that sounds like an amazing deal! Not only did all of us walk out extremely full, but we were allowed to order seconds of any of the plates that came out. The food was served in a family-style manner (one giant plate of entrees and we each took a piece), but we ended up getting more of the delicious tenderloin tips. The fondue was scrumptious as well, as the flavor of the dip complemented the texture of the bread perfectly. The salmon was cooked to perfection, as the fish crumbled with the touch of our utensils...definitely a fan. I would love to go back and eat at this restaurant, and I'm sure that's why our school has traditionally held a banquet there every year.
