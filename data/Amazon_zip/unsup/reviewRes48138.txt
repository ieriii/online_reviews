First time here I went with 3 girlfriends for Brunch. The place is rustic and comfortable tucked onto a crossroad in the meat-packing district, and they do their meat well! We ordered Bloody Mary's with a 3 Floyds chaser and they were delicious and spicy! Usually I have 2 drinks at brunch (lush I know), but I had the one and was more than feeling good.  I ordered the quiche and it was perfect, I am glad I got the side of bacon though since I would have been wanting more with just the entree. The bacon was the best thing I ate too! Its thick sliced and sugar glazed...it melts in your mouth with just the right amount of crispy fat on the end. Yum! The eggs poached in red wine were very good as well.  I highly recommend asking for a booth if you have a party of 4. The seating is very communal otherwise, which isn't a bad thing, but the booths were so fun. They have swinging doors on them and made it nice and cozy for us. You feel tucked away in the booth and private, but you are still open to the whole energy of the room. Definitely want to go back and try a hearty dinner her with the boyfriend.
