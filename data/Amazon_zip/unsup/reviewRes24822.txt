Justin- wasn't a fan at all. Treated us like idiots. Didn't he know we were from the best foodie city in the country? When presented with a desert menu that contained "olive oil cake" I said, "what's that like?" He said "there's olive oil in it." When we asked about the olive oil on the sorbet and chocolate croquetts, he said "there's olive oil on it." When asked what our neighboring table had, he said "third row down the menu." We no longer had menus. Whatever. The food was amazing but Justin needs a revamp.
