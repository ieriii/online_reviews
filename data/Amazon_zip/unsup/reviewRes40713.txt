Wow with practically 3 pasaditas in a row which is the one to choose from? We parked closest to this one so it won. At first I was a bit nervous, you are greeted with somewhat of a sewer scent when you walk in.  It doesn't take long to get past that. The chips weren't anything to write home about but the free salsas definitely were. We really enjoyed the smokey habenero flavored one. As for our entrees, him steak tacos and milanesa torta for myself. Lately I've been on the torta kick and this one did the job. It was stuffed to the gills with cheese and avocado spread. My horchata was excellent also, very milky, some horchatas have a very powdery taste, not here. All in all our dinner came to $10, which was the minimum for their credit card purchase, excellent. La Pasadita's circuses might not woo James Ward but I think the food simply speaks for itself.
