I have experienced WAY better. I agree with the reviews that the food is ok and that prices are a bit high, but sometimes Mexican food is a treat. What I didn't appreciate, however, is how awful the wait staff was - and we weren't even being cheap! Joe and I ordered drinks (horchata and soda), an appetizer of expensive guacamole, and entrees - and we were going to order dessert, but the waitress never came back to our table. We saw our waitress twice. The first time she came to our table, all she said was "are you ready to order." So me and my passive aggressive self said, "I'd like an horchata to drink and we'll start with an order of guacamole" After another server brought us our stuff, the original came back and asked us again if we were ready to order. So, we ordered. Then, we did not see her again until our food came out 15 minutes later. All this time, Joe's water glass was empty, as was his soda glass. I nrse my horchatas because I don't get free refills and if I drink too much/fast, I'll have to pee a lot. Anywho, still empty water glasses... Still no waitress... We've been done with our food for a half hour now and still have empty plates in front of us... Still no waitress... We flag one down... ... ... ... ... We flag another one down.... We get fed up. We get up, walk to the cash register and tell them what we ordered. They give us a total and we ask to see the receipt. We pay with a credit card and leave a dollar tip. Not classy, I know, but it's one thing that you learn from friends who have waited tables - a dollar a table. Did I mention the restaurant was pretty empty on a Monday afternoon? thanks.
