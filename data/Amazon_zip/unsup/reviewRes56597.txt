I've been to Mastro's twice. The first time I had dinner in the bar area, which was nice, but noisy. So if you're looking for more of an intimate setting, definitely choose the dining room. The second time I was seated in the upstairs dining room, which is very dark and dimly lit. It is so dark that you can barely read the menu. Servers will provide you with light if needed. Surprisingly, there isn't much ambiance at all in the dining area. It reminded me of a banqet room with tables and chairs set up for an event. I was surprised by the lack of decor, but I came for the food. The steaks are excellent and cooked to perfection, sides dishes are great and they also have a great wine selection. My friend had the shrimp cocktail and said it was top notch! Service is also great. This is a great date place.I have been to most of the top steakhouses in Chicago and this is definitely in my top 5. I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but I do look forward to dining at Mastro's the next time I go to Vegas.
