We arrived for Easter brunch with friends ahead of the church crowd, so it's nice to know that agnosticism has its perks. The best thing we had were the beignets. My eggs were well cooked and the service was generally pleasant. But hubby's crab and asparagas omelet lacked seasoning and the bloody marys were really disappointing... garnished only with a sad celery stick. Bad form, grand lux.
