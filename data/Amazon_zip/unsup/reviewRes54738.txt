I went here w/ the BF for Vday Brunch. The food was so tasty. I ate at least 10 oysters, not mention 5 mimosas. Highlights: mini crab cakes, lobster bisque, banana foster French toast, oysters, cold shrimp, white peach mimosa. The service was great John David was our server and I will request to be seated in his section next time. Old school tradtional type of buffet brunch, hipsters need not apply.
