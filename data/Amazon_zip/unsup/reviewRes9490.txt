ok let's make this short and simple. The decor was fabulous tried during restaurant week so not a lot of variety menu wise.My best friend is Vietnamese, so we eat all that stuff for a lot less on Argyle.. hmm, what else? It was cute and tasty, perfect for a girls rendezvous but probably not worth the money to eat there often.
