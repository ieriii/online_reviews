As far as I am concerned, The Gage has the best burger in all of Chicago AND its only $10. Yes that is correct ten bucks and better than any other I have tasted. I can't explain it but it was perfect...simple, juicy, and large! The restaurant itself is a bit of a scene and loud but I like that, this is a place where you can go have way too many drinks and laugh obnoxiously loud without the tight arses shooting you nasty looks. It's filled with dark wood and leather which is what I would picture when I hear "The Gage"...not sure what means but I like lol.  Service was nothing short of amazing. Our server was the type of guy that you know is really cool with a million stories to tell...a young dos equis guy from the commercial haha. He had accent that I couldn't pinpoint and and tattoo of a women's name peeking out from his sleeve. He explained how the chef buys locally and talked about days special...it was some fish that I had never heard of (insert puzzled look) but he promptly explained what other fish it would be similar to. I split a starter with my girlfriend and without even telling the guy, he had the kitchen split the dish on two plates for us. Very small gesture but greatly appreciated...little touches like that make you love a place! Overall The Gage is a winner...if you don't like it you probably suck jk. If nothing else try the burger!
