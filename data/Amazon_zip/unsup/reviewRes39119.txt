Yeaaaaaaah. Wuddddup rudeness.  My friend and I were not even halfway through our meal...and the waitress basically threw the check at us and forced us to pay. Literally, we had half our meal left on our plates, but we had to leave....ASAP. W.T.F. Naturally, my friend and I started to sh*t talk pretty loudly about how they only did it to us because we are a non-Korean Asian kind. (Seriously, though, they didn't seem to bother any other tables!) The waitress probably heard us grumbling because she came over and told us that since it was dinner time, they have to turn the tables over fast. (Ummm, ok...what about the OTHER tables?) I mean, I get it - the service here has always sucked in the multiple years that I've been coming here. But...really? This was ridic. Just because this place is suddenly "hot", they somehow feel they can treat people like that? I'm sorry, but there are a ton of other Korean joints in this 'hood that I'll never have to come here again.
