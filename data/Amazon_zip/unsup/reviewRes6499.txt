Excellent steaks. My friend's favorite over any steak place in Chicago (and he is picky about his food). Try it "Blue" (rare), but it tastes like sushi and is top-notch. I got the medium rare bone-in filet mignon which was excellent, but I tried the rare porterhouse and it was yummy. The Starbucks mud pie dessert was excellent and came with hot fudge on the side. =) A great restaurant for families, friends, or dates!
