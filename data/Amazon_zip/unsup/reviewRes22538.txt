In Chicago for the weekend and I wanted to eat Hot Pot since it was 15 degrees outside.  Decided to try this place based on the reviews.  We decided on the all you can eat hotpot for $17. Bad decision. The hot pot items were brought to our table. The meat was NOT cut thinly. Service was not good in bringing us the items we ordered.  Also, certain items are NOT included in the all you can eat, such as the shrimp.  Also, you can't make your own dipping sauce. You only get garlic sauce, peanut sauce, and soy sauce.  I was very disappointed.
