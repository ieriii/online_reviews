Such long a long line, at any time of the day the place is open, is an indication of how great this place is. I've been here a couple of times, and you seriously cannot go wrong with any of the food options. We've tried the boar and rabbit, both were tasty. The fries complement the meal. I go for the cheese fries every time. The guy taking orders is the nicest guy. Everyone working there is top notch. Even though the wait is long, it surprisingly doesn't take very long for your order to come out once you place it. Definitely stop here if you're a Chicago visitor, and be sure not to miss it if you're from Chicago.
