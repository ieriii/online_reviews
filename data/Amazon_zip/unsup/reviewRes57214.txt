Came here last night and had the Aruchetta (pork chops). Fantastic. I love the decor of the place and everything was presented fantastically. Our server was very friendly and I loved the margarita I ordered. I was not a particular fan of the coconut mojito, but that could just be me.Overall, a great place. A bit pricey but you're getting quality food. Will be back!
