Meat, whiskey and beer. My favorite things. I brought my parents here while they were visiting, because the Publican is awesome...and I wanted a free meal. Let's be honest. We were 30 minutes late because of traffic, but I called ahead so they had our seats waiting for us. Awesome. We got the pork rinds, taste of three hams, grilled market greens, tomatoes, and lamb with curried yogurt/chickpeas. Obviously the menu changes often. But if they have the lamb when you're there...get it. It was super good and had a nice kick to it that's balanced by the yogurt sauce. The leftovers were still tasty the next day. The pork rinds were good and crunchy but left a mound (seriously) of cheese powder on my plate. Some were just lightly coated, while some were drowning in it. It got everywhere. Beeeeer. I liked taking my parents to places with good beer, because the selection differs from the east coast. Of course I had to drink whiskey, too. There are other places that have a larger selection, but the Publican's list is not overwhelming and still fucking awesome. They have George T. Stagg for $15. At 140something proof, this is not for the faint of heart, but it is unfiltered goodness. I would not suggest drinking it with an even slightly spicy dish (aka the lamb), because I made that painful mistake. Service was appropriately casual. The guy who cleared our table/gave us new plates was on top of his shit. Super fast and just like threw plates down on the table. Speaking of tables, the communal table was cool, but it also gives people an opportunity to talk to you. If that is something you don't like, well...pray you get a 2 top. The honey pepper ice cream was not light on the coarsely ground pepper. I don't even like dessert that much, but I ate all of it.
