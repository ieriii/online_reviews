We were sent here by a local and wow, do I need to send her a million and one thank you cards. Talk about some of the best pizza I've ever had in my entire life... Nom. One note: It's a PAN deep dish pizza. From what I know, pan pizzas typically have a buttery bread that rises a little more than your average dough. So if you're life my boyfriend and expecting to find an entire dairy section worth of cheese on the pizza and no dough, you're in the wrong spot. However, if you come wanting some EXCELLENT pizza that's still covered in mounds of cheese and toppings, welcome home, son. The large fed us for two days and we loved every last bite. It was hot, it was gooey, it was thick, it was crispy, it was cheesy, it was spicy, it was flavorful, it was downright orgasmic. I'm normally the dissenter when people want pizza because nowhere but Italy has yet to make a pizza I can truly love on a regular basis... so it's probably for the better that I don't live in Chicago where entire paychecks would go to grabbing pies from Pequod's. Whew.
