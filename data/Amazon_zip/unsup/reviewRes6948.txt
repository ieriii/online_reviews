Came here for Easter brunch with the family. Service was prompt and friendly. Decor inside was lovely -- love the staircase and multiple floors and wait staff in their urban chic/ country casual flannel shirts. Food was delicious - great BBQ, yummy bread and butter pickles and chips. We also order the hush puppies to pound in the calories -- but it was worth it. I had the brisket sandwich -- the portions were plenty and the sauces were wonderful.  For the value of a nice Sunday brunch -- terrific! They also had a cute easter bunny and egg hunting for the kids upstairs. I would definitely come back again! All round, great experience.
