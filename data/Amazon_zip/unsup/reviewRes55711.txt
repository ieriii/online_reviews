Yes, indeed as good as it gets. Sunday brunch at 10 am and this place is already packed. Apparently they open at 9 and get packed by 9:10...for a good reason!! We had the blue crab cake eggs Benedict on an english muffin. done to perfection!! Also, ordered the new orleans scramble. Burst of southern flavor - can't be better. All brunch dishes come with the potato patty - very delicious. Topped with some good bottomless coffee. Nothing like good food to get the day started !!
