First and last time here. So not impressed, despite the otherwise good reviews. Prices for drinks. Sorry, it maybe Michigan Avenue - but it's SOUTH Michigan Avenue - not Gold Coast. The cranberry mojito was decent, but a bit watery and very light on the rum. The seasonal sangria tasted watery (again). The food was not that impressive. I'll give them props for presentation. $6 for a small bowl of jar olives? Really?  The complimentary bruschetta was the most appetizing thing we had. The patatas bravas were inedible. Put it up to your mouth and they smell of burning newspaper. Unless you cut one in two and let it rest for a moment, it tastes like you've just eaten burning newspaper. Disgusting! The beef shortribs flatbread was okay. Just okay. I can tell the chef likes smoky things because the shortribs had an oddly similar smokiness that was far too similar to the patatas bravas - only the shortribs are edible. The garlic shrimp was a joke. Tiny, frozen from the bag shrimp in a garlic sauce that was neither original nor very present in the dish in which it was served. I echo the sentiments on the generally snooty service. Please, folks. You aren't waiting tables for celebrities at some of the finer establishments in the city. Stop acting like you do and just be friendly and pleasant. I could go to the Elephant & Castle and get better service at the bar. Lastly, listen to your guests when they order a drink. When I ordered a martini made WITH Lillet Blanc, I did not order a GLASS of Lillet Blanc - and nothing else. Sorry to sound like a hater, but this place was awful. Not worth a second visit.
