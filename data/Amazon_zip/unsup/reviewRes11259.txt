I'm going to assume that you've never been to the Bongo Room. So you're reading these reviews, going 'some people really love it. Some reallly hate it. WHAT IS UP???' I will make it simple. The space is small, and a little crammed. the servers are... not always that nice. And the wait is long. Really long. Like, 2-hour wait long. WHATEVER. Plan ahead. Plan for brunch at 1, get there at 11, and go shop (at mojo spa!). It is WORTH IT. NOW for the important stuff. SO. The chocolate tower french toast looks good, right? But so do the eggs benedict!! One salty and one sweet... what to do!?? I'll tell you. Grab a willing (or bribed/threatened) friend. She'll order the chocolate tower french toast, and you order the beef tenderloin benedict (unless you don't eat meat. And if you don't, consider changing that for this dish.) WITH spinach, and SPLIT IT. Heaven. That's all- heaven in your mouth (and on your clothes and face if you're like me). And don't be a wimp. None of this 'I'll get the rest to go' BS. EAT IT ALL THERE.
