Being the sushi addict that I am, it's funny that the other night was my first time at Coast. And sorry, I don't know what all the fuss is about... BYOB was great, A + for that. We got 3 rolls, and a few pieces of sushi and miso soup. First of all, I know you may be supposed to "drink" miso soup, but I thought it was weird that they gave me a bad look when I asked for a spoon. Not that I don't like to evolve myself into the culture of the food, but I rather eat my miso with a spoon. The rolls were fresh but very small, and I overall wasn't blown out of the water for the price that it costed. I wanted to LOVE this place but I think I'll stick to my other sushi haunts when the time comes again...
