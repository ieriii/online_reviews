An immediate hit with our whole group, it's certain to become a favorite place to bring visitors to Chicago. The food is a deliciously creative American-Romanian blend, the atmosphere is festive (especially on Saturday nights when there is a live band), the drink list is comprehensive (Romanian wine doesn't get enough attention in the States), and did I mention the delicious delicious food?Don't be surprised if Bramko stops by with a free sip of, well, we never did find out what kind of alcohol that was, but it was fun.We looked at the negative reviews here before we went, and they all seem to focus on the aspects that mark authenticity. If you're used to European restaurant customs (little longer wait time, lack of fake 'hospitality'), then you'll love the Little Bucharest. And even if you're not, the food is sure to win you over.
