I had a hankering for a lobster roll and Yelped my way to this place. FANTASTIC. Got the Oyster Sampler to start, and the New England Lobster Roll. It was amazing. My buddy got the Lobster Brie Pasta, and while it was good, it was lacking on the lobster front. Waitress was fun and I could not have been more satisfied. Will definitely be back.
