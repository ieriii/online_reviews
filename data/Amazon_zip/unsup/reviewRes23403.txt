There's nothing like eating outside at Irazu in the summer. The service is always fast and super friendly, their prices are great, and BYOB ensures that you'll be sipping on exactly what you like at prices you want to pay. This place is very vegan friendly, from many of their dishes to the awesome shakes/smoothies that they have. Their veggie casado wasn't very inspired, but their veggie burrito (maybe not 100% traditional Costa Rican food - something my friend in Costa Rica gave me a hard time about), is AMAZING... especially when you add mushrooms and zucchini. I could live off of their gallo pinto and friend plantains... and now am hungry for just that. (note to self - don't write a review of a restaurant that's closed at the time of the review)
