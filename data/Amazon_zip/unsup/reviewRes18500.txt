I must be frank that I'm not into the whole "bar scene" but the Bad Apple is definitely one bar that I can handle (minus the most horrific and ridiculous Bad Apple logo--a kid could draw a better mascot!). Don't come to the Bad Apple unless you have an appetite. To begin my gastronomical experience, I was happy to come across their Pear Cider which is not just refreshing but also Gluten-free. My partner had the Pumpkin Spice beer which was quite fitting for the Fall evening.  The Hangover burger was killer delicious, and no joke since it's a true artery clogger. What more could I find to add to the 3 bacon strips, slice of ham, tomato slice, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, Dijon mustard and the best for last, an over-easy egg, all on a soft homemade pretzel bun. The burger couldn't be more perfectly accompanied with anything but Bad Apple's FLAVORED HOMECUT FRENCH FRIES. As an appetizer, or for just .75 cents more to your burger/sandwich, you can choose from my personal favorite Truffle oil, garlic butter, BBQ and more to add to your french fries...all sound appetizing. Although I didn't get to take advantage of them, I liked that Bad Apple had a quieter back room with Shuffle Board, Foosball table and board games available to their patrons. With the great music playing, Bad Apple a chill place to pig out and socialize with friends.
