This was my post marathon meal . We actually came to Chicago just to eat here and then I found out the Marathon was being held that weekend...so I had to do it. We did the full tour, 24 courses that night, along with wine pairings. Our reservation was for 9:30 so we didn't get out of there until about 1:30...ALMOST as long as my marathon :0) All of the food was amazing, flavours, colours, presentations...all top notch. It is hard to describe such a dining experience. Everything was creative, flavourful and we found ourselves dissecting everything then trying it all together just to add to the sensory overload. Creative, fun, interesting and some just kinda bizarre...but it all worked. Grant is a genius. We'll probably be back next time we visit the windy city.
