I don't feel very unique since I am giving this ANOTHER five stars but this restaurant is certainly worth writing about and definately deserves all the stars we can give. I am quite convinced this place is heaven on earth and if heaven had a taste then it would definately taste like their ricotta with honeycomb spread. (kinda sounds like a cheesy pick up line but what the heck). For the wine lovers out there this place is perfect. The back of the restaurant feels like a wine cellar and you can even pick out a bottle and drink it at the restaurant for a $7 corkage fee(We got the $17 Montepulciano which was yummy!) The service was AWESOME--and the manager even stopped to talk to us a bunch and even got us not ONE but THREE free desserts---I'm going back again tommorow night.:)
