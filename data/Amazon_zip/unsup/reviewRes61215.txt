At the recommendation of a friend I visited Gino's, on a Tuesday night. We had to wait to have someone seat us, we had to ask a busboy to send a wait-person. Once he did come over he had absolutely no personality at all. We ordered drinks and waited for those, then ordered a deep dish pizza. After waiting an hour, with no contact from the waiter, the pizza arrived. The crust was overcooked and crumbly, no taste whatsoever. The toppings were good. The waiter came by and we asked for refills on the drinks then proceeded to watch the guy stand around for 15 minutes before "remembering" to get them. We watched countless other guests leave unhappy, many without waiting for their food to arrive. Unfortunately no one asked how the meal was, but I hope the 10 cent tip I left wasn't too much?! I won't be returning!
