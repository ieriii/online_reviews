There was only one thing I didn't like about my visit to 90 Miles Cuban Cafe - due to my wife's hair appointment, we didn't really have time to enjoy our food as much as we would have liked. Other than that, which was no fault of the restaurant's, I loved everything about this place. We actually ended up here by accident for a late lunch, since the place we were planning to go to was closed for lunch on Saturdays. We were looking for a place to grab a quick bite to eat before my wife's hair appointment and stumbled on 90 Miles. Being that we were a bit cramped for time, we didn't order more than a couple sandwiches, and some fries, but the food and service was terrific. I had the Cubano sandwich. I am a huge fan of Cuban sandwiches, when they are not jazzed up in any way. This was exactly what I crave about a Cuban sandwich - just the roast pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickle and mustard (plain old yellow mustard; none of that high-brow dijon stuff). My wife had the Ropa Vieja sandwich. The one bite I had was terrific. I know she was really happy with the sandwich. We also ordered a side of fries, which were lightly battered and fried perfectly. Our server was great. She was extremely friendly and you could tell she was someone who enjoys her job. The man, who I am assuming was the manager, was very personable and, again, with him, you could tell he loved working there. Being a former server and bartender, I love eating at restaurants when you can tell the employees enjoy their job. You know the food must be good and you are very likely to get great service. I know we'll definitely be headed back to 90 Miles Cuban Cafe on Armitage soon, most likely with bottle(s) in hand.
