I came here while in town for work. I was craving Indian food, and found this place on yelp. I came here with the knowledge that the prices were a bit higher than I am used to seeing in Reno. A typical entree was $16. I ordered the lamb vindaloo and garlic naan. They give you complimentary naan triangles with a tomato cream sauce. The sauce was fantastic though I would have liked garlic on the naan pieces to compliment the sauce. The vindaloo was amazing. It was extremely flavorful and had the right amount of spice to it. I ate all of my vindaloo and not much of the rice. The garlic naan dipped in the vindaloo sauce tasted even better than the tomato cream sauce. I was so full from my entree that I didn't make room for dessert. I read reviews on the mango ice cream and I wish I could have tried it, but alas I have to wait for my next Chicago trip. If you don't mind paying a little more for amazing Indian food, then this is your place.
