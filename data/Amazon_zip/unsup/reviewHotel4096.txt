HUGE HUGE HUGE hotel!!!! When getting here Friday afternoon, there were a TON of people. Luckily my party was already checked in, but I can't imagine the line. All in all the rooms were nice and the bed was comfortable, but whenever you needed anything it took 45-60 minutes to get it. Also, a room nearby had the smoke alarm go off, so that was a nuisance to figure out what was going on. Oh - don't valet/park your car at the hotel. It took 50 minutes to get the car back. Try to find some sort of parking outside the hotel nearby.
