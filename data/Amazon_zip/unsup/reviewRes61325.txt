OH MY GAWD! This is like a carnivore's heaven! And that SUCKS for me, because I can't eat red meat :( At first I thought, "well, this is gonna suck, paying almost $50 and I can't eat sh#$??"Well, I was SOOOOO wrong! When I first walked in, I saw those succulent raw oysters calling my name from the salad bar, along with the most amazing mushroom risotto and different variety of salads and sushi. Well, I didn't pay $50 just to eat at a salad bar, right? The waiters swirl around as if they are in a ballroom, holding huge racks of meat. For non red meat eaters like me, there are still much to choose from. From the Parmesan crusted pork chops, roasted chicken and freshwater shrimp, to the always oh so amazing grilled pineapples. Let's just say, I walked out as a happy girl :)
