It breaks my heart that the original old place is gone. I loved how dark and awesome it was. Also, my parents got engaged there. But this is my favorite Gino's East location. The other locations should take lessons from here, they have the crust down. The pie that is our's is usually a medium deep dish, sausage, patty style. I have other kinds, even ventured for the cheeseburger. Don't come here if you are in a rush, you come here to relax, possibly catch a game, some beers, and great Pizza.
