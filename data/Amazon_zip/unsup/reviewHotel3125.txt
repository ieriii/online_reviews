As stated by previous reviewers, it definitely helps if you have a room facing the lake, unfortunately I didn't get lucky, but I had a hotel rate of $89 from a friend so I didn't make a big fuss. The lounge on the first floor was non existent, and the hotel restaurant was a bit difficult to differentiate from the bar/ common area. Oddly enough I was put into room 911 and upon entering the room, the first thing that caught my eye was the window with shutters in the bathroom to the beds. That was a bit weird, but whatever floats your boat. Checked out the pool and gym on the 7th floor, which was pretty standard, but the bar on the roof was nothing to really write home about. Overall the hotel was fairly standard and the staff was very courteous and helpful whenever I needed anything.
