Excuse me? Did your menu just say $5 shots of Makers and $5 shots of Red Stag? My dream come true. Nevermind that you're pretty close to the ghettofied Subway. Ya know, the one that my friends and I tried to stay away from when we were in hs? Yeah, that one. I'll overlook that one. The cheese and chorozio dip + wings + baked mac and cheese were absolutely delicious. My friend even commented that the "wings were pretty"...whatever THAT means.  There's a TON of tv's on the walls...and they were showing various concerts when we were there. Pretty cool vibe, if you ask me! The owner even came around to thank us for hangin' out. Our waitress was super friendly - even though my friends started causing a scene... I think this is a new fav. Can't wait to check it out on the weekends!
