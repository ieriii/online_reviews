I had heard so many good things that perhaps my expectations were too high. We were greeted & seated by a friendly hostess. Service from then on was a bit slap-dash. Waiter was fine, busser was a bit clumsy. It was a Tuesday evening, so perhaps the staff was being trained. Maybe the "A" team appears on weekends. Homemade chips and sweet pickles were delicious. The special limeade cocktail was refreshing. The pitcher was just the right serving for two. My lemon shrimp were quite tasty. The competition style St Louis Ribs - we split a full rack - were moist and came right off the bone. But even with the choice of 4 sauces we were each left thinking "What's the big deal?" Glad I went, but doubt I would return
