So I've become obsessed with all culinary things that involve duck. Who needs chicken when there's duck?!?! A dear friend of mine knows of my quest and decided to take me to Sun Wah. This ain't no glitz and glam organization and that's half the charm. Paper plates with specials taped to the wall, yes. Big cavernous dining room, yes. BYOB, yes. Make a reservation and pre-order the duck. As far as I can tell this place is always packed and you want to make sure you get your fists on this animal. We ordered other dishes as well but in my mind that's not why you visit here. They're far over shadowed. The bird is carved at your table. DO NOT IGNORE THE SKIN. Eat all of it. Make sure you use the duck sauce. Make sure you come hungry so you get every last morsel. Oh yeah it feeds many and is easy on the pocket book. Service was neither here nor there but that ain't stoppin me from returning....
