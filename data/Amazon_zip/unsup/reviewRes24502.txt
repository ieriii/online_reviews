Not just for dates! A dear friend and i went to Geja's and had an amazing, amazing time! Great atmosphere for talking over a great meal and wine. Loved the cheese fondue with grapes and apples. YUM! Both of ordered the veggies and tofu - and having never had tofu before - Amazing! Total delicious!! I was worried we would burn the place down with our flaming marshmallows during the dessert course but luckily all remained intact. Can't wait for our next trip there!
