Has anyone ever read The Emperor's New Clothes? We tried this place for after work drinks and snacks. We had a couple of items from their bar menu--chewy, rubbery fried calamari with thick garlic mayo and some flavorless risotto ball thing--plus the cheez-it risotto everyone's been talking about. Yuck yuck and yuck. The food was so bad that we couldn't eat more than a few bites. We were completely shocked that a chef like Bowles would allow food to leave the kitchen tasting like it did. Our server was honestly one of the worst I've ever had. Completely unprofessional and with no knowledge of the menu. It actually took him about 20 minutes to get through explanations of their signature drinks. He kept having to go back to the bartender to ask for the ingredients. The room was nice, but the whole experience felt a little 'ironic' to me, with the PBR-onions in the risotto and the staff in jeans and Chuck Taylors. The concept might have worked if the food was any good, but it just left me feeling irritated.
