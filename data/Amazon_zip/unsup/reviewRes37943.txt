I went to dinner here because the hotel concierge described Giordano's as "the best deep dish in Chicago!". I have to say that the idea of ordering ahead while you wait for your table is smart. I was here on business and was surprised at how busy the restaurant was at 9pm. We waited about 35 minutes to be seated and received our pizza pie within a 10 minute time frame. The service was not very good. Our waitress was not very attentive. however, I liked how they serve you a slice from the pie. The pizza was kind of bland and extremely greasy. They use three kinds of cheese (Mozzarella, Provolone and Parmesan) so a heart attack waiting to happen. I would recommend Giordano's if you are in Chicago for vacation.
