About bourgeois brunch: just when you think you've had every possible kind of pancake/omelet/panlette/omcake, another one comes along and changes you forever. Kind of like love. I know my fancy brunch food, and Milk & Honey had the best goddamn pancakes I've ever eaten. They were banana-granola-honey, and I will name my firstborn after them. This is super high praise *especially* since: 1). It's crowded and confusing and you will have to wait. That's part of living the weekend brunch dream in the city. 2). You have to sit close to other people. This would be okay, except when you are talking ad nauseum about your neurotic insecurities and/or shit about other people, as I find my friends and I are wont to do these days. 3). It's medium expensive. Like 8 dollars for fancy pancakes? Maybe you don't care. I don't know. (I wouldn't recommend the strata unless you are a huge strataphile.)
