The other month I told Doug that he was one of the reasons I moved to Chicago. And I was actually kind of serious. He took the ridiculous compliment in the best way a punk rock purveyor of encased meats could: he immediately told me to leave his establishment. With a huge grin on his face. I'm sure he's used to it. Doug is one of the reasons you go to Hot Doug's. He's always there, always behind the counter. Always smiling, calm, patient, and funny. I'm know that at times owning a restaurant, even one as consistently packed as this one, is incredibly difficult, and sometimes not that much fun, but you'd never know it when meeting Doug. This is some well-crafted, lovingly thought-out, inventive food. There are hot dogs here that will make you curse with delight. And at this point HD's is a part of my history: I take every single visiting friend here, without fail (they never regret not seeing the Bean instead). I have actually waited 2.5 hours in line for something like a Cognac-Infused Lamb and Pork Sausage with Spinach Raita and Delice de Jura Cheese and I'd do it again. And I'm pretty sure that I officially fell in love with my girlfriend while sharing a Burgundy and Citrus Pork Sausage with Orange Sauce Moutarde and Morbier Cheese. It's a testament to Chicago's culinary prowess that it can support magical dining experiences like Hot Doug's, which costs a fraction of a place like [the equally creative and delicious] Schwa, and without any of the pretension you'd get elsewhere in the country. It's this culinary creativity and obvious fun being had in the preparation of food that is truly one of the reasons I moved here. So, believe me or not, Doug: thanks!
