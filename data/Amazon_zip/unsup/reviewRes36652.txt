This brunch is SO good. I was actually only in Chicago for a weekend, and I visited this place not once, but twice for brunch. That's rare for me, considering I like to try new things as often as possible. I got an omelette the first go, and eggs benedict the second. Loved both of them. I'm usually not a fan of the potatoes that so often are a side with breakfast foods, in fact I usually don't touch them at all. But theirs are amazing, I couldn't stop eating them! Though I wish they had alcohol, they have a ton of different fresh juice blends, which is arguably even better (or at least healthier). It's not cheap, no, but the huge portions, extensive menu, and fresh food make it worth it.
