Not bad. I went with a group of 4, which became 5, which became 6. They were really cool about letting us sit at a 6-top even though #'s 5 and 6 trickled in way late. The margaritas are really super tasty (we had regular flavor, with the cheapest tequila), however they are not strong. The food is pretty standard and the prices average. But they keep the chips and salsa coming and the atmosphere is fun. No major complaints here.
