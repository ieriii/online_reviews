The only reason I don't give F&O 5 stars is because they're just too pricey to be a regular stop for me. To go to their cafe as a treat, though, is fine (love their grilled cheese and tomato basil soup combo). The food is consistently delicious whether it's from the cafe, the deli or their brown box meals. Great, unique grocery selection offering things you'll never see in your average grocery store as well as numerous varieties of such.
