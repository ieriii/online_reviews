Note: I have only been here for brunch once, so this is based on that one experience.  We had a large party to L&E for brunch. A lot of us had been there before, but it was my first time. I was so excited! The patio is gorgeous and perfect for a leisurely summer brunch. Our service was fantastic. They were friendly, informative, attentive. Just great. The coffee was also awesome. I wish I had gotten the chicken and waffles. That was the best dish we got, by far. The eggs on some of the dishes were a little oily and almost rubbery. The French toast was beautiful, but didn't pack a punch in the flavor department. I had the duck hash, which my friends had raved about. I had expected duck eggs and poached. Maybe that was just my own misconception. It was sunny side up chicken eggs though. Cooked a little too hard, so they didn't run into my hash. Bummer. I like to mush my hash and eggs up and I like the richness of the egg mixed into the hash part. The potatoes underneath were really salty. So salty that two other people at the table who ordered the same dish didn't finish it. They had an impressive cocktail list, but I had a hard time figuring some of them out. They had ingredient lists and stories about them, but it was almost too much to decifer before coffee. I ended up with a Bloody that was good, but not as inspiring as I am guessing some of the cocktails I missed out on may have been.  So, overall, A-OK. I would probably go back to give it another try, but there are a lot of great brunches in town.
