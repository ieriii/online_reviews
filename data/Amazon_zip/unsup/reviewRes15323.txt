Real cool bar in Bucktown. A local friend recommended, otherwise we would never have found it. It's "hidden" as the entrance is easy to miss (sort of hidden along a wall with no signs - very "speakeasy" feel).  But inside, it was swanky and happening. We were fortunate to get seated right away as we just beat the rush of the crowd that followed. The drinks are well-thought out with libations ordered in terms of the spirit. The whiskey drinks were fine but after trying a friend's Juliet and Romeo, I think that was my favorite (even though I don't like gin usually), although it is a little too sour if the bartender is generous with the lime juice. Drinks are all $12 .. pricey but definitely a worthwhile experience. Don't think there are any happy hour specials. Service is a bit slow and scattered so whenever we got our server's attention, we would bombard her with requests for more drinks and small bites.
