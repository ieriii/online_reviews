My husband came a while ago for a bachelor party. He loves this place, and he got my curiosity going. We came on a weeknight, and it was busy. No biggie though, we sat by the bar and had a beer before we got seated, about 10 min later.  The Bottom Up Belgian Wit was delicious. We each just got entrees. I got the pulled pork and bacon pizza, and my husband got the workingman burger. I thought his burger was better than my pizza. The pizza was good, but there was too much bbq sauce on the pizza. His burger was juicy and tasty, and the fries were good too. I'd come back here, but next time to try the pork chop as I hear it's fantastic.
