A friend took me to Crisp on a Monday night for dinner where we discovered they were closed. Not to be thwarted, when I realized I was within walking distance later in the week I headed on over for try #2 at these rumored wings. Authentic or not, these are some awesome awesome wings. I got the half order with the Seoul Sassy sauce. I'm normally not a fan of sweeter sauces but this really hit the spot. I am not quite sure how I managed to eat all the food but once you start it is quite difficult to stop. I took the food to go, and saw a couple other orders come out and they all looked fantastic. I can't wait to go back and try a few more things off the menu.
