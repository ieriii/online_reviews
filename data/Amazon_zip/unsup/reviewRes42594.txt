I heard that this place had good pizza, and was close to where I live so I figured I'd check them out... First off I want to say, food wise I'm relatively easy to please and I hate complaining. Buttt while I'm here and since you asked...I ordered the Marinara pizza, and was quoted a wait time of 20-25 mins. Okay sounds good, I figured I'd sit and watch the Bulls game that was on while I waited... I think the wait time was severely understated because I somehow managed to watch the entire second half of that game...and then at some point I guess my order became ready, but then I was never informed that it was. I hoped that when I got home, and cracked open the box I'd at least get a piping hot delicious pizza for all my troubles. Nope, nice and lukewarm with a side of meh for taste. On another note, for all the people who wrote reviews saying their deliveries were messed up, I can see how that happens. Spending all that time in the place, I saw plenty of uncertainty and fumbling over delivery orders. I'm sure that quality must vary depending on the day and how close to closing the place is, but for now I'm giving this place 2 stars. I think it'll be awhile before I give "Fogo 2 Go" another go.
