OH.MY.GOD. All you can eat Alaskan King Crab Tuesdays. A small group went last night for my bf's birthday. It was amazing. I've never had king crab and it was better than I expected. Everything was delicious (except the calamari. Skip that.) I had a root beer float - amazing. It's a little pricey, but you get what you pay for. Julz our server was a gem. Will recommend to all my friends :]
