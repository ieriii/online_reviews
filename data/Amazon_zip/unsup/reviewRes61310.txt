WOW... What a place...great service,excellent food. I took my future bride here the day after Christmas and all I can say is...groovylicious. We were treated as if we owned the place...We are not movie stars,but we received the red carpet treatment from the moment we walked in...Big thanks to Mary and Christian...My bride to be and I love Oreo's and Orange Juice(that's are thang-didn't think I would ever find someone with a fondness for that one,but I did) Mary and Christian made it happen...with the best dessert ever...She(my bride to be)was really surprised and just out done...Thanks Brazzaz,we will be back over and over again...Hopefully everyone will just love this place...
