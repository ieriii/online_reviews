This is my favorite Chicago pizza place. I'm from Los Angeles and SF and this is the best example of it I have had. I loved the sausage patty layer. That's unique. Also tried the spinach dip and loved it. I liked the writing on the wall and that made me think people love this place. Gave me a great sense of community. Loved that the bartender said hell no when someone tried to change the Monday Night Football game when the Chicago Bears were playing at home. Great place.
