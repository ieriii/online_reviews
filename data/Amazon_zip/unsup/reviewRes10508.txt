Well, let me start this off by mentioning that I am a beer snob. The beers at Piece are great, a few of them have won awards at the GABF. This place has become too damn popular for it's own good. Every time I've gone to Piece it's been packed full of people and there's been a 45-60 min wait. This is annoying, but it's not something Piece can do anything about. I also have to agree that the on more than 1 occasion the service was less than stellar. It really sucks to be out of beer, with no waiter/waitress in sight, at a microbrewery. All the complaints aside, the food is pretty good, although I've only tried various forms of the pizza and some of the appetizers. Update: Just hanging out and having drinks at the bar isn't too bad. Don't have to worry about the super slow service.
