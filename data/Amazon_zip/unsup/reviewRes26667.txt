Yet another amazing experience! I had friends/family in from out of town and decided to take them here after such a great experience last time. My guests loved it and were very impressed with the service. The staff remembered us from last time and went above and beyond to make me and my guests feel special. Thanks again!!! Items to try: Simply It's Beef, Avocado Wonton, Veggie Eggrolls.
