Schwa was the site of one of the best meals I've ever had. They would get 5 stars except my birthday is coming up. My husband started calling them 2 months ago and they've never returned any of his calls. We won't be going there for dinner on my birthday. Argh. I never thought I'd crave candied sweet breads for desert. The food is incredible and the service is unique since the chefs serve you with passion.
