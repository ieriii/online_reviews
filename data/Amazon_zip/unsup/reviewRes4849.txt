Nestled in the super touristy Miracle Mile in downtown Chicago, The Purple Pig was a pleasant surprise. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating -- the atmosphere makes you feel like you're in a small neighborhood and not in the bustling part of the city. It's best to go with more people so you can try more of the dishes! We tried a couple of the veggie dishes, bone marrow, pork shoulder, cheeses, some wine, etc. All delicious and served at a good pace so we weren't served everything at once.  Will definitely visit again when I'm in Chicago and highly recommend it to anyone with a craving for unique pork dishes. :)
