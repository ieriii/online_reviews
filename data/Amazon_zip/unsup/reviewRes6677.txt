Unbelievable. Went for our anniversary and had a great time, unbelievable meal (leak pizza, linguine with sea urchin, the most creamy mozzarella with roasted tomatoes and basil and other dishes too). The fire oven really adds a touch to many plates and you can't beat the retail wine pricing and small corking fee. Bottle of wine and a full dinner for $110, at a top notch place that's tough too beat. Great experience.
