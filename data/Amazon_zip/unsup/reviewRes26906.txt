What happened to you Pequods???? We moved back to Chicago in March of 07 and started our quest for the best pizza in the city. We mostly lived in the burbs before really. Our friend took us to Pequods and said to be prepared to be amazed - and we were! Love the tasty pan pizza with the burnt cheese!!!! We told people many times that it was a contender for our favorite in the city. Dined in another 1-2 times in 07-08. But then we ordered delivery in 2009... wow, is this the same pizza? There is SO MUCH DOUGH and it is dry. The sauce is still tasty, but very thin, and the burnt cheese still rules. But I could hardly eat it because of the dough. I don't want to have to pick my toppings off a pizza, that is not a good pizza. So, we thought maybe since it was delivery it just wasn't the same or just a fluke one time. I had a girls movie night last night and they all wanted to order Pequods. We got 2 pan and 1 thin (since I hadn't tried thin yet). Me and another friend ended up eating only the top half of our pan pieces and the crust - again - way to much dry dough! It just isn't cutting it. Maybe they changed the recipe? The thin was good, but not really thin - I would say it was "normal" thickness, and maybe more of what the pan pizza should be, just add the burnt crust to the thin pizza and it would be better I think. Well, that all being said, Pequods went from one of our favorites, to one that we won't be ordering again. Sad. I'll miss that big whale with undies on his head!
