I love this place. I ordered in because I was sick, and it was probably one of the best decisions I've made in a while. I'm vegetarian so I was immediately impressed by the number of options I had. After reading other reviews, I decided on the potato tacos, black bean soup, and oatmeal shake. I also got a side of plantains. They delivered the food in about 30 minutes and even gave me larger portions that I expected (never a bad thing). Everything went very well together. I loved the soup and oatmeal shake the most. They were both fresh and comforting at the same time. Not too heavy but still very satisfying. I wasn't that impressed with the guacamole that came with my potato tacos, but it was still tasty. I'm eager to try their sandwiches and desserts next time!!
