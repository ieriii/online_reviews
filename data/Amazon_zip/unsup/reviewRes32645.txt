I went there with my cousin and her boyfriend....It was their first time at a all vegi place. They are real meat eater :-( and yeah they broke their cherries here!! they seemed to kinda like it. they ate everything (they had to i was paying for it all) neither one went into the bathroom to throw up.... Its not as good as GOLDEN ERA in S.F. which is the mecca of vegi places but it was good..... I would eat at this place again. our waiter was nice. He didnt smell like a hippie or a crusty punk so that was good ! I didnt see a bike rack but I did get a $120 parking ticket...
