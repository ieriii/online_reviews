I've been to Wilde's twice now and enjoyed the food and beer selection both times. The Irish Cod and Cheddar sandwich is fantabulous. The sweet potato fries are addicting but need to be salted before digging in. There are also a variety of seating options and plenty of shiz on the walls to look at. Just don't go expecting decent service because you more than likely won't get it.
