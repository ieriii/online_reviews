I really enjoyed brunch at Big Jones with a group of friends. The migas that I ordered were very tasty and the service was so friendly. One of the owners greeted us and he was so incredibly welcoming. It was probably the nicest restaurant greeting I've ever experienced!  I kind of wished that the complimentary beignets were were a little crispier, but that may just be me--I like everything really crunchy. :) And they were complimentary, after all, so it's hard to complain. I appreciate when places put little extras on the table while you wait for your food. And if the extras are something different from the norm, even better! I am looking forward to going back for dinner sometime!
