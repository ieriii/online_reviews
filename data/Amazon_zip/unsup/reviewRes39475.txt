OK, so I came here with a group of 5 people. I had no idea what I was ordering; thankfully, one of the guys with us was well versed in Korean food. He asked us a few questions on what we like/were willing to try/refused to try and then ordered for us. We got a gigantic plate of different meat and got to cook it ourselves on the charcoal grill ourselves. This, I learned, is what Korean barbecue is all about. I don't really know the names of the meat, but I do know that we had mostly pork and beef. And then there were the side dishes...the multitude of little side dishes that they give you...I tried it all and liked most of it. I wanted to try the things before learning what they were so that I wouldn't make a judgment first. As the meal went on, I kept having more and more fun...but that probably had a little to do with the sake. I am a fan of Korean barbecue. You should be too...unless you're a vegetarian. If you're a vegetarian, I'm not sure you'll love Korean barbecue.
