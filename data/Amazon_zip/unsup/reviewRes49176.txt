Twice in one day, that's how good the macaroons are. I decided I want a macaroon wedding cake from here. The only thing that knocked it down one star is my first trip in the morning, the staff was a bit rude because I got there right as they were opening and my stroller was messing up the windows or something. But the macaroons, OUTRAGEOUS!!
