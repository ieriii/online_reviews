Hotels like this make me aspire for more. Earn a degree in gold-digging (or you know, become successful on my own...) This is an older building so it wasn't too impressive from the outside, inside, however, it was typical contemporary W design. Our room was ridiculous. It was a 1 bedroom suite with not 1, but 2 plasmas, XM radio, and 2 bathrooms. I love excess. The view overlooked the lake which looked like the ocean as well as Navy Pier (walking distance). It reminded me of Ocean Beach in Miami. Outside of the hotel are rocking chairs where you can relax with a drink (HIGHLY recommend the raspberry mojito or don julio tequila sunset/sunrise...).  The bed was heavenly. The bathroom had the "rain" showerhead which if you read my review on the Four Season in Santa Barbara, I go on and on about my love of it.  In-room Bliss products are also great - I am hooked on their sage face wash. The service here was also excellent - they really strive to achieve their "whatever, whenever" service policy. For example, we walked in late and missed the breakfast menu, but they were still able to serve us French Toast (albeit probably out of the garbage...).  Oh and for the health-conscious, their gym is amazing...but their indoor pool is definitely lacking (though you could easily just go across the street to the lake).
