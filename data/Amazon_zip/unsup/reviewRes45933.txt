Out of all the restaurants that I've been to, I don't think I have ever frequented one more than Grand Lux... therefore, I'll be really covering the restaurant's menu of what I had in depth. I have always had good service (except for this one time but one of the guys we were with was being a real ass to the server...plus the manager comped our desserts when he complained) and I'm guessing I've probably gone here around 40 times. The lines are ridiculously long so I always tend to go during weekday dinners or in between lunch and dinner on the weekends. It's great for big groups since there are so many different menu options and everyone's not limited to just one kind of cuisine.  Wish they brought back the regular banana bread pudding and especially the hong kong sea bass...that was my favorite! My Ratings (obviously based on 1-10 scale..and yes, I have tried everything on this list) Strawberry-lava colada: 8 (doesn't seem like there's too much alcohol but sooo tasty)  Appetizers: Cheese Steak spring rolls: 9 Asian Nachos: 8 (great if you want a sweet and savory appetizer) Buffalo Chicken Rolls: 6 Creamy Spinach & Cheese Dip: 6 Buffalo Chicken Rolls: 5.5 Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls: 5.5 Fried Calamari: 5 Crispy Ahi Sushi roll: 5 Grand Appetizer Platter: 4 Double Stuffed Potato Rolls: 4 Stacked Chicken Quesadilla: 2 Entrees: Sunday night pasta: 9 Southwestern salad: 8.5 (they changed this salad and it's still good but not as good as it used to be) Mushroom burger: 8.5 Short Rib Sloppy Joe: 8 (I swear, they must dunk the bread in melted butter first...never had such buttery bread before!) Fish and chips: 8 (used to be a 9 but wasn't as good last time, plus the fries weren't very fresh) Miso salmon (sometimes it can be like a 9..and at others time a 6): 7.5 Caramel Chicken: 7.5 Wiener Schnitzel: 7.5 Jamaican Pork Tenderloin: 7.5 Pasta Fresca: 7.5 Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya: 7 Shaking Beef: 7 Mongolian Steak: 6 Indochine Shrimp and Chicken: 5.5 Max Burger: 5.5 Thai Chicken Pizza: 5.5 Seared Rare Ahi Tuna Salad: 4 Salmon Three Ways: 3 Desserts: Molten chocolate cake: 8.5 Rustic apple pie: 8 Beignets: 7.5 Chocolate chip pecan cookies: 7 Banana Cream Pie: 7 Carrot Cake: 6.5 Deep Dark Fudge Cake: 6.5 Apple crisp: 3 Creme Brulee: 2.5 (sounds so good because it's a duo but so disappointing...)
