I love that I can go here on weekdays. I've had ONE weekend experience and wasn't a fan. Not worth all of the "scuse me"s from hectic, hungover hipsters and demanding yuppies. The food is consistently good (I'm partial to the ham sammich). Service is just fine. Not the cheapest lunch in the neighborhood but this cute, clean, well-established joint is a perk for a girl like me.
