My husband and I went to sprout on the second night of opening weekend. We didn't have very high expectations for the food since it just opened pretty quickly. We were more there since we are big fans of Top Chef and wanted to check out and support the former contestant's new place...but WOW WERE WE BLOWN AWAY BY THE FOOD.  I started with the Scallop appetizer and my husband had the Foie Gras and both were incredible. We both had the short rib entree and for the first time in my life I finished an entire portion of red meat. Delish! I can't wait to go back!
