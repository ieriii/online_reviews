My parents and I will forever keep going back here. That's just how it is. The bread is delicious! Make sure if they only bring the onion loaf that you ask for the dark rye raisin bread. If you're a party of 2, you may never get to see it without asking. Not sure why this is-they should really change that as many might even prefer it! The salads are a must. My parents love the chopped salad with everything in it. I prefer the house salad, which is so good. Usually a house salad is bland, but their citrus-vinaigrette dressing is SO yummy. I personally recommend the cedar planked salmon with a bbq rubbed sweet potato for the entree and side dish. I have never gone wrong with this dish as it is just truly tasty. The service is USUALLY top-notch. There are some times where we have experienced horrible service, but for the most part, have been impressed. The decor is really nice. I love the layout of the restaurant as it is roomy and lively. The bar area is nice when waiting for your party to arrive. Overall, my family and I go back to Wildfire very frequently. We are big-time Lettuce Entertain You fans and enjoy the dining experience that the restaurants offer. I recommend Wildfire for special events, dates, or work outings. However, just a casual dining experience is A-OK as well. There is definitely something for everyone here!
