I don't know how I could have passed this place up. I've had so many chances to eat this place. I've lived in the area for over two years and I had yet to step foot in the door until the other day. And what can I say.... I fell in love with the decor, the food, and the waitstaff. I especially loved the Vlad the Impaler stained glass window. We showed up for an early dinner, which at 6pm on a Saturday evening must have been early for everybody else. We were the only table for a good thirty minutes. The main entrees took some time getting to us but thankfully our waiter was more then kind enough to recommend that we get an appetizer. I'm glad he did because we had a great one. Normally I don't like eggplant but the Salata de Vinete was amazing. The entree's were equally amazing especially the Sausage-Stuffed Chicken Breast. So if you were like me and just kept driving/biking past this place, Stop! You won't regret it. Note: Almost forgot about the live entertainment. Enjoy.
