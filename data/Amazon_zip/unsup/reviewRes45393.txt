Monday Monday Monday... three dollar wells and an amazing staff in a great setting, I really am a fan! The music was flat but hey Im sure that can change... Was making hot tat-tis with the three dollar Jim Beam bourbon, they really hit the spot! The food was excellent all the way around, I got the corned beef and cabbage, I practically licked the plate! sweet salty out of this world, the cabbage was like crack, I could have bathed in this wonderfully textured creamy sweet cabbage delight! The corn beef was tender not too salty and with hints of maple and honey, I let everyone at the table sample it; with silent regret, I wanted every bite for myself!  The other dishes at the table included meat loaf sandwich (really good) shepherds pie, oh so flavorful and would have been equally satisfying for me! The fish sandwich was great, in an odd twist of fate, it was the first day for a new version of this sandwich; my buddy was not prepared, he is violently lactose intolerant, when the fish came swimming in a creamy white cheese blanket he was unto happy (previously this sandwich had no cheese), I quickly saved the cheesy delicate perfectly cooked fish from hitting the trash can, adding a very unexpected highly caloric punch to my already wonderful meal, I ate it all, luckily the other two blokes at the table do not like fish! The whole experience was great! The service was great! I will be back!
