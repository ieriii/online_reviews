It's Friday during the season of Lent. For this Catholic boy and his buddies, this meant that we've been abstaining from the consumption of meat all day. This is a tough day for carnivores jonesing for late-night za so in typical dude fashion, we get down to Pequod's just before midnight. Strategy, get the order in on Friday, enjoy it as soon as Saturday happens. Secondary strategy, make it half giardinera and half pepperoni. Eat the Lent-friendly side first in case the order shows up early. Btw, the pizza came out just in time and it was AWESOMEly good. I heart you Pequod's. Religious obligation...check, gastronomic obligation...check, check and check.
