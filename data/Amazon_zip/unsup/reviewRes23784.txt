Jammed packed on an early Sunday night we thankfully had a reso. We all came for the Hot Pot. we ordered regular and Spicy broth and all the fixings. The only thing I didn't like was the tripe, I'm not a fan and there was a lot of it. Everything else however was great. I want to come back to try the other dishes which looked great
