Probably one of the most romantic and borderline sensual restaurants I have ever been to in Chicago. I would probably take these comments with a grain of salt since I think that the walk up window to Portillos is sexy. You can also find me banging on the windows of the McDonalds (the one on the corner of western and Mil) at 2 in the morning...so again with a grain of salt... But for real....the place is cool. You see....the French were in NAM for awhile....doing their own tour of duty..so they put in their own 2 cents into the foodie food. I had the Cha Gio and it was Cha die for. ha..er sorry. :Crisp, fried spring rolls of shrimp, pork, & asian mushrooms, with chili lime dipping sauce" For the love of all that is holy...this place did it right. Pho was also strong. It is pronounced "fa" like fa la la la.......not "what you looking at pho?" So guys, if you want a romantic time with your gal, I highly recommend that you take her to this place. And like some other reviews, I would try and avoid some of the nearby dance clubs. aint nothin poppin but the viagra. I had some other stuff that was good too, but I can't remember right now. I'll update later. Good job Le Colonial Sanders!
