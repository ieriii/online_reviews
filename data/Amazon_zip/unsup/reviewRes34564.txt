I love this place. The decor is trendy, modern, and bright. We went on a weekday morning which is a much better idea than waiting on the weekend for a table. We got seated right away, and the food came out fairly quickly. Definitely get the strawberry OJ...it was so yummy, that my friend ordered one after I downed mine in about 1 minute. I ordered the farmhouse (sausage gravy over biscuits) which was excellent. The pancakes are good too. They have really large portions, but this place is great. I would go back again. I saw a lot of mothers there with their children.
