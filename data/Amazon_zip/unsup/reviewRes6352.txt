Since there were so many great reviews of this place on Yelp! and it's been on the Chicago Magazine Hot List for a couple of months now, we decided to try it out last weekend. As other reviewers mentioned, they don't take reservations, so we were prepared to wait a while for a table. It was pretty crowded up front - and I'm not sure I would love the table in the front window for that reason - but we eventually grabbed seats at the bar and from then on the wait flew. While we waited, we tried a couple of very reasonably priced bottles of wine and they even brought out some complimentary pizza from the kitchen for us to munch on, which was quite good! Once seated the experience was great - our server was helpful but not intrusive or pretentious. We tried the polenta and ragu of the day (which was pork), the bruschette (which has a tuna and white bean topping), crispy pork belly, calamari, olives and the burrata to share to start. All were very good but the polenta and ragu stood head and shoulders above the rest. It was awesome! I've been thinking about it for days. Our main courses (I shared the giant rigatoni and the strip steak with someone) were just ok. For desert I would definitely recommend the chocolate hazelnut mousse - it was chocolate heaven. Overall I would definitely recommend this place for a fun dinner with friends - just be prepared to wait a bit for a table. The wine menu is incredibly affordable (I heard they sell all the bottles of wine at retail + $7) and the tapas style portions are great for sharing and trying a lot of different dishes. Last but not least, the atmosphere is less pretentious than most "hot list" places which makes for a fun night out!
