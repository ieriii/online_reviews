alliance has amazing croissants. if i wanted to get fat, i would eat them all the time. as it is, once a week is prolly too much -- but still. they're very, very good. try the chocolate! or the raspberry... we stumbled upon alliance one day and ended up getting a carrot cheesecake bar. hello. amazing. we couldn't stop oooing and ahhhing. the only thing i wish could change about alliance is their customer service. i've seen them be extremely friendly with regulars -- but my gf and i have been in at least a dozen times in the recent past and they still hardly look at us during our transaction. the last time, they began to help another customer before they'd even given us our change. is this a trend with bakers? still, i'll never stop being french and loving croissants, and all i know is alliance has done 'em right.
