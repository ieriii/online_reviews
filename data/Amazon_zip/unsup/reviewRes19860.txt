great place for a first date sushi was awesome plus you gotta love Thai food ! BYOB is an exceptionally lovely thing in this world the staff could be friendlier, my date an i sat at the sushi bar and we got bumped into quit a bit because of the size of the restaurant and location of the restroom, it looks more comfier to sit by the windows but i do enjoy watching the chefs roll up, they were quit friendly too. the price for 2 people to get filled up was great plus if you don't know what to get ask the chef what he recommends my hat goes off to you Coast Sushi Bar
