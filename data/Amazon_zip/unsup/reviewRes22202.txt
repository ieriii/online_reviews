One of the best Chinese restaurants that I've been to in Chicago. Some dishes that we had that were outstanding: shrimp fried rice, orange chicken, chilli pepper chicken. Crab ragoons weren't that good to me (kind of dry/hard), go with the pot stickers instead. And yes the chairs do suck, but get over it. This place will be packed, so put in a reservation.
