Byob, great service, great food and great environment. Went with a group of 5 people and we all loved everything we had. We went there on a Saturday night and expected to wait a long time but we sat down right away. Parking was also very easy. For appetizer we had the avocado thing and empanadas. For dinner we got a variety of things including: tofu, steak, horse tail (I think) and chicken. We all loved everything; the tail was by far the weirdest but that person loved it. One of my friends said she is going to recommend this to everyone she knows. For dessert we had the bread pudding and the rice pudding. I thought they were incredibly sweet but my friends liked them a lot. Overall great food, great price, great service. Next time we will probably do some sangria
