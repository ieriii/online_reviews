Wakamono, how I've missed you! The specialty rolls make the slightly higher prices worthwhile. My favorite two are the Peter Parker roll and the Kani Chung roll. I haven't had anything like them anywhere else so I'm willing to pay the combined $30. HOWEVER, that's why this isn't my regular go-to. And why I get so happy when I do pay them a visit. I go to Wakamono when I'm eating off-hours because it's super annoying trying to eat while 15 people waiting with their bottles in the doorway bump into you. I don't know how they could fix this problem but it is definitely a problem. And speaking of bottles, we brought in a screw top last night and were still charged the $8 corking fee. Ouch! The hot towels before the meal make me feel special and the specialty rolls are just that, specialties. This place is a nice treat if you aren't dining at peak hours, don't mind giving up your first born child for the corkage fees (with or without a cork), and have some extra money to spend.
