I came here for dinner once and thought it was ok - rather overpriced for the veggies we had, not the best I've ever had, though I did appreciate very much that they seated and served us minutes before they were supposed to close; they were really friendly. Last week I came for lunch and my experience was incredible. Their lunch specials are much cheaper than the dinners. We got SO MUCH FOOD and it was SO GOOD and they were SO FRIENDLY..I guess lunch is it at this restaurant! I can't wait to go back soon.
