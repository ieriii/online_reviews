Alinea was brillant and all of their courses were surprising and delicious. What an experience!  We got to meet the incredible Chec Grant and I was star stuck. None of the food disappointed at all. I did deduct a star and would like to explain why... My father treated me to an evening at Alinea and we splurged and had the RESERVE wine pairings as well which is the same price as the tasting. Basically, dinner was $900 for two people. The pairings were mediocre, the food is so complex that I understand the difficulty in pairing...the issue I had was my favorite wine came near the end and it was a Spanish red. After desert, I wanted another glass.  (let me back track, at the beginning our server/sommelier stated that with the pairings they will pour as your drink....) Anyways, I asked our server for another glass of the Spanish that I liked. He brought me a very small pour. At the end of the evening, the bill came and they charged us $12 for the pour. I asked about it and the server stated that because it was a reserve wine they charge for extra OUNCES!!!! At $450 a person I would think that an extra pour wouldn't cost $12. It is the principle of the issue and not the actual cost. This alone would probably lead me to NOT return. James Beard for food but not service
