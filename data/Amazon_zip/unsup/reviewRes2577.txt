I would eat at Hot Doug's everyday if I lived in the same state. It was a staple in my diet when I lived in Chicago and every trip I make back isn't complete unless I stop at Hot Doug's. The veggie dogs are what got me hooked, but now that I'm not vegetarian I'm looking forward to trying the REAL DEAL!
