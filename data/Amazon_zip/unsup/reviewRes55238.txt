It's a carnivore's paradise. It's like an alcoholic walking into a liquor store. The restaurant is huge, which is good in the sense that if you're stuck waiting the turnover is fairly quick. I've always made reservations in advance, typically for a Friday or Saturday night. It's usually packed when I go. I believe you have two options: salad bar only or salad bar plus meat. Now, the salad bar is a quagmire. You can easily make a full meal out of the bounty offered. There's asparagus, sliced tomatoes, fresh parmigiana, smoked salmon and all kinds of other goodies. I love their salad bar but I deliberately try to get away from it with a small plate lest I ruin my appetite for the carnage that awaits. You get this thing that looks like a paper coaster. It's green on one side and red on the flip. It's the slaughter stoplight. If the green side is up, the gauchos that are moving about the dining room will descend upon your table with skewers of some of the most delicious meats I've ever had. If the red side shows, it means stop bringing me meat before my stomach goes supernova. There's prime rib, filet mignon, leg of lamb and roast chicken among others. I think there's 12 or 13 different kinds in all. Be sure to try the lamb chops, they're out of this world. Great wine selections, great service. A manager or assistant manager almost always stops by my table to see how I'm doing. Gauchos are always available if you want more of a particular kind of meat. Flip up the green side of your coaster thing, and let the slaughter begin!
