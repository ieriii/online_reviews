The thing I love about gastropubs, is the fact that you can dress as yourself and still get a chance to have a great selection of alcoholic beverages, delicious food, and great service. I've been hearing a lot about this place, so I was super hyped to go. The outside of the building doesn't have much for advertising, just a plain black and gray facade (which isn't very inviting). The interior was a little drab, until I started to realize the concept of what they were going for when my server, Cortland (what an adorable name and very fitting for a young Kurt Cobain look alike) approached the table in a blue, plaid, shirt and black jeans. As I looked around the room, I noticed that each server had on similar attire in their own unique way, kinda back of the woods, outdoorsy. Cortland was one of the best servers I have encountered in awhile. He was warm and incredibly knowledgeable in both food and drink. He knew every detailed description to each menu item and was able to pair it well with a suggested beverage. I ordered the Smoked Sweetbreads with piquillo peppers, olives, and fava beans and the Tete de Cochon with fried quail egg and Asian mustard-five spice sauce. My friend had the Pear Salad and the Roasted Cauliflower and Lentils. This chef knows his shit. He has a superb palate and knows how to pair his ingredients well in order to hit the perfect salt, sweet, sour, bitter, crunchy, soft, combination. It was the perfect balance and the preparation, seasonings, and execution were spot-on. Plate presentations were concise. I was very impressed. Unfortunately, the only downfall was dessert. We shared the Poached Apple with bacon ice cream, and langues de chat. The bacon ice cream was horrific. It tasted like they added liquid smoke to the anglaise and the smokiness took over, not a great way to end a memorable meal.  Lucky for them, the food prior was so good that they still get five stars in my book and I will definitely return!
