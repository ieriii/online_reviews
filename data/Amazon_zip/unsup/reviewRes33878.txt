Really, really great food for an even better price! I had the falafel which was amaaazing, and the lentil soup was pretty good as well. The place was busy but my three friends and I were able to find a booth without waiting. I also found the employees to be fast and actually quite friendly, contrary to some of the other reviews. Next time I'll be sure to check out the salad bar, as it seemed really fresh and had a ton of variety. Remember to bring cash!
