I like Sultan's a lot. Ton's of clearly labeled vegan choices. Spicy falafel and a spinach pie. Don't need to eat again all day. The pita's are great, the hummus is great, the falafel is the best in Chicago. They get you in and out and it is really cheap. 4 stars because they close too early and sometimes are out of things.
