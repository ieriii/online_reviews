So, we literally live on the same street as Caro Mio. We can always smell their food when our bedroom windows are open... and it always smells SO GOOD. Typically I do not prefer Italian, I can make pasta at home. I had heard rave reviews, though, of Caro Mio. Suggesting a date night on Friday night to my boyfriend we decided to just walk a few feet and try this place out. I had popped in earlier to ask whether or not we needed to make reservations (we were walking our dog at the time) and he told me no, they had "plenty of tables" (it's VERY small in there!)... We came back after walking the pup, and there were 2 parties of 10 in front of us. As I look around there are no longer ANY tables available. My boyfriend speaks to the manager, he tells him we live 1 minute away and would like to become regulars. We had stopped in and they told us not to worry about waiting/making a reservation. The man tells us that they do not take reservations (word to the wise, folks) and then pulls out a note pad with tons of 2 party "reservations" and claims they are "waiting for tables to open"... Isn't that a reservation? Whatever. SO, my BF being the persistent savior that he is talks him into letting us sit before the people on that list...(who were not physically there, they were on a call list). So - kudos to Caro Mio for listening to us, and letting us be seated ASAP... We brought wine, and ordered the bruschetta. (REALLY REALLY GOOD! fresh mozz! Loved it.) and then I got some kind of... tri colored shells with marinara and cheese. It was amazing. SO good, and a large enough portion that I ate it for lunch the next day (it was even better as a left over!)... Pricey, But I highly recommend - avoid the busy times though if you don't want to wait (there is no waiting area what so ever, so you will most likely wait outside) - friday nights, saturday nights... and parking is free along Wilson so that is a plus too.
