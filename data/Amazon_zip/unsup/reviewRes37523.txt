My brother and I stumbled upon Hopleaf in an effort to branch out of Lincoln Park/Lakeview and we were suprised at how lively the place was on a Sunday night. The bar and restaurant areas were completely packed, and we waited about 15 minutes to get a table (there is no place to stand and wait so we kept having to move around!) The menu was startling in it's lack of chicken entrees or appetizers. I found this a little puzzling but moved on. We ordered the smelts--which were excellent, and I had the shrimp salad sandwich. This was a disappointment, as basically the chef jammed a bunch of tiny prawns into a croissant with barely any kind of sauce or vegetable to go with it. Needless to say, the fries took up nearly 3/4 of the plate! The service was friendly, and our waitress recommended a good, light Belgian beer which I enjoyed. Hopleaf is worth a second visit, but I would order something different and probably only come on a weeknight.
