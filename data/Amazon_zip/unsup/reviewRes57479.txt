My husband and I visited Geja's cafe on Saturday, April 28,2012 it was my B-day. I made a reservation on 6:30pm and we where late for 18 min. Actually,we where there at 6:15pm, however we where looking for the parking for 25 minutes. The restaurant doesn't have any parking at all including valet. When we came in and I showed my Travelzoo coupon we where told that our table was given to somebody else,because we where late and we have to wait for a next available table. My husband and I spend one hour and fifteen minutes at the bar. However, at 8:15pm I saw three empty tables. I came to manager and he told me people are late, but they call and he is holding tables for them and I have to wait until 9:15pm just maybe somebody didn't show up. At that time my evening was already ruined and I asked manager why nobody told me about their policy at the time of reservation. The manager respond was the restaurant don't have to do it. Than I got mad, and was ready to walk out, the manager said the restaurant will pay for our two drinks( $7.00 each). I don't think it is enough for spoiled B-day and Saturday evening. I also sure it is happened because I showed my coupon and manager didn't want to accept it because it was busy Saturday night. Sorry, I can't review the food, I was not given a chance to try it.Alla
