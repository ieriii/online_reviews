This place is worth visiting, even if you're not staying to sleep. You can walk up and see the Red Lacquer room, admire the Sistine Chapel-esque architecture and have your picture taken by a gilded statue near the in-hotel bar. Apparently, it's the oldest standing hotel in North America, and every president since Ulysses S Grant has taken rest there. With help from my friend William Shatner (the Priceline Negotiator dontchaknow) I was able to bag a $250 hotel room for $75 a night, and subsequently upgraded (at an $18 a night charge) to a suite with two bathrooms, because we needed two beds as well. I can't vouch for the restaurant (since I am obviously a cheapskate), but the pool and hot tub were great, and never packed since they were tucked away on the 7th floor. And what other hotel is going to have an entire room for elevators? I would recommend this place if you're able to score a comparable deal, both because of the history and location (zoom into downtown Chicago and you'll find this at its epicenter), but couldn't in good conscience tell you to drop the retail price on a place where you're more or less paying for the legacy.
