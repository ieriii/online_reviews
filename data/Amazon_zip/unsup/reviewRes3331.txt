What a nice, new place to get fast eats! I believe they made this sandwich for me. Chicken, bleu cheese crumbles, bacon, spinach.... My god, the only thing missing is.... nope, nothing missing. Tastiness. Yes, I was a bit chicken (ha ha) for not getting something a bit more saucier. I'll just have to stop by again! (Oh yeah, and not write my reviews after a bottle of wine.) The boy got some sort of sandwich that was like a teriyaki Philly cheesesteak. Not my cup o' tea, but he loved it. Oh yes, and there were comments about the fries here. I really liked them. There wasn't too much salt on them (a la McDonalds) or too soggy (like most diners). I will DEFINITELY be back, especially after reading all the stuff about the Seoul Sassy.
