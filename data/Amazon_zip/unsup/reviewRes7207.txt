Underwhelming to disappointing. And definitely overpriced. $32 for an appetizer and entree takeout better be pretty solid. The $8.99 bruschetta was OK, nothing special to justify its costing double the one at Pasta Palazzo (which, btw, is a great place and the antithesis of Sapori in terms of value - really good food and quite inexpensive). The mushroom risotto was soupy and...how to put it...when I order a $20+ pasta dish I want it to have something exquisite about it. I have made better risotto myself, and I am no risotto expert. I vacillated on giving this place just one star but it's not flat out bad. If the bill was $16 I might even go back - not for the risotto but for decent bruschetta.
