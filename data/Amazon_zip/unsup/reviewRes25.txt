what can be said that hasn't already been said? dinner this past sunday was the most fun i've had in a while. from the moment we stepped out of the cab to the moment we got back in one after the 19 course meal, alinea carved out a complete sensory experience--every one of my sense were tickled and prodded to attention. you go for the experience, for the fun, to be amazed. there's no music playing in the background to drown out noise from the kitchen or conversations at nearby tables. there are no candles, tablecloth, or mini flower centerpieces on the table. it's just you, your dining companion, the staff, and the food. and that's all you need for the 4 hours. the food itself wasn't always perfect. certain dishes were overly salty (trio if lamb, razor clam), some didn't make sense (corn silk dish, sea salt foam on the otoro dish), but when it was good, it was some of the best and most creative food i've ever had (steelhead roe straw w/ peach, hot cold potato, black truffle dumpling explosion, watermelon snow w/ chili and tomato). again, have fun and be amazed. what's the point otherwise?
