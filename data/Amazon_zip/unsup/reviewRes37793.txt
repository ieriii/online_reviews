I must explain these three stars. No question their selection of beer is fine and the crowd that gathers around it is perfectly nice. But to qualify as a bar, particularly as a bar with a kitchen, you have to do something about food. Chicago is a home to many fine gastropubs. I am not expecting every pub to have fancy, creative food. Far from it. It is actually rather comforting to have a couple of beers with rather simple food. But that's exactly what the problem is. The food is just not good here. Salty, soggy, mushy, burnt, badly mixed flavors - you name it. It would have passed for food in a whole-in-the-wall pub with bad beer. But that does not seem to be the standard to which Hopleaf aspires. As it is, they are stuck between greatness and outright mediocrity. For the sake of the brew-lovers, I wish they did something to fix the kitchen.
