I have been here a few different times during the week. I love drinks, the decor, and the intimate vibe. Only thing that's holding me back from giving them 5 stars is my most recent trip there this past saturday. Everything was up to par. As normal our server (Laura) was wonderful! Very attentive and helpful. The one thing preventing me from ever returning on a Saturday is the fact that they were playing country music!!! Pop country on top of that! Way to ruin the mood and ambiance. Nothing brings the charm of a prohibition style speakeasy like... Taylor Swift?!
