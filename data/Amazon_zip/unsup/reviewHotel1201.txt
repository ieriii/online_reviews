I should preface this review that this hotel is very far from all of the touristy things in Chicago. While it's not too far from the museum campus, you'll have to cab it, especailly with little ones. The room was very large, bed was SUPER comfy, and had a great view of the lake and Soldiers Field (how cool!!) Everything was spotless, and service was spot on.
