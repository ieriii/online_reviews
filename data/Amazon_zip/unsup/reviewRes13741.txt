My sister-in-law brought me to this unassuming Cuban restaurant, and I'm sure glad she did! The food was fresh, the hot sauce spicy, and the empanadas were out of this world. The ropa vieja was the standout -- saucy, a little sweet, and exploding with awesome flavors. The beef and the chorizo are certainly recommended. For desert I had the cascos de guyaba. I guess I didn't believe the description of Guava shells with cream cheese and crackers... but that's what it was. Tasty guava pieces surrounding a fistfull of plain-ol' cream cheese, with saltines stuck into it. I can't say it was my favorite desert of all time, but there's something homey about it that I suppose would be compelling. All-in-all though, a great experience. Friendly, helpful servers. BYOB (we brought two beers and weren't charged a corkage fee), outdoors-indoors atmosphere, and awesome food.
