Loved this place. My only complaint was that sometimes we waited for a long time for cuts we requested especially the SHRIMP. The main waiter/manager was a little pushy on the upsale . . .wine, dessert, liquor of the gods . . . but my mom and I had a good time. The gauchos always gave us the cut we wanted RARE and were very friendly ... except that shrimp guy.
