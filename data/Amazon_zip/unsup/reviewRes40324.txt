i WISH people would know what Good Mexican food is.. THIS, is not it.. Not even when im Drunk. I think this is By far the worst mexican Establishment in the city, Sorry, but i hear people recommend this place and i cant help but wonder WHY? have you not ate Mexican anywhere else? is this your first taco? are you homeless? or is someone payingt you to say that? No Me gusta
