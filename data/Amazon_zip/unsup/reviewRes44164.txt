This is one of my favorite cages in Chicago. Their macaroons are amazing, and I know my macaroons!!! They make delicious pastries and coffee, and beautiful cakes (and offer wedding cake tastings!). The only drawback is the lack of room in the cafe for seating, and the constantly crowded lounge next door. But, for treats to go, it's perfect.
