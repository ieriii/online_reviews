AH-MAZING! L&E has definitely earned it's star. They do not take reservations, and is really small, so we arrived around 5:30 and were seated after 15 minutes, long enough to have a drink at the bar. Our waitress was excellent, helped us navigate through the menu and gave us great feedback on what we ordered. FAVES: scallops and duck rilletes. Also excellent: roasted marrow and foie gras. Good, but might have tried something else: meatballs. The polenta was perfectly creamy, but at the end of the day, a meatball is just a meatball. Dessert: Gruyere Donuts don't sound appetizing, but were soooo good. I highly recommend trying. The trifle was just ok. I WILL BE BACK! Next stop, brunch!
