In addition to good, affordable food, Wishbone has facilities for business meetings that really impress. The bar area doubles as secluded meeting space equipped with a professional projection system that accommodates laptop display, and a separate sound system just for the bar area.We used all the A/V equipment for a monthly creative artists (Second Tuesday every month) meeting and showed two movie shorts on the newly-installed system. The response was great!I highly recommend those who are looking for meeting space, especially morning meetings, seriously consider this easy-to-get-to North Side location
