Excellent food and lots of it too for the price. Saigon's Crepe was awesome! The server explained how to eat it properly and it tasted fantastic. The avacado wontons were wonderful as well. The main course (Ginger mahi mahi) was very good, a little dry for my taste but very good none the less. It is a small place and they try to pack you in tight. I'm both big and tall and felt a little cramped. This is a byob establishment. They do provide an icer if you need one. Excellent service, friendly staff, they are ontop of clearing plates and making sure you have everything you need. This place was a great find, inexpensive, and great food.
