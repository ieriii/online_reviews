Great low- lit atmosphere. Experienced and talented bartender. I would suggest this place for a special occasion or if you want to make an impression on a first date. The "Edgar Allen Poe" chairs are comfortable and the place looks whimsical with a kind of French flair to it. Staff is friendly but not bothersome. Enjoy .
