The Millenium Knickerbocker Hotel just refused to change or cancel my reservation for this evening even though I have the flu (and someone in my class was diagnosed with the swine flu). I'm a low risk person (30 y/o) for complications from swine flu, so I'm not really concerned for my own safety. I don't plan on leaving the house (to go the a doctor's office or hospital) for fear of getting others sick, but I am amazed at how irresponsible the Millenium Knickerbocker Hotel could be to not issue a refund or change my reservation. One would think the hotel industry would be especially sensitive to getting their customers sick with the swine flu. Hopefully the Knickerbocker is just an abhorrent exception.
