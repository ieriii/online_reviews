Easy to make a last minute reservation online. However, in the future I would call to reserve - OpenTable forced me to go in at 6:15pm, only to find the dining room less than half empty at 6:30pm. I was most excited by the drinks. Pink Flamingo w/ Campari, brandy, grapefruit, egg white was one of - if not THE - best mixed drink I've had. Everything else was pretty good.
