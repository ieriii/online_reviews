Good pan pizza, period. The very tip of the crust is burned, and I actually really like it that way. I can see how others wouldn't though. Good mix of doughy, yet kind-of dry crust, sweet sauce, good smattering of toppings, and light cheese. I can't stand pizza too heavy on cheese. Got take out. The girl at the counter was super nice. Our pizza was ready when we walked in, and fresh and hot! It's very reasonably priced also. Yay for Pequod's! They're a refreshing change to always eating at Lou's, Gino's, etc.
