I've seen a few recent low quality reviews for Brazzaz, but my Chicago restaurant week experience was nothing but great. My husband and I had 6PM reservations yesterday and we were seated right away. The server was a gentlemen but a little too in-your-face if you're the standoffish type like me. His humor was also odd - he doesn't have the right delivery. We had never been to Brazzaz and didn't realize that we get to eat all the meat we want, so we asked how it worked for restaurant week. He says, "You pay double." I thought I had heard him wrong, so he repeated himself and I gave a puzzled look to the husband. A long 10 seconds later the server finally admits it was a joke. Hardy-har-har. Leave your comedy act at home. The salad bar was superb. Every single option was delicious, and there were so many things to choose from! Goat cheese, roasted corn salad, Brazilian potato salad, roasted squash and zucchini, fresh tomato slices with mozzarella, shrimp salad, fresh salmon, cheese tortellini, and my fav mushroom risotto. Oh yeah, and salad greens. 'As if that weren't enough, they brought tapas-sized appetizers to the table: warm cheesy bread, fried bananas, creamy spinach dip, garlic mashed potatoes, black beans, and white rice. And now the meat. The coin concept is great: black side means leave me alone, and they do; orange side means "feed me". I don't eat red meat, but I got my share of shrimp and chicken. The shrimp was excellent and seasoned just right. The chicken legs were very tasty and the chicken breast wrapped in bacon had a good smoky flavor. The red meat and shrimp came around early and often, but we didn't see much of the chicken. Later in our meal we requested the chicken breast wrapped in bacon and it was at our table in less than 10 minutes. I thought I would bust a gut after all that, but the meal also came with dessert. I had the carmelized flan - as good as it gets. Overall excellent experience. I wish the meal was priced at $32 year-round!
