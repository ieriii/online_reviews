the 50 fifty. the bar? standard. locals hanging out. drinking beers. i dont ever say much about the patrons of an establishment because i feel that has NOTHING to do with the business. since i work in the service industry, i cant see my business being judged by the people who happen to be in the studio on any given day. so on that note, anybody who is bitching and complaining about the "douchebags," "lincoln park assholes," "hipsters," "rap fans," "gangsters," "punkers," or whatever else these people can come up with should just screw right off. one thing to remember about reading a review on a business. when ever you see poor reviews, you need to actually READ the review. mostly the bad reviews are from miserable people who work some crap desk job in some crap office. they never have to worry about a yelp reviewing their business because nobody gives a flying fat f#$k about their job and in reality, them. so on with the review. first off, let me say that the owners of this place are a class act. they are respectful, generous, and extremely nice. especially to deal with. i cant say anything other than every time i have ever had any dealings with them i have been treated as close to royalty as possible. on to the REAL reason why i am writing this review. the food. its a breath of fresh air to get good food in a "bar." this place kills it. if i were to describe this place i would have to say its a restaurant that serves alcohol. yes the food is STELLAR. every time i have been able to enjoy a meal from here its been great. the food is always TASTY. thats one of those things i look for in food. taste is important. dont ya think? so, if you want TASTY food from QUALITY people, i dont think you can go wrong with the fifty/50. its simple. its fast. its good. what more do you want? get there.
