Francesca's is like a good friend - always there when you need it for a good Italian meal. I've been going here for years and have yet to be disappointed with the food or service here. I think you have to take it as a given that you are going to cramped and on top of the nearest table in this cozy place, but I'd say that's part of the charm to it. That is, of course, unless you get seated upstairs where there is much more arm room and it's a quieter atmosphere. Last night a group of us dined here. We had two bottles of wine - both recommended by our server and they were reasonably priced (for restaurant wine...) and complimented our meals well. We had the mussels in a red broth for an appetizer - which was good. I'm so used to always having mussels in a wine or garlic sauce that this was a nice change. We shared a capresi salad and prosciutto which were also done well - the capresi having blue cheese instead of the typical mozzarella. Everyone enjoyed their dinners, one sausage and mushroom pizza, chicken with mushroom and prosciutto, and two of the pasta dishes. All were cooked well and very flavorful. We capped off the night with tiramisu and the warm banana bread with gelato. The tiramisu here is excellent - light and tasty but the warm banana bread dessert was outstanding! As usual another great dinner here!
