This place is really cool. We went last night and sat on the back patio which was super nice.. The chef (i think) came over and was really kind, and explained all the food and made suggestions... The food was perfect, the fish and sauces melded together and the tofu steak was an excellent vegetarian/vegan option that more restaurants should take up. I like how simple the food is, exquisite yet not trying to be too crazy... The helping were quite large I thought which was great for sharing. The price fixe is awesome, and since it's BYOB - you leave feeling full and with some change to go have more drinks elsewhere (hehee). I can not wait to go back for brunch!! I honestly debated even writing a review, because it was so nice and Not crowded and I like how it seems like a hidden gem...now the word is getting out... but good for them!!
