Bim Bim Bop is ok.... not the greatest or worst I've had. Their fried chicken is pretty good. Actually compares to the Korean style fried chicken I've had in Seoul.  This stuff is some of the best I've found in Chicago. Wife like's their seoul sassy. I'm a fan of the original. It's great. Place is clean and the workers are friendly. Parking is a little tight
