my new favorite neighborhood place... When I moved to South Loop, there was not a single decent restaurant. About 2 yrs ago, I said that I would be satisfied if we could get a tapas joint. Well, we got more than a tapas "joint" in Mercat de la Planxa. This is a hot spot. The food is tasty, beautifully presented. I have had to fight my urge to lick my plate on more than one occasion. Desserts are a MUST! A pitcher of sangria goes a lot further than you'd expect here. The restaurant is pretty & you have a great view of one of the prettier parts of Grant Park. The only drawback is that, on occasion, my waitresses have been less than stellar.
