Love. One of my favorite places in the city. I'm fortunate to live so close. Patio is unbeatable and so is the food. I especially enjoyed the wonderful fresh bread w/ thick, sweet balsamic vinegar and the special dessert treat our waiter brought for my birthday. Perfectly romantic, but also good for a work dinner.
