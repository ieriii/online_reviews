I'll admit that the first time I was taken here, I might have had a little to drink beforehand. I had what I thought was the best burrito EVER. I returned a few weeks later for lunch dead sober and confirmed my rose-colored perceptions from before. Ignore the grime and just EAT! You'll be back for more carne asada!
