Very nice. The bi-bim-bap (Original Bad Buddha Bowl) renditions were good, but the crispy chickens were better. Portions are pretty darn big, so I recommend sharing for some people. Went with my sister and we probably would have been better off sharing one serving of 5-crispy chickens with the seoul sauce and one order of the original buddha bowl. Not greasy and quick service. If I lived closer by, I'd probably hit this up more frequently.
