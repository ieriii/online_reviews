Extensive selection of tasty homemade pastas, and BYOB is always a plus. Service was friendly but not very efficient (conspicuously slow to bring out bread and to open our bottle of wine). Even so, I would like to return to try some of the other menu selections. Good stuff. Prices seem a couple of dollars too high per entree, but I suppose you pay a little extra for the handmade pasta. As an aside, I'm not sure if the AC was off and/or broken during our visit, but the place was hotter than Hades.
