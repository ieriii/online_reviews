Cashed some points out and got 2 nights at Doubletree MM. New flat screen HDTV in our room (21st floor being a Hilton Honors floor). We got a "special needs room".....you can tell as these rooms have no bathtub just a straight walk in shower. Also there are 2 "peep holes" in the door. One for standing folks and an additional peep hole for folks in wheel chairs. Did not eat here but did avail ourselves of the Einstein Bagels. Those $4.50 frozen drinks tasted good. The pool has some nice views: Hancock, Trump, Tribune Tower and that really cool blue top building that I never remember the name of. Great location. Michigan Avenue is 2 blocks away. Navy Pier is 15 minute walk. The only downside was no hot water the first day we were here....quickly fixed by maintenance. Overall a good experience.
