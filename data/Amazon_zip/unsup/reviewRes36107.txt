I located Meli Cafe using Yelp's proximity search from my hotel. It sounded great according to reviews, everyone in our group was craving brunch, and it was less than two blocks away. Perfect plan. Despite reviews indicating that it was always busy, I was still surprised to see the place hopping when we got there around 1pm. It was a busy, but not stressed or frenetic, environment and the staff was promptly attentive and thorough (noticing our baby, asked if we needed a high chair, for example, and then had it at the table before we even got there). The service was superb throughout our visit. Espresso drinks were perfect and our food was at the table before we had time to sip past the expertly developed froth. The menu is extensive and accommodating to many different tastes, dietary needs and lifestyle choices. I ended up winning in a fight against my impulses to order something with bacon and sauce. My arteries may be slightly happier that I settled on the Farmland Skillet: sauteed spinach, portobello, zucchini and tomato, topped with havarti cheese (thus the "slightly" qualifier above). My wife got the vegetarian benedict and my mother got some kind of meat, cheese and potato scramble. Everyone loved their choices except for me. Perhaps I shouldn't have ordered something I didn't have my heart set on (vague pun intended), so I won't blame Meli Cafe for what I thought was a relatively bland scramble. What I really had a problem with, and the only thing that keeps me from giving this rockin cafe five stars, is that my skillet was actually burnt in some places. I mean, it was crispy-charcoal-charred. But only some bites. I might have complained if I had actually liked the dish in the first place. I'm sure they would have done something for me. Can't wait to return and explore other parts of the menu!
