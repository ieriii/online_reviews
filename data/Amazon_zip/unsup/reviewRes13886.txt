"Good, but not awesome," my friend said as we left. And it's true, there was nothing wrong with this place. The beer was good, the food was (reportedly) good, and the atmosphere was pleasant. (Although they maybe got a little heavy handed with the fisty revolution motif.) The only real standout here was the service. Our waitress was great: attentive but not overly so, well-informed about the beer and the food menus and laughed patiently at our sad math/computer nerd jokes. (And really, that last part's all I look for in a server.) But would I bother going back? Eh. Life's too short to drink boring beer. So... if I was randomly stuck in Logan Square and wanted a quick beer at a sort of fancy place... sure, I'd go back. (But this assumes that there isn't the one hour wait that other reviewers have reported. If you've got an hour to spend waiting in line for something, you should wisely spend it on Kuma's.)
