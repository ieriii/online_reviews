If you need your healthy vegetable fix, you can get it here, and the local organic produce makes it so delicious. I wanted to eat here again, and when I asked my son to join me he said "Mom, I really need some vegetables." He was remembering our Mardi Gras pigout and thought I wanted another session at the trough... : ) Well, we both had great salads, mine a Blackened Chicken with gluten free cornbread and his a fried chicken salad with cucumber, blue cheese, and yummy pickled onions. Very very good, and excellent coffee too.
