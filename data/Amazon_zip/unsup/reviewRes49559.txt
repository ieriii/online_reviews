I really enjoyed my visit here. Native Californian, first time in Chicago was not prepared for the wind factor (as many times as I was warned) and stumbled into Bin 36 for cover. Pleasantly surprised and took to it immediately. We arrived before work let out so easily found a spot at the bar, order ourselves a couple flights, cheese and made a late afternoon of it before meeting our friends. Presentation was great, informative layout for flight tasting, the environment was modern, clean, warm and inviting. I plan on revisiting our next trip out. Location was nice along the river and found myself lingering after the bill was settled to check out the wines around the place. This is my kind of place and recommend for sure!
