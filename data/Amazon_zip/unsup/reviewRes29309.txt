Greasy, fried, indulgent, vegan goodness! Would love to try again, as it was very hard to pick one dinner. I had the buffalo wings, a peanut butter cookie dough shake and the country fried steak. ALL AMAZING. Our waiter was the nicest, young boy, ever. The joint is pretty small and got ultra busy as we were leaving. Really amazing feeling, knowing this place is in the world. Extra points for the organic ketchup on the tables. Vegetable/fruit detox time.
