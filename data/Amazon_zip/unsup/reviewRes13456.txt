This is my probably my favorite Logan Square standard. Great food. Great beer. Typical prices. When it's not super busy this place can't be beat. I love the chicken sandwich. It has some sort of aioli or something on it that's just to die for. The pulled pork is in the top 3 best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had. That's really saying something. Best nosh in the city? Bacon fat popcorn. $4 gets you one awesomely tasty treat with cheese shred so thin it just melts in your mouth and bacon that's well... really good bacon. Even by bacon standards. As for beer, well, let's face it, everyone has different tastes. I'm big on IPA's and LOVE the Anti-Hero. Bonus points for the Star Wars reference! Also the Patty Wagon, the Revolution answer to Guinness is better than Guinness. No question in my mind at all. And by the way, if you join the 'party' you get your first growler free. If you buy 9 your 10th is free and you get a free beer on your birthday. There's other stuff too but I've never bothered to show my card to drink out of a party member mug. Ah well. I think it's worth joining if you dig the beer here!
