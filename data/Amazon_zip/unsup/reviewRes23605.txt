i first took my mom, visiting from out of town, to greek islands after seeing it on $40 a day with rachael ray, and i've never tried anything else in greektown since. the food and the experience is truly enjoyable. i recently went to a dinner hosted in one of greek island's private rooms, and everything was spectacular -- from the service, to the drinks, to the pre-set greek feast they delivered us family style. the waiters were perfectly attentive and the food came out in an organized, timely and well-paced manner. i highly recommend this place, especially for special occasions and big groups. opa!
