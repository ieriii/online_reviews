MI was excited to go here because I had heard great things about the lobster so we went hoping that it was a place to have a nice dinner . We had called ahead to see if they could fit us in and they said they had plenty of seating and she would put our names on their list , when we got there person in the front said our names were not on the list and gave my husband a dirty look. He said to follow him and he lead us towards the back of the restaurant and then he said it was a short cut he took us though the back kitchen and server area , there was plenty of free tables. But he left us next to the waiters serving area and sat us next to the kitchen and serving area I was upset that there was so much space and the person sitting us decided that was a good place to sit us my husband is a proffesor and I work in sales we where both dressed nicely. I don't understand why we were treated so poorly . Once we received our meals they were tasty but once my husband was finishes both of our plates were removed emidiately (I wasn't done eating) I was fuming by then I had ordered lobster and my husband some angel hair pasta with shrimp the food was just ok the service was horrible.I am sad to say it was supposed to be a nice dinner but by the time I was done all I wanted to do was to get out of there .I don't recomend this place .
