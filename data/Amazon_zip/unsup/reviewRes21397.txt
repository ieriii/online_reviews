Confession: I've never been to a drive-in. I honestly do not know why, but surely it was not intentional. The concept is so ridiculously simple and awesome that it quickly approaches novel with little effort. A drive through where I can sit and eat my food? Genius. SO last night I enjoyed my first Prom, and today I went to eat hot dogs at the drive-in. Call me nostalgic, I'm on a frickin' roll this weekend. ;) A nice little Sunday drive, and here I find myself randomly near the intersection of Milwaukee/Devon/Nagle...a little place I like to refer to as "where!?" Oh wait, it's where Superdawg is planted. Home of the big dancing hot dog statues. A manly one dressed in WWF gear and flexing his meaty muscles, and his female counterpart in a skirt get-up looking timid and shy. Stereotypes aside, pretty funny with the demonic red flashing eyes. Let's eat! The menu is simple, yet funny. I mean...tamales? battered vegetables? Yep, both. Cheeseball names. Gluttony can be funny, I tell ya. I opt for the Superdawg with fries (super, as well as it turns out) and though it was a bit crammed into the kitschy little box, I dug it. A sinful amount of Diet Coke to wash it down and split a chocolate malt. mmmmmm. Good shizzzz, my dears. I want to go back on a summer night...crusin' the gut, ending up at the drive-in. It made me happy to sit there. Now just need to find someone with a convertible...
