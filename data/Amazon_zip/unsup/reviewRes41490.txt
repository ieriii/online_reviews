This place would make skeptics cringe. Food is good. Their broth is authentic pho. The beef that goes with the bun is so tasty. They have Yang Chow fried rice and they have chinese sausage with it which; makes it so authentic. This is a good place for vietnamese food. It is reasonably priced and they have good service. I am going back.
