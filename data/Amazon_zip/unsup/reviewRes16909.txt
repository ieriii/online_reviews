India House is a great place to go and enjoy fine Indian food. For a person who is not too well versed in Indian food I would say the fair was quite enjoyable. They have a great selection to choose from and my friends who were with me were able to guide me towards some items I really liked. The portions are big and I would suggest getting some bread to go with all the great curries and sauces the food is prepared with. I'd definitely go back, and now that I have had a taste I am excited to try more dishes either here, or on Devon in the future. The restaurant had an enjoyable atmosphere and the presentation of the food was great. Our waitstaff constantly brought us more beer or water and we had a great feast.
