I LOVE this place. I would have given them 5 stars but....My 1st time here...I didn't know what to expect. The ambiance is serious. MY waiter was so very RUDE. Maybe he was being overworked but I shouldn't know or sense this... The food is awesome and I haven't had a bad experience since/but I also I haven't had him either...Shrug*
