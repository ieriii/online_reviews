I've eaten here 3 times total (on 3 separate days) and my final rating of 3 stars is explained below. First visit -- Brunch -- Total fan, 5 stars, loved it. I believe I had the shrimp with dirty rice. I liked how they served the whole shrimp with head intact, which is the best part in my opinion. Raved about this restaurant to everyone I knew. I may have mentioned it to my one of my patients as well.. ("Yeah, pork belly won't hurt your ridiculously high cholesterol. Eat it!") Second visit -- Dinner -- I felt like an oinker trapped in the stable booth. Cool. My party ordered a bunch of things. Most of it was pretty good. I was disappointed they were out of a few items on the menu. The pork chop I ordered had a good char, but underneath that layer was mostly fat and some tender flavorful meat. Sad surprise. We also ordered all of their desserts. Yay for Waffles! Third visit -- Brunch -- Made reservations for my Mom's birthday, party of 4. The restaurant was half empty and they sit us at the bar at the very end where the staff walks in and out. Seriously dude? Unhappy with our seating I asked the hostess if we could sit at an OPEN table and she replies with Nope, don't want to overwhelm our servers who already have big parties. Uh, not my fault if you have poor planning! We decided to take this up with the manager who then kindly sat us at an oinker stable booth. She also made it up by serving us some baked goods to go with our coffee and even gave my mom a new Publican piggy clothe napkin for her bday. Despite our better seating, it put a damper on my meal, which to be honest wasnt as good as the first or second time. Conclusion 3 stars.
