Glenn's was a very tasty experience! A friend and I decided to give it a try recently and it was hoppin on a random Wednesday night. They've got a pretty solid beer selection as well as other drinks to suit your taste. I really am kinda kicking myself after reading other people's reviews because I was this | | close to getting the clam chowder! I did however get the salmon which was very nicely and lightly encrusted and spiced. The potatoes and asparagus were quite nicely prepared as well. I'm looking forward to going back because I have a feeling the clam chowder may bump this to a 5 star review...
