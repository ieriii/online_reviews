I thought that I would never find a vindaloo in the US to rival the skin-melting, eye-watering curries that I had in London. But India House set me straight. Chicken vindaloo was super-spicy, but complexly flavored, and the Kashmiri lamb kofta was so interesting and in a delicious sauce. Vegetable samosas also were fantastic, in a crust that was soft and rich--not like the thin, greasy samosas that you can get out of a box or a deep fryer. Only drawback is that India House is a bit pricey compared to other Indian restaurants--probably would not have gone without a Groupon--but definitely a superb dinner!
