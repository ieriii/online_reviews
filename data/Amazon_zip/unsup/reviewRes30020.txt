As an omnivore, it's not often that I can feel full (or even close to satiated) after eating a vegetarian meal. Chicago Diner isn't just a gimmick - it's the real deal! Real diner food, with real diner portions, made vegetarian. Not only is the food delicious, but it fills you up with the same sense of comfort that you can only get from a greasy spoon. A great place to check out with friends, vegetarian or otherwise.
