I vote "eh." Really nothing special, and too many damn kids. Salad bar was really good, but I thought it was kind of expensive when you added it on to a burger meal that was already $10--I think adding the salad bar to a meal was $6, making a burger, chips, and side salad a wee bit overpriced in my opinion for a restaurant like this. The chocolate malt was good...but once again, not great. "Eh" is my final word.
