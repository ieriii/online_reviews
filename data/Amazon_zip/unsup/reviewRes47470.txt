Jeez, where to start on the general disappointment I felt walking in and leaving here. 1. Sat at the bar for 7 or 8 minutes without anyone so much as acknowledging me. Even after that, service was nearly indifferent. The staff was def more interested in chatting among themselves and the manager. 2. Ordered burger medium...came out well done. Although the flavors were good, I knew it was gonna be overcooked because it took about 20 min...with hardly anyone in the place. And served in a pie tin?? 3. Place was only about 10 degrees cooler than the 90-degree temps outside!! 4. Thankfully, it was half-price Mondays, so worth a shot, but I sure as heck will not be going back.
