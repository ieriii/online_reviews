Graham Elliot was alright. The atmosphere was pretty good. The food was okay. I am not sure whether the restaurant is embracing a kitschy theme as evidenced by the gourmet popcorn instead of bread. But, it's definitely different. The service was good. Although I suspect everyone will have a different experience depending upon the server. I didn't really enjoy the port wine recommendation with dessert though. The food was okay. I wasn't blown away with the different food arrangements. I didn't think it was bad, but I wasn't really impressed. I am not a food critic. My palate isn't strong enough to judge the food well, but I just wasn't blown away like other fine dining establishments. I didn't think the menu was all that pricey. I thought it was reasonable for being a fine dining establishment. We did have the server match our entrees, which was fine except for the port wine I mentioned earlier. I would base my recommendation on the type of friend asking me whether he/she should try Graham Elliot. If he/she was on a tight budget looking for a special occasion restaurant, then I would definitely pass on Graham Elliot. If he/she is a frequent fine diner, then I would say try Graham Elliot for the experience. Don't expect trumpets to sound while eating.
