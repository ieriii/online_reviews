The best Chicago style pizza I ever had! This pizza is worth 5 Stars! I probably need to try the delivery to take my rating to 5, because the restaurant is small, not very comfortable, and not conveniently located (compared to the other Chicago pizza places that have L stops nearby). Given the quality of the pie, it is a must-try no matter what!
