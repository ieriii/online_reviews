Waited a while before being seated, but the meal was worth it! I had veggie skillet, which was delicious.  My friend had the nutella crepes. Everything was delicious!! Decent prices. Food came quickly but they forgot to bring toast out with meal, and didn't until I had reminded them. Other than the delay in bringing the toast out, it was perfect. Portions were huge, and I couldn't finish what was served.
