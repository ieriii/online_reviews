Graham Elliot had been on my list for a while but for whatever reason it always got pushed back. Overall, about what I expected. The atmosphere is pretty laid back while giving the appearance of a nicer restaurant. Probably more a commentary on the friendly staff and their easy-going approach, which are always welcome. As for dinner, the portions and shorter menu were done well. I had the Waygu beef which was decent and prepared expertly. Not the greatest steak ever, but served with a potato confit and a foie consomme that went together smoothly. Well balanced, and not a massive honkin' plate to stuff you before attempting dessert. Wifey enjoyed the white fish (local-ish from Michigan I think?), which is a new addition to their Spring menu apparently. Had a bite, thumbs up if you can still find it. One thing that fell flat in our humble opinion were the foie gras lollipops with pop rocks, a 'signature app' that our waiter recommended. I tried to come up with an analogy, but the closest thing I landed on was imagine a half stick of butter sprinkled with crunchy candy. The fat delivery system was served cold, and was too rich in a couple of bites to really enjoy. Think I had a minor coronary after my second bite, which if it had tasted good may have been OK. I vote 'pass' on that science experiment. The saving grace was naturally the popcorn, which on our night was a truffled variety. Ours was tapdancing in truffle oil and shavings - really, really good. Almost forgot the drinkity-drinks. Before dinner, I tried the Smoke Monster, which lived up its name. Nice Dharma reference, can't go wrong there. Ask yourself, "Do I like the option of 'smoked' when I order anything?". If the answer is yes, give this one a shot. My value equation came out a bit light, but still OK. I think I'll be back when the menu flips, but can't say I'll be in a rush. STILL, worth a visit in my opinion.
