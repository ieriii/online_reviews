Yes it's owned by one of the Iron Chefs Jose Garces, and yes it's a big, trendy and sexy place. More importantly, the tapas are good. I ordered 3 plates for myself for dinner and they were the perfect amount. -Sizzling garlic shrimp: Fantastic. A must. -Bacon-wrapped dates: Not my favorite but interesting and worth a try. -Butter squash dumplings: Nice and filling. -Sangria: Uh, how can you not enjoy it with your tapas? My waitress was friendly, and overall I had a great time here. Recommended.
