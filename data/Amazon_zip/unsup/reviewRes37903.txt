I'm not that big of a beer drinker, but I sure do like to go to HopLeaf for there amazing selection of beers. It doesn't matter if you prefer wheats, ales, porters or whatever, then HopLeaf with have it. All the drinks come in speific glasses as well as a great taste. The bar is convinently located near the Foster 92 Bus and the Clark 22 Bus intersection in Andersonville. There's both a front bar area with bar seating and table seating as well as a back dinning area. Get there early or prepare to wait for some time. I would suggest eating the bucket of mussels. I hate mussels that are not fresh. Hopleaf has the freshest mussels that I have found in Chicago's reasonable priced restaurants. Now, I want to go back and have them again. Lol. So, enjoy your time at Hopleaf and above all. Have Fun!!!
