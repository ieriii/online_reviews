This place is fantastic. The interior is stylish, unique, and romantic. The menu is original and refreshing. Everything we tried was great. It gets a little too LOUD starting early, even on weekdays. I found myself dreaming about the hanging tapestries on the walls to help keep it down. Also the trendy dance music was kind of cheesy, too, and just added to the noise. Other than that, this is a wonderful restaurant with style and great service.
