Picture this... Its 43 degrees out, a soft mist of rain is constantly falling from the sky and I'm standing in line, outside, getting wet and freezing my Miami Ass off for over an hour. What for you may ask? For Doug's encased meat of course, and I would do it again without question.  My sister took me here about a year ago on when I was visiting and on my recent trip there was no question I had to go back. Nothing would stand in my way, not 43 degree weather nor the rain. Here is a quick rundown of what we had. Alligator -- 5 Stars Wild Boar -- 5 Stars Linguisa -- 5 Stars Cord dog 10 Stars (yes out of 5) Duck fat Fries -- A must try dipped in cheese sauce even better The solitary issue I have about Hot Doug's is that ever since my last visit my girlfriend will not stop talking about Doug's encased meat..
