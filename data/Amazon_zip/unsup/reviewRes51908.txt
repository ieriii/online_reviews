Unbelievably good pizza at Gino's East. I think it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life, and I've eaten a lotta pie! So I'm not a Chicago local, I was just visiting on a conference and Gino's came highly recommended from a Chicago ex-pat living near me in California. I can't claim to be any kind of deep-dish connosieur, but I know what I like and this definitely fits the bill. Everything from the crust, the sauce, the toppings was just right. Just the right combo of saltiness, sweetness, heat, and creaminess (cheesiness?) to make for an unforgettable pizza. Very affordable, too, and served in a fun, lively atmosphere that feels like an experience. Okay, so maybe it's busy and a bit commercialized and maybe the service isn't the finest, but the finished product is terrific. The place is an institution. Enjoy!
