I have been looking for a cheap Korean restaurant with good rice bowls for the past three years and finally found it! I went here last Friday with a group of friends after reading reviews on Yelp. AWESOME CHOICE. The place was a bit small (we had eight people) so we had to wait about ten minutes to get a table we could all sit at but there was plenty of seating at the counters along the wall and by the window. Overall not too long of a wait especially on a Saturday night. There's no waiter service so you have to go up to the counter to order and pay. When your food is ready, they call your name and you go up and get it. However they do clean up the table for you after you're done so you don't have to worry about where to bring your stuff after. I got a Baby Buddha Bowl with beef (comes with four veggies and a fried egg), my bf got an Original Buddha Bowl with beef (comes with eight different veggies and a fried egg) and we split a five piece order of wings (Seoul Sassy and Korean BBQ). Our order came out to about $25 ($7 for baby buddha, $9 for original buddha and $7 for 5 piece wing order)which is relatively cheap compared to other korean restaurants and we had a ton of leftovers!  I didn't particulary care for the Korean BBQ wings but the Seoul Sassy wings were the best wings I have ever tasted in my life! Great Seas on Lawrence and Kedzie used to be my go-to-place for korean wings but I think the wings at Crisp far surpass it! Theyre oh so deliciously crisp and flavorful! And there was nothing "baby" about the Baby Buddha Bowl...I was starving when I got there but I didn't even come close to finishing it. I wish this place was close enough for delivery.....but its good enough for me to make the 15 minute drive from andersonville at least once or twice a week. Overall good choice for cheap korean food thats GOOD :)
