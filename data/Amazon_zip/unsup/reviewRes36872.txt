LOVE this place. One of my favorites in Chicago. I have eaten here so many times (it's near my work) and so had to write a review - i have loved every single thing i have tried on the menu and that is saying a lot! The breakfast, lunch, breakfast for lunch - it's all fantastic. you'll get a good line on the weekend, but it's worth the wait....and you get HUGE portions which is always a plus :) I love the strawberry salad, and lately I have been a fan of the paninis. And they are always super quick, which is great especially during the lunch hour, so even if you have to wait you get out in enough time to make it back to work. The only bad thing is the wait on weekends, it is ridiculous (but worth it!)!!
