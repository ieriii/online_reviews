I was really looking forward to the experience given the variety of pizzas, the thin crust, and a good coupon. We came in, placed an order, were told it would be about 35 minutes...we stepped outside to wait since the joint is small and crowded...we returned basically on time to find that our pizzas had not even been started...so we had to sit there and wait as three different people tried to put our order together...continually asking what was supposed to go on x pie...we were sitting at the bar stools opposite the oven were able to see the process, e.g., they did not wash the basil and arugula (from a new plastic box) before putting it on one of our pizzas. Once they placed the arugula and the strangely thickly cut prosciutto on one pizzas they did not return the pie into the oven for a quick minute or two. Our four cheese pizza left us feeling less than 100% the next day. It was a strange experience - we seemed to be neglected and it seemed that our pizzas were not put together in a pro manner. I wanted to love this place but I don't trust it enough to go back. The guys were generally friendly and to some extent evidently tried to do a good job, and the pizza crust was nice and thin...but I still have my reservations.
