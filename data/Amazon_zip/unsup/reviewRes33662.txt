If I could do 3 3/4 stars I would- can't so they get 4:) I definately feel like I always get my moneys worth here, especially if I am dining in. The portions are HUGE and the service is SUPER fast- plus the food is pretty scrumptious. The California omelet(tons of avocado-YUM but watch out-it's garlicky!) and Mediterranean omelet(spinach, tomatoes, feta) are my favorites, plus the potato pancakes and the banana nut french toast are awesome too. And oh yeah, their salads are great. My only complaint is what in the world do they use for Syrup??? I would be scared to read the ingredient list on it-trust me, I have asked, there is nothing natural about it--and it's like orange! But other than the syrup, this place is great- you have the fun different stuff and the basics- Yolk pretty much covers it all.
