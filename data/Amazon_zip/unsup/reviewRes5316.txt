I frequent Chicago often , at least once a month if not more often. I was daring myself to go to the Purple Pig, despite the small seating area and feeling somewhat intimidated about being in a "trendy" Chicago restaurant. Well, I dove right in and I so did not regret it. The waitstaff could not have been friendlier and because it is such close quarters with your fellow diners, they were just as friendly. On to the food, I had the calimari appetizer (not your usual batter dipped ) it was fantastic. I ordered a lovely red wine with the assistance of the waitress, then the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes.... OMG, awesome... I felt like a grown woman. The prices aren't prohibitive as well. Will be going back this weekend!
