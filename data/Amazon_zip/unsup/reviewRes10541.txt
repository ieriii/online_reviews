I dined there recently, during the cold snap, and missed the alfresco experience that television reviews had greatly reinforced of my sister's glowing report on this establishment's atmopshere. Not to worry, we ate in the 'tent' that transitions from inside to the garden whose allure will keep for another visit. The food was so good that being somewhat indoors did not spoil anything. I started with the beet salad. It was an excellent combination of earthy chunky beets, dressing and flavor notes of fennel and textural complexity from the cheese. Wow! My main course was the di Mare secondi course of fish, shellfish and garlicky toast points. I appreciated that the dish was not your typical 'frutti di mare' of shellfish and mussels atop a mound of pasta. My wife had the pear salad and a stellar preparation of halibut, an excellent firm white ocean fish. I regret I did not pay close enough attention to the wine, since I asked our waiter for a recommendation. It was excellent IGT dry white that he picked mindful of our request that a second mortgage not be required to settle up at the end of the meal. Service was very attentive until a bizarre group arrived and proceeded to spill their drinks on each other and the patio floor as they were being seated. The theater that party wrought actually made having to wait for after dinner coffee relatively pleasant.
