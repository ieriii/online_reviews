I long to get back to Hot Doug's, preferably on a Friday or Saturday so that I can try their duck fat fries. Anything with "duck" and "fat" in the name just seems irresistible. I'm having unnatural thoughts about them right now. But when I did get to Hot Doug's earlier this year, I was so impressed with their Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel selection. As a francophile who enjoys anything sounding remotely French, I had to try this heart attack on a bun. It was so good I wish I had ordered two. They will be closed December 24, 2010-January 4, 2011 so I'll have to find time to try it out before their vacation!!! Merry Christmas to me :)
