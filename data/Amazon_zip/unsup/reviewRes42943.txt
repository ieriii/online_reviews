Pick a day of the week and Art of Pizza will smack that ass with a glorious special, delivered fresh and to your front door. All of their pasta dishes come with soup, salad and bread and run anywhere from $3.95 to $6.95. The chicken parm on Wednesdays is the best, but you could find anything to suit your needs any day of the week. This isn't a place I would choose to dine in, but the carry out and delivery are top notch. It usually takes close to an hour, so order early enough. The pizza is great too, but I usually go for the pasta dishes first.
