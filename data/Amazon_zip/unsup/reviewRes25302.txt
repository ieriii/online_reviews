Well it's official I have a new favorite Chicago deep dish pizza and it's Pequods! Every place claims to have the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, but there can only be one winner and that winner is Pequods. I came here with my girlfriend and we got a deep dish pizza with sausage and giardiniera that was simply amazing. This place is well worth the wait and I guarantee you will not be disappointed in Pequods deep dish pizza!
