on the expensive side, but I have been here 3 times and have yet to have something disappointing. The dishes are flavourful and include a number of unsual ingredients and dishes found in few other restaurants. The appetizers can nearly be filling enough for a a lunch. The patio is nice, and the servers helpful. I love getting taken out here : )
