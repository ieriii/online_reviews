Come here for the pizza, that's where Pequods shines... Very crispy crust with melt-y cheese, and tons of toppings. Personally, i think the pizza is just a touch heavy on the sauce, but, not enough to deter me from coming here. There's usually always a wait, but you can grab a beer from the bar and watch whatever game is on until your name is called. Appetizers are your standard fried options, nothing spectacular. Like I said though, the pizza, makes it all worthwhile. During lunch time throughout the week, if you can, stop by. It's pretty quiet in there, and they offer fantastic lunch specials.
