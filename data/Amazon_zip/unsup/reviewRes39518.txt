I had brunch here last summer and left feeling not too impressed. I remember thinking, "really, does every single item need to have pork?" I also had a snooty waiter who did the thing where he condescendingly corrects everything you say as you order. Buy boy oh boy, am I glad I came back for dinner. I've actually eaten here twice in the past week. I've had the chance to try almost every cocktail on their current menu, and many of the food offerings. It makes me really happy that they've come up with some excellent winter cocktails. I happened to be there when they had truffles in house, and the kitchen prepared a fantasitc amuse bouche with beet, goat cheese, white truffle, and a couple other components I can't remember. It was so extremely good. All, ALL, of the dinner food I've had here has been really really good. The pigeon dish they're offering this season is so good that I had to pause mid-chew to savor my bite. Other things I've approvingly tasted lately include: roasted bone marrow, a lobster special (perfectly cooked!), scallop ravioli, sturgeon entree, olives, cheese plate, and I forget what else. The service this time around was also good. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. The only tiny thing, and it's a small thing that really irks me, is that the bussers were just too eager to take our plates away. IMO, as a rule, dishes shouldn't be removed until the entire table has finished with a course. Instead, they were hovering and waiting for the exact second when the plate could be removed. It really made every course seem rushed, even though the next course was not ready to arrive. Overall, the atmospehere makes this a nice place to sit, chat, and enjoy. The prices are a bit on the high side, but the value of what you receive is definitely worth it. I'm sure I'll be back the next time I'm in the mood for a little splurge in Logan.
