The only way you get better than this is to go down to Pilsen, or a state near the border, but after that is La Pasadita. My roommates and I went after hearing so much about the trio of taco tastiness on Ashland, and we were not disappointed. It was excellent for what it was. I had the mixed fajitas, my roommate had the carne asada super burrito, and my other roommate had the Guisado de Pollo. None of us left (1) hungry (2) disappointed or (3) broke. The problem with the fajitas and the burrito was that some of the meat was overly chewy, which is why this place does not get the fifth star. Otherwise, for what this place was, it was fantastic.  Warnings for those out there that may be reading this... (1) This is true to its hole-in-the-wall roots. Don't expect great table service if you dine in. The wait staff isn't rude by any means, but I rate with the character of the establishment in mind. (2) The Guisados are REALLY spicy, so the weak of tongue be warned. Also, the table salsas are spicy. The dark green salsa won't hit you for for about 10 seconds, but then once it does it coats and stays with you. If you love spicy, you will love the dark salsa. (3) If you like your tacos with the lettuce and cheese and such, order the super taco. This place does tacos the more authentic way if you order the cheap ones, so keep that in mind. (4) The Super Burrito is HUGE. Every man wants to eat it, and every man wants to be it. Plus it tastes great. (5) EDIT 12/11/07 - the super quesadilla I had wasn't all that great -- probably because they loaded it with lettuce, beans and rice. Wouldn't recommend this. The other stuff, indeed!
