I cant say anything about this awful hotel. My aunt bought a room on Orbitz so she could stay there after having important surgery. Her and her boyfriend were about to check in when the lady told them it wasn't time to check in when it said on their website they could. So they had to drive all the way to Naperville wiith my aunt screaming in pain. Plus, you have to use the crappy internet service they give you . You could only use it in the lobby which was always crowded because of that cause... I HATED IT!
