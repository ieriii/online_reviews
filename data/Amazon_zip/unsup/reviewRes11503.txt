The crust is nice and thin with a dust of cornmeal and you can pick whatever topping you want. I am not the biggest cheese lover so I love the plain pizza which only has red sauce with garlic and parmesan. cheese. If you are with picky people best place to go for lunch because they make the pizza individual size so you get what you want. I also like the goat cheese app too when I am waiting for my late friends.
