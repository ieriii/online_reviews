Similar to Fogo de Chao (they get the nod by the slightest margin), it's hard to say no to the guys walking around asking if you want their bottom sirloin. As others have said, you try to get your money's worth. I think it's much easier to get your money's worth at Brazzaz from the raw oysters they serve. Yum-my. Extra points for living next door and occasionally walking through the wrong set of doors.
