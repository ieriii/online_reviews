I am glad to have crossed this off my "Things to do while in Chicago" list! No reservations. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon =( Bad idea, unless you like 2 hr waits. I suggest coming after the rush like 3pm-5pm. The pizza was huge and super cheesy!! we got the stuffed supreme and i loved the tomato sauce on top. but unfortunately it didn't do it for me. I think I'm a die hard Zachary's fan (Berkeley, Ca). but I would most definitely come back here when I return to Chi-town.
