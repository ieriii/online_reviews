The bar in this place must be seen! The decor is authentic and flashy but the margaritas are all substance, no flash. They are on a different plane than the Gatorade and tequila they serve in much of Houston. I ordered a duck taco al carbon. The duck was cooked perfectly after being rolled in coffee to give it a nice earthy flavor. The tortillas were light corn that were doubled for strength. The guacamole was out of this world. For a Texan who thought "Mexican food sucks North of Denton", Frontera was an eye-opening expedience!
