Coast, I wanted to give you four stars, I really did but let me tell you why I didn't. The people that work there, including the managers, are rude. They have no problem asking you to leave when they need your table, they have no problem not honoring your reservation and making you wait 30 minutes even when you have one. They have no problem charging you for the other 3 pieces of rolls you didn't eat even when everybody else at the table didn't like it. Guess what? Everybody tried it, nobody liked it. Their BYOB "policy" is dumb - seriously, you're a restaurant, people sometimes sit and squat - that's just part of the biz, okay? Other than that, you do, for the most part, make pretty good sushi. My recos are the White Dragon of course, Crunchy Spicy Tuna, and pretty much everything else - except the Po Boy. The Po Boy just has too many things going on in it and it's not pleasant to eat. Don't eat it if you're out on a date! Apps - try the Hamachi Carparcio, so good! Desserts - mochi all the way! Don't get the fruit sticks. They are literally piceces of fruit with Hersey's dipping sauce. I mean, seriously, I can do that at home. Overall - you go there for the food, not the service.
