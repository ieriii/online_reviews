This is a case of high expectations + high prices + mediocre quality equaling disappointment. Got the carne asada - meat was cooked just right at medium-rare, but it was tough. As such, could not eat it alone, but had to slather salsa and accompaniments and wrap up in tortilla to make it tolerable. If I'm paying $29.50, I expect a tender cut of meat, not meat that I subsequently need to dice up and bury in sauce and carbs!
