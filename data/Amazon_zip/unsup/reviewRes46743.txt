My mom and I went here for lunch our first day in the city. RJ Grunts is conveniently located right near the LP Zoo and Conservatory. We immediately loved the charm, it is small but gives a feel from the 70s. The two of us split a chicken sandwich and both got the salad bar. The salad bar was excellent. I'm not a huge fan of soup, but I loved the creamed tomato one. It seems they have 2 soups a day, which varies. The salad bar had many options, including some nice fruit and sweet cream cheese to finish off the meal. Our sandwich was also good, although we were full from the salad bar. The cottage fries were really a mix of kettle chips and potatoes. The staff was very attentive and friendly, offering advice on what to do/see while in Chicago. Overall, a great place to get a taste of local Chicago restaurants. Definitely recommend for lunch!
