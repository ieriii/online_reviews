Geez I just love Meli! It is VERY hard for me to go there and not order eggs...if I don't order eggs I get something sweet like their divine Meli cakes, but this is a big step for me...I actually ordered lunch. I had my egg intake for the day and opted for the Meli salad. So glad I did! Peppery arugula, large slices of avocado, red onion, feta cheese and slices of chicken breast topped with honey vinaigrette dressing. DIVINE. With such a tremendous menu filled with tasty treats how can you decide? You can't. Which is why several trips to Meli are a must...I wonder if I could eat my way through their menu? I smell a challenge...
