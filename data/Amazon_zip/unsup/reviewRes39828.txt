Went here with the in-laws. While the food was very very good and our waitress was pleasant, it was a bit overpriced. About $18 per person, and I've been to other KBQ joints where it was $18/couple. Overall very good though, and maybe worth the extra money since it was close to my neighborhood and seemed very safe and clean.
