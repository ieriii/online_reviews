After watching top chef masters, I had to to visit GE.  We made reservations day of (Friday) and arrived early. And there was the chef chilling by the bar as patrons trickled in. I was star struck.  Food was good. Small portions. Big bill. Popcorn tossed in truffle oil with parm cheese? Very good! For entrees, I really loved the different layers of flavor of each dish. I would recommend the sturgeon. Light delicate flavors. Service was excellent. Very attentive but not overdone. Just be prepared to order couple of entrees to try to have the best experience. Don't skip out on dessert. Also had one of the best mojito from here. ;D Favorite part of the meal was listening to the explanation of each dish.
