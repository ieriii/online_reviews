I was introduced to this place through a first date. (Us suburbanites don't get into the neighborhoods west of Western too often.) The date didn't go so well, (a regularity in my life....sigh) but even a downer of a date couldn't dampen my spirits about this place. Simply, it's AH-MAZING! Excellent selection of rye and bourbon - right up my alley. And let me tell you about the bacon cheeseburger. I know, such a ubiquitous menu item, but there's nothing passe about it. It's a reminder that the simple can be better than the complex. High quality beef, succulent bacon, and a sharp, and aged cheddar on a tasty roll that doesn't get soggy. No lettuce, tomato, or condiments. It's sort of the antithesis of Kuma's, which is of course, fantastic in it's own way. But really, you need to go here for the cocktails. Maybe they do girly syrupy shit, but this is a place where they make MAN-drinks. The bartenders take the craft of drink-making seriously, and they turn out some serious drinks. Seriously - these drinks are "crafted", I don't know that a better word exists in the English language. Best Old Fashioned I've ever had.
