Perfect place for a post dinner drink on date night. If you dont enjoy someone putting time and effort into making a drink, dont go there. Plenty of places with solid cocktails all over the city, but this place makes some of the best I've ever had. My wife and I go every few months to see what new drinks they are slanging. Expect the wait but that's okay. I rather wait for a bit to know I have a seat than wait in line to get into a club where I'll be shoulder to shoulder with the crowd and it's impossible to get to the bar. I'm not sure if it's because I come here often, that I think it has lost some of its cool speakeasy vibe...I think this place is too popular now and that's why I dont give it 5 stars. This place sort used to be a secret but it's still worth checking out and definitely a must see for any out of town friends that can appreciate a tasty cocktail. Dont come here with a huge crew, dont meet friends here. This is a place you go with a group of 2-6 people to enjoy each other's company.
