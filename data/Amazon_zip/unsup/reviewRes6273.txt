Really really awesome atmosphere. If you are an ambiance kinda person, you will LOVE this place and will make up for their lack of good vegetarian options. It's a pretty classy place and deserves a nice blouse and jeans. I know its right near UIC, so college students, leave your sweats at home. Definitely a great date place, but I saw a large group of people also sharing a long table in the back. Seating is in these high-seat tables or normal tables. Now, the food! I was a BIT disappointed with what was so deliciously written in the menu, and what actually came out. roasted cauliflower steak + Sicilian olive tapenade + crispy ceci + preserved lemon vinaigrette : not bad, but tasted mostly like burnt cauliflower and lemon roasted squash+ farro+ whipped goat cheese+ hazelnuts+ watercress: I really liked this. I think it was the best out of all the dishes. Had a good fresh texture and the squash and hazelnuts really went together well. Cacio e Pepe = spaghetti + pecorino + black pepper: pretty much tasted what it sounds like, spaghetti and black pepper. Tasted pretty decent, but not something I would pay 8 dollars for if I can make it at home for 2. (and it was a pretty small dish) Pizza della Terra = foraged mushrooms + braised leeks + taleggio + truffle oil = this was not good at all. I am not a fan of stinky things. maybe my palate is not that refined? All in all, I was in Chicago for a week and tried out a series of restaurants, and I was not impressed with this one. Too expensive for what was served.
