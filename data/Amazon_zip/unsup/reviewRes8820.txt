I was kind of thinking I would stop writing yelp reviews since I was on 187 and I'm so gangsta, but then I realized that would mean I'd be forever remembered for getting munsoned at the Apple Store. And thus, I carried on my legacy of writing completely useless reviews. Anyhoo, I just remembered that I ate here like a week ago for lunch. Food was good, but they really Arby'd me on the meat. For $10, I got about 6 bites of tender steak (Where's the beef yo?), and a whole shiteload of rice which was decent. Around Lolbany Park there are so many Middle-Eastern places. I don't know why Noon-O rose to fame and left the others to bask in their own failure, but I'd suggest bargain shopping.
