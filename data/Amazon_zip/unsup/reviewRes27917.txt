My wife and I have been back twice since my initial review. This is by far our favorite restaurant in the city. The second visit was a comedy of errors. My wife made reservations, but there must have been some sort of glitch with Open Table because when we got there they had no clue who we were, but the staff was amazing about it. We stood at the bar while the hosts went to work trying to find a table for us. Bar tender heard our plight, and gave a couple glasses of champagne. We eventually got seats at the bar and the host told us it would be 45 minutes. 20 minutes later he said it would be 45 minutes..... We asked if 45 minutes really meant 90 and he said maybe. So we decided to eat at the bar. We ordered some apps, but they brought some extra ones to try and make our experience the best it could be. Food was excellent. Ordering a la carte is the way to go after you've done the experience or repertoire once. We went back a couple weeks ago and it was just as good. The same server who asked about the flavors was there. This time she only asked about the flavors once. We still were given a sabre of a meat knife, but it makes much more sense proportionally speaking with an a la carte portion as opposed to the tasting menu portion. The drinks as always were amazing. We ordered the Wagyu tartare and the Deconstructed Cesar. Both were excellent. I had the Jidori Chicken which is a playful interpretation of southern fried chicken. Delightful! My wife loved the bison loin. We skipped dessert because we were headed to Aviary for drinks afterwards. We will definitely come back next time the bank account recovers.
