Wow what a place, gastro wine bar! Had theshaved Brusslesprouts appitizer, a little bit salty for my tastes, but after that Woo Hoo damn good. Great wine selection, great mixture of plates all perfect for sharing and sampling. I had the Razor clams the pigs ears and the quale, not a hint of anything but goodnesss in each dish. Topped off with that wine list, and a nice spanish brandy, I only wish I had more people with me to try other things.
