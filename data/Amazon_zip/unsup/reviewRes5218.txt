The Purple Pig makes me a happy camper. The food was TO DIE FOR. I was there for a birthday dinner and our group was ordering on and off. Service was quick once we were seated. It is quite a popular place and we felt very lucky to have been seated after an hour of waiting. My favorite dish was the milk braised pork shoulder. Try it, you'll love it!
