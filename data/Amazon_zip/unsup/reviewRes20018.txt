Went here for a girls night out! It is always hard to order sushi with a large group and for the waiter to organize everything. Coast did a great job taking our order, splitting our checks, and helping us have a fun night. They also recommended so great rolls for us to try and made sure all food allergies were addressed. Sushi - delicious, unique rolls but the only complaint is they are a bit small. I thought the price was a bit high considering how much we got for our money Atmosphere - Great decor, nice waiting area in front! BYOB - makes this an affordable night on the town! I understand they only let you have so many bottles on the table though so we hid them in our purses. haha.
