India House was a great way to introduce myself to the world of Indian cuisine. We went for the lunch buffet and sampled a large number of dishes (amazing curries!) --- including the tandoori chicken which was simply delicious. (Too bad they only served three small pieces on that hot sizzling pan, though.) The mango ice cream dessert was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I believe I made 3 consecutive trips just for it. Yes, THAT good.  When I move to Chicago, I'd def like to try this place again for dinner.
