This is our favorite sushi joint in the city. When out of town friends come into town we pick up a couple bottles of Riesling and head over to Coast. We love the atmosphere and the cost is always very reasonable. There can be quite a wait on the weekends so I suggest getting there a little early or just be prepared to wait.  Also, there is no corkage fee on the BYO if each person spends over $15.
