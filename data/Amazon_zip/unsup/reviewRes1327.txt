There is no shortage of great hot dogs in Chicago. But judging by the rating and the over 1,400 reviews I think Hot Doug's may be one of the best. The line to order is also an indication. The place was crowded and lively on a weekday early afternoon. I went with several associates. There is something for everyone in this place, even rattlesnake and ribeye sausages. I have a weakness for andouille, so I tried that. It was good but not really as good as I expected. Chicago is too far from Lafayette I guess. But the Italian Sausage (aka the Sollozzo) was excellent. One of the top five italian sausages of all time. Definitely worth a return trip.
