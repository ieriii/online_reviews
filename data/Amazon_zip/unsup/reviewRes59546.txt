Dear Yelpers,This restaurant takes an advantage on foreigners and doesn't serve all the condiments that supposed to come with the entrees. BBQ short ribs are the most popular items on the menu. They will not allow you to cook a single order BBQ on the table. Instead they cook them in the kitchen and bring those out to you. It's just one of the ways to push you to buy two orders and make sales. Also, when they cook inside the kitchen, they use the oldest marinated meat. Be aware!They jacked up the price, yet food got stinkier. No wonder you don't see many Asians or Koreans. It used to be place, but not anymore. Don't go there, its not worth it.
