This is the first and only time I've been to Sunda. It was for lunch, and I was with three other people. The miso soup they ordered came out tepid. They sent it back and it came back a little warmer but still not hot. The sushi was ok.  The shrimp and sea bass curry was good. The chicken and pork adobo had a nice tasting sauce, but the chicken was dry, hard, and not easy to chew. The pork buns were not great either. There wasn't enough flavor, and the pork belly, which you would think would be rich and tender, was dry and hard. Sort of like the chicken. The garlic noodles had nice flavor, but had TONS of melted butter (or something similar) and were overcooked to a mush.  The worst thing of all was the steamed ginger salmon filet. With 'ginger' in the title, you would think it would be flavorful, but it was totally tasteless.  None of us will be back here. Even though the sushi was ok, there are so many other places to get it that there is no reason to return.
