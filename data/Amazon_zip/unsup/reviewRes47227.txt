Eh...burger was ok (**The Lockdown Warden**) I think you have to dine in to receive napkins. - Me. The servers were very nice and personable (although it DID help that my friend whom I was with lives 4 doors down and knows 90% of the staff). - Cassandra K. (05/09/2012) Well, cassandra, i live 6.5 miles away...which is probably why they thought i was trying to deliver something. i think they had security on stand by in the back.I think i'll go back and try something diffy. they should creat another burger and name it "WATCH HIM" lol.
