LOVE THIS PLACE! It's really the best sushi on the north side, hands down, and wonderful thai too! Contrary to other reviews, I have eaten in and had delivery several times, and both are good! In the city, we generally expect that delivery will take 1 to 1.5 hours, that's just the way it is. I don't think I have ever ordered delivery from anywhere in the city and had it arrive in less than an hour, usually about 90 mins. And seriously, of you are going to cry over delivery food, you should probably be on medication, and if you want 30 minute delivery, go back to Hinsdale! Lol
