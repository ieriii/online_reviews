I looked to my right and I saw jalapenos, I looked to my left and I saw jalapenos. I looked in front of me and I saw no jalapenos. I think I should have gotten jalapenos. I got the stuffed special and I thought it was better than Lou Malnati's but it wasn't great. Not enough to warrant me being a fan. The second layer of dough was covered in sauce so the dough didn't really get to brown and cook. It was slimy and cheeselike without the flavor. I think they should cook the pizza without the sauce enough to brown it and give it some texture, then put the sauce on, but that's just me. I like the concept of the stuffed pizza and the ingredients were good, except for the sausage, it wasn't meaty enough. It tasted like overprocessed meat. Overall, I still prefer Giordano's over Lou's but I was done with Chicago pizza after this.
