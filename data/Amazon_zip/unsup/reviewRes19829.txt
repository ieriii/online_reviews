After everything that I read about the line at Xoco, I was slightly nervous about eating here. I'm not exactly the most patient person. When my buddy and I arrived at 7:15 pm on a Tuesday night, the line was already inside of the door. I was surprised because it was one of our Indian summer evenings where the temperature was still 65 degrees and I thought more people would have been out. Clearly, I was mistaken. In my opinion, the line moved very quickly (remember, I am impatient). It did come to a slight halt when some self-important woman who refused to get off her Blackberry had to dig through her purse and find her wallet to pay. I mean really?! We've been in line for 20 minutes it just occurred to you that you need your wallet? After 2 minutes of her apologizing and me rolling my eyes, she moved and we were at the register ordering. We ordered chips and salsa that we shared. The chips and salsa were okay...nothing amazing to write home about. I had the Cubana Torta which from the first bite I was in love. The pork loin, bacon, black bean, avocado and jack cheese made the perfect combination. I inhaled this sandwich like it was my last meal. My buddy ordered the Gunthorp Chicken Torta. He tried to eat the sandwich with his hands and discovered that it was messy. So he ended up eating it with a fork like an open-face sandwich. I didn't taste his torta but he raved about it. Lastly, we shared an order of 3 churros which left us both with a smile on our face. To top the evening off as we are finishing our churros, who walks by and says hello....Rick Bayless. It just doesn't get any better! PS- We were walking out of the door by 8:20 pm.
