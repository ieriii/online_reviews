Wow, I've always heard people say good things about Chicago deep dish pizza, and finally I've experienced it for myself! So just what did I think? Well.... (**channeling Antoine Dodson**), what they say is definitely the truth--Chicago deep dish pizza does indeed rule!  So why did I choose to try Pequod's instead of one of the clich Chicago pizza joints like Pizzeria Du, Pizzeria Uno, Lou Nalnati's, or Gioradano's on my first visit to the windy city? Well, my boyfriend, Vinny, lived in Chicago for a year and swore up and down that Pequod's was the best. So, being the good partner I am, I took his word for it. And, he was right-- Pequod's did not fail me... it was awesome! Their deep dish pizza was everything I hoped Chicago pizza would taste like! Thick, soft-on-the-inside and crunchy-on-the-outside pizza crust.... abundant creamy & bubbly mozzarella cheese... tangy, delicious pizza sauce... and fresh toppings! Heavenly indeed! As for the atmosphere at Pequod's, it was nice, too! The restaurant is housed in an older building that's been cleverly updated to have a modern industrial look and feel. So, you know immediately that the place is casual, but it's still warm and inviting.
