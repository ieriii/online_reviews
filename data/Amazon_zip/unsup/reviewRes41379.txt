I finally went to try Tank after seeing all the people waiting at the door. This place is usually pack and I don't really understand the hype behind this place. After having their pho, I still don't understand. The broth had some flavor but it gets a little bland after a couple minutes. It lacks the kind of kick you get from Pho 888. Noodles are perfectlty cooked but they are stingy with their meat. I also ordered fresh sugar cane juice as I was excited to see that on their menu. It turned out to be very citrusy with a hint of orange which I thought was odd. I've had fresh sugar cane juice before and it definitely does not taste like that. Overall, the pho' was decent but not good enough for me to come back for more. Save yourself some waiting time or having to share tables and try where else.
