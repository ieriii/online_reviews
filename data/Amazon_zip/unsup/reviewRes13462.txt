Let's start off by saying....I WILL BE BACK. First if you do bring wine do not let them sit you outside. They are not BYO on the patio. We had no idea they brought the wine in which was fine but then after they opened they brought it out it was just strange. So we all went on Monday night and the special is any of the fish but a few are only 14.95. I had the sturgeon and it was phenominal. We did have some issues because they were out of crab legs to begin with. Then one of the people in our party kept ordering and they were out of those fish as well. He finally picked something and enjoyed what he had. We all tried a bit of everything and they were all good...but mine was the most flavorful. Tuesday night's special we heard was all you can eat crab legs for 34 dollars. I will be back on a Tuesday for sure. The service was just strange. The waiter seemed overwhelmed. I brought a 1999 bottle of wine and he broke the cork. When i looked at the cork it was in good shape but he wasn't paying any attention and just assumed it was a young easy bottle to open. We did end up asking them to remove some of the corkage fees because of the debacle for the fish being out and the cork being broken.  They did remove 2 corkage charges which was nice.
