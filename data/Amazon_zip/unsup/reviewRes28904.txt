Let me start off by saying I consider my self a pizza guy. Before I ate at Pequod's, I considered Lou's as the best Chicago style pizza in town. While I still love Lou's, I will move that title to Pequod's! This place is amazing!. My buddy Rich introduced me to this gem one night and the rest is history. I haven't eaten deep dish pie anywhere else since. After I had it the first time, I had cheese, I thought wow this pizza is great. The second time I had their sausage and green pepper, even better. Since then, I have ordered it several times and it has been just as good every time. Even their delivery is excellent. The pie comes to my house steaming hot and I live in the loop, which is a fair distance from the Lincoln Park location. Anyway I can go on, but let me just say it is the BEST pizza anywhere!! Try this place, you will feel the same way. Enjoy!
