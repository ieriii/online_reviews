Always loud, always busy, always fun. I come here a lot with industry friends. The wine list is superb - even the random Croatian red. We always order a bunch of dishes and nosh away. Some of the ones I've particularly enjoyed: - calamari and fregola - grilled green onions with romesco - all the panini - BONE MARROW (although Gilt Bar's is better) - Nutella panini -- yes. yes. yes. - the fried donut thing filled with ricotta and chocolate. Nom nom nom. The meat eaters I tend to roll with like the turkey leg and the milk-braised pork. (Yes bone marrow is technically animal. I know). Service is as quick as it can be with so many people and so little space. They're always sweet and fun and well-informed!
