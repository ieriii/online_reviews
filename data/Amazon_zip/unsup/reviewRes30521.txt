Came here for dinner while I was on a business trip in Chicago and sat at the sushi bar. Ambiance here is upbeat trendy, with lounge chairs on one end of the restaurant, a main room with a mix of high stool seating and low top wood tables, and private rooms on the other end of the restaurant. The music playing is loud, mostly top 40s, and sets a fun scene. The crowd is mostly made up of young, good-looking, well-dressed people either in groups or on dates. Also recently read that Sunda was named #1 Top Celeb hangout in Chicago (I didn't see anyone A-list...nor was I looking). Food I started with the Organic Miso soup with Mushrooms, and had the Dragon specialty sushi roll. Both were delicious! This place is a little pricey...but the food is good, and you're paying for the great ambiance. I'd go back!
