Brunch at Sprout was a magical, perfect day. The morning sprouted with great weather and sun, a portend of wondrous events yet to happen.  We arrived early so my husband pulled up right outside the restaurant and I ran in to see about valet, which they don't have for brunch. Our waiter came all the way outside to tell my husband he could park right outside the place, no meter, no problem. It was like a fantasy come true! We had reservations but we were early enough that we wouldn't have needed them as it didn't get crowded until we were leaving. I was glad we were early because the tiny tables are close together but we felt like it was very spacious as people were scattered.  It was such a good day with sprouts of fun and sunshine that we started off with cocktails. I had the Afternoon delight because two of the four ingredients are on my loved list - raspberries and prosecco. Cheers!  We then split an order of bacon buns. Say it again, bacon buns. Only the best bread you will ever taste. They are Red Hen Bakery bun dough chock full of delicious bacon. Chock full! I followed that with a lamb eggs benedict which was simply amazing. It had polenta and green onions with the lamb plus a poached egg, peas and pea tendrils topped by perfection in a sauce. What a dish! The service was sublime; my favorite part was that if you left the table, they folded your napkin. When my husband returned, I told him I had done it. Then just because I am immature, I left to use the bathroom and sure enough, my napkin was folded. My husband told me he had done it and we had a good giggle. The coffee and oj were fabulous. It just was a perfect day, a sprout of love and happiness! Before, if you said the word sprout, I thought of the Jolly guy's sidekick,. Now I just smile and think of marvelous flavors AND a folded napkin.
