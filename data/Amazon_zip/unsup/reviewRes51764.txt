This place is so greasy and yummy!! Their margaritas are pretty good - the ones on the rocks are definitely a lot stiffer than the frozen ones! The carne asada tostada is delicious! I get that every time! The quesadillas consist of one small tortilla folded over, so definitely order more than one! All their combos are really good! The chile relleno is good, as are all the enchiladas. It's much better to eat in, though -- we've taken out a couple of times and the quality hasn't been as good. A great cheap eat in the neighborhood!
