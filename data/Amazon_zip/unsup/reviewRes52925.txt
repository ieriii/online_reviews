I live kiddy corner to 90 miles, and watched with a bated breath as old Calvin's was transformed into a lively and beautiful establishment.  Now, I was one of the few who did kind of like Calvin's. I never had a problem, they were cheap and their soups were delicious. So, you can imagine that I was a little hesistant to walk into 90 miles, because, really, it came down to cost.  And while they are a tad more expensive, they are miles ahead in atmosphere, quality, and friendliness.  I stopped in on my way home, and just wanted to get something small to go. So I order the sweet plantains and was going to get a shake. Shakes were apparently a no-go, but he offered to make me an ice coffee instead. The Ice coffee was amazing, seriously, I'm normally not a fan, unless it has flavors but it was perfect mixture of coffee, milk and sugar. The plantains themselves were also spot on. Just the right amount of fried yumminess.  I'm only giving 4 stars for now, because I haven't had enough of their food to judge them completely. However, the owner, who spoke with me as I was getting my bike unlocked, was very cordial. He invited me back, reminded me they were BYOB, and asked me about the neighborhood.  All in all, I look forward to this place succeeding and hope that more people take the time to get over there and enjoy this great establishment!
