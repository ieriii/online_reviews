I love their pizza. I was worried when it was on Check Please that people would start going there and it would be too crowded. So far that hasn't happened.http://www.wttw.com/main.taf?erube_fh=cp&cp.submit.restaurantDetail=1&cp.id=349I always plan on trying something else, but the pizza is so wonderful I can't help but order it.
