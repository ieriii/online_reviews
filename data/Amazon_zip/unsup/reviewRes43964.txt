I took a group of 6 to Kinzie chop house as part of a work function. I have nothing but good things to say about this place. 1st - my coworkers were NOT dressed accordingly. Frankly i was a little embarrassed (talking t shirt and shorts...). But they didn't make anything of it. 2nd - Dirty Martini was extremely well made! Plus they asked if i wanted stuffed blue cheese olives, YES!!! 3rd - I love how they bring out the steaks like its on a dessert platter. I learned so much about steaks! 4th - I had the Dry Aged Delmonico with Blue cheese. Omg.... amazing! Best steak i have had in 10 years. Period. (we got mac n cheese and creamed spinach - they were ok, but nothing to write home about). Overall - excellent service, amazing steaks. I would definitely come back!!
