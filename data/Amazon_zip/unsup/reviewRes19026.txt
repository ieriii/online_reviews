My roommate and I have been patiently waiting for the Bad Apple to open - and it was well worth the wait. When we went last Sunday, we asked if they made a good Bloody Mary. Nothing is quite as disappointing as a bad Bloody Mary. However, it is probably my new favorite Bloody Mary venue in the city. They are missing the salad bar that should come sticking out of the top but the flavor was so good that I still loved it. They let us add more horseradish, tabasco, etc., which is nice so you can have your drink exactly like you want it. I tried the Earthly sandwich - Portabella mushrooms and goat cheese! Two of my favorite foods. My roommate got the Lucky Duck sandwish, which was like a grilled cheese pilled high with duck. The food was everything we were hoping for. When they first brought it out, we were slightly disappointed with portions; however, after we ate the food we realized they were perfectly portioned and we weren't trying to stuff ourselves.  There is a game room off to one side, positioned behind the bar. They have a Foosball table and board games to entertain yourself while drinking something off their extensive beer menu. We didn't have time to play any games - but we definitely will be back.
