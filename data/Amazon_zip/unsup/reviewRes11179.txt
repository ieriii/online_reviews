4.5 stars for Bongo Room.........perhaps 4.75....... My dining companion(my Mom) and I went about noon on a Saturday. I was surprised our wait was only about 10min as it was one of the first NICE days of spring. We both ordered the egg white omelete(with different ingredients, this place really has variety). OMG- THAT was what an egg white omelet should taste like. It was FIRM(read- not runny) my vegetables were clearly distinguishable- fresh not frozen garbage) with the PERFECT touch of feta cheese. YUMMY, YUM-YUM!!!!!!!!!! The hash browns were perfect, cooked well to the perfect texture and seasoned appropriately. Our server was friendly, but not too intrusive and my Mom enjoyed their mimosa. It was a great brunch all round. I suppose you are wondering WHY Bongo is not a five star review- well, their menu is a tad small, and they have no daily specials. I have heard others RAVE about the chocolate tower french toast- but due to the fact I'm not a HUGE banana person I saw about maybe two other dishes Id want to try. Also the acoustics are very bad, making it very hard to hear a conversation. Ill definitely be heading back to Bongo Room, probably not regularly due to the fact that I'm not often in Wicker Park but if you are in the area THIS is the spot for brunch.
