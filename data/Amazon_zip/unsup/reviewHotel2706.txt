I spend three days here for my birthday.This is a really wonderful place to be to just relax and enjoy the downtown location. The beds were incredible, nice clean clean white sheets, clean mattress, down comforters,nice plush pillows and wonderful window view, which by the way you have to request. I could barely get out of my KING size bed because it was so comfortable nor did I want to! :) The lights were wonderful you can dim and adjust the lights just how you want even in the bathroom! real plus for me. It's just such a luxury to have dimmed lights in the bathroom I'm mean simply amazing! staff is very friendly. I only gave three stars because of the food menu prices the hotel offers. Ridiculously high with 18% tax plus 3$ charge for room delivery, with all that you pay to stay there it should at least be reasonable food prices. I mean how else would you get your food unless they deliver it to you????? so of course you would have to pay. With so many other restaurants in the area within walking distant you will definitely want to dine out!  Overall the stay was nice and relaxing
