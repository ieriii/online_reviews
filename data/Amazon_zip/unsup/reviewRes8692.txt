Unlike other reviewers, I've never been to another Brazilian steakhouse so I don't have any points of comparison. However, I've now been to Fogo twice -- once for lunch and once for dinner -- and I can say that it's worth every cent it costs you. Every. Cent. I am never going to manage to be a vegetarian as long as I'm in the vicinity of a Fogo de Chao. What can I even say about it? The service is excellent, the food is amazing and just keeps on coming. My main recommendations are the bread (so gummy, so delicious), the fried polenta, not filling up on the salad bar (though I do love me some hearts of palm). As far as the meats go, make sure to save room for the picanha (top sirloin) and fraldinha (bottom sirloin): but honestly, it's all good. And the strawberry cream is pretty fantastic. Actually my main recommendation is "go to Fogo de goddamn Chao." Do weekday lunch -- it's much, much cheaper and it's the same thing.
