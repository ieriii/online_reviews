Amazing cupcakes, and this coming from a native NY-er who frequented Magnolia Bakery on Bleeker. I think I might actually like them better than Magnolia. Who knew? I've had their cookies, brownie dessert things and the cupcakes, and really, the cupcakes are my favorite so far. The frosting is light and had a whipped texture, but the taste is so rich and creamy. The cake part is moist and amazing. I can't wait to go back for some pumpkin spice ones! When I go back to NY for Christmas, I'm seriously considering bringing a dozen of these babies with me for my family. The best part of this bakery is that they have a whole room with extra seating and wifi. Score five stars for Alliance.
