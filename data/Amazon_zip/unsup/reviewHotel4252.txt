Got a great deal on this hotel using http://Priceline.com and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while visiting Chicago. Our room on the 18th floor was clean, but the bathroom was a little small. I love that they use Peter Thomas Roth toiletries as oppose to generic hotel brands. The hotel is conveniently located in downtown Chicago near popular tourist spots (with the exception of Navy Pier), great restaurants, and shops. My boyfriend and I did more walking than we did public transportation.  My only complaint was that this hotel doesn't have a complimentary coffee maker and you have to buy coffee outside of the hotel or the Starbucks in the lobby.  Also, be sure to check out Balance Spa & Fitness at the hotel if you want to get a massage, nails, and hair done for a day or night out. Online booking available at http://www.balancespachi There is a health club there too, but you don't get any discounts for being a hotel guest. Fee to use their gym is $10. You're better off walking and wandering around Chicago if you want to get exercise.
