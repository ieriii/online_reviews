So I'll start out by saying I'm not a huge beer drinker, but my friend insisted that we go here and I was not disappointed! Neither of us was hungry so we grabbed a seat at the bar. It was around 5pm on a Monday and not crowded at all. It did start to get busy a few hours later for Monday Night Football, but nothing to where our bartender couldn't still chat with us.  Our bartender was great - he chatted with us, didn't think we were crazy when we started talking about foreign films, and most importantly was extremely knowledgeable about the beers that he was serving.  I had the Iron Fist Pale Ale and it was awesome! It is a beer that occasional beer drinkers could love as well as the seasoned beer enthusiast. My friend had one of their darker beers, I think it was called When the Shit Hits the Fan or something along that line, and then later the Nosferatu draft. Both were really good as well! We shared the bruschetta which was awesome and just the right amount of food for us to munch on.  I really liked this place, but I think it deserves a few more visits before I can properly give it a 5 star rating.
