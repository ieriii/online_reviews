Went here with a friend after work last night. I had not been here in awhile. I got the turkey club and he got the 3rd burger. My club was really good (actually, it was delicious) and the burger was pretty standard.....not amazing, but not bad either. We ordered the goat cheese fondue as an appetizer, and it seemed a little bland....but it definitely tasted like goat cheese so I guess we got what we ordered....I would order it again. I had not been here in awhile, but the service was WAY better than I remember it. Kudos to everyone who worked on Wednesday night, 3/28/12. Goat cheese fondue, burger, turkey club, three glasses of wine and three bottles of Stella = $76 + tip. Rediscovering a quiet, non-obnoxious place to eat in my neighborhood = priceless.
