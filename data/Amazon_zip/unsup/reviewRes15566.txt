Yet more delicious pizza! Pizza that will show up at my house! We're trying to branch out from just getting Apart pizza all the time, so we called these guys. We ordered a plain cheese pan pizza. It was a little expensive, but that pizza was enormous. It fed three of us for two days. Plus, delivery was really quick (like 35 minutes, and we live a couple miles from Calo) and the delivery guy was friendly. There is a delivery fee, which is a pain, but they make some solid pizza. When I'm looking for something a little more substantial than Apart, I will totally call them.
