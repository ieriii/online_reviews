Everything we had hear was delicious... except for the duck fat peanuts. I didn't see what the hype was, couldn't tell the difference between them and regular nuts. In any case, really enjoyed that they have small, medium, and large plates so you can share. We split the buffalo caprese, which was fresh and delicious. The gazpacho, which had a lump of delicious, fresh crab. The poutine, which is essentially cheese fries and really, really heavy. The venison burger was also huge and on a delicious toasted brioche bun. In summary: Huge portions, fun to share, everything was tasty.
