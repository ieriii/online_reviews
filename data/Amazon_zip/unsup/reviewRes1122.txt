yay so glad i finally made it to hot doug's! it doesn't need another review but i'm going to write one anyway. had the foie gras duck sausage; the rattlesnake sausage with raita; the apple, pear, and port elk sausage; the corn dog; and duck fat fries. everything was delicious! the foie gras duck sausage is the one. it was so good and flavorful and every part of it filled my mouth with delicious creaminess. duck fat fries were great - not too different from regular fries, but again, the creaminess. corn dog was the second best i've had in my life. i was scared this place was over-hyped but it's not. it's just that great. and the best part is that the guy taking orders, i can only assume and wish it was hot doug himself, was the nicest guy in the world! the other people working there were pretty great too though. kind of a perfect experience.
