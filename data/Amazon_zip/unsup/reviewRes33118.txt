I've never written a Yolk review? Geez... I guess I don't write reviews often for my regular spots. I'm a brunch person all the way and Yolk stays in my rotation. The wait is always super long. 30 minutes would be fabulous but expect 1 hour. The food is good and I always leave stuffed... just the way I like it after brunch! Hey... I walk home afterwards so that makes me feel better. =)
