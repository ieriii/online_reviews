Totally loved this place, honestly not bad at all for a 3 star hotel.It was cheap, easy to find from the airport, the service was great and very professional. Also, the front desk was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions thoroughly, they even gave me tips on where to go to have a good time in Chicago.The bedroom was clean and the perfect size for a single person. It came with a queen size bed, flat screen TV, coffee maker etc..... Overall I am extremely impressed.
