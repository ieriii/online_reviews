This place was great about a year or so ago. I finally went back last night, and I have to say I was a little disappointed. The pizza was EXTREMELY soggy. And the burnt flavor of the crust (which you get from not cleaning your wood-burning oven!), didn't help much. Overall, $38 (before tip) for two pizzas and two beers seemed a little excessive to me, especially since we walked away feeling completely underwhelmed by the food. Too bad.
