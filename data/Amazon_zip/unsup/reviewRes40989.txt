Pho - yum. Appetizer dish where you dip the rice paper, served with rice noodles, bean sprouts, cilantro, beef, and other fixings - heaven. Also had the avocado smoothie, which was equally good. Everything is reasonably priced as well. The place is cramped, and the service is not super. But, it's worth it for the excellent food.
