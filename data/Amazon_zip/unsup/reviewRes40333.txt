I love this place...but as a bar more than a restaurant. Definitely 5 stars for the amazing drink list including delicious cocktails and my fav whiskey, Michter's, great easy going service, and the fact that I sat next to Rahm Emanuel! here a couple of months ago. (I was too chicken to bother him during his meal, but it didn't stop me from staring). I love to go here with groups of friends or on a date, but lately I haven't been wowed by the food. Since I'm drinking I will probably order some pate or a small plate of meatballs just so I don't fall off my nike on the way home, but I've been leery ever since I ordered the scallop with oxtail, and could not finish it due to oversalting and an unappealing richness and lack of balance. These are two of my favorite foods and I felt let down. boo. Still, this is one of my favorite places in Chicago, especially to sit at the bar and admire the awesome ambiance!
