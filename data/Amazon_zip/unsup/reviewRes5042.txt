If I can, I would here almost everyday (alternate with Davanti Enoteca). The first time I went to the Purple Pig was during the summer around 4th of July. The outdoor seating was perfect. We sat there for hours just enjoying the small plates and awesome wine selection. The best dish? BONE MARROW. Such a simple dish but it will blow your mind away. Suggestion on how to eat (which we were educated by the owner/head chef himself). Spread the bone marrow goodness on the toast, sprinkle some sea salt and top off with herb salad. This dish will change your life forever. Just don't eat it too often because none of us want to take the highway to a heart attack right? I have never had a disappointing dish here. Maybe one OK dish? But it's one of those "I don't dig this so much but it doesn't mean it tastes bad". Service is excellent. Food served promptly, staffs are not over-attentive (I hate that, you know, when they check on you every frikkin' 10 minutes?) but are always there when you need them. The downside? It's so popular, sometimes you gotta wait for an hour. Luckily, I'd just go stroll in westfield mall which is right next to it. This is one of the places on my list of "Bring people here whenever you can!"
