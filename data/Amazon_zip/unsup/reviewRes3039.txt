Dear Diary, It's me. Adriane. How come when I tell you things you never talk back? Luckily when I tell Yelp about experiences I usually get feedback. In fact, they even tell me cool stuff like about Crisp being delicious. So when my bestie suggested we try it...the prospect pleased. We went on an early weekday evening and it was busy. We ordered 5 wings in Seoul Sassy sauce, 3 chicken tenders in BBQ Spicy sauce, and a chicken breast sandwich in Seoul Sassy sauce. It's BYOB so while they made the order my partner bopped out to get beer. As soon as he returned the food was up and we got a table. The wings and tenders were so great it was hard to chose which sauce was better. The Sassy sauce is kinda complex and sweet and a transparent glaze. The BBQ was sweet with a spicy aftertaste. They were both sooo meaty, huge, and tender. I found the two sauces and meat quality and portions impressive. He liked his sandwich since it had veggies on it to elevate the flavor profile. I know, I'd always choose the wings or tenders. That's just me, different views, Diary, some people like cucumber better pickle. Anyhow, I definitely recommend it, Diary, not that I think you eat. And I'll post this on Yelp for those that do. I love you. And Crisp. Bye!
