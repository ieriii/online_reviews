HOLY SABATINO! Went here for my birthday dinner (one of a few happening last weekend) after reading some great Yelp reviews. First of all, prepare for the valet... the complimentary valet! I was a bit annoyed at first, because I wasn't expecting it but appreciated it later. Even when the valet came back with the wrong car. Anyway, then there is a complimentary coat check...fancy! And we didn't have a reservation because it was late on a Sunday, and man they were packed. Luckily the host found us a table hiding out in the back room. The food came with soup AND salad, plus bread. I got the risotto special, which was alright. Veggies beware: there was meat in the risotto. Spaghetti and meat sauce was pretty standard says the fiance. My brother-in-law said his steak wasn't quite as well done as he liked it, and his potato was kind of small. The blue cheese dressing was a delight. Overall when the bill came, we thought there was a mix up it was so cheap for so much food. We will be back!
