Not bad. I am not a vegetarian but my wife used to be (still pretty much is). I like to eat things with moms and feelings, their despair sweetens the meat. Must be the endorphines. Anyhow, i haven't been here a lot but the times I have it has been pretty decent. They have a nice little patio, the smoothies are tasty, and the veggie chili dogs were great! Service was pretty good too. I haven't noticed any surliness on the part of the waitstaff, and the prices are fairly reasonable for the area.
