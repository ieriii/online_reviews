This is BY FAR my favorite pizza place in the city. When I first moved to Chicago years ago I was on the hunt for a fantastic pizza place, I tried a ton in my neighborhood but they all were pretty disappointing. Then one day an Art of Pizza menu magically appeared at my apartment and I've been a happy camper ever since.  I've tried a few different options here but my ol' trusty is a cheese pan pizza...it's amazing. The dough is an ideal balance of soft/chewy with a little bit of buttery crisp. The sauce is a little sweet and the cheese is SO delicious and melty. I can't necessarily identify the combination of spices, but it compliments the pizza perfectly.   It usually takes them about 45+ minutes to deliver, but I guarantee it's worth the wait. Also, I've never tried any of their other menu items, but I've heard they're very tasty, you get a lot of food, and reasonably priced with daily specials.
