Food - 3 Service - 3 Ambience - 4 The dogs are juicy and plump - just the way it should be. Not a fan of tangy tomato. And I violated the Chicago hot dog experience by putting ketchup on my dog, but that's the way I roll. I did rather enjoy the relish, despite my initial disgust at its neon green coloring. Did the Jolly Green Giant throw up on my dog, were my first thoughts. We dined inside the hot dog stand, as we arrived in two different cars. The ordering process was quick and easy. The eating area is decorated with framed print-outs of various dining magazine reviews/features of the place. I wouldn't seek this place out per se, but it was a good dog.
