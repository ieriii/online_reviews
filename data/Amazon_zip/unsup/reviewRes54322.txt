This is my favorite pizza joint. Being from the east coast, I don't love deep dish, and theirs is a little different than others I've tried here; less heavy, and tastier. On weekends they will let you make a reservation, but it doesn't get you a table right away. You just get priority over the people who have just walked in. But you can put your pizza order in while you wait since it takes so long to cook anyway.Side note, I chose this as my last solid meal before getting my wisdom teeth out! Must be my favorite meal!
