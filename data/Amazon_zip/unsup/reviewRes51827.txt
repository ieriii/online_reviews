Me and my wife were recommended here by a friend. The service was kinda slow but not as much as I have seen in other reviews. We started with cheese sticks and they were great. We had a thin crust pepperoni and I would give it a 6 out of ten. I did not like the graffiti on everything, but I guess some people might like it.
