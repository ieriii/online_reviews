Ah..Piece. This place is great for a lot of reasons. First, the pizza is amazing. You'd be surprise how many places can mess up a thin crust pizza in this city. Piece is definitely one of the best in the city! I've had all the different combinations with different sauces and I can't think of one time where I didn't like the pizza. I also have to give props to the service. The place is always busy and it can get crowded on the weekends. I don't have an extensive knowledge of beer but the staff is more than happy to give some recommendations based on what types of beers you typically drink. Each time I ordered, the waitress recommend I try something different and I enjoyed the 3 types I got. So kudos to that. Also on Saturdays, they have live band karoake which is an attraction in of itself. After a few drinks, you'll have the liquid courage to take a stab at it. The crowd coming through it as diverse the Bucktown/Wicker Park area is. With large groups, I definitely recommend getting a reservation, especially on the weekends. It's definitely an energetic atmosphere. So if you're looking for a laid back area, perhaps coming during lunch or off hours to enjoy the pizza.
