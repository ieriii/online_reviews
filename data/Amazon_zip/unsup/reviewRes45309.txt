Great atmosphere! Very few patio seats but they do open all the windows and you get a perfect view of the street. I've eaten here a few times for convenience and I'm always shocked that I don't come here more often! The beer selection is decent and the food options include some traditional Irish pub options as well as some comfort food. I had the chipotle turkey burger which I had heard was good and it did not disappoint. Service is kind of hit or miss, i've been here when it's outstanding but I've also been there when it's been slow and scattered. I like the atmosphere even though it is a bit confused and they have a lot of space which is nice and not so claustrophobic.
