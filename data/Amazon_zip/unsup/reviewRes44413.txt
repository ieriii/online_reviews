Near where I live, BYO and some interesting rolls are the strengths of this place. Peter Parker, Kani Chung, and Summer rolls are particular favorties. The price is right and the decor is reminiscient of the Seinfeld episode in which Kramer decided to completely surround himself with wood in his apartment. Wood Jerry, Wood. I always seem to get in without a problem. Of course, maybe I should stop eating dinner at 4:30.
