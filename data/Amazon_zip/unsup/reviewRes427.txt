Tour de Force This is the ultimate dining experience. Alinea is the only FLAWLESS dining experience we have ever had. That was not luck because we had the same mind blowing experience twice here. Walking in you know you are some where different and some where very special. Everything is meticulous and perfect.  Every dish speaks for itself. It is brought to your table with care, usually on a custom make plate, spoon, or wire. It is explained and usually a story about how the dish came to be. I also recommend wine pairings to accompany each dish. Words can not do justice to this experience.  Pray for Grant because he is going through some tough time battling cancer.
