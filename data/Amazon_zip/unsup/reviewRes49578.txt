Joe and I came here with a Groupon, which was perfect because I was craving some skirt steak. We ordered the empanada combo for two (2 beef, 2 chicken, 2 cheese). They were all super delicious!! They were cooked perfectly with a crispy dough and moist fillings. With the salsas they were even better. I could've eaten this plate by myself as my meal... Then I ordered the combination plate with squid and skirt steak. One of my squid still had its bone in it, but other than that they were delicious. Grilled to perfection and served whole. The skirt steak was also delicious. Cooked perfectly and nice and moist. So, the proteins were tasty... But the sides: the potato and the yuca... Don't know what happened with these. The yuca was so dried out and tough that it was inedible. The potato was just ok... It could only really be eaten with the salsas; otherwise it wasn't good because it was so dry it would dry out your mouth.  And, the plaintain wasn't anything special. Joe got the combination plate with shrimp and skirt steak... His was good and about the same as mine except his yuca was edible.  In addition to the food... The bathrooms are downstairs and it was pretty creepy. I mean, downstairs bathrooms are creepy in general, but theirs was creepier than most. It's hard to describe, but it just was. Our waitress was also pretty annoying. She kept asking us if we wanted anything else. She asked us if we wanted to order drinks about five times - and we just kept telling her we were ok with water. I felt like she was constantly trying to upsell us.
