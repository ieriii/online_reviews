Not worth the hype. Its a nice romantic, dimly lit date spot. They make you wait and wait because they dont believe in standing. The drinks are strong but Im not too keen on the concept of drinking anything with raw eggs in it. They make alot of drinks with a raw egg meringue on top. I dont like how they wont allow anyone to stand around. As a former bartender I can see why its a place thats big with bartenders becasuse the drinks are strong and well made BUT you could get drinks as good elsewhere. And the high backed seats are uncomfortable and lack intimacy and discourage socialization with others.
