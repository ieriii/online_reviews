I never intended on going to this restaurant but I had a gift card and thought I would check it out and I'm glad I did! This place was awesome, from the food to the service and atmosphere everything was great. I got the Pollo Billy and loved it. It was a simple dish but the sauces they used made it special. The guacamole was rated # 1 and for good reason. The waitstaff seemed to really know about their dishes and provided us with good recommendations and fast service. I strongly recommend coming here if you're interested in trying something fun and different. While this place is huge it tends to get really crowded so make reservations and even then be expected to wait.
