Friends and I love to sit in the bar here and graze from the appetizer menu with occasional entrees and sandwiches thrown in. The food is fresh and always delicious. The fresh oysters and maki rolls are always a hit, as is the lobster bisque. When in season the soft shelled crab should not be missed. Toss in the music, good service and casual atmosphere, what's not to love? The restaurant is more upscale very nice but the bar is what keeps us coming back.
