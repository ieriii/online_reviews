Definitely really good food, even if it is a bit pricey. It's got that sort of sandwich shop appeal with a line to order, but you can grab a beer while you're at it! And good beer, too. I had a bottle Domaine Dupage for $5.50. I ordered the Torta Ahogada, ($8.95) which is a delicious, drowned steak sandwich in spicy chile de rbol. The presentation is excellent, because half the sandwich is standing up out of the sauce, making it easier to eat by hand. It was spicy and awesome.
