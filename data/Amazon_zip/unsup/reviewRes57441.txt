Go on Tuesday and Thursdays for 1/2 price margaritas. The banana margarita is to DIE for... literally tastes like you're drinking a smoothie :)The queso fundito is amazing, they put jalapenos on top so its a little spicy. Just steps from the Diversey Purple/Brown stop. A must try if you live in the area.
