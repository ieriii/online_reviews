I really like this place, though the service is better at times when they're not so busy. We primarily have gone for brunch. The chilequiles dish is good - and just the right amount of spice. I have really enjoyed the heirloom tomato sandwich too. The one weird thing that happened to us was that on our last visit (the place was busy) our server brought out our check before our food had even arrived. When we told her her mistake she took the bill back, but it was off putting - and it made us less inclined to order anything else. In general though the staff is friendly and we've had no other major problems.
