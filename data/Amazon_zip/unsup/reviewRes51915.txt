What else can I say about Deep Dish fuckin' pizza! I have never had deep dish pizza as great as @the Original's Gino's East. The ingredients they use in their pies are phenomenal from the green bell peppers to the cheese to the meats, the dough for the pie is delectably thick but blends well with everything else, & the sauce is very tasty. Truly a pie to fly back to Chicago. Size of the pie is rather huge and upon receiving my pie I was rather flabbergasted. Service was great.
