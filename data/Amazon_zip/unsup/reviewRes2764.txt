My fiance and I were taken here as an anniversary present by my boss and his wife.  I had heard rumors that Tru was stuffy and stuck up....that they weren't very nice and that they just weren't friendly. I beg to differ. I didn't feel that at all. I felt the atmosphere was actually very pleasant. The tables were spread apart perfectly and you felt like you could have a conversation without everyone in the restaurant listening. Also, if you talk to the servers like normal people, they talk to you normal also. We had our sommelier telling us hilarious stories about wine regions and types of wines.  The food was fantastic. We did the 9 course menu and I loved each course! And we did the wine pairings (those were HUGE pours!).  I loved the personalized menu (Congrats Amy and Greg) and the fact that they reprinted out exactly what everyone ordered on a special menu at the end of the night.  Truly great food and service and a very memorable experience.
