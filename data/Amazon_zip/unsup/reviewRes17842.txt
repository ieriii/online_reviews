Fried cheese curds, burgers, craft beer. Come here for these things. Don't come for the service. The cheese curds were excellent. I could have just eaten a double order of those, but being the eve of National Cheeseburger Day, we opted to continue our dinner by splitting the Elvis (peanut butter & bacon) and the Belly (pork belly) burgers, both medium rare. Both were excellent, flavorful, juicy specimens. The toppings didn't detract from the meat of the patty. The fries, with none of the special seasonings on offer, were excellent (and I'm not normally a fry person). We had five different servers from when we sat down to when we paid the check. Each was more visibly annoyed with their lives than the one before. Cheer the fuck up people, and don't ignore me for 25 minutes while I try to pay the check: that's the bit where I'm slowly forgetting how excellent the food was, and deciding how small your tip is going to be.
