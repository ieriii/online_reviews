Note: This review is for August 2008. I hope people don't find this too offensive, but dinner was soooo good that looking back on it, I think I just jizzed in my pants at the mere memory of that delicious evening. Service was impeccable. Hands down, some of the best service I've received. Some highlights of the dinner: 1. Tuna belly from a special farm in Japan served with White Soy. 2. The delicious desserts 3. The fun Mignardise cart that they rolled around to your table as a delicious ending to your dinner. I have never been soo deliriously happy as I was when I realized that I was allowed to take a little bit of each tasty sweet from the cart home with me.
