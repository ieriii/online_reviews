All I have to say is get the duck service. It is amazing! You get duck fried rice. Soup made with the duck bones and duck with these steamed buns. The duck service is very good.  We've also had bbq pork, mapo tofu, and an egg plant dish among other things and nothing ever seems to disappoint.  This is definitely a favorite place of ours!
