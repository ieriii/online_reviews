I was really unhappy with this place, especially because of the good things I've heard. I ordered the mahi special and about 3/4 into the fish it was completely uncooked. The waitress was apologetic, took it back, but it never came back out! And I stll had my side on there. I got a free dessert. Whoopee. And I tried my boyfriends burger which was mediocre at best and the bacon fat popcorn tasted just like bacon... Nothing special. The only good thing this place has is their brewery.
