I only order Pequod's deep-dish. It has a carmelized crust which required some getting used to, but now invokes some looking forward to. My story about Pequod's: We got completely drunk one night, had a couple people over and things got a bit chaotic. My roommates ordered a large deep-dish. During the time it took for the pizza to arrive, half the party left and the other half fell asleep (or passed out, if you will.) The pizza came, no one answered the door and the delivery guy left. We order regularly and immediately became worried about the next time we wanted some deep-dish. It's the only place we order from so thoughts raced through our minds. Will they spit in it next time? Will they put us on a black-list, a la Elaine at the chinese restaurant? Leaving nothing to chance, I ordered and had them deliver to the apartment building across the street. It took an hour of staring out the window and some serious self-reflection time, but it arrived as planned. It's that good.
