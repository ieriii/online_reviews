The food is great, however, the service is awful! The host, which is this guy who is so rude. I went there when it was really cold outside and he wouldn't let people wait inside. Ok, fine, I understand that to a degree but he didn't have to treat people like herding cows. He yelled at me and gave me a math lesson when I asked him if table 73 was next. His eyes were about to bulge out and he was looking at me very intensily as he yelled 72 comes before 73! Anyway, I always left feeling like trash everyi time I go there and I've been there like 5 times. Not sure it's worth the abuse even though the food is good.
