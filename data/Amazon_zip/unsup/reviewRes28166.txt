Ah, Nuevo Leone. It once reminded me of the tasty Mexican I used to live on as a child growing up in AZ (next to the more mainstream Mexican that is the norm). But then I took my girlfriend there "for the best Mexican" only to be greeted by a bunch of drunks seated near us who got into a pretty bruising battle of fists. It was pretty terrifying b/c they were falling down almost on top of us as we tried to skedaddle out of the way. Haven't been been back, but the rating is for what once was.
