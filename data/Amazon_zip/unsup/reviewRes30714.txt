The Chicago Diner has a reputation for being the pillar of vegan restaurants in the city. After all it was the first of its kind here in Chicago, establishing itselft nearly 30 years ago. The owner/chef has her own cookbook and is known as an innovator in that field of cooking. Unfortunately, my experiences there haven't lived up to the lofty status. I've always left Chicago Diner very underwhelmed, never really been impressed by anything I've had there. Its easy to get excited reading through the myriad of choices they offer, everything sounds SO delicious on the menu. However the flavors never stack up to their descriptions. The problem with Chicago is that there aren't many totally vegan and creative restaurants. So, Chicago Diner will most likely retain its status as THE place to go for vegan food. My suggestion is to seek elsewhere.
