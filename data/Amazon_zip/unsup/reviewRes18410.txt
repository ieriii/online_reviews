This is my favorite Italian BYOB in Chicago. The food is consistently great and the service is very friendly and attentive. Be patient if you are going on a weekend because you will probably wait for a while, but if will be well worth the wait.  They have a great selection of appetizers. My favorite is probably the green bean and tomato salad with buffalo mozzarella and a balsamic and olive oil sauce. This is always a nice and light way to start a meal. They also offer a few mushroom appetizers that I really enjoy.  As for main courses. They offer a wonderful array of home made pastas and their tomato sauces are really rich and wonderfully flavored. My favorite dish has to be the "pappardelle con porcini." This may be the best mushroom sauce I have ever tasted. The chef brilliantly combines the earthiness of the mushrooms with a creamy richness that warms the soul. I think the porcini mushroom sauce may be my favorite sauce of all time. I highly recommend this dish.  If you still have room, they offer some nice deserts.  the staff is great and although there is always a line out the door, they never rush you out of the restaurant. This is a cozy and casual place that serves up top notch food with good service. Also great for groups.  Enjoy!
