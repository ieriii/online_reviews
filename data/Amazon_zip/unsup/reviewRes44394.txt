the roommates and i love sushi. we love to try new places and overindulge, in general. through our hard work, we've found wakamono's rolls are definitely the best bang for your buck.  the range from about five to ten dollars (depending on size and stuffings) and are always fresh and filling.  they start your experience with hot towels and are always quick to refill your - garnished with a cucumber - water. but before you dive into the rolls, make sure you start with a seaweed salad or at least their jalapeno miso soup.  both light and delicious. (note: edamame is nothing special and the portion is tiny. pass on that reg app and go for the two mentioned previously.) rolls to try include: kani chung spicy trio sweet potato salad wakamono yellowtail scallion spicy scallop shitake tempura hmmmm can you tell i've been there a lot? yep, best rolls in the hood. you can even BYOB. try it!
