I love this place! My fiance and I always go here for special occasions. It has a very romantic feel. We love cooking our food together. It's a lot of fun doing fondue instead of your typical restaurant. We always find ourselves laughing and having a blast as we dip our food and sample the different sauces. Not to mention, its all delicious! I recommend for your next date night or special occasion!
