Definitely one of my top three fine dining experiences of all time. We did the 12 course meal with wine pairings...don't know that we really could have consumed much more than that. We had high expectations coming in to this place, and they were actually exceeded. The collision of flavors, the visual and tactile experience of each course, and the simple decor amidst the formal, yet efficient, service made for a very special night. You really do use all of your senses here, so it's important to pay attention so that you don't miss the show that is your meal. Our waiter was our guide along this culinary journey, and he showed personality and humor that we weren't expecting from this type of establishment...it was a pleasant surprise that enhanced the experience even further. And be ready to drop some cash...our set 12 course meal with wine pairings was just shy of $700 with tax and tip for two. Some might consider this overindulgence, but this is just one of those places that every foodie has to try at least once in their lifetime. Grant Achatz definitely deserves every accolade he's ever received.
