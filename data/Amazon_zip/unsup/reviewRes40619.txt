Once again I had the pleasure of trying some new items. One new discovery was that they have Maudite Unibrou on tap IN ADDITION to bottles, which I did not notice the first few times I've been, which I thought was pretty interesting. Had a big group this time and they handled us very well. They said one hour wait, it was exactly a one hour wait. We got a great table in back, waitress was friendly again, they are establishing some consistency here. The Kobe meatballs were great again, had the pretzel which was great and I hadn't tried that before. The mustard was a little bland IMO, no big deal I think the pretzel itself was awesome. The only negative was the Scallops. My friend ordered them and they were tiny, not enough to fill her up and she is a petite woman, so not sure how that is an entree. Crowd was once again very good looking and mixed age.
