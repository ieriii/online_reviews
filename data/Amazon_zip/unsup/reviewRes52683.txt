Fogo de Chao is the gold standard for this format. The salad bar at Brazzaz just doesn't compare, and neither does the service. I even got a few cuts that were a bit well done. The dessert tray looked pretty weak, also. The 2 for 1s are the big selling point for this place, I think.  Otherwise, it's not worth it. Go to Fogo if you are looking for this particular format. It is better in every single way.
