Chicago Diner is just ok. I have been there a lot and will continue to go there because it's great to have an entire menu of vegetarian options and I think they're important to have in Chicago. And a lot of their food isn't bad. But that's it. It's not bad and it's all vegetarian. Nothing great. It's overpriced and my girlfriend can make brunch food better than theirs without a problem, but I'm glad it's here and you can absolutely find better vegetarian food elsewhere.
