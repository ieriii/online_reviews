I love this place! The decor is very old school, dark and dated, but that makes the experience even better! The service is always good , and the food is great! Portions are huge, and you get yummy french onion soup and salad and bread with every entree. The fried calamari app is delicious, had the escargot last time, and it was just ok. I always end up enjoying the appetizers, bread, soup/salad so much that I stuff myself before I even get my entree...so I always have dinner the next day =)
