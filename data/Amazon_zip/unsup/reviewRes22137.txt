My most favorite hot dog place in the world! The burgers and hotdogs here are some of the best I have ever tasted and fries are included. Also, sometimes, you can get it delievered right to your car. Its something that was big in the 50s, but seemed to disappear except for them. The only complaints I have is its a little expensive for a hot dog stand, but worth it and the other problem is on credit cards (which would be nice if they took them since, again, a little pricey)
