I attended a wedding here this past Saturday night. I had never been inside this hotel and I have to say that I thought it was beautiful. The wedding reception was held in the Grand Ballroom, which was a round room. There was a stairway leading above the room which was open so you could see the second floor. They had candles all the way around the stairway and the second landing. It was just gorgeous with the low lit room. The tables were beautiful and they had festive red wine goblets since it is so close to Christmastime. The food was absolutely delectable. Spicy Pumpkin Curried Soup, next came Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato towers with fresh Basil and Balsamic. They then served a Raspberry Sorbet and then for the main course, Filet Mignon with Baby Carrots and Asparagus and a side of Risotto. Being that I am a vegetarian I got a whole plate of that Yummy Risotto. The wine was delicious and was flowing all night long. That is why I had to rent a room that night. No driving for me. Anyway, I got sticker shock the next morning when I had to pay $50.00 to get my car out of the lot. I know we are on Michigan Ave. and all, but geez the room had already set me back $300.00. Anyway, aside from that, what a nice event. I would recommend for anyone to have a wedding reception there. Classy, elegant and just a wonderful time!
