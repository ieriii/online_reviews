Forgot I ate here until I read some recent reviews. Forgot on purpose. I must apologize for not sounding the warning bell sooner. STOP! If you like to taste your food and not have what's allegedly "meat" overpowered by the rip-off flavor of hot-ass jalapeno, then turn around and walk out immediately. Any (I mean even a Pepe's) Mexican chain rez could at least give you something that won't make your stomach feel worse after sitting down. Also - and this is becoming more imp. given the E-con-on-ME, if I can get good taqueria food, without the inflated "restaurant" prices and obligatory-undeserved tip, I'll do it. Will I be back soon? No way, Leon.
