Whenever we want a good meal it's Wishbone. The Lincoln Ave location early evening's is filled with small Lincoln Park parents and thier small children, but Wishbone has an adult only room in the back which is great. I always like the blackened salmon when I go, the sides are always good with a wide choice which often changes from visit to visit. Since I keep coming back, year after year, I usually will try a daily special. They never disappoint. Last night is was a blackened New York Strip Steak, with blue cheese, the blue cheese was in a little dish, and was actually a little watery, so I dipped a couple of times and that was it, but the steak was cooked perfectly and very tasty. I say, go often, try different things. The wait staff gets an A+.
