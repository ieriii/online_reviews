Super-delicious dining experience. Friendly, helpful wait staff. I've tried about 5 different pizzas and three appetizers [so far - I will be back!]. Creative combinations of toppings and fresh ingredients on to-die-for crust. This is not Chicago pizza, folks. The crust is light and slightly chewy with that wood burned, smoky flavor. Pizzas arrive in about 5 minutes. Excellent prosecco. But forget all that, what you really need to have is the Tiramisu. The best ever.
