Wow. Amazing. Fabulous. I was SO impressed. Had dinner here with the Bf and his parents and did the tasting menu(PLENTY of food) for $55 a person. A pitcher of the seasonal sangria with pommegranite, a couple fun drinks- loved it all. My fav's: pulpo con palatas (Spanish octopus) peltotas de calabrazo y cardo (butternut squash dumplings, lamb ragout, truffle...) cebollas rellenas (garrotxa stuffed cipollini onions) and some croquets dessert PHENOMONAL And the service was amazing. I cannot wait to go back. Also...the server warned us it would all have garlic- but it was subtle enough that I still really tasted and enjoyed my food.
