OK so the Eggs Benedict was one of the best I have tasted. But a breakfast that DOESN'T serve lattes or cappuccinos? Just plain black watery coffee? I mean, are you kidding? I need a real caffeine fix to go with my eggs. What's the use of breakfast if it doesn't wake you up? Seriously, I am not going back, simply because I do not believe in a breakfast place that doesn't own an expresso machine.
