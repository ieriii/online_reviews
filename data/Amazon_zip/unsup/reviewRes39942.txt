This place has so much to love about I it, I don't even know where to start. Considering the place is so small and so popular, I was surprised we got right in; I certainly wasn't complaining though. Next, our waitress Stefanie was fantastic - uber friendly and extremely helpful in answering our questions about the menu. Now, the food part. The buffalo frog legs were delicious (especially dipped in the mousse-like blue cheese dip). The meatballs were decent (and helped remind me how yummy polenta is), and my entre of the slow roasted cauliflower, lentils, caramelized onion, raisins, pickled mango and cucumber raita could have used a bit of a kick (more mango/raisins might have done the trick), but it was still scrumptious. However, my dad's pork belly was rockstar good. If you're not a vegetarian, I'd say go with that option - you won't regret it. The spot itself is adorable - dark and cozy, it's a great locale for a dinner date. And the bourbon list is pretty impressive - I almost ordered the Michters since I've yet to see it offered in any restaurant around Chicago, but the beer list was calling my name just a little too loudly to be ignored. A full page of bourbon offerings ain't too shabby though, if you're looking for something with a little edge to accompany your meal. Great alcohol and food - reason enough to love this joint.
