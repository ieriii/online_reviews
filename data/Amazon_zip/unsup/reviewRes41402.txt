In the top five meals I have ever eaten. I consumed the vegetarian 4 course and my bf went for the carnivore option--both were packed with flavor, cooked to perfection, and delicately assembled. Hands down the best tofu I have ever eaten--it melted in my mouth like souffle. The flavors were creative, diverse, and well matched--the chef took risks and all the risks paid off in beautiful, rich, and luxurious dishes. Yum.
