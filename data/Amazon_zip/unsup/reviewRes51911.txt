This was my only Chicago style pizza stop of my trip and it was well worth the trip. Some of my group had already eaten at Lou's so Gino's was their second pizza joint of the trip. First thing I noticed was the graffiti all over the walls. I guess that added to the quirkiness of the place. After waiting for about 20 minutes, we got seated and we immediately ordered our pizza right away as it was going to be another 45 minutes to arrive. We also ordered salad since none of us wanted to have indigestion later for not balancing out the heavy carbs with some veggies. We tried the sausage and cheese, the plain cheese, and the spinach and cheese. I had only two slices of plain cheese and sausage and while they each were individually satisfying, the remaining crust left me dissatisfied. I think I ate the crust dry as-is just to taste the flavor but I think I should had asked for some more sauce on the side as a dip.  With the amount of food that we ordered, it came out to only $15 per person which wasn't too bad. I hope to one day come back to try Lou's or Giordano's. Overall, a quality pizza place but a mixed bag in terms of satisfying my Chicago style pizza expectations.
