Lover took me here as a surprise apology dinner. What did she do for me to deserve this? I don't remember. But who cares - this place is pretty awesome and worth it. As the previous yelpers have mentioned, this place can only be romantic if you have a booth. Otherwise, it's just like any other dimly lit restaurant - still perfect for a casual date or any get together. Actually, it wasn't "dimly lit". It was dark as hell. Fortunately, the candles provided just enough light to get around...so I really don't know what everyone is complaining about. The food wasn't orgasmic, but it was definitely above average. I think the only way a person cannot enjoy it is if they don't pay any mind to the cooking times given by the waiters because everything I cooked accordingly came out perfect. If you're a seafood lover, DEFINITELY go for the "Deluxe Seafood" and then dip everything in butter...because everything tastes better with butter. They include 8 other sauces...but I still dipped everything in butter... I'm such a fatty.... ANYWAY, if you're confused and can't decide whether you love meat more than seafood, then go for the Prince Geja's Combination - you get a little bit of everything but just enough to get you full. Speaking of which, the food is PERFECTLY portioned for the average person. So don't be a fat-ass and complain about not having enough because this restaurant made me nap afterwards. Cheese and chocolate fondue with every meal. The service, on the other hand, was orgasmic. I fell in love with our waitress. She was so nice, and perky...probably on drugs but it's ok because I really appreciated her enthusiasm. She also didn't make me feel like a complete failure for not being familiar with the menu by not assuming we've been there before. She never made me feel rushed...I want her in my pocket. You do come out smelling like the restaurant but I didn't mind it...it provided me with a sense of euphoria at the end of the night.
