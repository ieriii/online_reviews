On a recent trip to Chicago, I decided that a deep dish was something that needed to be tried. It was either going to be Gino's or Giordano's, and Gino's won out as my husband had eaten there before. The sauce and toppings were great, but the cornmeal based crust fought with the topping flavors. I would have preferred a more traditional bread dough style crust, as I really didn't like the crust on this pizza at all. Next time we will try Giordano's, or UNO.
