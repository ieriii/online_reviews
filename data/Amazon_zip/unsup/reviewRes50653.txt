This morning, we gave Big Jones a 3rd try. I guess that 3rd time really is the charm because, after a couple of non-spectacular meals at this place, this morning's brunch really hit the ball out of the park. You see, it's like this: We're Southern girls transplanted to Chicago. So, just because "mama" is in the kitchen and there is a cheesy grit on your menu, doesn't mean that you'll fool us. Heck, last time we went, this place didn't even have sweet tea. Even McD's has picked up on that trend. However, the reviews have been looking up as of late and the website boasts a newly fangled menu that drops words like "natural" and "local." It is only 3 blocks away, why not give it another try? My sweetheart had the fried tomato benedict and I had the country breakfast complete with--you guessed it--more fried tomatoes and a heaping serving of cheese grits. What was once bland and textureless was perfectly seasoned and comforting. And the free beneits--even though we had to beg for them--were worth the whining. Overall, it was the best breakfast I've had in a long, long time. In fact, I left longing for Charleston and our long-gone days of crabbing with a neckbone. While this Southern girl isn't completely sold yet (it takes more than 1 good meal to win me over), my breakfast had me whistlin' dixie for a few hours. And in the middle of a Chicago winter, what more could you ask for?
