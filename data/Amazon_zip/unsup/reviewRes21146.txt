not gonna lie, it's probably a bad thing that i live close to XOCO. i've always been a fan of the Bayless corner, and the latest addition is no exception. sure, the start of your visit is gonna feel something like waiting for rations in post-war russia... but it's more than likely worth it. some great gourmet takes on tortas. the cochinita pibil is really phenomenal! the soups are all pretty phenomenal too. the truly dangerous territory for me is the hot chocolate and churros. god forbid i walk by there five times in a day.. 'cause i'm gonna stop, even if it's just for a warm (albeit small) cup of awesome and a side of awesome. cheers, Rick.
