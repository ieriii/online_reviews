lunch was a charming experience and a wonderful bargain.for $9.50 a beautiful plate of grilled shrimp,noodles,bean sprouts,vegetables ,and egg roll,preceded by a salad and soup,and a great fresh sqeezed lemonade[+refills].the beef short ribs were very tasty but have the expected bits of fat and bone.highly recommend this.
