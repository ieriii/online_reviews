Love breakfast? Yolk's your place. Don't love breakfast? Yolk is still your place. Hate eggs? You can STILL find something on the menu.Yolk is my go-to place when someone suggests brunch. The food is excellent, the portions are huge, and the service is top-notch. Now, it is a busy place, so if you're looking something quiet, I wouldn't come here. But otherwise, this place is great for a date or groups of people.I am an egg-lover, so I always look for eggs that I can't make at home, or would be too time-consuming. Yolk has a huge variety of egg options, which always overwhelms me. Their french toast is also to die for. I usually don't order sweet things like that for breakfast, but I will at Yolk because they're unique and always delicious. (Try the Red Velvet French Toast sometime--holy CRAP! WOW.)Anyway, if you're looking for a good brunch place, come to Yolk. If you're looking for a good brunch place for either a date or group, come to Yolk. If you're looking for something intimate, maybe not, though I've never had a problem talking to my date.
