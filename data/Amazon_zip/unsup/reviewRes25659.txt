This was a pretty nice place to go to for lunch. I came here with my husband, mostly from seeing pictures of their dessert selection online. We first walked up to the counter where I think you could order sandwiches, only to find out later that we were supposed to sit down at a table and a server would be with us (wish there was a sign telling us that when we came in, or if there was, we weren't paying attention). We each got an artopita, and the side (potato or pasta) was more than what we expected.  Although we were full from lunch, we still wanted dessert (that was the main reason for going).  Pretty good food and reasonable prices for the quantity you get. The service was decent until what happened at the end of the meal: the server came back to the table after we paid to get the tip (it wouldn't have been so bad if she went there after we left the table), but I guess that was so none of the patrons would steal the tip?
