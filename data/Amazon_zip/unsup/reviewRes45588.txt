Almost 5 stars. Service Could have been a bit more welcoming, less awkward and at one point the bartender was blatantly rude. Food is awesome. Try the Lemon and Rosemary roasted chicken or the New York Strip both are really good. Specials looked good as well. Everything from the onion rings and cod brittles to the mahi mahi and the grilled chicken Cesar salad. GOOD GOOD GOOD Interior is reminiscent to the restaurant in the Skylon Hotel in Dublin. Best birthday dinner ever!
