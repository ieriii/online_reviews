This place was a 45 minute wait but I'd say it's worth it if you're a tourist. It's not practical if you want a quick lunch. The Magnificent Mile is right next to the place so there's plenty to do while you wait. Also, you can pre-order your pizza so it's right there when you sit down. But the magical moment is when the waitress lifts out that first piece and the cheese just goes for miles! And the first bite is so very good. Eat it fast, when the cheese cools it's not as tasty. 1 slice can fill your whole stomach.
