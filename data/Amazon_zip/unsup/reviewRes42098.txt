Pan and stuffed pizza by the slice is pretty rare in this town, so Art of Pizza is a gem for just that reason--they have both. The pizza is pretty darn good, and they always have a wide selection of slices. The last time that I was there it was so varied that I struggled to make a choice. Thumbs up for having interesting vegetable options such as spinach/mushroom and spinach/mushroom/onion rather than just boring single-veggie slices.  My earlier review seems to intimate that I left unimpressed, but while it's not the best on earth, I would call this pizza top-five in Chicago. I still wish that it was hotter when it hits the plate, but that's a tradeoff for having so many slice options prt  manger. Fresh out of the oven it might be top-three.
