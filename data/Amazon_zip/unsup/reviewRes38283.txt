I don't care if it's pizza or not, their "Deep Dish Pie" is delicious (if you're lucky enough to have it arrive while its still hot). As a counter to that, their service would have to improve to become ridiculously bad and the restaurant is not a pleasant place to hang out while you grow a full beard waiting for your pizza. I think the Neapolitan word for inefficient, rude, and lazy must be "Giordano". It doesn't take three hours to assemble an automobile and it shouldn't take that long for them to assemble and cook a commodity food product they've been selling for decades, much less the half hour you'll spend waiting for them to walk from the cash register to the kitchen when you're picking up an order. The servers and people answering the phone, to a man, have been rude and indifferent every time I've patronized the venue. They must recruit their workers from the Chicago School for People Who Shouldn't Work With The Public. The restaurant itself is conveniently located near the loop, but suffers from being cramped and poorly laid out with uncomfortable seating and ear splitting "music" piped over an overdriven speaker system.
