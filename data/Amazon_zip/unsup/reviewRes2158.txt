Went here at 11am on a weekday just before I left Chicago, still had to wait in line for 20 min! It was okay though cause we had planned accordingly. Now I love hot dogs, but of course since these are specialty sausages they don't bear THAT much in common taste-wise. I ordered some of the wilder things (elk sausage) and I liked it, but I didn't see God like a lot of the other reviewers. Worth going back to with out-of-town visitors, and I loved how comparatively cheap it was, and the decoration was adorable, but I wouldn't make the trip out to Avondale all the time just to eat here myself.
