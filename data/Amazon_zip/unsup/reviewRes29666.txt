If the food is good and service is good there's no way you cannot get 5 Stars from me. So this will not be the exception, The Diner is AMAZING. I have taken a few friends that have never had vegan food and have fallen in love with it. The burgers in this place are amazing and the sweet potatoes fries are equally good. My fiance likes their breakfast bowl with the biscuits and gravy. I love their shakes (my favorite chocolate peanut butter) and brownies and cookies and cheesecake, the list goes one. I love the whole diner feel and the waiters are so friendly. If you want to try vegan but are afraid of what it might taste like, I recommend you go here and try their burgers. I tried their gyros and was disappointed but maybe that's because I am super picky about my gyros, besides that everything else is pretty delicious.
