I was excited to try the place out- have gotten take out for lunch and it was tasty and inexpensive. Guess you get what you pay for though, because dine in on a Saturday night was just so so. No reservations, so even though we went early, we had to wait. (I called and they said they weren't taking resos, not sure if that was just tonight). The ceviche was fresh and generous (should be for $8.50) but our appetizer came out at the same time as all our food. Some of the things I asked for she charged me extra- but had she just said we were already getting that (flour tortillas and guacamole) with our orders, I would have passed. (Especially since it all came out at once!) This fish taco was good- but the steak and chicken were shredded and not so great- flavor was lacking, and salsa was never refilled. The place is so full of light- that it almost seemed like it would have better ambiance if they just dimmed it a bit and gave it a cozy feel. The drinks looked good- but I couldn't drink, so I asked for the NA beer on the menu, but they were out. Oh well- it was OK- and just because it was in the neighborhood, we may go back- but if there was something better within walking distance- I would go there instead. I really don't know how people could think anything they served here was truly BEST in Chicago- this seems more like chain type quality and flavor then anything to knock your socks off. Service was friendly though.
