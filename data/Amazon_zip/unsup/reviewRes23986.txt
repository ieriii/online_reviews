maybe their regular dishes are better or maybe they gave us all the crappy hot pot stuff b/c we had 25 people. i dont know. but the lamb was hard to chew as was the beef - which was also SUPER fatty. there wasn't a lot of other stuff to put in the hot pot (at least not what i'm used to from california) the meatball tasted weird. i dont know what was wrong w/ it, but it was just nasty. i asked for pork and they didn't have any. it took them forever and a day to bring out new plates of meat and they only refilled the soup once all night.
