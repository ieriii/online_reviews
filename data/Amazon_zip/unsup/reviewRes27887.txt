If you think Caesar Salad or Corn Bisque is boring or can't be reinvented, then you haven't been to Graham Elliot. It's the first place I have ever been where Linne Calodo was on the wine list.... It may have been Sticks & Stones for $150 but it was still Linne Calodo - Trevisan being one of my all time favorite California winemakers. Service was great, ambience was dramatic but unpretentious and fun. I enjoyed my first Graham Elliot experience.
