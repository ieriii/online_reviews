Ever been to an event with festival seating or sat on the lawn for a popular concert at an amphitheater? That mad rush of humanity when the gates first open is similar to the process for getting a table at Frontera Grill. Just Go before they open, wait in line, put your name in, and hit up the bar area for a drink and appetizer while you wait for your table. The guacamole is excellent but really only big enough for two people. I loved their corn tortilla ships. We were there on a Wednesday and I had the daily special, Cochinita Pibil, which is achiote-marinated Maple Creek Farm suckling pig roasted in banana leaves. The dish itself is good stuff. Great flavor on the pork and not too dry. The side of black beans were a little bland but a touch of the hot sauce on the table spiced them up well. The server will likely warn you about the salsa served on the side and you would be smart to heed that warning. It is very spicy and a little bit goes a long way. They have a signature beer, a Belgian wheat, that is brewed for them by Goose Island. It's definitely worth a try for the beer drinkers in the group. Overall, the food was worth the trip and I appreciate the efforts Chef Bayless puts forth to bring quality meat and produce from local farms to his customers. I did knock off a star due to their seating system. Why not take reservations? The only two options shouldn't be standing in line in the hot sun 30-45 before the doors open, showing up right when they open and waiting 30 minutes for a table, or showing up later and waiting 2+ hours for a table.
