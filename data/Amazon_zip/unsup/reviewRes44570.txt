Went here yesterday to pick up some kind of comforting baked good because I was jacked up only having tea and no food so I was jittery. Anyways, it was the 2nd time I've been here and I was looking for their gourmet "fig newton" but they didn't have it. So I went with their cherry scone and a red velvet cup cake price was 5 something for both, but it was worth it!! The Scone was the best I ever had!!! The cupcake (even though it was small) was delicious and cracklicious! A nice place to go to when you want to reward yourself and indulge!
