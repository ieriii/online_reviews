I really loved Simply It! I'm sure I've passed it many times without really noticing it, and it is certainly a gem. It's great that it's BYOB, and they do not mind you lingering around for a few hours to finish your wine. All of the food we tried was great and reasonably priced- hot pot and spring rolls for appetizers (get the spring rolls, the sauce is so good), my entree was Catfish in a Clay Pot- sort of picked this one for the weird name but it did not disappoint, and other friends of mine had the calamari in an actual hollowed out pineapple. Not only did that look cool but it tastes awesome. Everyone here is friendly and cares about your experience in addition to the food. Would be a great place to go before a night out as well.
