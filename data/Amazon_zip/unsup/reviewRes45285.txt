My boyfriend and I went here for the first time the other night, for Valentine's Day dinner, a night that he usually loathes going out for, due to the crowdedness, overpriced menus, and poor service that usually go hand in hand w/ the occasion. I was able to convince him to go out this year, and fortunately, we were both pleasantly surprised! Our waiter was prompt and friendly. Food came out in a timely fashion, despite the packed house. The food was EXCELLENT!!!!(And I never say that lightly). All the food was great, but the entrees really stole the show - my boyfriend had the double-cut lamb chops and I had a scallops special. Everything was cooked to perfection, the flavors were excellent. It was a culinary delight! It wasn't cheap, but for a special occasion, it was definitely worth the price. All in all, it was a perfect v-day meal, and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes.
