ok..I wanted to love this place, especially after seeing Rick Bayless win Top Chef Masters, but everything was just ok...I went with a group of 6 and we probably ordered 10/11 different Tortas, and Caldos. I WANTED to love the Pepito, but the it just fell a bit short on the flavor. It's great for Churros and Cafe in the morning, especially because it's only 2 blocks from my apt.....but I wasn't really "WOWed"...the staff is GREAT though and very lively atmosphere..!
