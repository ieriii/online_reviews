Hmmm....kind of a cool vibe. Hidden entrance. Somewhat Swank interior (but certainly not overly chic...kind of farm house crossed with Versailles...done on a budget). Cocktails were good...but I am getting sick of the whole "craft cocktail" lets baffle them with all kinds of exotic combinations shtick (kind of like the libation equivalent of duckfat or truffles) All kinds of liquor I have never heard of mixed with bizarre tasting condiments, etc...and the drinks...are ....ok. Where the heck is a good cosmoplitan? A margarita?  On the plus side...good music (it must have been Elvis Costello night)...somewhat romantic...but overall...I can think of many other lounges that are more enjoyable. Good...but certainly not great.
