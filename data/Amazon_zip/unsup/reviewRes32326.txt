Visited this place twice during a trip to Chicago, once for brunch, once for dessert/drinks as they carry a gluten free beer. I should preface this review by saying as a traveling vegan, my options are all the more limited by my intolerances for soy and gluten which I avoid eating. My partner and I expected a Mecca for vegans in Chicago here but were slightly disappointed by the seemingly extensive menu. For brunch my partner ordered a side of biscuits and gravy with chorizo which looked incredible and apparently tasted as good, a completely opposite portion size to his one piece of French toast beside some scrambled tofu. He said the flavor was great but was perplexed that two pieces of French toast amounted to one slice of bread cut in half. Although they have gluten free bread there is no gf French toast option and no offer to accommodate by request. Every vegan restaurant in Toronto and many other major cites makes a gf pancake, they do not- which I find strange since they have gone to the effort of offering a separate gluten free menu. They were out of several dishes/ingredients including quinoa and corn cakes which most of the gf options were based on if one avoids soy, this was at noon on a Saturday. I ordered the only option left, a grilled cheese on gf bread with daiya cheese, deliciously done but with totally superfluous lettuce, tomato, cucumber added, a chewed up pickle on the side and a tiny portion of the side order of kale salad which was oily kale with shredded carrot, no other dressing not even salt. Overall it didn't feel like much effort is made here, with no almond or rice milk available for coffee as well, it felt like I was getting as many 'no"s' as a vegan does in any other resto.  Service was cavalier as well.
