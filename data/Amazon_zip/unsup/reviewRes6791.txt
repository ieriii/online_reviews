I came here on a Saturday evening around 8:30 for dinner. This place is enormous - they have main seating, seating in the back, and outdoor seating. We started off with apps by splitting the grilled calamari, which I wasn't a big fan of. I don't think balsamic goes well with calamari, and it both looked and tasted strange. I've NEVER seen calamari that isn't sliced into rings, so I was taken aback by these odd, tube-like, chewy things on my plate. We also had the stella salad, which I approve of because it was fresh and featured some fruit. For my main, I ordered the zuppa de pesce, which came in a ridiculously large ceramic tub. By tub, I do mean tub because it was larger than my face. I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, and I'm ultimately giving a 3.5 rounding down because I've been eating leftovers from this tub for the past two days and I'm starting to resent it because it's still not done (and I swear that I'm a big eater). Also, the mussels were kinda stinky and just not fresh. My bf's vitello ossobuco was delicious though. I'm a huge fan of veal, unwillingly so because the idea of eating baby cows is sad so I never order it, but I guess I don't mind devouring it if someone else ordered it (and it's just so tasty). It was fork tender and came with some very tasty lasagna. For dessert, we had the chocolate hazelnut panna cotta, which was super rich and resembled a molded pudding. I liked it, and it went well with the free coffee (which you can get from checking in on yelp!). Service was good initially, but became super slow at the end of the meal. It took forever to get our table cleared and to get our check, but they did keep my water glass full throughout the meal, so I guess the service averages out to good. Overall, a good meal at a decent restaurant, but not one of my faves.
