I shocked that the health department has not close this place down. One time, my fiance, a couple of our friends and i went in to eat. As we sat down waiting for the food to come, a roach crawled right in front of us on the table then onto the wall and made its way into the kitchen area. We walked right out and haven't been back. Who would???!!!
