It's a-ok. I love that it's all organic food. That one extra points for me, but I agree that I don't think all the flavor is there. Does organic have to mean bland food? I had the nanadict. I loved the concept and was super excited for it, but I really thought it lacked flavor. The pupusas that was the main part of the dish really was tough. It seemed like they cooked it earlier and had it in a warming area for awhile. It should have much more moist. The eggs were a little too over poached. The sauce really did not add anything to the dish. The potatoes were good though, the chorizo was tasty, just wish it was a little spicier, but that's personal preference. Service was great, ambiance cute, and coffee was good. I think that it definitely has potential. It has a tweek a few things about it's menu, be a little riskier with flavor, and it can get there. Great addition to the area and I hope to come back soon.
