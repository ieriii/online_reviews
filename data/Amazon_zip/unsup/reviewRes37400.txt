Hopleaf is legendary. I'm just upset that all the years when I lived near Andersonville, hung out there and ate in many of the places there, I didn't get my ass over to Hopleaf until now! WTF was I thinking? Anyway, yesterday brought a rare moment of happiness as I had a most awesome DUCK reuben along with an incredible glass of Dark Horse Blueberry Stout after chatting up the owner and friendly bartenders on St. Paddy's Day. The reuben is a slow-roasted Pekin duck with cranberry sauce, house-made sauerkraut, emmenthaler cheese on toasted marble rye. Honestly, I can't recall having duck this tender in a very long time. You can tell someone spent a fair bit of time putting together this masterpiece of a rich sandwich. They are respected for their extensive beers, but I had no idea that Hopleaf had so much duck on the menu and look forward to putting it all to the test. -- Update: went back the next day to try the duck meatballs. Wasn't impressed. The meat tasted like a so-so blend of turkey and soy. Would never have guessed that it was duck as there was nothing gamey tasting present. There was a bit of hot spice there, but something was missing. The risotto cake was nice. Would be nice if they somehow incorporated the sauce comes with the fries into this dish for a bit more zest. However, I sat next to and met Julie who ordered the CB&J and she said it was excellent. Sean ordered the mussels and they were quite tasty, seasoned well with garlic. They are some of the meatiest mussels I've had served. They were very generous with the serving amount also.
