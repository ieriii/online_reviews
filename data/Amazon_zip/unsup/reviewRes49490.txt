I really enjoyed my dinner of hanger steak and the delicious chocolate rice pudding dessert at Bin 36. Actually, I will say that I probably liked the food better than their advertised specialties of wine & cheese.  I had a four course wine flight of "All About ME Reds", and really... none of them stood out exceptionally. All were good, but none were mindblowing. Similar experience with the Bin 36 cheese plate, which was generously large for our table of 4, but similarly didn't have any particular standouts. Serving it on an elevated platter was a nice-looking touch also, but made it difficult to get at, and potentially hazardous - you could knock over a glass of wine easily! As far as wine & cheese go, I prefer the low key, friendly atmosphere of Webster's Wine Bar. But Bin 36 will do in a pinch, and they definitely win in the meal department. For the overall quality of food and wine, I thought that the price was a fair value. For most people, though, it's not a "once a week" dinner establishment - we walked out at about $50/plate, including cheese, wine, entree, and dessert. Overall, a nice place!
