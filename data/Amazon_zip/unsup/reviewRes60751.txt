My fiance and I love this place! It has become our Friday night hangout. The turkey burgers are the best in the city and they have great beers on tap. And we absolutely love the music and having the concerts playing on the TVs. HOWEVER - recently they have only been playing sports games on the TVs. Lockdown is not a sports bar! They are having an identity crisis. When we asked the Mgr, he said he was doing what the people want....but, how could the people possible want to not be able to hear the game on the overwhelming sound system. I don't want to go there ever again if all they are going to play is sports.
