I've lived in Roscoe Village for three years now and have always avoided this place. Didn't want to go in fear of a let down. So on a blizzardry not going to work day, the wife and I decided to head to Hot Doug's.... I mean, there's 5 inches on the ground and snows still coming down, no one would be at Hot Doug's right?? 20 minutes wait out in the blizzard and then 10 minutes more inside later....  I didn't really mind the wait... It's kind of like an initiation ritual, everyone has to do it, no VIP treatment here..... You wait outside staring in as watching people shove handfuls of fries and dogs down their gullet.... I was practically drooling by the time we got to the counter. It was worth it. There was a slight fear in me when I placed the order. I had a mental picture of the soup nazi at the counter... any slight movement and I would be sent out the door empty handed.  But it was quite opposite. Doug was great, easy to converse with. I ordered one specialty dog and the spicy hot dog. The wife had a specialty and we split an order of the duck fat fries. They also had great sodas in there fridge, I got the orange creme, the wife got the Berghoff root beer. There were plenty of seats inside. We came out of there smelling like encased meat and the line somehow was even longer.
