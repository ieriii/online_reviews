Ordered dinner from here on Friday night. It was a bit on the early side, but the delivery was super fast. The Godzilla roll was fantastic, the ungai and spicy tuna were really good, but I was a bit disappointed with the spider roll. My friend loves the honey roll, it is a bit too sweet for me. I would have given four stars, but all they have are rolls - it would have been nice to have the option of nigiri as well.
