I dined at Ruth's Chris in Chicago last night and wanted to comment on my service experience. The food was as exceptional as always (the ribeye cooked to perfection, seasoned appropriately, hot plate!!!), but the service was what separated this experience! From the beginning, the hostess to the bussers treated me and my guest as VIPs. I must have heard my name recited a dozen times throughout service. Every detail, from my water being constantly refilled to my napkin being refolded after I excused myself from the table, was exceeded! Not only did my guest and I enjoy the attention and service we received from the staff, we also had a great discussion with the manager about the history of Ruth's Chris (Ruth was a VERY impressive woman). My guest and I were truly appreciative of the genuine service and hospitality we received. We have promised ourselves to return on a more frequent basis and visit our new friends at Ruth's.
