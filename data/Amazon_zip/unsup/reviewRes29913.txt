two words: veggie hash. Amazing! I can't even begin to say how awesome the veggie hash is. It was served with a side of eggs and toast, which I didn't touch because I loved the veggie hash. I think I may have dreams about the veggie hash. I will be back. The atmosphere is perfect for a brunch. No wait. Alcohol to be had (if you have an id, i left mine in the car... darn). Low key neighborhood restaurant feel. I felt as if I was in someone's basement/house.  I really can't rave enough about the veggie hash. It was so good. I think next time I may just ask for a plate of that.
