Stopped here after I found out that Kuma's was having their block party.  Didnt want to deal with the crowd...just wanted some good food. So I headed over to Lockdown.   Granted it was a Saturday afternoon, but It was empty.  2 other customers besides me!? Kuma's is usually packed all day. Anyways, A little disappointed that they didnt have any concerts playing on the flat screens(which I look forward too), but they did have the soccer game on.  I sat down at the bar(pretty much the only customer) and ordered a fat tire.  Perused through the menu and decided to go with the POW. It had roasted red peppers, blue cheese, and crispy prosciutto.  I liked it! Plus their hand cut fries are awesome. Kumas should learn from this.  I'll take hand cut fries over regular waffle fries anyday.  The only thing I have to point out is Lockdown burgers seem to be on the salty side? I've had 2 different burgers here and they were noticeably salty. Maybe its just me...I dont know. But I still ate the thing.  Finished the whole plate, vs Kumas which I always walk out with a container with leftovers. I figure I need to return on a busier weeknight to see what this place is reall like.  4 stars for now. Hopefully next visit will bring that last star.
