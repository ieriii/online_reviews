Really good pan fried chicken! Also, get the collard greens, they have pieces of turkey in them and they are AWESOME. Went here for their lunch, and the service took a little longer than expected, so that's one star off, but the food was quite good.  As a side note, coming here has made me realize some "patterns" I tend to follow when ordering food. If a place makes fried chicken, I don't even see the rest of the menu. I get fried chicken tunnel vision, which is delicious, but severely limits my decision making. I love fried chicken.
