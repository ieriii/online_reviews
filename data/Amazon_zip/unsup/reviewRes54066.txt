I just wanted to say thanks to Maura (I hope I spelled it right) and everybody else who collaborated on Sun. night to make my first visit to the Violet Hour a super great one. I was in town visiting from Denver and have been wanting to go get a drink here for a long time. Unfortunately my friend and I arrived just a little too late and almost weren't allowed in, I whined about being there all the way from Colorado and luckily we got in. (Thank you floor manager & hostess for being cool). I started talking to Maura about bartending and drinks in general and she was so kind and made me a Juliet and Romeo. (even though we had originally been told it was too late for anything other than a beer and/or shot) Super delicious, I loved it. Wish I could be there more often to try out more drinks, this place is really quite lovely. I will be back as soon as I can! Here's to your continued success.
