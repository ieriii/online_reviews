update: seriously! you don't want to wait forty minutes, do you? even for hot doug goodness. 1) call in your order ahead from, say, the corner of addison and damen. 2) drive to dougs, park. 3) excuse yourself past the lined up masses, walk up to the side of the     cashier, say, "i have a pick up", pay. 4) walk to the back. 5) your bag will be there or ready in less than 5 minutes. 6) chow down in your car. you didn't really want to eat in that crowded place anyway, did you? doug's is the best! along with every combination of regular dogs imaginable, they offer a veggie dog and two kinds of chicken sausages, minimum, for those few of us who don't eat red meat dogs. i love their santa fe chicken sausage, charred to perfection, and their fries, which are always fried up brown and crunchy, not limp and undercooked.
