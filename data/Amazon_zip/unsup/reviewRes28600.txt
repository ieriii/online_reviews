Our night at Frontera started out a little shaky, but was great overall. We came without a reservation and found it was an hour and fifteen minute wait. No big deal. We quickly got seats at the bar and ordered a couple margaritas and some guacamole. The blood orange margarita came straight up and was tasty, but a bit too sweet for me and my boyfriend's mezcal was too bitter. We hit our stride though with the second round of drinks, the paloma (perfect) and a standard gold margarita. The guacamole was amazing, probably the best I've ever had. However, there was a fly buzzing around (in the dead of winter?) that wouldn't leave us, or the guac, alone and there was a hair in the chips. That was a little annoying, but we quickly forgot about it because our table was ready about 30 minutes early. The art in the dining room was really interesting, but the lighting was terrible. There were bright track lights pointing every where. It created harsh shadows and was terribly unflattering. Our waiter was Edgar and he was a delight! He was attentive and helpful and had some great recommendations. We started with a platter of oysters and ceviche and an order of the sopes. Everything was fresh and delicious especially the tasty little sopes! For our entrees we had the duck breast with mole and the grass-fed flank steak. They were incredible. I thought the portions were just right. I finished my plate and felt warm and contented instead of stuffed. It was just a perfect meal. We tried the pecan pie for dessert and it was so decadent and rich! We had such a wonderful time and we can't wait to go back again.
