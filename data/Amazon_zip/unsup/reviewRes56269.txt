I came here before summer for my brithday dinner but this is the first time I came back to this pretty restaurant because I kinda busy for my senior year at DePaul and I heard that they got the great lunch special. And it's absolutely right. I got a beef banh mi and it's so so good. I used to eat Vietnamese banh mi in uptown but this one is so much better and the price is unbelievable. I just had to pay $6.95 for my lunch special which included sandwich banh mi, salad, soup, egg roll, drink and deserts. I was surprise because everyday I have to pay more than $7 for the Big Mac meal which is not fresh and healthy at all. I'm so glad because from now,I don't have to worry about my lunch anymore because I got a great restaurant with the best food and wonderful service next to my campus. LOVE IT !!!!!!!!
