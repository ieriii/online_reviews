Let me start by saying that I'm a fan of all foods Asian, period. However, Vietnamese seems to be the hardest to find in its FINEST form. Not as popular as the ubiquitous Chinese, Thai, and sushi joints, competently executed Vietnamese is a rare treat.First, a few word, the service is perfect, with knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly waitstaff. We just walked into the restaurant without reservations in rush hour last Saturday but they still tried to get for me a table. We waited for a table around 15 minutes while we was drinking lovely hot teas which given from the little owner. After that, foods went out really fast and all of them were so fantastic. I got the Coconut and Mango beef when my husband got the Mahi-mahi which came out after the healthy spring rolls. Mouthwatering good. Everything was wonderful. Outstanding work, Simply It!!!In summary: highly recommended! If you enjoy Vietnamese food, or you're looking for something new to try, Simply It should not be missed, but don't forget to for reservations because they are usually extremely busy on weekend.
