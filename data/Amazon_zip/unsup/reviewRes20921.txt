Since I can't bring myself to give any sushi less than 4 stars, cuz I'm a lover, I'll give Coast 4 stars just for serving sushi. However, I was a little put off by the atmosphere for one thing, VERY loud and close. I realize most sushi "bars" are this way, but I felt like the acoustics were way off. We went on a Wednesday night (I believe) and weren't aware that it was BYOB. They didn't have a table ready for us for our reservation but it worked out because we needed to walk down to the store for some drink. We returned with some beer and had to wait some more for a table. They assured us it wouldn't be more than 10 more minutes. 30 minutes later, we were seated. Our waiter was very nice and funny, and he even gave us a little bit of free sake since we were the last ones there (we waited forever!). The sushi was alright, sometimes it depends on the day of the week that you go, but it seemed a little bland and just not up to par. We got several pieces of Nigiri and also a few rolls (spicy creamy, and something with eel). All of it fine, just not great. The lighting in Coast is a little strange too, around the perimeter are spot lights that point down on you if you're sitting in the bench seat side of the tables for 2. They kept dimming and brightening them all night. That was a little annoying. At one point it was so dark in there that the candle seemed too bright so we blew it out. Then it was so bright 30 seconds later, that i thought i was being interrogated. I might give Coast another chance and maybe update my review at a later date, but for now, I only like Coast because they serve sushi. That and that alone.
