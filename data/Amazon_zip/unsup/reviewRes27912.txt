At first I wasn't sure about the neighborhood but that's just me growing up in a small town in Michigan. The restaurant seemed very family oriented since they don't allow smoking and they don't serve alcohol-BUT it's BYOB. Looking into their kitchen you can see it's very clean. Lots of stainless steel shining and it looks REALLY professional. Great fajitas. The shrimp fajitas must have been authentic because it was totally different than any I'd had before. It was sort of like a stew because they used tomatoes and those cook down to create a sauce. They were very tasty and the shrimp were huge. Also they make their own tortillas! I wasn't too much of a fan of the salsa they brought us at first but I have to admit it did have a nice heat to it. The restaurant was very crowded but you could still move around AND there was a line of about 3 tables when we first got there but it moved quickly.  When we left we bought some of the homemade tortillas at the counter and they were really cheap...I think a buck something. One bad thing though: It was hard to get a cab back to the loop. We didn't know the area and were kind of nervous about waiting outside in the dark. And cash only for the restaurant. Overall though it was a fun time.
