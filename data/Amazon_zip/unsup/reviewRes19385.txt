Coast has the best fish in my opinion. I think the sashimi is extremely fresh and tasty all times that I have been here. It's BYOB which is nice, because it definitely saves on the bill. The rolls at Coast seem more traditional than those at other places. They still do have some saucy and sweet rolls, but for the most part they are more traditional.  The space is really elegant and the service is wonderful. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the restroom situation--- Coast is a pretty large restaurant with only two restrooms, one for men, one for women. The line can get pretty long.
