I consider myself a bit of a foodie, so I love Fox & Obel. And I'm from North Carolina and Fox & Obel carries White Lilly Flour. And they have a great grilled cheese and tomato soup in their cafe. The things I would like to buy here include white truffles and serrano ham, except I haven't had a need for them nor have I found the time to use them. There's only one thing that I dislike about Fox & Obel and it's their prices... But you can't win them all!
