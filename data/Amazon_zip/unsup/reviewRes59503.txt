I love La Villa. I would actually go as far as to say it is my favorite place for pizza. I usually get my food to go and order time is always reasonable even on the weekends. The thin crust pizza is perfect- great sauce, cheese, and crust. The "stuffed" pizza is an equally good option, and stuffed is exactly how you'll feel after eating it. Also, I wanted to add that I am very picky when it comes to eating sausage pizza and they have the best in my opinion.The calzones are another one of my favorites because it's essentially their thin crust pizza folded in half.Other than pizza I would highly recommend getting the deluxe meatball sandwich on garlic bread with mozzarella cheese. It comes with three really huge tasty meatballs and the steak fries are the shiznit.
