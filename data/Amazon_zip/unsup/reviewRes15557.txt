Was in town for a conference and therefore had a large group out for dinner. There were some last minute changes, additions of a couple people to the group. There was a lot of drama over this change. While I understand that this can be a problem we had already monopolized a side room and with the addition filled out a small side table in the same room. Seems like it was better since the table, doubt anyone would want to sit next to a table of 12-16 people that they didn't know in a side room. Lots of eye rolling, sighing, and snotty remarks. The pork adobo was rich and succulent with a rich smokey flavor. Tender chunks of pork lathered in a rich sauce. It was hearty and filling down to the end. The banana cream pie was smooth with a good texture. The passion fruit ice team was good, but didn't really stand out. The pork was great and I would return to eat here again but what stands out the most in my mind was the rude waiter that impacted our entire meal.
