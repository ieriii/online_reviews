So we did the birthday dinner here last night, and must say it is a great date spot. Very cozy, you might knock elbows with the next table, but nice nonetheless. Our waiter was great, attentive and had suggestions whenever we asked for any. The food by itself was OK, we've had better Italian. The roasted peppers appetizer was neither cold nor warm, but the grilled peaches appetizer was great! Be warned, if you don't like Gorgonzola cheese, this particular appetizer might be overwhelming. We tried the risotto and gnochhi pastas - good, but not great. The highlight of the evening was the dessert - a light fluffy piece of lemon panna cota. Omg, I would go to this place again only for this. Perfect texture, with a great glaze on top. The best ever. Ask for the outdoor deck seating if you head there with good weather, we didn't realize that we had the option until after we finished our meal.
