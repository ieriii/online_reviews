We went to RJ Grunt's for Sunday morning brunch reservation at 11 AM with a party of six, four adults, two toddlers (that's two two-year-olds!) and it was awesome!! When we arrived, they already had a table set up with two chairs and a high chair in between on each side. Although the space was a little tight, it wasn't as bad as I had expected when I read all the reviews.  The food was pretty tasty! I enjoyed the salad bar, the enchilada soup, and the breakfast offerings. The waitress forgot to bring me my sweet potato fries...but I never even checked to see if she charged me for them. I had a $100 LEY gift card so wasn't paying much attention to the details. :) I was too stuffed to think about anything else. Their fried potatoes from the breakfast bar was really yummy and so were the waffles. They had three different kinds of eggs, one pan of just egg whites for the health conscious. The bacon was very fatty but delicious. The sausages weren't to my liking....it had a strange herb ingredient that I wasn't quite used to for a breakfast sausage. The salad and the ranch dressing was great!! The only thing that could make it better would be to add jalapenos to the salad bar. The banana peppers were a decent substitute but not as much of a kick to it as I would have liked! The great thing about this place, despite the bit of circling we had to do for the parking, is that right across the street there's this great playground where we let our toddlers run off some of their steam. It was a great brunch date with friends. The staff was friendly, they gave crayons and coloring sheets, and we had a lot of fun!
