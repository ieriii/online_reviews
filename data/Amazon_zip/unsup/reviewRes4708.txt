Even after devouring a Lou Malnati's pizza, a stop had to be made to The Purple Pig. A stop for 4th meal one may say. I called and they had no wait around midnight so off we went. We were seated at the long communal table, in adversarial positions nonetheless. I'm not a fan of squeezing between people at a communal table but we were only going to be there a short time to try a few choice dishes. "JLT" w/ Fried Hen Egg & Lemon Aioli: An open faced sandwich taken to new heights. When you have crackly, juicy pieces of pork jowl with lettuce and tomato adorned with the perfect fried egg, it can be only heaven in your mouth. And it was. I wish I could be served this for breakfast every single day. Razor Clams w/ Oregano, Lemon, & Olive Oil: It's too bad razor clams are so tiny in their serving size. These were sweet and delicious. Lubricated with the fruity olive oil and caramelized from the grill, I wish there were more. Pig Tail's braised in Balsamic, Egg Salad: This was recommended by the server but wasn't a highlight. It was just soft upon soft. The pig tails melted but I wish there was a crouton or bread to accompany the dish to make it even better. Lemon Panna Cotta w/ Lemon Marmellata & Candied Pistachios: Of course she has to have her panna cotta. It had smokey crunch from the pistachios, tart from the panna cotta, and subtle sweetness throughout. She loved it and it was one of the best I've had. It's a shame we only could try a few dishes. Next time we'll have to go for the full dinner experience. And hopefully get an individual table of our own.
