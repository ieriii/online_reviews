A year ago I went to Chicago with a group of friends, 3 couples. We wanted to make a point of trying new restaurants so everyone chose one, the only rule was it had to be a place that none of us had visited before. XOCO was my pick, I'm a sucker for good Mexican food, and it turned out to be a crowd-pleasing favorite. We each ordered something different and tasted and passed until everyone had tried everything. A hush fell over our normally loud group as we tucked into the entrees, every one a happy plate when it was over. Then we passed around 3 different desserts, all fantastic. Since that trip whenever we get back to CHI, alone or as a group, we hit XOCO at least once. I was in CHI last weekend with the girls. XOCO was our dinner stop the first day. Chica #1 ordered her usual and was perfectly content with her torta, upended as it was into a bowl of steaming broth. Chica #2 ended up with pork but thought she was ordering chicken so she switched with me (what I chose turned out to be too hot for this Gringa to handle) and we were both pleased. Chips and guacamole were enjoyed by all, esp. the green salsa. For dessert we had a churro with chocolate and ice cream to dip in (I think I'll skip the chocolate next time, it's too rich for me!) -- it was warm and crispy and I love that ice cream -- and the coconut rice pudding with grilled peaches. As good as the churro is, the rice pudding was the fan favorite. That was Thursday, fast forward to Saturday morning and we were back at XOCO, this time for empanadas. Flaky crusts... spicy fillings... perfection rolled up into a beautiful golden wrapper. It's all of this that keeps us coming back. If you haven't been, check it out. Don't let the line scare you, it's moves surprisingly fast.
