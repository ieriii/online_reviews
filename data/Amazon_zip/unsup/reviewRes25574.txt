After a late show at Lincoln Hall we had a pizza craving. We whipped out the trusty Urban Spoon & wound up at Peaquod's. This place is awesome & uses their well seasoned cast iron pie pans for your pizza. We had just a basic sausage pan & it was just perfect. The center wasn't soggy at all, the crust had great flavor & stayed moist without becoming gummy & the cheese caramelized nice and crispy around the edges of the pan. Being a weeknight around 1am, it was nice & quiet & we had the waitress pretty much all to ourselves. Will def come back/carry out in the future.
