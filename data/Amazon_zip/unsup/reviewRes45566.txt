4 stars for Really really good mac n'cheese. 2 stars for the Fish n' chips - not outstanding. Service polite both times. I would def. go back and just get the mac 'n cheese. That plate was almost licked clean. UPDATE: I have been back many times. Burgers and sandwiches are always wonderful!! Whiskey buffalo wing?? MMM Service and atmosphere is fantastic. I just cannot get enough of this place. They are open late, so its fun to hang out and drink.
