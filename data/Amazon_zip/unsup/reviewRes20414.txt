The sushi here is great (usually). Probably the best non-fufu, almost reasonably priced sushi in Chicago. The service sometimes leaves something to be desired, but it's usually because there is a lot going on. Not that it's an excuse for servers to act like they don't care, but often they don't because they know that all tips are pooled and split at the end of the night anyway (dumb rule in my oppinion, but who am I to say?). My suggestion is to call in your order, and take it to go. When they say 20 minutes, they mean 40, but it's sushi, and you don't want to take a chance, so be there anyway. While you wait you can people-watch as the valet keeps an eye on your car (give him a buck wouldja?)
