The Purple Pig is a Michigan Avenue wine bar that specializes in eating parts of pigs. And any place that specializes in eating parts of pigs is okay in my book. I'm not a huge fan of the communal dining tables though. What is it with Chicago restaurants and communal dining tables? I guess they're trying to promote being social, but I mean, c'mon, talking to people? Next thing you know they're going to expect me to leave my basement and deal with that giant burning ball in the sky. Pfft.
