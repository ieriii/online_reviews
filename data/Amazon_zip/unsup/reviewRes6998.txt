This place is quite a gem. I almost don't want to give it a review so that it doesn't get too popular, however, a place like this has to be shared with the world. They turn out amazing food at very reasonable prices. I first saw this place on the TV show "Chicago's Best" and had to check it out. Lobster ravioli was ridiculous and was under $25 for a huge portion. I've also gotten a scallop, mussels, shrimp pasta in red sauce that was amazing. For appetizers there bruchetta is the best I've ever had and they also have an avocado bruschetta that is even better. Chocolate panna cotta for dessert was very light and addicting. I can't say a bad thing about this place. I highly recommend it.
