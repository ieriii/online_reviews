I had to mentally prepare myself to eat all that meat, but the Jedi mind trick worked because I ate like a champ. The service, particularly our waitress, was great. I'm a sucker for good service. The meat was great, cooked perfectly. My favorites were the lamb, the filet, and the shrimp. The creme brle was disappointing. It did not have the standard caramelized sugar topping and had some type of chocolate syrup on the bottom. *tear The salad bar was nice, but I was there to eat meat. The seared tuna and smoked salmon were tasty. I also enjoyed the Brazilian chicken salad. Oh and how can I forget the friend bananas...yum! I wasn't a big fan of the mushroom risotto. Make sure to check the website prior to going if it's your first time. They may not have all of the meat choices on the floor. But they will prepare it for you if you ask.
