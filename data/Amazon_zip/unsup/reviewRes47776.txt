AMAZING! Zed has all the standard fare for a Brazilian steakhouse: endless platters of meat and a fully stocked salad bar. However, the quality surpasses that of the others I've been to. The salad bar had creative concoctions. My favorite was the stuffed tomato. They had a wide selection of cheeses, meats, and vegetables. All the ingredients tasted fresh. The meat was out of this world. Like a bad Chinese buffet, I didn't maintain my food boundaries. I ate too much. In addition to red meat, they served fish as well. The rare/medium-rare meat was as advertised and tasted amazing. The dinner ended with a caramel bread pudding with a flame-toasted marshmallow on top. It was a perfect end to a perfect evening. The service was amazing as well. I highly recommend this for any occasion.
