Amongst some topnotch competition along Taylor Street, Davanti Enoteca still makes quite an impression in my mind from the warm, inviting atmosphere to the delicious small plates they serve. There is a wide selection of breads/cheeses, pizzas and other traditional Italian dishes. The roasted beets with the walnut butter were outstanding, as was the cannoli sundae we had for dessert. Definitely a go-to in my book - only downside is they don't take reservations and there isn't much waiting room.
