This place is amazinggggg. So much delicious meat and an excellent salad bar too. Only use the salad bar as a palette cleanser though, you don't go to this place to ear salad. I would recommend the capriana drinks. Very nice atmosphere but make reservations, this place is packed. Pretty expensive but totally worth it.
