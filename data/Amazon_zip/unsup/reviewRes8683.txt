Went here on a recent trip to Chicago. Like many of the reviewers I can't believe the quality of the salad bar, my first thoughts were ok, salad bar at a Brazillian steak house, probably will fall a little flat. I could not have been more wrong, the salad bar was devine and if I wasn't such a devout carnivore, I could well have been satisfied with this salad bar, simply amazing, hearts of palm, fresh mozzarella, an entire wheel of parmasan regiano cheese, it was just perfect. Now as this was a Brazillian steak house I can't not talk about the meat. i would have to say that the meat was pretty good, I had some dry chicken and tough steak pieces but the beauty of it was that you don't have to eat that, you can easily get something else. My personal fave was the house specialty picanha (sirloin) and the ribeye. Very awesome dinner could not have asked for more.
