I am digging this place - I can't rank it at 5 stars because I didn't try the food, but I can tell you that the atmosphere, people, and beer are all great! I was able to try a number of Revolution's beers, all good, but finally decided on the Workman's Mild, which is surprisingly tasty, and a dark beer, but mild and not as bitter. I love the space, it is beautifully designed, and the bartenders were very attentive even on a friday night. I heard the mussels are delicious, so I will be back to try those! Also the people are great - lots of good looking people without all the oglers found in other bar scenes.
