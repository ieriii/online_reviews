This is an old-school Italian restaurant that should not be missed. The Italian side of my family goes way back with this restaurant. Many of the waiters and the owner speak Italian. We had a ball there with relatives visiting from Italy a couple summers ago. Anyway, the food is always amazing and prefectly prepared. The service is impecable with many waiters that have been there 20+ years. Portions are large and soup and salad come with the entree so go there hungry or plan to take soem home. Their minestrone rivals my grandma`s! It is also a great value for quality of food and service.  The decor is right out of "Goodfellas" . A total throwback to the 60`s and 70`s. Honestly, though, that is part of what makes this place special and a unique and old fashioned dining experience.
