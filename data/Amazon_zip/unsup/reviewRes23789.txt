Let's see how simple I can keep it this morning. The food is pretty good. Not the best crepes I've ever had but certainly far far far from the worst. I really enjoyed the turkish coffee. Granted I've nothing to compare it to but I liked it! Waitress was nice. Overall a great spot to stop for a bite to eat the next time your in that neck of the woods!
