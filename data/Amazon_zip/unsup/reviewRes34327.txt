hm.. so decided to hit this place up after a long night of boozing. Came here around 2:00 PM and the place was still jam packed. First off, the service sucked. I'm not sure if our waitress was new or what the deal was but we had to keep asking other people (the busser and the manager) for things that our waitress should have been on top of. Second of all, the food was "meh". The first word that comes to mind. My boyfriend and I decided to share a spinach salad and splurge our calorie intake on the breakfast pizza. We have been to breakfast places before and ordered pizzas so we expected one of those circular thin crust pizzas. This is not what we got. Instead we were served a square pizza that was semi on the soggy side. It reminded me of one of those lean cuisine pizzas except with the breakfast toppings. Pretty hard to eff up breakfast foods but serving soggy lean cuisine pizza def. does the trick!  Basically the highlight of this place was the strawberry orange juice, but next time I will save my $30 and go to whole foods and buy juice and not be a lazy hungover piece of shit and cook my own breakfast. Maybe.
