Granted, I have never been to Cuba, but of all the Cuban restaurants I tried Cafe 28 ranks pretty high in terms of service and quality. My favorite dish here is what I have been told is a typical Cuban dish: rice with pulled beef and black beans. Simple, but delicious. I have greatly enjoyed everything I have ever tried at Cafe 28. Location is great, as it is right off the EL stop on Irving Park. You want to take public transportation or a cab, because the drinks are too good for you to limit yourself to one drink. Make sure you get a frozen mojito. They have them in other flavors, but you have to go for the traditional for sure. As for dessert, well, I never made it that far because I am always too full from all the delicious food and drinks. But I'll come back and update this review if I ever make it to dessert.
