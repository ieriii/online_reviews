Let me begin by saying that I LOVE the pickles that they put on the table at the beginning of the meal, it may be my favorite part of my meal! That being said I really enjoy how it is a great place to go to share, we always fill the entire table with mostly sides are all so delicious! Q is great because the ambiance is uniquely upscale and casual, I always fee comfortable. Overall Chicago q is a great place to go to eat outside and enjoy some good food with friends!
