This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I've visited for dinner, and brunch and I've been nothing but pleased. I even don't mind waiting (too much...) at the cute little bar area! The food is always wonderful - though we were a bit upset about the lack of pork rinds on Saturday morning...but the rest of the food made up for it.  The brunch flatbread - WOW!  Service is always exceptional along with the food. Definitely a must visit!
