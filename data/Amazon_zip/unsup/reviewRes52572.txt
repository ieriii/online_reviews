I'm a carnivore. I love meat. This place, however, stepped over the line a bit. And yes...I understand it is a Brazilian steakhouse and that's what they do. However, it was a bit overpriced and the service seemed a tad forced. It was a fun thing to try, and if you are in the mood for some protein, by all means, go for it. Just expect to pay a lot of money for meat that has similar taste. And come hungry!
