We went to Glenn's for seafood last night after spending the day at the Shedd Aquarium. Odd, I know. Still as good as always. I had the Lobster Bisque Alfredo, it was fantastic. My boyfriend had the Arctic Char Diablo which was spicy and awesome as well. It sat on a bed of red potatoes and asparagus... yumm... Mine came with garlic bread and was fabulous. Seriously, go. You're welcome.
