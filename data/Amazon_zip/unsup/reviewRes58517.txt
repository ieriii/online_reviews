Save your money and time. We're fans of Top Chef, and as Rick Bayless won the first season of Top Chef Masters, when we were in Chicago we were excited to go to Frontera Grill.As others have mentioned, the wait can be interminable, and one wonders what the problem would be with taking reservations.  Maybe its that they would not sell as many drinks if they didn't have the bar packed with people waiting an hour or more for the table. Well, it was a good margarita, but not a great one. Our local bartender makes a better one.But here's the worst part: the food was nothing special. It was OK, but it was NOT the exceptional. The pork I had was a bit dry. The black bean soup that they said to dip the pork in was good, but not spectacular. The tortillas were fine, but also not exceptional.We were told that Mr. Bayless is now cooking at his higher end restaurant next door (that DOES take reservations). Had we known THAT we definitely would have gone next door, and NOT had to have waited more than an hour standing up in the packed bar.Want really exceptional Mexican food? Try Tlapazola on Lincoln Ave. near Venice Blvd. in LA.
