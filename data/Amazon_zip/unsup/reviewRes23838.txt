Yum. I frequent here whenever I want a good crepe. I usually get the Banana Nutella w/vanilla ice cream one for dessert. As for savory crepes, I tried the Roma with Algerian sausage (excellent) and the Palace with Algerian sausage (excellent) crepes. One thing is there really isn't much taste other than olive oil taste in the savory crepes so the hot sauce they provide helps to give it a bit of a kick and taste. Their soups are delicious as well. The crepes are pretty large for lunch so I can usually have one savory crepe and like half of a sweet crepe, take the rest to go. As for drinks, I have had the hot chocolate which was milky and gooood. I also had the apricot iced tea which was excellent as well. May need to add sugar to it. I always get fast and friendly service too. Street metered parking usually easy to find during weekday lunch hour. I'm sure weekends would be tough though especially on Clark street. I usually park on the cross street, Foster. Icosium is on the West side of Clark and the North side of Foster at the corner.
