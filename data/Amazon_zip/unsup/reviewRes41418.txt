We are so lucky to have amazing and unique restaurants like Bonsoiree in Chicago. I try to appreciate something about every meal I ingest, and Bonsoiree gave me many moments of food appreciation and excitement. My loving boyfriend treated me to the special "no menu Sunday" and that was such a great experience. We brought a bottle of red wine (1 was enough for us, but plenty of people came in with a variety) and our menu was built around that. We delighted in each of the 7 courses, but we were particularly enamored with a little "seashell treat" that was based off a buttery crab and scallop gratin and the mustard apple soup. Before we left I lost control and gushed to Chef Creagan how much we enjoyed dinner through their little kitchen cutaway window. He was probably annoyed, but I was giddy happy about this meal and I thought he deserved to know it.
