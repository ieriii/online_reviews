The deep dish pizza crust is like cornbread, except it's dense, doughy, and bland. And then there's a half-inch layer of plastic-y cheese on top. My favorite part of the pizza was the sauce, because it was neither plastic-y nor bland. The thin crust pizza wasn't better. Gino's pepperoni tastes more like salami, which is fine if I'm eating Ritz crackers and orange cheddar cheese spread, but on a pizza, it needs to taste like pepperoni. The crust was thin, crispy on the edges only (soggy where the pizza was topped), and bland. Again, this pizza suffered from too much cheese--enough so that all of the toppings (supreme) were suspended in the cheese! Plus, my friend told me that the pizzas at this Gino's location cost $5 more than the one in the suburbs (downtown/tourist premium?). After eating what I thought was a lot, I was full but not satisfied at all. I hope to never have to eat pizza from here again.
