A hot dawg drive-in... What a concept (http://www.yelp.com/biz_). This was the first stop in our dawg expedition. It's off the beaten path from the heart of Chicago, but worth the drive at 11pm. I guess I've been out of it for too long, or too young to know. Had no idea how to use the drive-in squawk boxes. So just parked in a stall and walked to the counter. What was hilariously-pitiful were these two blue-collar white guys behind us who were overly threatened when I started to take pictures of the joint. Saying "Those Chinese are talking pictures and they're going to steal this business and go over and start a business in China or Korea. Looka them thar taking pictures of da kitchen..." What they never saw an Asian person with a camera before? Heck that's our ID calling card. ;)  Why do sorry-ass naive people still exist in this world? I'm proud of myself for keeping my cool... I wish they could learn how to read so that they could know how famous they now are in the yelp world. Here are the pics that reveal those coveted trade secrets: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) So Asia - take these blueprints and go and prosper... Despite that little snafu, it did not stop us from enjoying this off-the-beaten-path history of dawg-kingdom. Of course we had the Superdawg which had all the Chicagonean-dragged-through-the-garden fixin's. A pure beef schlong in a blue box with fat potato fries stuffed around the sides. The great things also found in the box, a pickled green tomato chunk, dill pickle and two Tabasco peppers - can't go wrong with any of those additives. However, my favorite is the whoopskidawg - the good old Polish served on a kaiser onion bun with grilled onions, pickle and Tabasco peppers. What a dawg!  Wanted to try the Supersteak, which is an open-faced double cheese burger - but didn't try it because of the dawg expedition. I'm a fan!
