One of the best low key breakfast/sandwich places! They have an amazing yogurt parfait with their own home made granola!They have a really good french toast if you don't mind gaining a few extra pounds, but it isn't overwhelmingly sweet either!Really great baked items and super sandwiches! Try it out!
