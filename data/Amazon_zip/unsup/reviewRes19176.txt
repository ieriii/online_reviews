Recommended to us by the staff at a local gallery, we enjoyed lunch here in April 2012. We thought the food was fairly priced for The Loop location, and all three of us enjoyed our sandwiches and soup -- on that day the special soup was lobster bisque. Not as creamy as some we've had, but very flavorful. We were warmly greeted by all the staff we encountered, including the owner. We arrived for lunch after the rush, which I recommend for less noise.
