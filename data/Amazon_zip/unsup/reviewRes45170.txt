Honestly, so f'n amazing I can hardly stand it. After my fifth visit Monday night I am finally compelled to share my love of this place with others.  I am hearting the $29.00 you pick 'em prix fixe they have this summer, what a great way to try a whole mess of food! I have had the octopus salad every time I've gone there this summer as well as the lemon panna cotta which haunts my dreams. The Lobster/Ricotta Ravioli with Corn Butter was mind blowing...whoever thought of combing butter and corn and turning it into a sauce needs to give me a call, I think we might like each other...alot.
