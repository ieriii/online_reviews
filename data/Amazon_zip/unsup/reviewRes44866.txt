I ordered a deep dish pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza and although it took an hour for it to be delivered, it was well worth the wait. The pizza was filled with cheese and yummy goodness and the crust is so addicting - it is buttery and light and just the perfect combo for a carb lover. I could only eat 2 pieces before passing out but so good - a must try! I also heard that the spinach stuffed pizza was good too - try this place!
