Had the good fortune to stop at Chicago Q for lunch at 3pm so there was no wait, but let me tell you - if you have to wait for this food, you will be rewarded! We had a bbq flight (pulled pork, pulled chicken, beef brisket), which came with cornbread and a half slab of the baby back ribs. Pulled chicken, when you catch a tender bite (any time you have pulled meat, you can get a dry or a tender bite), it is exquisite. The pulled pork was similar. The brisket might have been over cooked (easy to do when the cubes are so small) but still tender enough to chew easily. Baby back ribs fell off of the bone - just the way I like it. The meat was so tender, then when I stuck a fork in it, the fork just came right back out. So what makes Chicago Q five star worthy? the blend of sauces and the pickle chips and potato chips that come with your meal. The pickle chips are "bread and butter", i.e. they are sweet - AND DELICIOUS! No too strong that you can't just grab one with your fingers and drop it in your mouth. The bbq chips are perfect. Seasoned with just enough bbq spice, and thick enough to have a crunch, but not so thick that you cannot easily consume the whole bowl by yourself. And then, the sauces for your BBQ. Regular BBQ, Spicy BBQ, Northern Carolina BBQ (vinegar style) and Eastern Carolina (mustardy). There is enough of a difference between regular and spicy BBQ that you notice, but not so much that they both don't taste like BBQ. The vinegar style sauce was too runny for me and probably would be best used as a dip. The mustard sauce takes some adjustment, but it is very good once you do account for the fact that is mustardy. I rarely give five star reviews, but this dining experience was top notch from start to finish. The pickle chips and bbq chips, the meat, the sauces. Well done Chicago Q, and I'm not talking about the meat!
