Great food, terrible music. Am I the youngest person in the restaurant? I've ordered delivery from RJ Grunts on several occasions, and their food is very good. However, after deciding to check out the place in person, I have my reservations about ever going back. I will definitely still continue to order delivery from them though because their food itself is at least 4 stars! Likes: Food is great overall, and their creations are definitely unique. The menu is diverse and comically written. I very much like their chips, which are made in house, especially when they are well-salted. I'm also a fan of their tuna melt, which offers 3 small tuna sandwiches on English muffins, each with a different type of cheese melted over the top. Dislikes: By far the biggest issue that they have is their music. They play really bad 70s rock/pop NONSTOP, every waking second that they are open. I asked the bartender if they always do that, and she replied, "Welcome to my world..." I kept waiting for waiting for a song not recorded 35 years ago to play, but it was in vain. It's not disco at least, but it wasn't good 70s music either. Usually I don't care much what music is being played, but this was just so bad. On top of that, as I looked around the establishment, I realized that I was perhaps one of only a handful of people under the age of 35 (out of probably 70 people). As for the food, after reading about their shakes on Yelp, I was expecting a bit more, though they are not bad. The onion rings were generic, which is really the only item that I've not enjoyed there. If you love great food, this is a terrific place. Beware though that if you dine in, you'd better be over 35 if you wanna keep your sanity.
