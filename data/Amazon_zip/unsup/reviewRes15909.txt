This is a very popular Tuesday spot for the $9.95 rib special, but they have specials every night of the week. It's a pretty large spot, so they can accomodate big groups. The service here is really right on the mark and treat everyone as if they were VIP. I love foccacia bread, and I hadn't been to a place that offered that so I can appreciate it being on the table. I would advise you to not fill up on this though to make room for your meal. I had the lobster ravioli which was a little too rich and creamy for me, but was still pretty good. The rib meat come off the bones pretty easily and are pretty tasty. The prices are very reasonable, and I can see how someone would want to be a regular. They seem to have a very decent bar if you just wanted to hang out here for drinks as well.
