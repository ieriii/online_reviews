Superb service and attention to our table. The waitstaff is EXCELLENT although there was not much of a selection for me a a vegetarian.....My friends were raving about the meat though and the atmosphere is much better than Brazazz, large spacious and beautiful. The drinks were VERY strong so we feel we got our money's worth. Would definitely recommend to devoted carnivores.
