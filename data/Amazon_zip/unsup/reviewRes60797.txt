Theme restaurants can go wrong like the worn out TGI Friday's/Applebee's/Chili's chain. But ya know what, themes themselves are not to blame. The over-production of some chains are to blame. Nearly any Irish bar in Chicago isn't really an Irish bar. It's just a theme. So when you see a place go out and make a statement with a theme its a risk. Some people hate it but others like me like the ambience.What I look for is to have a place set it apart from the usual crowd. Sure this is a burgers and beer joint. But it stands out with a desire to make a statement and create an atmosphere. That's to be commended in this homogenized world of today.This place has the makings of a great place to meet and hang out. It's got local hangout written all over it and a warm sense of familiar while also varying the daily specials.The burgers are great. They're oversized but I am a sucker for pretzel rolls; nothing better for a burger. While the beer selection is mostly bottle, I can't complain because they've got Shiner Bock... one great, great beer.
