I was in town visiting friends and family and one of my foodie buddies took me to Hot Doug's. There are enough reviews, so I'll make this brief... We waited 45 mintues just to order and it was entirely worth it. I'm not a big "crowds" person, but we had a choice of seats after we ordered. The food truly is amazing. The owner was there taking our order and couldn't have been a happier guy. Fridays and Saturdays are best so you can try the duck fat fries. If you've never been, you need to go. Seriously. Stop reading this. Go. Now.
