Service can be a hit or miss here, but never the food! The wait for a table can be long too, esp. on the weekend. I love getting the horchata, as well as the chicken nachos or a chicken torta. Portions are huge, and the prices are low. It's definitely on my to-go to list when I'm up for a satisfying, delicious meal for cheap!
