If gourmet beer is your thing, the hop leaf is the place. Excellent food (that is more bistro-like than bar and grilly) and a phenomenal selection of domestics and imports (as a New England native, I couldn't be happier to see my favorite beer from Maine on tap). Excellent decor. One should be careful though, some of these beers are costly, and if you're not careful you could prove to be a very expensive buzz.
