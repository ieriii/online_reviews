We really enjoyed the atmosphere of sprout! It's a really open air restaurant, with just the nicest service and completely friendly atmosphere.  We had the biscuits and gravy with fennel and sausage and no matter how hard I try those biscuits will never leave my mind! The Sunday cocktails are something to write hoe about as well!
