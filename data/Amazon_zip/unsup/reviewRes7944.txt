The best part of Spacca is the patio. Yeah the pizza's good, but the patio is great. You'll forget you're in the city, because it's so homey and refreshing. As a thin-crust fan myself, I was excited for this italian-style pie. Maybe I hyped it up a little in my head, and yes it was good, but just not amazing. The toppings start too far in from the sides...meaning....the crust is too wide. Does that make sense? I felt like I was getting hardly any topping. But the crust is crispy and tasty and definitely authentic. (But I've never been to Italy, so who knows) Service was indifferent, prices are decent. I'll certainly be back for the patio, but I've got to try some more things and find a favorite dish still.
