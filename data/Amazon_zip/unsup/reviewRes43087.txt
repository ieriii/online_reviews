Just had pizza by the slice, very good and a nice change from Chicago-style deep dish. Saw people ordering a variety of other menus on the item, very diverse. Be careful to only come with a small group: I was the straggler of an 8 person group and there was only 1 kind of pizza by the slice left (green pepper and onion, which was delicious). The staff was also very nice.
