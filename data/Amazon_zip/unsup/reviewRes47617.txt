3.5 stars. everything was pretty solid, and there were even a few standouts. their house-marinated sirloin was top-notch, my table kept requesting more. all the other meats were at least decent. i also liked the market offerings, although they did run out of prosciutto pretty quickly. :( the only issue i have with the restaurant is their center seating. the flickering flames cast shadows that gave me the one and only migraine i've ever experienced. however, that's not to detract from the food because everybody else was fine. only i had to run out of there like my clothes were on fire. there was a bit of a snafu with my table though. the waiter spilled oily meat onto my dining companion, and they were only willing to pay for dry cleaning if he mailed in a dry cleaning receipt and waited to get reimbursed. ummm....ever heard of petty cash? apparently it took half an hour after i left to get it resolved; they were supposed to take a glass of wine off the bill, except that there was a miscommunication and they never actually did until one of our party noticed the next day and called in. way to make somebody pay for getting oil and crap spilled on them. oh, and apparently the bread pudding is MUCH less than stellar. avoid.
