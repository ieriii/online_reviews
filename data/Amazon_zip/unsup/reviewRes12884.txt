Texas De Brazil is an orgasmic, meat loving experience that I will continue to come back to, Restaurant Week after Restaurant Week. The filet mignon is to die for as is the beyond tender, perfectly cooked juicy lamb and the special sausages (of which I consume several on each occasion). Seriously though, out of the brazilian steakhouses offered in Chicago, I'd have to say Texas De Brazil provides not only the best of quality, but extreme variety as well. Service is splendid and decor is additionally amazing. In fact, if you get the chance- to pay a visit to the restrooms... they are quite nicely done. Eating tip: beware of the endless sushi, salad, and appetizer bar. As much as it's hard to resist the lobster bisque and cheese varieties, one should definitely try to instead save the maximum amount of room for the meat that is yet to come. Lastly, if for some ludicrous reason you have room for dessert, I would suggest the cheesecake but like the meats, all of it really is amazing.
