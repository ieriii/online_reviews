Let me define this place before I judge it. BrewCo+Pizzeria+Bar. So, I am going to evaluate this place like Russian River (best BrewCo+Pizzeria) and a bar with 8 guest taps (any crappy bar). Grind, grind....this place is amazing. The pizza is great. The beer is great. The guest taps are great. This place had ERIC's ALE a week after it's release!!! That is amazing!! All their guest taps were amazing. Sure, their guac was mediocre at best, but everything else I experienced was amazing. GO!! PS, my price vote is based on enjoying lots of amazing beer.
