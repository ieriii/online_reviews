For the adventurous foodie, Alinea provides one of the most unique and deliciously entertaining tasting experiences. From the moment you enter the modern unassuming dining room, you're greeted with a friendly staff who delight in presenting your dishes. Each course plays out theatrically in unexpected sensational ways. I hesitated to touch these "food sculptures", because they're unlike anything I've seen let alone eaten. But they encourage you to play with your food, explore it's textures and tastes. Whether it was a frozen pea soup that melted in your mouth, or dessert served on a rapidly deflating pillow of Earl Grey essence, you're rewarded simply for participating. The night which began with low key chatter grew livelier as fellow diners shared their dining experiences with the rest of the room. This is perhaps the closest thing to interactive dinner theater, because the enjoyment comes as much from the reveal as it does from the taste.
