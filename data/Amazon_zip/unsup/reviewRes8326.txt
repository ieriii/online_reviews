Needed a place to go to in the bf's hood and since I don't know it as well as my own, I turned to Yelp. From reading the reviews, we were expecting a wait. Luckily, the 20 min wait we were given turned out to be only about ten. We had mussels to start which were really good. He ordered the funghi e salsiccia pizza and I ordered one of the specials which had prosciutto, salumi, mushrooms and black olives. We both studied in Italy in college and both said it reminded us of the pizza we had there. Overall it was very good, but at the end of the night, we were a little surprised by the bill ($70 including tip). I guess we did have an appetizer and each had two drinks, but $16 for my "special" pizza? Call me cheap, but had it been listed on the regular menu with prices, I would have gone with something else--it is only pizza after all.
