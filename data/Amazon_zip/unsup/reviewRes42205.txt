I'm in over my head right now with schoolwork, so cooking dinner tonight was not an option. I don't have time. Apparently I have time for writing Yelp reviews, though. See how I have my priorities in order? I was craving pizza. I had been wanting to try Art of Pizza for a while after hearing so many great things about it, so I thought what the hell.... Downside - they don't have a website. Grrr. Luckily a quick google search brought up their menu. I perused it, picked up the phone, and dialed for delivery. Downside - I could not hear their employee on the phone. Grrr. Pet peeve of mine. If you're a business that does delivery, seriously, invest in a good phone. My street name sounds a lot like another major street near me, so I had to have him repeat it a couple times to make sure he got it right. Downside - they said it would be an hour. I was STARVING. Whine. But hey, it was 6pm-ish. It's my own fault, not theirs. A little more than 30 minutes later, my phone rings. "Delivery!" says the man into my intercom. SCORE! Upside - nicest delivery guy ever. I detected a true Italian accent. I kind of wanted to be on a gondola or something. In the snow. What? Upside - free soda! It's Pepsi, which I won't drink, but hey. I wasn't expecting that. (Anyone want some free Pepsi?) Upside - free calendar too! Can you tell I like free stuff? So I opened the box, and at first I was like, damn... I had ordered thin crust because well, that's what I like. And looking at the pizza reminded me of Giordano's, and that's *not* what I like. But I tore off one of those corner pieces (my favorite), put it in my mouth.... Oh, yum. Ok, SO not Giordano's. The cheese is just... yum. Chewy in the best way chewy cheese can be. The sauce? Good, but nothing special. The crust? Good amount of chewy and crispy. Me likey.
