Walked by on accident but I had wanted to try this place for some time... Super nice interior, def seemed out of place for the area..Big "Square" Bar in the middle that probably seats 50/Brewery in back with windows for brewing/Open Air kitchen with wood burning oven also in back/lots of tables!! Really liked the "Barrel Walls", they actually took apart beer barrels and created walls with the wood, awesome! They have like 8 of their own brews, two of which are served "Cask" style--warmer temp and no CO2!! Liked the Porter in this format. Had a "Workingmans Burger"- Aged Cheddar/Beer Onions/Bacon and it was really good--I think the Bun actually made the burger! All their buns/desserts/etc are baked in house by the Pastry Chef!! Damn..also saw but did not try their Pizzas--they looked/smelled amazing! Food is Friggin' GOOD here! Another thing I liked was the "Beer List" and "Guest Taps"-- a lot of obscure ones on both lists and its a big list! I hate how most brewpubs just have "Their" Beer on Tap.. annoying! Service was great/everything was clean including the glasses...Get There---Ask for Sam, she's a great bartender!! GTFJD
