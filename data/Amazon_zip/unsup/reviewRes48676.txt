Went here several weeks back, but sat on this review as I had such a mixed experience. I'd been wanting to go here for months and finally got around to it. We went here on a Saturday night. We started off with some interesting beers -- I had a Belgian ale and my girlfriend had a Koelsch beer. Both were great. We shared mussels to start with---so so (like most of the food the flavors seem a little bland). The pork dish would have been great but it was delivered lukewarm. We also ordered the duck hearts (which were delivered Luke warm with burnt toast). The waiter clearly felt bad about this and they really did try to make us feel better (free extra desert and mini-beer samples that were a good choice based on my girlfriend's earlier beer choice). If I was giving a review for "how to recover from a bad service experience" these guys would get an A. But, sadly, the food was just too average for me to want to return.
