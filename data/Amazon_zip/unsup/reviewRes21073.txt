I visited XOCO right after it first opened, over a year ago. Less impressive than Frontera, but still really good would probably be the best description. I had the ahogada torta, which consisted of "Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions." The meat was flavorful and not tough at all, and the broth was great for dipping the torta. I'm eager to return for churros and hot chocolate!
