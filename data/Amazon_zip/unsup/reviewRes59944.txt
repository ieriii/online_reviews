We live in Wicker Park and are long time patrons of the Alliance Bakery, but we recently had a bad experience with those amazing looking cakes in the window. Since I was completing graduate school, we decided to order something special for family that would be in town for the celebration. There was an awesome cake in the window that looked like a giant cheeseburger. Inspired, we decided to get one that looked like a deep-dish pizza. When I ordered the cake, it was much more expensive than originally quoted...over $160 for a cake that fed eight. When I picked the cake up, it was the size and dimensions of a regular cake, NOT of a deep-dish pizza, the frosting was pink instead of red like a marinara, with just a few fondant pepperonis and (gray) mushrooms. My expectations had been set by their impressive display window, and even the Alliance baker who heard my complaint agreed that he would also have been disappointed. The only offer made at that point was to add a few more pepperonis and mushrooms. Not only was my entire party very disappointed in the cake's appearance, the amount of money we spent was far beyond our budget, which made the disappointing product smart all the more. The cake itself was delicious, but the experience was a bad one that left us sad. We wanted to be happy, satisfied customers. We wanted a realistic looking cake like the ones their window display advertises. The Alliance neither delivered nor offered any recompense. We expected much more from them.
