I ate Saturday brunch at Frontera Grill that past weekend and thought the food, decor and service were great. The only problem is that there were too many tasty things on the menu...i had a hard time making my decision. It was the first time I had mexican coffee and this was pretty good. I probably will order a different entree next time I visit - I admit, I had the 'Casserole' and it was only 'ok'. Some folks I was with ordered the Sopitas (?) and thought they were great. I would definitely go back adn recommend to a friend.
