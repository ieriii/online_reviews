I have never been so disappointed or disgusted with a hotel and its staff in my entire life. During our stay, the hotel placed us in a room in which they knew the door was faulty, making it so absolutely anyone could push open the door, walk inside and steal anything, which they did. On top of that, the safe within the room was faulty, as the same thief also managed to get into our safe and steal tens of thousands of sentimental jewelry and electronics. The situation was only made worse by the horrifying response of the hotel staff, who showed absolutely no shock, surprise, or apologies when we informed them of the situation. The security in this hotel is terrifying, and even the cops handling our situation told us they would absolutely not stay there. While the cops were in our room getting the details, they were called down to the lobby for ANOTHER security breach in which a homeless man was walking around and wandering into rooms inside the hotel, until he pushed open a door and walked in on a family of four who tackled him to the ground. Now the hotel has told us that they accept absolutely no responsibility for any of our missing items, including the belongings within the safe, because of the faulty door that THEY gave to us! Do NOT stay here if you value your own or your family's safety and property!!
