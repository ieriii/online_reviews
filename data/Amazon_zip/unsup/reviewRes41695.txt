What! I can only give Bonsoiree 5 stars! That's not nearly enough. BF and I went there last night and had just a fabulous time. The waitstaff are impeccable. The dining room is perfectly pleasant. The meal was beyond compare. I cannot find words that are good enough to describe it. Each course of our 4 course meal plus the duck course was a masterpiece. AND, it's byob!! This is not an inexpensive dinner but it is a dinner that is a good value. The food, the flavors, the descriptions, the presentation was flawless. The menu is posted online so you can see what's being served ahead of time. The staff was most solicitous in asking if we had any food allergies or issues. I cannot find a single fault. Just wish I could justify the cost of going more often!! :)
