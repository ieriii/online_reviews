I think this place is pretty great ... however, I liked it better when their pepperoni was basically greasy summer sausage (it was great, because you could tell it was SO bad for you). THAT was the bomb. Anways, these guys are really great. Our Church does a lot of stuff with them, and they're always donating pizzas, both to our events, and to Dignity Diner, which is a community out reach program to feed those who might not have a place to eat ... just a great community presence. I think they also have good deals ... 2 HUGE slices of New Yorkish style ZA (although New York is in every way the inferior city, FO2GO's pizza is a good Chicago reprensentation) and a coke for $7 and change? Can't beat that. They also have the best Hawaiian pizza I've ever eaten.
