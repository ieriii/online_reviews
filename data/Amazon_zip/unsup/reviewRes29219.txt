I adore The Pasta Bowl. It's good anytime of day, but specifically, their Lunch Specials are second to none in Lincoln Park. You get a huge amount of Pasta, bread, and a soda for something like $5.99. I pretty much got the B.V. Pollo every single time (I'd say once a week for a year) and it's absolutely delicious. It's also enough food to fill you up for two meals. The connecting bar is fun too, but I only went once. Their pizza was really good, and cheap. I highly recommend the Pasta Bowl, and I'll be back.
