This is a gem of Chicago. I have had about 12 items from the menu since finding this gem. Fried rice, pork, chicken, duck, egg rolls, sea food and noodle dishes. Everything is tasty and portions vs price is unbelievable. This is a must when I'm in Chicago . Parking is very tough. There are times when I double park in front and call in my order because the metered parking spots are not opening up after watching and waiting. While waiting you will see a steady stream of take out. It's amazing the constant foot traffic at the door. The staff is great and the service has always been very reasonable based on how busy they are. This is the only Asian place I will patronize when in Chicago. There is probably some other good ones but when something is consistently great no matter what part of the menu you land on. They do a great job. Thanks Sun Wah.
