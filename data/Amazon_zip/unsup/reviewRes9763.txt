I didn't know what to expect b/c my other experiences with Vietnamese were, like, Pho. ^-^ But this place was great. The filet Mignon salad was my favorite - it was divine. I had the salmon plate for my main course and it was perfectly cooked and accompanied. It was the banana rice pudding for dessert and it was pretty good - the bananas made it something special and a little more sweet. I also tried their Tahitian (?) vanilla ice cream, which was perfect. My friends had different items but everyone really enjoyed their food. The wait staff was really nice and patient and treated us like we were paying the full price (which, sometimes, is not the case) even though we were there for Chef Week. All in all, it's a really nice place to go on a date, or with friends for a chill evening. Am totally trying to go again soon.
