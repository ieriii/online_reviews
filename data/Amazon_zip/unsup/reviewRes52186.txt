I have no idea what was going on with our server. First, he takes our starter order wrong and instead of coming back with just the Caesar salad that we ordered, he comes back with it AND some sampler platter. Then almost a hour and a half later (instead of the 40-60 minutes) after he tried to tell us we ordered a medium instead of a small, we get our pizza. Pizza was fine. Just nothing remarkable. When the bill came, he charged us for the sampler (which we didn't order) at $9.99 instead of the salad (which we did order) at $7.50. After 2 hours, we took the difference off his tip.
