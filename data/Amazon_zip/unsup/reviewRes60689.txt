I went here on a first date. We have been together for almost a year and a half now and whenever we want to celebrate something special, we go back to where it all began. The fried pickles are so yummy. you really cannot pick a bad item from the menu. Try the blood orange Mojito you will be amazed at how tasty it is! The service can be here nor there on a busy night but overall, this place is one of my favorites. I have never been able to try dessert but I vow to try it and give you a review!
