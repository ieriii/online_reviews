This place was recommended to me by a foodie wine and condiment establishment down the street. I'm only judging Opart by one takeout of phad thai which is not a good enough standard to judge by so this judgement is more about the transaction. Otherwise, Thai is my favorite and I try a variety of dishes in Thai places around Chicago, NYC and Seattle (and stayed in Thailand for 3 months up and down the country). When I ordered the takeout of veggie phad thai, the guy said $9.54. I paid that without really thinking. Then while waiting for the food, I looked at the menu and it said phad thai was $6.54. When the food came, the receipt said it was $8.54. So maybe I paid $8.54 and he just mistakenly said $9.54. I had already put the jumble of change in my wallet and didn't look back at how much he gave back to me. I asked why it cost $8.54. He said "it's $2.00 for extra veggies, we do that for chicken or tofu too", justifying it. I didn't order extra veggies, I just said veggie phad thai, but I didn't argue about it. When I ate the phad thai, I did not have extra veggies, it was just a standard amount. And the phad thai was okay. I was a little miffed. The menu should really say "phad thai, $8.54" NOT $6.54 if they're gonna tack on an extra $2.00 for what should be standard with the dish. But this place was packed with people. Maybe the other dishes are good. I thought Spoon Thai a block down had a great phad thai with no extra hidden charges.
