Trendy and spendy :) Went there on a Thursday night. The place was packed with a young crowd, and many people on dates. Ambiance was nice, very well decorated, but very loud! We had the avocado, mushroom, dragon, and firecracker rolls. Loved them all, just not sure if the portion size and taste fit the price tag (specialty rolls are ~ $13-$20) . Service was okay. Our waitress gave us some good recommendations. However, as the night went on, she seemed to get a bit rushed and tipped one of our drinks on the table. A cool place to try if you're looking for something new and trendy.
