This is a nice enough place with a decent menu, but it just didn't float my boat. A friend of mine took me here and was all excited about it, but I think she fell in love with the owners and servers as opposed to the food and drink. It's true, the folks that run the joint are very nice and interesting people. The crepes, on the other hand, were average at best. On the plus side, they will let you sit and chat with friends for a long time without bugging you. All in all, the two star "Meh. I've experienced better," pretty much sums this place up. Meh.
