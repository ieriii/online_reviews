ANOTHER RIDICULOUS RESTAURANT WITH RIDICULOUS HOURS . I called ahead , no none answered , of course . We walk in on Saturday at 2:25pm . There were plenty of people eating . Host says they stop taking people at 2pm and re-open at 5pm . WAIT .................... REALLY ????? Because by the time those people are done eating , its what 3:00pm - 3:15pm ??? So , you then close the doors for an hour and 45 minutes ??? To do what ???? Twiddle Thumbs ? Rocks paper scissors ??? Rick Bayless ...... I will not be back nor will I tell anyone to go eat here .
