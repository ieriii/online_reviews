DON'T HAVE YOUR WEDDING HERE!!!!! I had mine at the W City Center and although it is a beautiful place, I can't imagine how they could have screwed up more. This is even considering I had my own private wedding planner. I don't want to know what would have happened if they did the event on their own. I'll make this short and only include a couple screw ups.... 1. They screwed up my PARENTS' room....yes my parents'...the ones actually paying for this 300 person event! They were supposed to have a suite with a King Sized bed and they had a room with a double. They kept giving them the wrong keys to the room for about and hour and with all of this hassle made them late to rehearsal dinner. 2. They threw out the top of our cake!!!!! Who does that!? That's a common tradition to save that for your first anniversary. They apologized and said they would make us a new one for our anniversary. So, a year later I got in touch with the catering department to coordinate our new cake. She said "no problem" etc.....then the woman didn't return my phone calls/emails the week before my anniversary and we AGAIN didn't have a cake! This was absolutely NOT what I anticipated from one of the nicest and most expensive hotels in the city that could have held my wedding!
