Amazing gourmet (and standard) hot dogs. The line can be 2hrs but you forget the wait as soon as you take the first bite. The owner is always there and takes your order. He is incredibly kind. The first time we went, we didn't realize it was cash only . We don't usually carry a ton of cash so were going to skip the Cokes but Doug waived the charge. I was blown away by this gesture (and made sure to bring cash and tip extra the next time). Great place with the best hot dogs I have ever had!!
