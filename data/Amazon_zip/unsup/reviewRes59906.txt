Do not be fooled by the cakes in the pictures. They completely messed up an important order 6 mos ago and only offered to refund the difference in ingredients cost - what???Then at my wife's request we tried them again last week for 2 birthday cakes and again, completely messed them up. Do not trust these people with an order for an important event, they suck and do not even provide basic customer care even when they acknowledge that they messed up. That is 3 cakes completely screwed up folks - you decide. Also, the owner Peter is a complete Jerk and refused to provide a any type of credit other than the price of the missing ingredients. If I didn't care about the cake, I would go to Jewel and buy a 10.00 cake, at least then you know what you are buying.They will provide whatever cake they feel like baking that day regardless of what the ticket states There are a lot of talented bakeries in the city that appreciate their customers - Try Bleeding heart or Floriole
