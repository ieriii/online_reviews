I ate here once about four years ago and remembered being very full and happy, so my fiance and I ate here again last weekend. They must have been terribly understaffed, because waiting was pretty much how we spent most of our time. Good thing we're in love. We were quoted a 30-minute wait time, which we were OK with; we went for a walk and got a bottle of wine. When we got back we were told another 20 minutes, and by the time we actually sat down it had been a total of 60 minutes. First rule of hostessing - overquote your wait time, never underquote. People get impatient. I've worked in restaurants, so I hate to be one of those people that tries to do the hostesses job, but it's frustrating to wait an hour when there are four empty tables in plain sight. The server was friendly but the kitchen was very slow, and while the food came out tasty, in the end it just wasn't worth all the hype. We left there saying that was pretty good, but let's never come here again.
