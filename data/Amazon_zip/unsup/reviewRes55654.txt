Went here shortly before leaving Chicago with some friends for a birthday. I must say meh for sure. My biggest problem was the service. 3 times we had to ask for our beers to be delivered to the table and that was round 1, round 2 had to ask twice, our waitress was often times no where to be seen which given the size of the place is nuts. I had a seared tuna that was again meh. This place is suppose to be known for fish but I thought I could of cooked it better. Also the sauce served with it left something to be desired as well. For a appie my husband and I had the calamari and ehhhhh never again and again we make better at home. I don't think this place will be in our rotation upon our return visits to Chicago.
