Yes! This place is the best! Low price, byob, delicious, cool music, great vegetarian options, and yummy yummy shakes/smoothies! It is cash only- that with the byob gives it a bit of an underground feel. Everytime I go there are stylish people around, which enhances the fun effect. I LOVE their plantains and I LOVE the oatmeal-banana shake with soy. (Reminds me of Mexico a bit.) I feel like this is just... the greatest restaurant ever. Staff & diners alike are cool, very cool. Laid back. Great outdoor patio. Take out, delivery. Plus a tall table for single diners to eat. It's all good!!!!! :D :D :D! Great selection and tasty. And very low bill! If you haven't gone here yet, go go go!
