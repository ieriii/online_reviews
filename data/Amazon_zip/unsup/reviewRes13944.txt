I actually have never tried Glenn's for breakfast, but that all you can eat cereal sounds intriguing! I do like their seafood though. The 4 oz shrimp cocktail is a trip- it's the first time I've ever had to cut up my shrimp with a knife and fork! Everything else I've had there has been good as well, although some items have a little too much onion for my liking. The service has always been wonderful and friendly.
