Went again, this time for dinner. Inside was very nice, trendy looking with the wood floors and exposed brick. Figured that I try the Grilled Laughing Bird Shrimp & Fried Oyster Po' Boy, as its one of the items that made them known in the foodie world. Its a baguette-type sandwich with fried breaded oysters, baby shrimp with Cajun Mayo, Tomato Slices, Giardiniera, Arugula and Duck Fat-Roasted Potatoes. I liked the sandwich, the bottom part of the sandwich broke apart due to so many ingredients packed in. Tomato had to have been organic, as it was very tasty. The Cajun mayo was the focal point as while it was good, this coming from someone that doesn't like mayo, they could of cut back on the amount as it seemed like I was getting a bunch of the mayo around my mouth from every bite, which made me feel like a gay porn actor.  Also ordered an Arnold Palmer type (non-alcohol) drink that had hibiscus tea that was very refreshing. Very loud inside so don't go here expecting a conversation-friendly atmosphere as it got pretty crowded. Oh, and the servers here were very personable and enjoyed talking about the organic food here.
