Wow, this is really good food! My boyfriend and I ordered in one night, and we seriously got enough food to feed 5 people and the total bill was $20! I had the falafel sandwich, which was absolutely to DIE for! it had just enough heat, but not too much. The ingredients were super fresh and the sandwich was very light. It was the best falafel sandwich I have ever had. My boyfriend got the meat pie, and at first I scoffed at it (not being the biggest meat eater), but after taking a bite, I was hooked. This meat pie was SOO good. I had no idea! It was so simple and so tasty. He also got the Chicken Shawerma, which I didnt taste, but he ate the entire thing, so I am assuming it was as good as mine. We split the hummus and that was super tasty and the pita was warm and fresh! I found my new favorite gem in my neighborhood. In fact, I think I am going to stop here on my way home tonight :)
