Don't be deceived by the small space and location, the food is phenomenal and very reasonably priced. It's family-owned and you can just feel the love in this place. I believe they're opening up a bigger place on W. Armitage and Milwaukee (I think). This is only my 2nd time to a Cuban resto so nothing was really familiar - I ordered the guajirito (fantabulous!), the Mamey shake (not too sweet, refreshing) plus the different fried goodies with guava and goat cheese (an unusual combo to me). Obviously, I enjoyed it very much and will come back again soon.
