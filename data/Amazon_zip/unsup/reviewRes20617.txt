things i enjoy: tasty little meat ball thingys on sticks with a spicy horseradish sauce, mushroom strudels, miniature fish and chips served in their own little newspaper cones to absorb the grease, cocktail hours and most of all, my job paying for all of these things. onto dinner. we had a limited menu (obviously, it was a special event). the choices were filet or stripped bass. after being informed that the rarest i could have my steak was medium, i opted for the fish. my coworker chose the steak and asked the waitress to go as rare as she could. i definitely came out on the short end of that stick. his steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, whereas my fish... my fish was fishy. i like seafood of all kinds and this fish was not what i would call a catch of the day (maybe a catch of 3 weeks ago). everything else i thought was great. great crab/caviar app, great ceasar salad, nice sides, lovely service.... just lousy fish. i'm giving the gage the benefit of the doubt and assuming the fish was a fluke (no pun intended).
