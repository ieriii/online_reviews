This has to be the WORST pizza I have ever tasted!!! I truly do not get what all of the hype is about.  I tried their thin crust years ago when me and my husband started dating. He raved about this place and I thought he was insane after he took me here. I thought the pizza was oily and soggy and just simply did not taste good.  He has been begging me for years to try it again. After seeing Piece being given huge thumbs up in a recent Chicago magazine as having one of the best pizzas in Chicago I decided to try it again. We ordered a thin crust half mushroom and half onion last night.............HORRIBLE!!! The pizza is still soggy and oily AND I got a bad stomach ache that lasted several hours after eating a couple of pieces. I don't understand you Piece lovers. I would not agree that this is one of the best pizzas in Chicago and I would definitely not suggest anyone attempt digesting this so called pizza!!!
