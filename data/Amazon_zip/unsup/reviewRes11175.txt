I am a sucker for microbrews, so this place is pretty cool, however, I am not overly impressed with their pizza. Actually, I shouldn't emcompass all of their pizza in that statement, I should have said "I'm not at all impressed with their pizza sauce."  When I do make it here I always order the white pizza, never the red sauce pizza. It's...well...it's not that good at all (and I have actually had it, but swore to never get it again). It does get very busy and it can be hard to get a table, but that's pretty much the same at almost every bar in that area....so it doesn't lose any stars for that.
