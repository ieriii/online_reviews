I was so excited when this place opened up in Bridgeport. The food is DELICIOUS! Recently I tried their homemade donuts they were simply delectable!! Also, I happen to know one of the their local produce suppliers. Yep. Produce grown right in Bridgeport! Yay! Some prices are fair but some are a bit steep. Service is generally okay. My first time there the server was pretty arrogant. When I asked for a "coke or pepsi" she scornfully reminded me that they only have organic sodas. Yikes! Pardon me. Geez... She treated me as if I didn't know what "organic" means. Although, service has definitely improved in my more recent visits. My biggest gripe with this place is that the owner seems grumpy all the time. (I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars due to this.) Her sons, I believe, are very pleasant but she is not friendly. I like to feel welcomed when I go out to eat at a restaurant like this. I think if she was friendlier she would have more repeat customers. I do hope this place stays open for a long time. Nice option for dining in Bridgeport.
