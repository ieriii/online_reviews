Calo is solid. My first experience here was at Midsommarfest when some friends and I stumbled in off the streets and purchased beer at the bar. Huge beers for half the price of what they are on the street? Score. Plus, the bar staff was great and handled the large crowd very well.   BUT, a few years later after moving up to the 'hood I've finally had the opportunity to dine here as well. Many times, in fact, as Calo has become a regular dining spot in my book. The reason? They are consistent time and time again. Good food, drinks and service. Every. Time.  The waitstaff is friendly and attentive, without being pushy or rushing you. The bussers? They won't let your water glass get half empty or an empty plate loiter on your table. The barstaff whips up some mean drinks (martini's and cosmos are recommended). And the food, why most people go to a restaurant, is great as well. Everything from the fresh bread to the salads (recommend the Chopped) to the pizza and pastas. Havent had a bad thing off the menu yet.
