This place is great - Just went for their family style Monday night special. I was expecting small portions since they give you so many different things.. Two Apps, two choices of soup or salad, 3 entrees and desert! Wow was I wrong! Everything was great and the portions were huge. For the price ($21) you can't beat this.
