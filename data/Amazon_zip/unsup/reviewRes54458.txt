**I'm not even vegan and I thought this place was great! The food was really good and the service was amazing!**Here's the story:We came here for our vegetarian friends birthday so I was a bit hesitant about the menu (being a meat eater). I ordered the Chikn bacon ranch sandwhich. I didnt necesarily expect it to taste like the real thing and it didn't. BUT it tasted very good! I would certainly go back. I wasn't a huge fan of the macaroni and cheze but the potstickers were delicious!Aside from the food our waiter was so nice! He was attentive but not annoying and he brought my friend a free dessert with a candle and everything. He didnt just do it becuase he was supposed to, you could tell he was really excited and happy to do it! I'm looking forward to going back and trying new things!
