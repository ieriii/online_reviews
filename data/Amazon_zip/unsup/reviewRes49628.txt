This is my first review as I had such a bad time there Saturday night that I felt the need to sign up. The place is fine for a drink, but do not go for dinner. The service was terrible and we were only able to order after we finally flagged down another waiter after several attempts. And even for the prices the entree portions were ridiculously small. Three medium-sized scallops for $23 with two fingerling potatoes? It would take 2-3 entrees to not be still hungry after dinner. The wine flights are a nice to idea to try new regions but go somewhere else for dinner.
