This is my favorite restaurant in the city. I feel weird having a chain (though it has very few locations, it is still a chain) restaurant be my favorite restaurant in a city full of great local restaurants, but deal with it, it is. It seems like every time I go, the wait is a little bit longer than the last time, but it is usually worth it. The food is great. If you leave without eating any buffalo chicken rolls, you've done yourself a great disservice. And although the servers will try to encourage you to be more adventurous, the burger is among the cities best (and I've had a lot of cheeseburgers in this town). The servers are always good and the decorations are a lot less obnoxious than the Cheesecake Factory (which, as others have pointed out, is run by the same people, and you'll know it). Highly recommended.
