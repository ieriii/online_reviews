I came here with friends for restaurant week. I totally screwed up my reservation, but they were so nice about it and were able to get us a table anyway. Our food was super tasty. My entire table enjoyed their dishes, and we really appreciated that we were able to mix and match restaurant week specials with items off the menu. I used to live down the street and from the outside had always assumed it was fancier that it is. I would come back again for a nice but low key place.
