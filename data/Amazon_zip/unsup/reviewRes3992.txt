considering that i wore a sweatshirt and my friend wore a hoodie, this was a very relaxed experience. right up my alley. i'll probably be back as the diners next to us were given preferential treatment (more courses, more explanation, more chummy-ness, etc) and, we were told, it was because they are "regulars." i'm not quite sure how one gets to be a regular here, but...in anycase. concept is similar to the newer EL Ideas. and my experience at EL was far superior...in service, in flavor, in music choice, etc. but, i'd be willing to give Schwa another go 'round because i do appreciate carlson's story and his "i do whatever the fuck i want, when i fucking want to" approach. just not sure if this "avant garde" thing he's got going on is still as genuine as it was on the day he opened schwa's doors. my friend visits from NYC quarterly to knock down some good food. when he got to town, he called, they answered, we were booked for the next night. so, maybe if you don't take scoring a reservation too seriously, you'll get in.
