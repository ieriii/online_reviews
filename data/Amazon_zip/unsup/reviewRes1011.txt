. Now-- My husband had to beg me to come in here. Eating a whole bunch of fatty sausages in no way appeals to me, especially if you have to wait 2 hours to get in. Come on a Monday, right when they open (10am), as we did, and your wait in line will be a breeze. It took us about 15 mins to get to the counter. Once I spied the menu, I began to understand what the fuss is all about. To say that this restaurant serves hot dogs, is to say that Gucci sells t-shirts. The menu descriptions alone transcend "hot dog place". A great deal of inventiveness and culinary care is taken in creating the sausages from often unusual meats (antelope? quail?) and pairing them with toppings that will blow your gastrophiliac mind. Each dog is huge. One could easily be a meal with fries, but me and my hsuband, our reason effectively blocked by the food equivalent of titties shaking in your face, ordered 5 dogs and split them between us. We did not eat for the rest of the day. The dog that sticks out most in my mind, and that begs me to return despite having since adopted veganism, was the one topped with creamy, delicious coins of foie gras. Heaven. We also split an order of cheese fries, because fitting into pants is for nerds.. The best order of cheese fries I've ever eaten, this coming from someone who hates soggy cheese fries. The fires are spiced and the cheese... well, it's not Velveeta, that's for sure. Something a bit nicer. Too bad Monday is not duck fat fry day (gotta get down on duck fat fry day). I really wanted to try them, so I know there is a round of vegan turncoat-ism in my future. I would like to point out to the vegetarians that they do offer a veggie dog, which I may try if only to review it. They also have a classic Chicago do and a range of more traditional dog toppings for the Philistines. In summary, Come here. Eat here. Live here.
