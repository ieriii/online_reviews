"It's in Logan Square." I told Jerel, my dear friend I was visiting in Chicago. Demure face: "I have no reason to go there." "Supposedly it's kind of hipster." I was trying to get him interested. "like you have to wear plaid or big blocky glasses." We exited the blue line and I recognized the outside right away. "I think this is it" "There's the plaid!" he noticed, with hippie mama's and their strollers and their messy hair boyfriends chatting in a group near the street corner. At once my grungy Austin days came to mind. We waited at the bar and ordered drinks. "I'm debating wether to order a cosmo." Jerel smiled. "I don't want to upset them." "No they want you - the black gay guy. You're a highly coveted demographic. " "that's right." he realized. "they do like us." "excuse me, can we get a cosmopolitan?" I said. A blank look went on the bearded tatted bartender. "that's a good question" the Indy Paul Bunyonesque bartender said. "told ya." Jerel said. He went to go check. "He's calling the straight police to get approval." I laughed. We got drinks and moved to a table in a funky fenced in patio area right on the sidewalk of a treed residential street and got a smiley effeminate waiter in skinny jeans.  It was a beautiful day. I had the peeky toe crab benedict and Jerel had the crab mac and cheese. Delicious and fresh, but nothing unusual. The real treat was the free ambiance and the neighborhood. After our meal, a pretty young woman invited us to limbo with them on the sidewalk, it was one of the girls birthday. "she even knows the entire limbo song." Jerel mused. So I did a limbo and she gave me a prize, a cubs coozie. They clapped after I unwrapped it. Now THAT'S five stars.
