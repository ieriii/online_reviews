This place rules. Really. I mean, it dominates and probably one of my best dining experiences I have had in a while. I came here with a group of family and friends, 6 total, Sunday night around 8:30. This place was hopping! We had to wait for a table but who cares when you can order a nice bottle of red and enjoy it, all while in a great conversation? We got a table by the window (and warm!) and started perusing the menu. Now this is the dilema. How does one decide what to order?! Everything looked fantastic and we had questions. Our server, and I am sorry that I didn't catch her name because she was awesome, was only happy to answer about the cheeses, meats, and whatever else.  The hubs and I ordered the Purple Pig Platter (all the charcuterie), three cheeses, the rillette and bone marrow. All were to die for! The charcuterie was presented on a wooden pig! It was so long that we were embarassed for taking up one table! The toasted bread was perfect. The cheese. That damn fromage. How I love thee! I could have eaten all of them alone but had to share. We got a cheddar, a blu, and one soaked in bourbon. Enough said. The rillette was the one thing I didn't try but the hubs was all over it! I, on the other hand, was dying for the bone marrow. Scoop, place on bread, a pinch of salt and bite. I was on cloud 9. Seriously, does it get any better than this? I stuffed myself on the charcuterie, bread and cheese that I couldn't finish all the marrow. What a waste. This is a great place. The ambiance, the music, the service and the food and drink. From beginning to end, it was exceptional. Listen, if you want all of the above, come here. Fast!
