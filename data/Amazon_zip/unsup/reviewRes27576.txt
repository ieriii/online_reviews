If I had written this review after the first time we visited, I would have given it 4 stars. Based on our experience today, I would give it 2 stars, but am giving them the benefit of the doubt. So, the food is quite good here, but doesn't taste as good if the service is bad! One of the things I hate, is recommending and bringing something new to a restaurant and having a horrible experience. Unfortunately, that's what happened today. We went early to beat the rush and walked in around 5:45pm. It wasn't very crowded at all, so the 3 of us sat down right away. We ordered and and the place started filling up. By 6:15pm the place was full and we still hadn't gotten our food. At around 6:30pm, we noticed that all of the tables that had come in after us were getting their food. Had to go up to the counter twice and start complaining before we finally got our food at 6:40pm. The worst part, no one seemed to care or apologized except the waitress. Take something off the bill?? ... not even our cokes!
