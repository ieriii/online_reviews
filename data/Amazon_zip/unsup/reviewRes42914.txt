Delicious and nutritious. Before Fogo I had no idea that there was a Brazilian style pizza. But there is and it is delicious. It is probably some of the best pizza I have had in Chicago. I usually go with the Margarita piza. Fogo is definitely expensive for a thin crust pizza, but there are always Groupon's and Living Social deals, so next time you see one, snag it because this place is well worth it. Plus they deliver. Yummmmmmmmm.
