I can't believe I haven't reviewed Uncommon Ground yet!!! When I moved to the neighborhood (2 years ago) I was thrilled to find something other than Indian and Middle Eastern food. I was even MORE thrilled to find that they have an environmentally and socially conscious menu, a certified organic rooftop garden, and an outdoor eating area that allows DOGS! What could be better? A delicious menu too! I have come here for Valentine's Day, my birthday, random nights out, breakfasts with friends, and I have always been pleased. It can get a bit pricey when you start adding drinks, but they do have a great menu of beer and cocktails. The menu changes seasonally, but I recently had a coat cheese, spinach and artichoke dip that was incredible. On the weekends, I like to order breakfast to go and pick it up! The chilaquiles with chorizo is to DIE for. YUM.
