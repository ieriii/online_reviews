Walking into Sprout, I immediately felt comforted. The vibe of the staff and ambiance in the room is very inviting. It felt particularly cozy on a rainy fall night. We started out with some specialty drinks that were recommended, a cider cocktail and a blueberry bourbon cocktail. All of my favorite things so my expectations were high, but the bartender absolutely delivered. We had to order a second. Our waiter was quite charming and enjoyable, and everyone that approached the table was polite and genuine. The chef's pre-meal taste was particularly delicious. I was happy to see a couple lamb offerings and tried the lamb chop appetizer, which was also excellent. I found the menu had a number of intriguing items; different twists to old favorites. I would have appreciated food source descriptions, but I did like that the selections were clearly seasonal. My vegetable lasagna was decent, but really missing a little something. I did get the hint from one staff member that the menu is still in process. My dinner was soon forgotten after diving into the apple pastry for dessert. Delightful. Going to a new restaurant can often be tricky, but if they are doing it this well on their first week, I'm optimistic it will get five stars from me soon. I look forward to going back and enjoying the warm feeling in that space, and see how the menu progresses and changes with each season.
