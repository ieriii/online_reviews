The boyfriend and I had reservations downtown for sushi on Valentine's day and traffic was no joke. Instead we decided to do a walk-in at Indie Cafe (I saw the reviews on my phone and gave it a shot). Luckily, we were seated right away without a reservation. Although, the service was extremely slow. Wouldn't they have more servers on one of the busiest days of the year for restaurants? NOTE: We ordered from the sushi portion of the menu (this review is solely based on their sushi, not the thai food). I was pretty disappointed. The rolls had way too much rice, and the sushi was pretty fishy. It wasn't fresh. We ended up spending 100+ which included a bottle of wine. We were left unsatisfied. The only thing we enjoyed was the crab rangoon. 2 stars just for that.
