I've come here a few times before .. all during evening times..and the busyness varies...sometimes it's harder to get seated immediately..but even so.. the wait was never really long... Food: it's been soo long since i've eaten food food here, but I do remember the food being good! portions were big so definitely had left overs.. Desserts: -Almond cookies ($15-$16 per pound): are delicious..melts in your mouth. a must try. -Loukoumades ($6.00): it not only looks good, but tastes good as well --it's like a ball sized soft donut dipped in honey, cinnamon, nuts and sesame seeds....yummy and is probably 7278389279328 calories...oh well you can splurge once in awhile.. Drinks: -Ice Frappe ($3.75): if you are a coffee lover, you'll like this coffee.. it has a very strong flavor to it..slurp slurp slurp..or sip sip sip.. Customer Service: the waiters (male) are very friendly and nice, but the waitresses aren't always that great.. maybe they're nicer to the male gender?...our waiter yesterday was extremely friendly!! :) Atmosphere: great place to come for a meal or just for dessert & coffee...or for some alcohol (there's a tv and a mini bar area as well...you can come with a friend or with a group of friends.. :) Costs: typical for bakeries though (I think).. Parking: there's always street parking! would I come here again? yep! :)
