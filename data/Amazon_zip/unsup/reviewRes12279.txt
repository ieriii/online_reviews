So I tried 3 pizzas when I went here: Plain Pizza with sausage and red peppers. White Pizza with chicken and mashed potatoes. Red Pizza with clams and basil. Each pizza definitely has a unique taste that separates it from the other two, but all three had one thing in common: deliciousness. The crust is a perfect crispiness and the tomato sauce tastes fresh. I just wish there was a little more taste and texture to the cheese. If communal dining isn't a problem for you, you can enjoy a nice pizza at lunch for 7-8 bucks. Didn't get to try the beer this time, but I'll definitely have to for my 2nd round. Personal Recommendation: Red or Plain pizza with clams, basil and garlic.
