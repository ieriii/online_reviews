How have I lived this long without forreal deep dish pizza? Delicious, delicious, delicious. With that said, instead of going on and on about the food, when I'm sure you have plenty of reviews to go by, I'll give first timers a few tips that I had to learn the hard way. 1) Do not, I repeat DO NOT, take a huge bite of your deep dish pizza, because it smells and looks so amazing (and took 35 minutes to arrive) that you just can't help yourself. Find a way to help yourself or you certainly will choke. The pizza is cheesy (like seriously) and the cheese expands in your mouth with each chew. And, it doesn't just break apart. You will swallow and still have half of that cheese in your mouth, trying to swallow more and more until it's all down. It's bad business, man. So, TAKE SMALL BITES. 2) Make your life easier and use a fork and knife. I know you're used to regular pizza, that's intended to be a form of finger food. This is not that. Consider it a savory pie and cut yourself tiny slices. This will not only help you to follow tip number one, but it will stop you from over eating, because it's easy to find yourself needing a wheel barrow to get out of the restaurant after about a slice and a half. 3) My final tip: If you're going to order a deep dish pizza, don't order the sample/combo appetizer and expect to eat it all. Nothing in this place is small. The small could be a medium in a half. Yes, you're starving. Yes, you could eat a horse. But you don't actually want to. Get a to-go box and put two thirds of whatever appetizer you order in the box right when it's served so that you don't do more damage than you ever intended to. Now, go forth and eat yourself in to a fat and happy ball of tummy ache from fullness, because it'll be worth every (tiny and slow) bite.
