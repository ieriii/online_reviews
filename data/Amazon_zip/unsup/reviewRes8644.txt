Fogo de Chao is an experience everyone should have at least once. I was introduced to this place over a year ago n try to use every excuse I can to come here. This Brazilian Steakhouse is the best one in Chicago. Period. It doesn't need a fancy owner, our ariel wine angels to make it great the experience speaks for itself. This place is amazing starting at the ambience. The excellent quality of service is hands down the best of any restaurant I've been to. They don't let you lift a finger except to get more food at the salad bar. From the moment you sit down the staff welcome you and make you feel at ease. The salad bar is freshly stocked with cheeses, fresh cured meats, vegetables, etc. but the best part is the 16 different types of prepared meat that come to your table endlessly; the filet, sirloin, chicken, pork, lamb, & sausage... Made so perfectly! My mouth is watering just thinking about it again. The sides of fried polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, and fried sweet plantains are the perfect compliments to the meats. The staff has the best wine suggestions and an excellent selection, once you have finally finished with the amazing dinner and wine don't forget the coffee, even if you are not a coffee drinker it is to die for with the best creme brulee I have ever had. Honestly I could go on and on because I truly love this place, it is a lil pricey but worth every penny hands down.
