The Gage is a very loud place with very good food. Surprisingly, the servers were friendly and very attentive, despite having a pretty packed restaurant. I opted for the Chef menu which included a fennel soup, lake superior trout and a some sort of baked blueberry/raspberry dessert with nuts and ice cream. The trout was phenomenal and was set on top of grits, crayfish with kale. The waiter commented on how fast I wolfed it down. I'm definitely returning to sample more from the menu.
