Came for the sushi. Sat down, asked for an unfiltered sake...they don't serve liquor. Fair enough. I'm new to Chicago, but it seems like liquor licenses are hard to come by. The sushi was meh. Not bad, but not worth turning into a regular occassion. Not a lot of choice in fish, but they do have some unique rolls. We're in the Midwest, so no surprise the rolls are cream cheese and tempura variations, but again, the fish wasn't bad. I wonder how the Thai is. I'll come back to find out, but will keep searching for my local sushi feeding hole.
