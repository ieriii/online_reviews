Just had lunch here, since it's in walking distance of my place. Demera offers a well-rounded lunch buffet for about $7. About half meat, half veggie choices, plus salad, fresh fruit and the eating-bread (sorry not to remember the name of it). It was good stuff. I have to echo others on the service though - once I sat down and got a water, the server never returned. I sipped my water veeeeeery slowly so it would last for the whole meal, waited a while for the check and finally went to the bar for it. But for the price, the buffet would be hard to beat.
