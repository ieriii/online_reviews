AMAZING chicken wings. The breading is so thin that it almost tastes like it's grilled. Yeah I only wish. The meat is so tender, so flavorful that I would even chew on the bones. The seoul sassy sauce is uniquely sweet. My vocabulary is too limited to describe my satisfaction. The baby buddha bowl has lots of rice but not enough veggies. The secret sauce (yellow on the tables) is wonderful. Next time I will definitely get the bad boy buddha. The not so common sandwich is very yummy too. A huge chicken breast, perfectly fried - thin breading, fried twice, and meat so marinated it must have been drenched in seasonings for at least a night. The place is very divey, with wooden tables and benches, and rolls of napkin papers (the very rough yellowish kind, not the baby soft kind) and bottles of condiments everywhere. They also sell popsicles in lots of flavors, and Asian drinks. Writing the above review makes me crave it now. Can't wait to try their whole birds and dig my face in one :D
