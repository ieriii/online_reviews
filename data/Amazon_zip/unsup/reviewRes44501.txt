For me, if you idiots judge a pastry shop by there cup cakes you need a kick in the ass .the way i see it one day martha stewart had a show on cup cakes and all these wacked out prozac queens could not find vanilla extract because they drank it .so they made it some elses problem ..now it is a cup cake marrygoround out there .bull shit ..... Alliance has some great product eat that and shut up...
