Everytime I go to N.L. there is a line or I have to wait way too long for some greasy mexican food. The beans have a film of grease that talks to you for hours. The best thing about this spot are the home made flour tortillas. Some of the best in the area..if you're not making them at home yourself. But thats about it. For some real authentic food head down 18th street a few blocks to Casa Del Pueblo. Some of the best mexican food in town.
