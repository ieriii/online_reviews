Last night was my second time dining at this fabulous establishment. The five stars is based completely off the food. It is all seriously delicious. The menu has changed slightly since my first visit - which makes me love it even more. Same place, new fantastic food = big win. Some things that stand out are: whipped feta and cucumber spread, butternut squash with pumpkin seeds and sage, pork shoulder, nuetella and banana panini... i could go on.. bottom line - go there! you may have to wait a few minutes and the seating may be a little crowded, but your tastebuds will be happy!
