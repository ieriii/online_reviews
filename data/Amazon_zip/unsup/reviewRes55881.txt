In Chicago on business and gave this a try. Went for dinner and a weeknight when it was about 1/3 full.The positives: Nice atmosphere, great service, vast menu, and large portions of quality food. I liked the complimentary naan and marsala dip. Naan was very good; buttery crispy yet soft in the middle with flakes of cilantro. Getting a hot towel at the end of the meal was nice too. The not so positives: While the food quality was very good and the portions were large, I felt the actual taste/flavor of the masala curry was lacking. I ordered my favorite chicken tikka masala. I wanted lamb but they wouldn't do it. Which is strange since they have tikka masala for other meats (even shrimp) but not lamb? They can make a lamb chili masala but not tikka?? Seriously, over like 100 menu items and no fricken lamb tikka masala?? Disappointing. But the chicken was good, it's just not the best masala i've ever had, although better than most. I left wanting better flavor. Their masala has a smokey distinct tomato flavor that i just couldnt get into. The service is so good it is borderline annoying, and almost doesnt allow you to enjoy your meal. The bus/attendant stands by the bar and hovers over the customers, jumping to fill water after a few drinks and pick up plates just as the fork hits the china. He could lighten up a bit and speak louder. I found it unsettling. Menu items are a tad expensive and they get you by charging $5 extra for rice. I get the higher prices, as they seem to have higher overhead for the prompt service and nice atmosphere, but think they have a little way to go as far as attention their dish flavor in order to justify. Overall: Better than average food, but not great or the best ever - but a solid option for some decent Indian if it is convenient.
