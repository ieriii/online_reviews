Stay Away. Never have I experienced worse service. At least 7-10 open tables around 1 PM on Saturday and was told that I had to wait 10 minutes for the servers to get situated. What is that supposed to mean. There were about 5 servers and only 25 tables in the entire place, but it seemed like a chaotic mess. After our bitchy hostess mumbled something incoherently my party of two went to the bar where we were ignored for 10 minutes by at least 3 servers.  This place seems to be run by a bunch of people who hit the pipe a little too hard the night before or on their last break. After being told I could not eat what I wanted (which was on the chalkboard) until 3 PM, I was ready to leave. Had to wait another 15-20 minutes to get our check. Keep in mind that I am sitting at the bar where every server walked by me at least 3 times. Will never go back. Your service sucks. Fruit Flies are not pets FYI.
