I ordered 5-6 items delivery. The guy who answered the phone was very helpful, however the first thing I picked up was that he was definitely not Persian. I asked some questions, and he made some recommendations that ended up being pretty accurate. During delivery, a hurricane/tornado/weather-of-doom warning was issued. I can't believe the delivery guy still made it Period. More surprising, he made it on time while the food was still HOT! From what I recall, everything was pretty decent. It wasn't California flavor or prices, but the meat was fresh and good quality. I'm not sure how the restaurant is, but the prices would be more reasonable dine-in. Overall, this place will give you an accurate idea of authentic Persian food, and I'd order from them again.
