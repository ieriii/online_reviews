SIMPLY AMAZING!! A few of my friends had taken me there for my birthday and I have to say the place was amazing! I love the bright colors, lights, and the open space within. The waiters are very helpful, they have great recommendations, and how to pair the drinks with the food. A few selections I would recommend trying if you've never been are: ROPA VIEJA - Braised beef with sweet plantains, REMOLACHAS - Roasted beats with goat cheese in a orange vinaigrette, and the Arrachera - Grilled steak just melts in your mouth!
