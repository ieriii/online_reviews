I have heard great things about this BYOB sushi place so I figured I would give it a try. I went to dinner on Labor Day with a few girlfriends, and thankfully it was no were near as packed and loud as others have stated it would be. Unfortunately your service when dining at a restaurant can really make or break your opinion......in this case we received what I consider to be a poor service. Our waitress was quite neglectful and slow when she was paying us attention. In terms of the cuisine, the fish was fresh and tasty but a bit expensive for a byob place. My girlfriends had the beef and asparagus appetizer and informed me they have had better, Suffice it to say, I wont be coming back......I think there are better sushi establishments in our great city. Thats just my opinion
