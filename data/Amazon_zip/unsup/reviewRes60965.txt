i ordered online a few times and TWICE the paper was left on the cheese on the grilled cheese sandwich. I understand accidents happen, and thats why I gave them another chance. But twice!? Thats unacceptable. I tried to call the restaurant directly and talk to a manager but I was left on hold for 5 minutes before I gave up and decided to write a review.
