A safe bet when you're starving and don't want to completely kill your diet- that salad bar (the original, according to their menu). I am fully aware in my "old" age that I'm a gal with a hearty appetite. Typically on visits to RJ's, usually after a long day out, or night, or one after a workout, I arrive sure that I won't miss the salad bar but feeling that I need something more like a sandwich, burger, etc. I'm always wrong and walk out with a large doggie bag of that "something extra". That salad bar is awesome! Loads of fresh veggies, balsamic mushrooms, fresh fruit (including berries), delish potato and tuna salads, a couple crowd pleasing soups and you're set. Not to take anything away from their sandwiches- hearty fare with several options on how you like your chicken cooked. Comes with homemade chips (I usually avoid but like theirs for done reason) but you can substitue for fries. Full bar, lots of beers to choose from as well as shakes and malts. That and I have to say I really dig ghe 70's chill vibe. Campy decor and one of the best music play lists. Try not to sing along with your mouth full!
