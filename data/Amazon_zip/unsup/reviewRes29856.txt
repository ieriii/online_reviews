The wait to get a table in Chicago Diner was worth every minute in the cold, blustery rain. The atmosphere is friendly and warm, our server couldn't have been any nicer-seriously, Chicago, don't ever trade in your Midwestern hospitality for mannerisms of other regions-and the food was stellar from appetizer to dessert. A young man in the booth behind ours was celebrating his 21st birthday. The house lights were dimmed so the entire restaurant could sing him "Happy Birthday." Now, I've eaten at a whole mess of veg*n joints across the country, and never once have I witnessed such amazing kindness from a restaurant--excuse me, a diner.
