Amazing!The owner was incredibly nice and patient with our big group of BYOB'ers.  It's more healty and fresh than the Argyle St alternatives. I had the beef lemongrass app as my main and it was plenty of food. Other people in the group got claypots, pho, spring rolls and beef dishes and everyone was very happy with the food.
