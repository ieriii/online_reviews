Pequod's Pizza is what is served in heaven. This to me is the best pizza in the city. Plus, as a lonely jew on Christmas it is open...and it has become a tradition for my wife and I to get Pequod's every Christmas. We get a half pepperoni half green pepper and onion and before I eat it I like to stare at it for a few minutes, sort of like the same feeling I had the first time I saw Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts in Can't Hardly Wait...very similar experiences for me.
