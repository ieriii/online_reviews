Tru-ly exceptional... hardy har har... ok now that that's out of my system, I have to say that I really enjoyed my meal at Tru... even more than L2O. Both restaurants really outdo themselves as far as service and knowledge of the food but as far as flavor goes, Tru takes the cake. I chose the prix fixe menu. King crab, white asparagus, pineapple and tarragon. Hawaiian ahi a la plancha, radish, leek, sauce provencale. And for dessert, I had some wonderful selections of cheese. I'm not used to eating at such high end restaurants. I am usually into the local places or hole in the wall joints but when on business trips, we get treated to the fancy stuff. It's nice. I think we'll be coming back here again.
