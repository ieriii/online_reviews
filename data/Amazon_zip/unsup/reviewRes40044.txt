Whoa! What's with this place having 4 stars?!  Ended up going to this place last night because Da Rae Jung was closed and my boyfriend and I needed our Korean BBQ fix.  The only way it was better than Da Rae Jung was that you got more banchan (little plates of yummy).  Here's a summation of our experience: - service non-existent...no explanation of what was going on and how to cook anything (we didn't need this, but what if we were new to Korean food?). took me 10 minutes to flag down waitress to get more sauce. - got an order each of galbi and bulgogi (favorites of ours). totally under-seasoned and just tasted like charcoal. i'm guessing it's because the grill is too close to the coals. - kimchi and rest of banchan weren't very flavorful. i've had way better at most other korean places i've been to. - no refills on the banchan. they essentially plop down everything on your table when you arrive and then you don't see them again til they give you the check (without asking for it). - not that great of a value. at $20 a person with no booze, i can definitely get a better meal elsewhere.  - this morning my boyfriend (who has spent time in Seoul) smelled his smoky clothes from last night and said "I am never going back to that place ever again".
