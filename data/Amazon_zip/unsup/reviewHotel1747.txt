3.5 stars I just checked out. We stayed here for mini one night get away. There is no doubt that the service is good. Room service was very nice and so was the front desk. The couple of complaints I have are mainly about the room. I was given a mini bar key, but there was no mini bar, wtf? Ok, I can live with no booze...but the room also felt a little grimy and small. I don't think I'd stay here again, unless I was staying in a clean suite.
