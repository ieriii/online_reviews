This is my family's fav spot in Greektown-they were coming here before I was born and my uncle was the manager at one point-so I guess I'm maybe a little biased. Saganaki is a must have-I could probably eat 2 myself. The greek salad and Avgolemono soup are always good, and if you like garlic definitely try the Skordalia. They have great gyros that never disappoint and my favorite dish is usually only available on special...but its basically an orzo rice with a tomato sauce with chunks of lamb-oh my gosh sooo good. Its hard to beat my grandma's homemade cooking but Greek Islands does a great job.
