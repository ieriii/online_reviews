I don't ness see myself as a sushi expert. I just enjoy eating sushi because different restaurants seem to do something different with it. I tried Coast Sushi off the recommendation of a friend a little over 3 weeks ago. I wanted to take someone out for dinner on their birthday and since we both love food, we were like "sushi!" in a girlish high pitched shrill. Walking in, you notice the extremely friendly staff that greets you at the door (even the sushi chefs said hello as we walked into the foyer). We were able to find a seat right away on a Sunday night when it was moderately busy. The atmosphere was dark but still welcoming. Our waitress (who's name i forget, I wish i remembered but she was tall with maybe dark blondish/light brownish hair) was helpful and very friendly. She gave us detailed explanations on what hamachi and tobiko was and recommendations if we liked a certain thing. The food was so good that we ordered roll upon roll until I felt my wallet scream for mercy. I wish I knew this place was BYOB, then we would have bought a bottle and maybe stayed longer. Overall a great experience. I've actually been fiending for Coast Sushi lately. I enjoyed myself. To the waitress: You probably don't remember but I was the black guy that came in with the white girl and we couldn't decide what we wanted for like 15 minutes. You're awesome. If I can remember your name, I'll ask for you.
