When a restaurant shows up on more than one list on TOC and is in the heart of downtown and is NOT a fancy steakhouse, it was just a matter of time before I made my way in there! Stars aligned when an old friend agreed to accompany me on a cold weekday night and it was a fun dining experience indeed. We made an attempt to go budget friendly on the alchohol and were not at all disappointed with a 6$ glass of fine red Italian wine. We deserted any attempt to go calorie friendly and were thrilled with our frugal but delicious small plates. I loved the fried brussel sprouts and the squash arancini, but the very buttery butternut squash was a bit too rich even on a half empty stomach. We didn't quite share our food with complete strangers as TOC predicted but did exchange wine recommendations and small talk- maybe it was the cosy ambiance, maybe the energy on a weekday evening, maybe it was the two glasses of wine, but being friendly with a random diner sitting next to you, does come quite easily at Purple Pig. Less easier is the ability to snag a table without a lengthy wait. But if you don't mind sipping your wine in a dead zone between the restrooms and the main lobby, when the mercury doesn't allow for a wait outside on Mich Avenue - there is not much to complain about with the swine, wine and cheese experience in a very non-pretentious and local setting in a neighborhood that you would least expect it in.
