Pork rinds had too much lime flavor but excellent crunchiness Arctic char is soooo good Shrimp and grits too salty Corn delicious but too much sauce and lose the corn natural sweetness Service good and more than made up for the fact that they ran out of the dishes we really wanted- hence the on the house arctic char which was the best thing that night!
