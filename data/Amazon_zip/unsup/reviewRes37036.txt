Did you know that the enormous umbrella on the back patio is custom made? I've actually never sat inside Hop Leaf, only under the biggest, custom made umbrella I've ever known. If you like beer, this is the place for you. I think the beer menu rivals The Fountainhead which recently opened a roof deck, so it would be interesting to have a showdown between the two. Anyway, food is decent but the beer is the reason to go. Servers are always busy, scrambling around and you know they're doing they're best to accommodate your requests. I think it's the best spot in Andersonville to chill out and meet with friends on a warm summer evening.
