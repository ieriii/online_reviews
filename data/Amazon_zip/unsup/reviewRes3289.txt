Crisp has kind of messed with my head a little bit. I mean, I really like fried chicken, like a lot. Like this was like the fifth or sixth fried chicken place I'd eaten at. That day. Like in one day. (Yes, like all within a few hours, and yes, my doctor says I'm just fucking fine so shut the hell up and leave me and gotdamned chicken the hell alone. I digress...) And the chicken here is delicious. We had some giant ass pterodactyl sized Seoul Sassy chicken wings here and they were great - maintained a crispy crunch under a sticky, but not too sweet or salty, but super flavorful saucy thing that tasted like ginger and garlic and soy sauce and was just fricking delicious. But even with all of that goodness, I can't stop thinking about their sesame oil scented sauteed vegetables. I mean, the chicken was good and all, maybe even pretty dang great, but those veggies are still haunting me, calling to me with a leafy siren song of lingering phytochemical loveliness. Go figure. (Stop #, jeez, I don't even know anymore...like Stop #5 or 6 or something... on the Great Fried Chicken Crawl of Chicago.) PS - The communal seating tables and benches are beautiful, but not the most conducive to the type of elbows-on-the-table fried stuff eating seating that this food deserves.
