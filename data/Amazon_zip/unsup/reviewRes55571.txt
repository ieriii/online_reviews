Just moved to Chicago recently, stopped in here for brunch with some friends on Sunday. The food was really good and our waitress was OK, she seemed a little irritated but it was probably due to the table of messy five year olds next to us. I was also a little irritated by them. The only thing keeping this place from a 4-5 star rating is the incredibly poor alcohol selection and the long table wait!
