I've been here quite a few times but not anymore. The food could be so much better. Maybe things were different two decades ago but I get better vegan food at a non-vegan restaurants that offer a vegan entre; for example vegan bi bim bop at a Korean place or falafel wraps at a Lebanese place. I just feel like there is way too much fake meat in everything. It's like I'm eating veggie slop. Also the desserts are so dense. I've made so many vegan desserts at home that taste way better that what is served here.The service is great and there are some tasty foods. I'm not saying it is all bad.
