My husband and I stumble upon it when we were in the neighborhood and craved pho. The first time we were there, I ordered the pho and he ordered a rice dish with beef (cuts of filet mignon). I loved my pho! The meat they use is good meat with no weird thawed after-taste that some places would have... My husband's dish was also really good. We ordered a couple of appetizers: spring roll and something else (it was fried in phyllo dough or something and had chicken in it). The spring roll was good and I wasn't a big fan of the fried thing. Because their pho was sooooo good, we went back two more times in the period of ten days. Each time, we'd order a different appetizer to try out. We thought their eggrolls were good as well as their meat dumplings.  Friendly waitstaff and super nice owner. He'd come around and asked if we are doing ok ... OH! Their smoothies are AMAZING. I love them! We had their pineapple, mango, and banana smoothies. My husband loves their pineapple smoothie with pearls and I am a fan of the banana (a lot for someone who doesn't like banana normally) smoothie. It tastes sort of like pina colada with hint of coconut in it. Delicious! If we live closer by, we'd definitely carry out from them all the time!
