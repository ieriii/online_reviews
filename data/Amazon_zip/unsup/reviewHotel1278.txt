Another knock it out of the park experience with a Ritz property. I don't know how to convey this but of course there is always the nice finishes that go along with a Ritz. The real difference is the customer service as I've said before. Here's an example. Checking in, chatting with the person across the desk he asked if I would be catching a game at Wrigley. I tell him yes and go about my way. Later that evening I return and he crosses my path to the elevator and ask me how the game was using my specific last name. THAT my friend is going above and beyond no matter how simple it may seem. Bottom line, they treat you like gold and this particual hotel has residences with doormen too that help grab cabs, etc. Fun note: I actually rode the elevator down with Lebron James here! So be on the lookout for celebs!
