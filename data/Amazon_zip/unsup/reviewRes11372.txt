Was craving pancakes and stopped in here before they closed. Surprisingly the place was pretty packed on a Wednesday.  This is my kind of place... they have like 3 or 4 different versions of pancakes with chocolate. I got a Banana pancake with bits of Crunch bars in it... and I was very happy.  The service was a little awkward though... maybe because I'm not used to eating breakfast at a bar.
