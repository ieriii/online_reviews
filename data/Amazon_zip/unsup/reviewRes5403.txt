If you're visiting Chicago, this is a restaurant you HAVE to try. But if you live in Chicago, I recommend trying it, but it's not a place I would visit often. Short version: A bit pricey, because everything is 'tapas' style, so although each dish is about $9-13, you have to order at least 3 between two people. Good food. Best service (our waitress was the bomb). Cool atmosphere. Long version: We ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, & the Chicken Thigh Kebabs. The Bone Marrow was excellent. It's served with several garlic breads (which is unlimited!), and herbs. It's definitely very heavy and fatty, though. So if you're not into that, then I recommend you don't order it. The Pork Shoulder was very soft and tender. Yum. My favorite was the Chicken Kebabs. The chicken was served on a stick with the crispy skin still attached to it and they were laid on top a bed of mashed potatoes and some sauce (tar-tar like). I looked around and saw people ordering the antipastas, but they were so tiny. I was kind of glad I didn't order them. I eat A LOT, and I'm also broke. So antipastas wouldn't really work for my belly and my wallet. The server was so knowledgeable about the menu, and even the wine menu. She recommended all the great dishes and the best wine. I like the restaurant ambiance. During busy times, it's BUSY and hectic. The music is blasting, the environment is lively, and you hear laughter everywhere. Love it. You should definitely try it out, you won't regret it. By the way- there is free Wi-Fi! Just ask your server what the password is. They'll tell yah!
