Holy smokes!  Looking for a place to eat at 8:30 PM is tough sometimes in the city... but this was open until 10:00 PM, so we were hungry and rarin...For $18 (post tax), my fiancee and I ate: Lamb schwarma sandwich - Good flavor, good texture, not likely to reorder. Falafel sandwich - Perfectly crisp and delicious! This is one of the best items on the menu I've had thus far. You've got to give this a whirl! 400+ reviews state the obvious. Eat up! Baba Ghanooj: Two pitas cut into quarters and some baba ghanooj. Very nice! $5 seems a bit much, however for the light eaters, this could serve as a meal. Yum. Bakalava: $1 for a square of bakalava... of which consisted of 7 bites. Good size, good price, not at all greasy like other places that over butter the bakalava. Possibly one of the best bakalava I've had in life thus far in my limited experiences. Verdict: Absolutely a revisit and worth coming back to when you're in the neighborhood!
