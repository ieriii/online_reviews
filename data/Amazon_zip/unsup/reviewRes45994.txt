I'm a big fan of the concept this restaurant (as well as the Cheesecake Factory) has: huuuge portions for a moderate price. The food always tastes great, and usually I can take up to half of it home with me to eat over the next few days. The decor in this restaurant is very pretty, and the huge windows have a beautiful view out on Michigan avenue. The only thing that bothered me was that is was too cramped for my taste, there were so many tables pushed closely together and so many waiters walking around that it was kind of distracting.
