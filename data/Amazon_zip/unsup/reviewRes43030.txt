Tasty, cheap, and fast--just how I like my food. The pizza is delicious- nice big slice with thin crust (more NY style than cracker-like Chicago style). Maybe a tad too much cheese, but still a satisfying piece of pizza that hits the spot! Also had the chicken and it was great-- the marinade tastes just as it smells, perfectly spiced and grilled. The black beans and rice are just like they do it in Rio. Makes me want to hop on a plane and go back to Brazil!  The gentleman who seemed to be the owner (?) was super friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back! Cheers!
