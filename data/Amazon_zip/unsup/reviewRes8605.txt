If you like pizza (and I love pizza) get over to this place and eat some of the best wood oven cooked pizza in Chicago. This place is seriously old school Italian pizza with a few simple, fresh ingredients on a hot tasty pie and it makes for a most rewarding dining experience. Plus, while you wait for a table (it's a popular and modest joint so you might have to wait but its worth it) they give you some homemade cheese. In the summer they have an outdoor seating area and will give your dog cheese too. Also, the antipasto, deserts, and wine are tops too.
