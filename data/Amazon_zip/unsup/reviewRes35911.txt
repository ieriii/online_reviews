Just got back from a quick dinner in the bar, and it was underwhelming. I've had good meals there before, but the portions seem to have shrunk and the prices have gone up. Salad was good, but in my opinion, the serving of salmon was about half the size it should have been. I'll give Shaw's another try when I next pass through town, but it won't be at the top of my list as a place to hurry back to for dinner.
