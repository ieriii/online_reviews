When my boyfriend decided we were going to have Vietnamese for lunch on a cold Saturday I was a little hesitant. He kept talking about this really good "pho" (pronounced like fa). I usually like to stick to my usual asian foods like Thai, Chinese, and Japanese. However, I was really surprised about how good the pho was! The restaurant was packed with a mix of people and they had loud music playing (sounded like B96 or KissFM). We had good, quick service. I got this really good lime/soda water drink and then the most basic pho on the menu which was like a skirt steak soup with noodles, scallions, cilantro, jalapenos and some other little things. It was really good and a huge bowl! My boyfriend branched out a little and got something similar to mine but it had different types of meat- if you call stomach lining meat... I sure don't. We also kept looking over to the table next to us to see what they were doing with the sauces given to us. We mixed a bunch of the sauces and put it in the pho. It was better that way.  We'll be going back. Pho is good on a cold, winter day. :)
