Yummy! I love deep dish pizza but surprisingly, I don't like a lot of the pizzas at many "Chicago Style" pizza places. But, my mouth waters when thinking about Pequod's pizza! I grew up eating this pizza and continue to love it. The dough is soft, the sauce has a sweet taste, and has a good amount of cheese, and the crust is AMAZING! My favorite topping on this pizza is the Canadian bacon, so I recommend trying it if you're a meat lover like me. The medium is more than enough for 2 and a large is big enough for 4...in both cases you will probably have left overs for the next day. Score! Another reason I love this place...they will deliver from Lincoln Park to downtown! Or at least to Streeterville. Be prepared to wait though, for delivery out there, it takes about an hour and 40 minutes. When eating in the restaurant, pizza takes about an hour to cook. Prices are very fair as well. Check this place out!
