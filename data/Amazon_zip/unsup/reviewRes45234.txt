Just enjoyed a wonderful dinner here with friends. To get to the point, everything is AMAZING. I had the grilled octopus appetizer and I wanted to slop up every remainig drop of sauce with the delicious, salt encrusted bread. The entree I had was the orechiette with spicy lamb sausage. It had a GREAT spice and a nice salt to it. I was so full, yet couldn't stop eating it. The pasta tasted extrememly fresh and homemade. Dessert was the strawberry tart. All was excellent. Make reservations! It's so worth it for a fun night out! Also... Excellent service.
