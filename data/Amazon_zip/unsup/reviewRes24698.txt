Artopolis is proof that you should always eat your dessert first! Simply amazing desserts and seriously you can't go wrong ordering ANY of them! I consider myself kind of an Artopolis connoisseur of sorts since my friends and I frequented this place for lunch and dinner and late night (sometimes all in one day!) all throughout college, often endulging in the sweets 3-4 times a week (if not more!). My personal favorites (and this list may get long so bear with me) are the tiramisu (better than in Little Italy!), loukoumades, almond cookies, symphony, chocolate mousse, frappes (don't forget to add the liquor!), baklava, creme brulee, and trust me, the list doesn't even end there. Their wait staff is probably the friendliest anywhere. Always smiling, always making sure you have enough dessert. They make the dining experience great. And you'll probably read that they don't have the best food. And that is completely true. But I'm here to help you out. Get the wood-fired pizzas. It's the best food on the menu. And pair it with either their cheese plate, or their lemon (traditional) soup. And of course, wash it all down with a frappe and don't forget the desserts. Seriously, I'm hungry for their desserts just writing about them! To make a long story short... I LOVE THIS PLACE.
