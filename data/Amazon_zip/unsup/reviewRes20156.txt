OK, so 5 stars is high praise but I can't give 4.5 and Bayless' latest creation seems to have its niche down. I could quibble about the tight quarters and counter seating but I really care about the food as long as the other stuff doesn't take away too much from the eating experience, which it doesn't in my book. I'm not into knocking other places, but after going to Mercadito for lunch one day, I wasn't even sure I liked tortas. Then I met Bayless' little oven-baked Pepito and it was romance at first bite. Mr Pepito is a succulent combination of short ribs, carmelized onions and some of the best bread this side of the border, with just a few too many feisty jalapenos for my taste that were easily brushed aside and a beautiful green chile sauce to keep things interesting.  A tasty sweet and tarte aqua fresca of pineapple coconut and something else went great with the sandwich. Fresh churros with warm chocolate dipping sauce were a delicious sugar and cinnamon work of art unlike anything you'll ever see at a ball game or car show. Can't wait to go back to try the porkbelly vermicelli caldo and a "Mexico City thick" bean-to-cup chocolate! Thanks Rick!!
