I really don't like this place anymore. We used to go here all the time, but the food isn't good and today I got a salad and the lettuce was literally yellow. I was like, "Where's the actual romaine? This is all the stem." And it was $13. I could make a better salad myself or go to the salad spot down the street and get one for $9. The chicken had dark meat in it (YUCK) and it was string bits and not cubes of white meat. I also had charred and black pieces of bacon and gristle from the chicken in my salad, which is AWFUL. Did I mention the salad was yellow? I saw our waiter twice. When he took our drink order, our actual order and I had to flag him down for the check. Time to find a new place. Grade: F over it. Maybe for a drink but that's it.
