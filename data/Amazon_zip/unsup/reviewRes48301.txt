Went here and had a great time. Didn't sit in the booths or one of the big community tables, but a small 2 top towards the front of the place. Had a reservation, were seated right away, and had a fantastic guided tour of the menu. The server gave us great suggestions on beer and food, and for the most part, everything was great. We started with the pork rinds & half a plate of the country ham - of which I could've eaten another by myself and called that dinner because I'm a fat man inside a normal man's body. Cured ham? Yes please. One of their signature dishes is the farm chicken - I usually hate ordering chicken when I go out because, well, it's chicken. This takes a couple minutes, and we were warned that, but damn, it's good. Negatives: The boudin blane didn't have a lot of flavor, and, at least on our plate, there was way too much Dijon. So, that was about all I ended up tasting. The beer list is a little steep in price - I understand they're craft beers, but c'mon, this is Chi, and I can get a good craft beer for a lot less at several places around town, ya know? Overall, pretty strong first experience.
