I LOVE Carnivale. I have been to the resturant several times for dinner and the food is excellent. It can get a bit loud so it may not be the best choice if you are looking for a quiet evening. It is great for groups and parties. I recently had my wedding reception in the Samba room. My reception was everything I could have asked for. All of our guests had a great time and LOVED the food. Several of our guests commented how nice it was not to have to eat the typical wedding food or sit in a hotel ballroom.  Also - since Carnivale has such great color and decor - we did not have to spend that much on center pieces. There are also tons of great places to take pictures throughout the evening (the hallway, couch area) Also - Alyssa Stark - the event coordinator was a true pleasure to work with.
