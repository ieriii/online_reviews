OMG!!!!!!!! blown away,,, The service here is ULBELIEVABLE it was like if you just thought of something you might want they where there saying "hey would you like this".. This is a dining experience that is not for the casual diner, what I mean is you don't just say let's go to TRU tonight. We got there at 7 and left about 11:30, it is like going to/ watching a show. It is expensive so be prepared, I think dinner for 2 was about $650 with the tip (lucky for me someone else was paying)... It was worth every penny in my mind and I would do it again!! It is everything it says it is.
