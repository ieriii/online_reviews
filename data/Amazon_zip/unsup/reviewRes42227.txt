Time for a Gilt-y update! If I'm looking to start the night off right this is where I usually head to dinner. The food is delish, and the scene is just enough to get my groove going for a night of cocktails just about anywhere in River North. There are multiple spaces for dining so it can suit a couple out on a romantic date, girls night out with a few friends or larger groups of people. Tables, booths and couches all add to make for a very eclectic atmosphere.
