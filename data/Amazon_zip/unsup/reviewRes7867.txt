If it was socially acceptable, I would come here in sweatpants. I feel like I have meat in my veins when I leave this place. Remember John Candy from the Great Outdoors and how he was in the steak eating contest? How he felt at the end of that is how I feel after I've eaten here. Good luck going out after. I wonder how hot dog eating champ, Kobayashi would do here.
