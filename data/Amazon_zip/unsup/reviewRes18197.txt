The beer menu at The Bad Apple is massive - and that is awesome. And they have poutine! What's not to like? Their menu is also creative and delicious. I would come back here daily for their varieties of seasoned fries alone. The dining room is spacious and has lots of interesting art, and the music is always good. The servers are especially nice and are really helpful with choosing a beer or burger.
