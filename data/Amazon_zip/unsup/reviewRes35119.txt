The only reason why I gave this a 3 star rating was because of the overall experience. First off - The sushi itself is very good. I would probably order takeout to save the money (drinks, tip, time) rather than dine in. The dining experience is what prevented the 5 star rating in my book. Atmosphere - I felt like a DJ was going to pop out of a corner and start spinning house music. This place seemed to be more of a place to be spotted, rather than a place to eat. There was a wall in the back corner with the DVD emblem bouncing around the wall because in the 2 hours I was there, no one could either restart the DVD player or press play on the player. I don't know why anyone needs to be watching a movie in a sushi restaurant. Service - We sat down around 8:30 at night on a Monday night (not typically a night for slow service) and didn't get our food until about 9:30. There were 3 of us there, and we decided to split a bottle of wine. The waitress brought out the bottle and 2 glasses. She ran off to get the third glass and we ended up pouring our own wine. We ordered Soup and Edamame as an appetizer (I the edamame, my friend the soup) and she got the soup while I waited on the edamame for another 10 minutes! A group sat after us, and the waitress took their order first, than finally took our order. Once the order was taken, we still waited about 45 minutes to receive our food. Please let me remind everyone that this was on a Monday and I think there was only about 3 tables. If we are going on food along, this place deserves 5 stars. The price is pretty standard, (about $10-$16 per roll) and the quality is very good. I was not a fan of the atmosphere and the service, which is why it received the 3 star rating in my book. My suggestion, order takeout and eat it on your back deck with a nice bottle of Saki or wine.
