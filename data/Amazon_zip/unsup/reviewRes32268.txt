Drinks were nice. Service was fine. So why two stars? The food was simply not good, and some of it downright bad. Also the wait for a table was longer than we were told it would be (waited over 1.5 hours, friday night) Maybe the thing to get here is seafood fare, but as far as the terrestrial, it simply was that not good. We had three things: Chicken and Mushroom Shu Mai: This was fine and good, but it's shu mai and you can pretty much get that anywhere and have it be good. Lemongrass Beef Lollipops: These were BAD BAD BAD. It was a low quality cut of beef, thinly sliced and wrapped around a lemongrass stick. It was overcooked and tough and had an awful cheap beef flavor. Now I am sure they get fresh beef coming through the place all the time because they are such a high volume place, but to describe the flavor of this lollipop all I can say is imagine putting a steak in the freezer then pulling it out after 4 months nice and freezer burned and eating it. It was that type of "beef" flavor. Now I know the food was probably fresh, but it just tasted bad, nay, awful. BBQ Pork: Was mediocre. It was a very fatty piece of pork. Now I am a disciple of the pork fat gods, I love the stuff. I will smear lard over toast and all. But the pork just was not that good. The sauce on top was meh, and the bok choy it was served with was bad too. To be fair, we didn't try any seafood, maybe it's good there. But on the whole what we did have was pretty downright bad.
