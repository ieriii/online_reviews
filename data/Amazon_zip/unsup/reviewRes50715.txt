I loved my Sunday brunch here! A friend and I made reservations a few weeks ago (thus bypassing the dreaded Mother's Day scene), and it was great from start to finish. Of course, it's hard not to be gush praise when you start with complimentary beignets. We split the addictive fried green tomatoes, munched happily into our second courses (country breakfast and cheddar corn cakes, with a side of just-right bacon), and then finished the gorge fest with a serving of bread pudding to-go. Yup. Oink. This was a much better meal than my first, where I was silly enough to only order oatmeal.
