Although they are delicious, I am not really concerned with the other side dishes served at this restaurant. They are a mere distraction to the red meat heaven served here. Get the Entraa, medium rare. It is an exquisite piece of seasoned skirt steak. The chimichurri sauces that accompany everything are also excellent. I dipped everything in it. My friend actually asked for extra chimichurri sauce, to take home. He later confessed that after trying it with different foods at home, he eventually just started eating it straight out of the little plastic cup. My only complaint was the hostess, handling the seating. The first time, we were told that if we arrived within the next 30 minutes, it would be a 10-15 minute wait. I arrived in 20. Ended up waiting close to 50 minutes. On the phone, she asked for my name. When I got there, it was clear that she did not take my name, or make any arrangements for my arrival. What the hell is that? Pretend like you're holding a table for me, and when I arrive, treat me like walk in? My gf made reservations the second time, and I don't remember the details of what happened, but there was a mix up. It would probably benefit them to work on their reservation scheduling. It is the only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars.
