As so many others who enjoy macaroons (macarons) have mentioned, it is so difficult to find good ones in Chicago! But alas! Alliance Bakery has come to the rescue with some help from the famous king of macaroons, Pierre Herme. The owner of this shop studied under him and has saved all of us macaroon-lovers from the hard, tasteless macaroons that haunt much of the city.Personal favorite is the raspberry rose. Go get them now before I do.
