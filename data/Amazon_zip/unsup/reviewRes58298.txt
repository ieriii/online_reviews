The pizza was great. There's not need to go on and on like others have about that. But the service ruined the entire experience. We went in on a Sunday afternoon and the server was in another world. She was TERRIBLE. She forgot our drinks, our refills, and our condiments we asked for. It was borderline comical. When I went to the bar to see if I could pick up the beer that had been sitting, the hateful bartender told me that she has other tables, you know. Oh really? I hadn't noticed the 2 other tables she had. My bad. And then when my friend let the manager know how awful it was, he said Sorry about that and walked away. Wow 1-star for you Pequod's...sorry about that
