Finally revisited this restaurant after a number of years and was glad to see that it's going strong. It's definitely a youngish, hipster crowd with a very laid back vibe. The food was good overall, but I have to say the potato skins were a significant disappointment. I guess certain things just don't quite translate to vegan. They could stand to add a few original menu items, rather than relying almost exclusively on meatless approximations of traditional dishes. That said, it's probably worth a return visit at some point to explore other parts of the menu.
