Tried Coast for the first time last Friday night. It was great sushi with a trendy atmosphere. Although we had to wait an hour before we got a table. The hostess suggested the bar around the corner while we waited since Coast doesn't serve alcohol. She took my cell number and said she would call when the table was ready. I was a little skeptical about her actually calling but she did and it was exactly the hour wait quoted. Our service was good for a busy Friday night. Our order seemed to come out in a timely manner and the server was efficient. I will definitely be back and recommend other sushi lovers try Coast. I would suggest going earlier than 8pm if you don't want to wait an hour.
