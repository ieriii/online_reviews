Oh so scrumptious. I am a sucker for a creative name, so that was the jump-off.. Also anything having to do with pig should surely nourish my cuban soul, and did it ever! We started with white wine to accompany our appetizers, which consisted of feta and cucumbers, and pig ear crisps under a fried egg. Thank u sweet baby pig geezus. Crack that yolk dowg, get it crackin. Then came the strange famous bone marrow, 1st step marrow spread on toast, then some salt on the marrow, last some of the green (salad) they supply to top it off. Crack. We ended with white wine and the sirloin tip entree... At this point we were quite inebriated (stopped prior to at English, awesome bar close by) and were jamming to the tunes they play in the restaurant, Biggie, Tupac, MGMT, etc. Bustling atmosphere, great food and music. Awesome place.
