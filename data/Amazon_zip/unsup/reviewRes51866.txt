We used to eat at the Gino's East in St. Charles, IL when we lived there. Now, visiting downtown after leaving the area seven years ago, we definitely made it a point to stop in for some pizza at the Original Gino's East. I think the breadsticks changes a little (used to be square and more garlic flavored) but were still good. Since this was a lunch, we opted for the thin crust with famous sausage. Pizza is still the best!
