This place threw my date and myself for a loop. High end snootie bbq...?! Is that a pair...? Well food was goooood, nice decor and VERY attentive service. Almost too attentive. We must of had 5-6 different staff members check on our meal experience. From the busboy, waterguy, server, wine dude, manager, etc. etc. checking numerous times throughout our meal. Overall really nice experience. Gotta go back for the hominy app. Drinks were just that right amount of strong to take that edge off. Will definately return, just gotta save some scratch cause it can get pricey if you do a meal from soup to nuts.
