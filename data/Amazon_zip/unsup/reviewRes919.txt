If youre gonna have a chicago real deal dog, you will have to trek on out to Hot Dougs! its way out there, and you will wait on a line(luckily it wasnt freezing cold this day) and they close at 4pm(that and far location prevented me from giving them 5 stars!) and if you go on the weekend you can get the fries cooked in duck fat, my heart skips every time i remind it! prices are great, dogs are even greater!
