My friend and I tried Anteprima yesterday and the food and ambiance was exceptional.  Tip: Make reservations! - We went around 7pm and the place was empty, however, we were told that only tables were at bar or table would be available at 9pm, which was fine for us, however, we were surprised as there were ample empty tables. Well, in 15 minutes of our seating, the place was quickly on its way of being full. We ordered an appetizer that was 2 fried eggs (with very slight liquid yolk) mixed with homemade tomato sauce on oiled bread. We were told that is a traditional Southern Italy dish and it was tasty, after realizing it was boiling hot. My dish was a ravioli with chestnuts and mushroom cream sauce. I ordered the dinner portion and it was the the right size. You can choose to do a tasting portion, but you'll need at least 2 dishes to make a meal. The ravioli was done well and the chestnut flavor was balanced with the mushroom creme sauce. Actually, I would have liked the chestnuts to have a slight stronger flavor as it was a bit masked by the sauce instead of balanced. I could tell that the ravioli were made in house and along with everything there was made by them. Only the breads were brought in from a bakery, and they give a nice selection of breads in a basket before the appetizer arrives. Antepasta, according to the bartender who was well versed in the menu, uses little sauce in its dish, just to bring out the flavors of the dishes instead of masking the flavors. Just keep in mind, that if you are looking for a sauce dish, you won't find it there. I will definitely be going there again to sample more off the menu and try a Dolci on the next try.
