There are only so many capacities in which I will eat fried chicken. One of those capacities is not riddled with sobriety. Another capacity is this wonderful locale nestled like a baby chick just south of Wellington on Broadway. I have brought my family here, dates, anyone and everyone that I feel needs to experience how tasty these Buddha blessed wings are. A poignant statement was uttered in the back of Bobtail one day during a break-induced bender of Crisp chicken about how the chicken may not be the highest quality. However! This critique was complimented by the ring of all of the various Crisp sauces surrounding everyone's mouths. Each and every one of the sauces is so incredibly unique but absolutely addicting. I would eat it cold, warm, pipping hot, maybe even scalding. Coupled with some onion rings and Alison's Atomic sauce spells doom for any type of productivity regarding the scooping of ice cream or entertaining whoever I brought to this magical place. I also have no shame in putting the Crisp bowls in my mouth. The mixture is incredibly interesting since some of the ingredients are hot (the rice, protein of choice, the egg) while the other ingredients are cold (spinach, carrots). Swirling it all together is my go to method, but I'm sure you can eat everything individually if you like. I don't care; just get that bowl in your mouth! Make sure you take notice of a tall, handsome employee there that is clearly Irish. He holds a special, figurative place in my heart, opposed to the chicken whose presence is both figurative and literal.
