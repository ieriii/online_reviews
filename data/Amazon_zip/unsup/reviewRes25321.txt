Artopolis is right down the street from my work, and since there is a lack of places to grab a quick lunch around there, I've been quite a few times. I have yet to have a meal that I just love. The food always looks good, but it's deceiving. It looks so much better than it actually tastes. It just lacks flavor and really is nothing special.
