The Grillmaster, with its sublime chicken breast, grilled onions, mushrooms, Monterey Jack cheese and Atomic Sauce, is irrefutably one of the best yet underrated sandwiches in Chicago. It's a beast and looks almost more burrito than sandwich. I would walk a mile in the rain for this special treasure, and come to think of it... I have! Actually, almost every sandwich here can hold their own with the best of the best. I've only one small bone to pick and that exclusively applies to delivery and carryout - the sandwiches and fries do not hold up well and within 15 minutes, everything's a-wilted. Fix this, please? I still love you, anyway... that is all.
