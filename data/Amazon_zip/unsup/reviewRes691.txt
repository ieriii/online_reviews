I really can't say anything more than what's been said already. I've never had a dining experience like Alinea's. For each dish, my palette traveled to another plane of existence. Get ready to put forward a lot of dough for that trip, though. One tip: don't gorge on the food, eat it slowly. I have a tendency to shovel my food, so I had to curb that habit. You'll appreciate the food more.
