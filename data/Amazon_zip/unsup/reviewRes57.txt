A review of the food is not needed. But I wanted to just rave about my experience. Everything (building design, staff, wine pairings and of course food) was exceptional. Non-adventurous eaters need not apply. Seriously, because you'll write a poor undeserving review that will skew the almost perfect 5 star rating.
