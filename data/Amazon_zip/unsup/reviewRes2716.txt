Remember when I said Uncle Julio's was my happy place? Yeah well really THIS is my happy place. That's my affordable happy place. If I were independently wealthy this is where I would frequent. I love everything about it except that they lent or gave that fantastic Paris picture over to the Paris Club. If you're there you'll see it. This place has it all. The service is like a choreographed ballet. The art is exquisite. The room is open and simple and calming. The cocktails blow my mind. I've had the wine pairings and gone with just a bottle of something. Either way, and at any price point, you're getting something terrific. If it weren't terrific they would correct it for you. Even the silverware and the dishes are fantastic. And I haven't gotten to the food yet! I don't know where to start with the food. The bread. I have dreams about that pumpernickel bread. The butter is rich and creamy and delicious. The food is thoughtful, artistic, interesting and delicious. Then the cheese cart. OMG the cheese!! If I were on a desert island that is what I'd want with me. I love that cheese cart so much. By then you're stuffed like its Thanksgiving but no, here comes the treats cart. Everything on it is good and you can have as much as you want. Its Wanka time. And if you ask - they will bring you a mini root beer float with Gale's very own root beer and grand marnier ice cream. You're there for over 3 hours. You eat so much. Hopefully you've had a lovely time. And then they have your coat waiting for you and a little bundle of treats for your coffee the next day. SWAK!  I think of reasons to go here. The first time was nearly 10 years ago for a 30th birthday. Then my friend was working for LEYE so I got in good. Real good. Then I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and once for New Years Eve (in bed before midnight because you're so full!) the last time I saved up LEYE points to soften the blow when the check came. Highly recommended.
