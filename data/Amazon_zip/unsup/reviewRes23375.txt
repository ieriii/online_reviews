The food awesome! We loved the Saganaki! The food was great. No doubt about it. The desserts were amazing. Presentation - awesome! Especially the Saganaki - really cool!! Service - don't stand in my face!!! I think though it was our waiter. The rest of the service was good - we got our seating in 5 minutes on a friday packed night, every one was smiling etc. Our waiter was like rushing us through our food - we went with another couple friend and were at the table for 2-3 minutes and the waiter kept asking us every one minute if we knew what we were having. Then after we ordered he took away my husband's and my girl friend's plate filled with food that they wanted to box. He did not even ask them! Then when the bill came we just kept our CC in and he assumed that we were done with our coffees and picked them up and cleaned our table! It was not like there were people waiting to get in or something but he was like in a rush and wanted us to get lost!!!! I gave this place 3 stars as the food was great and you may not get this particular waiter. So try your luck :-) BTW - They have free valet (and so do most Greek restaurants in the neighborhood).
