This is a place for all you folks that are on a real tight budget. There is one meal in this place that you can get that both fills you up for next to nothing! Their burritos are great. They are also huge! Their menu is extensive and the food is good at a reasonable price. If you ever get to the place and cannot find a seat in the dining area, go to the bar...you still get waitress service. A burrito dinner with one bottled beer, chips and salas came to a whopping $11!! And I took HALF of the burrito home it is that big. So is it healthy.............heck no..........is it good.......yes......is it cheap.....yes again......to two out of three isn't bad. Give these folks a try.
