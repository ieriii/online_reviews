Came here with a group of my closest friends and did not expect much, but was completely blown away by the service as well as the food, and so here I am for the 2nd (and probably last) time writing a review on Yelp.Walked in, and thought the place was nice. Small, but nice. (3) Three floors, and a decent looking clientele. Sat upstairs and was immediately confused by the presence of Strip Steak on the menu, as well as the quantities for their Wings. I immediately understood when the Wings arrived, as they are enormous, and thank god our waitress stopped us from ordering too many. I apologize for ever having any negative thoughts what so ever in regards to their Strip Steak because after eating the Strip Steak Sandwich, or as we now call it: "Heaven in a Bun", I was in a state of euphoria that lasted for days.The drinks were... well let's face it, my friends and I drank a lot so who knows, but they were in big glasses and everyone there was awesome so enough said.If Bucktown was closer, this would be our "Peach Pit".
