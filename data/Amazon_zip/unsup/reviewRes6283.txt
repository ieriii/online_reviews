Had to finally get down to Davanti Enoteca to see what all the buzz was about. Grabbed a couple neighbors and headed down late on a Sunday afternoon to catch them before they got busy. We were welcomed warmly and seated promptly. What a great rustic space with warm lighting and cozy vibe! Sunday had a wine special (retail wine prices and NO corkage fee!) so we enjoyed a wonderful and very inexpensive bottle together to start. We took our time going over the menu and each of the four of us chose something to share. The Mascarpone Polenta with Ragu was excellent (cool and unique presentation!) and we could've gobbled up several orders of that with crusty bread and called it a meal. We had a selection of cheeses and meats that were all wonderful (pretty hard to get that wrong!). We throughly enjoyed one of the Pizza Con Salsiccia E Rapini flatbreads as well. All in all a very enjoyable experience. We spent a decent chunk of change there for what seemed more like a large lunch with a $25-ish bottle of wine, but the experience was unique and memorable enough to merit the price. I should also mention that the waitstaff helping us were cheery and eager to offer recommendations. Will certainly return...probably soon!
