Wow, lots of people hating on Irazu!Other than there being no place to sit except outside (cold much?) I think it's pretty good! And I am about the least adventurous eater EVER. Seriously, I've never had Asian food. Or mayonnaise. Check it out, the burritos are good, and it seems pretty authentic. No compaints. Stop hating!
