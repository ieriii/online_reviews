I love vegan food. I think service is awesome, Personalities are usually so friendly. Yes, that place is almost always full. So, i guess it means food are good. I will agree with that. Some of the stuff is a little too heavy, but menu is big, so it should take care of most of the critics. I love their sweet potato fries. Also, I think gyro is pretty awesome as well - pretty realistic. And of course their famous milk shake. It is sweet as hell, but who is not addicted to sugar these days? Great food and place!!!!!
