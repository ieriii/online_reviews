After waiting patiently for months to venture out to Wicker Park to try Violet Hour, I can definitely say it lived up to the hype that I had created for myself (as well as what others had told me.) As many yelpers have said, it is easy to walk by this place, especially if you're not careful to lookout for the address. It looks like a construction site with a peeling mural disguising the entrance which is literally just a door handle sticking out of a wall. Upon entering, you go through two sets of heavy curtains that unveil an extremely dark lounge. Needless to say, it took several minutes to adjust, as well as fumbling around in my wallet to find my ID to show the hostess. Upon being seated in high backed chairs with a great view of the bar, my eyes finally adjusted to focus on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided on getting a whiskey drink each--I chose the Barbed Wire Daisy and he went with the Summer Sazerac. Initially I was a little disappointed with my drink, as it appeared to be a pink girly drink that was quite sweet on the first few sips. Although, it redeemed itself as I tasted the complex flavors of the cinnamon syrup and orange bitters as they complimented the whiskey. My boyfriend LOVED his drink, and remarked that it was probably the best mixed whiskey drink that he has had to date. I too enjoyed his drink, as it was classic and simple, and extremely tasty. I would have loved to had another drink, but dropping $50+ on two drinks a person is a little much in one night on drinks alone. Regardless, we will definitely be back, and I cannot wait to try the Old Fashioned.
