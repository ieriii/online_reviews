I loved everything except the fish, but really, why would anyone want to get fish here? Standouts included the Asian braised pork belly, the hangar steak, and the buttermilk ranch marinated sirloin. Our group received outstanding service, with every meat choice coming around our table multiple times. I wish I could comment on the dessert, as the menu looked good, but I ate about 2 lbs of meat and simply couldn't find the room. I'm looking forward to my next visit.
