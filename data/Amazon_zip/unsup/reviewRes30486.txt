I'm from San Diego and I love Mexican food. So while on vacation in Chicago, I was desperately looking for a mexican restaurant. This one was recommended in my travel book so my mom and I took a shot at it. By the size of the crowd I could tell this was a happenin place. We started with the guacamole dip which was amazing! Then for lunch I had beef tacos. Yum! No fat at all on the meat and it was so tender. My mom had the goat enchiladas and she loved them. We'll definately visit this place again on our next vacation.
