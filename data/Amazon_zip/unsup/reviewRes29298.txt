I'm a fan for sure since it's not easy to find great vegan food. Each time I visit Chicago I stop here and every time I dig it EXCEPT for this time. It seems that the creativity in vegetable and tofu/seitan/tempah creations have been sidelined for the standard typical burger/panini/appetizer /salad selections. There is an art to creating spectacular vegan food and Chicago Diner use to be one of those places. Next time I'm in town I won't be dining I just hope I can find a replacement.
