Piece might very well have been the tipping point for the gentrification of Wicker Park when it opened several years ago, but at least it serves up some pretty good beer and pizza. Any place that can cater to the demented whims of me and my friend and prepare a sausage, bacon, garlic, jalapeno, olive and green pepper pizza without batting an eyelash and while keeping all the ingredients in good proportion to one another deserves a four-star review. Piece is impossible to get into on many nights, but they can't be blamed for doing good business.
