Grand Lux: We had a good run, but I think things are finally over between us for good. Don't get me wrong, we had some good times. Remember our first time when you woo-ed me with your beignets? They were massive, and tasted even better than they looked. I thought that the things you could do with flour were amazing... and the way you handled that powdered sugar on top was so delicate! The cream sauce left the perfect finishing taste in my mouth. But then you started to change. I don't even want to talk about that night with the Seafood Salad, and you started slacking with my usual backup of Chicken Tortilla Salad. I saw you looking at those tourist couples on more than one occasion, and you didn't even give me the time of day when that party of 8 came in. Not to mention the last time I came over, you had the audacity to tell my friend that those sliced chicken pieces weren't raw in the middle when they were clearly pink! But whatever. That's in the past now. Let's let bygones be bygones and poultry be poultry. I've found a place that can offer me better crme brule and just more, how shall we say.... consistency? I'm sure you'll be fine. You're not bad-looking. You have curb appeal. You're diverse and popular among the younger crowds. Let's not forget your dad, The Cheesecake Factory, is pretty well off. I'd like to say, "it's not you, it's me" but no, it's you. I need more. Consider this goodbye.
