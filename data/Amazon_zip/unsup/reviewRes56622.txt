Nice atmosphere-I would have liked to eat outside but it was too hot. I like the casual attire of the wait staff, as it gives a home feel to the place. The polenta with meatballs was obscenely good! The only letdown for me was the risotto-a little mushy and minimal taste. Otherwise a nice meal and I would definitely come back.
