All I can say is hands down one of the best in the Wrigleyville area. The Shrimp Poor Boy is awesome the Black and Blue Burger is the cats meow and the Prime Rib sandwich is killer as is the Rueben. If you want a great breakfast well Glens is also the place. I have not made it there yet for dinner but that will be done in short order! TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT!!!
