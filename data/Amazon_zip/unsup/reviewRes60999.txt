This place is straight up nastayyyy! We walked into the bar and the bartender was hot. We were off to a good start. I got a burger served up and it looked pretty solid. I ate it and was pretty happy overall...that is until i saw THE ROACH. I nearly hurled. I pointed it out to my friend as it found a tiny crevice it walked into. The thought that I may have ate one of those with my burger was enought to ensure I will never be back.
