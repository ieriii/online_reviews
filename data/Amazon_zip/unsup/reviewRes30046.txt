I had one of the best Thai meals I have had in years. Everything was tasty, fresh, and well prepared. I've been eating Thai food for 20 plus years and have been to Thailand several times. I've noticed that as the years pass, the Thai food in Chicago is declining in quality. I think the chefs are adjusting their seasoning to western tastes. The food in the restaurant had the same taste sensations I remember when I first discovered and loved Thai food! The fact that it is so crowded in an area with many Thai restaurants is testament to its quality. I saw in some reviews that people complained about the service. I've never had especially good service in Thai restaurants even in Thailand so i expect things to be served out of order, to wait for condiments, etc. There was a little of that at Opart but nothing horrible. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the waiting area melds into the eating area. We sat at the edge of the restaurant and we felt like people waiting for tables were hanging over our shoulders. There needs to be a little more difference. That being said, I'm looking forward to eating there again!
