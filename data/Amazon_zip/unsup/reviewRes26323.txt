Now that we recently moved back to the City, I ate at Geja's again after a 15 year hiatus (used to dine here about 3-4 times year then). Unfortunately, we were very dissappointed. Prices, of course, have gone up considerably - probably more than the rate of inflation. That would be ok, IF the dishes and service were at least as good as when I last dined here. But, they have gotten smaller (less meat/shrimp/lobster, less veggies, and even less variety of dipping sauces). Cheese fondue was also smaller and dipping bread wasn't even very good. Service wasn't great either - but, we understand that can vary with the waitress (ours was a real Ditz). Of course, it remains a romantic spot -- IF you're lucky enough to get a roomy & private booth (on this occasion despite advance reservations, we were not).  Long ago we learned to make our own complete Fondu Dinners - even better than the Geja's I remember; so, I think we'll stick to making our own for the future.
