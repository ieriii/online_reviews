My, my, what a dinner! I was here with a group of six, and had to wait at the bar for about a half hour but that's not bad with no rezzies! When we got seated the waiter brought our drinks and a menu. From the time we sat down to the time our appetizers came out was literally 10 minutes, fantastic! My steak was cooked to perfection, exactly the way I ordered it, and our waiter was amazing. Attentive, not hounding; friendly, not intrusive; polite, not stand-offish or meek. The whole experience was definitely 5 star in every way!
