Simply a wonderful experience. There was a 15 minute wait when we arrived on a Sunday morning, but they have a great heated "tent" for you to wait in with some complimentary hot tea and water. It was crowded for sure, but it's an old diner, what do you expect? The food is definitely the star at the Chicago Diner. I had the vegan gyros with sweet potato fries and was absolutely floored at the enormous flavors on that plate. First off, the gyro "meat", made from seitan, was marinated perfectly with Greek flavors. It was extremely moist and there was a lot of it! The sweet potato fries were a great compliment. Perfectly cooked with no burn marks, with just a light buttery crunch on each one. Our server Miles was also a great addition to the experience. He was always smiling and had great suggestions. I am counting the days until I get to go back again!
