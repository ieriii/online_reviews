Delicious food (you haven't lived until you've tried their ropa vieja and empanadas), cool atmosphere (they even have an upstairs "lounge" they send you to wait in until your table is ready), but surprisingly unfriendly service, especially for being a Latin place. I came with a party of 10 and instead of walking around the table to get our orders, the server just stood at one end and made everyone yell our orders down the table to her. The place is loud to begin with, and trying to yell questions about the menu back and forth isn't too pleasant. It's also BYOB and there's a $3 "hospitality fee" for bringing in a 6 pack.
