Number 1: This is an experience, more than "going to get a bite." Number 2: If you don't appreciate creativity in your food and are uncomfortable outside the normal spectrum of flavors and colors and textures, this isn't for you. Number 3: We had a spectacular meal. We went here for my husband's birthday, wanting to do something interesting and as he is a fan of the show the chef is on (which I don't watch) I thought he might enjoy it. We had the 10 course tasting menu, which was definitely the way to go (I think we could have done the larger one, but I'd written in with my reservation that we had a theatre reservation 2.5 hours after the start of the meal and the waiter said that based on that, we really didn't have time for it - very thoughtful service). Everything was fun, some I was less fond of than others (it turns out I don't like sweetbreads), but they were all interesting.My husband and I both have special food needs and these were accommodated with ease and rather spectacularly. On a similar note, the service was exceptional. Everything we needed was attended to exactly as we needed it (not aggressively or uncomfortably fast but not left looking around desperately for someone to help) and the waiters almost moved about like a seamless symphony.I would say that the cocktails we ordered were rather spicy (yes, spicy) - I believe it said they were, but I thought that meant American spicy, as in, has a little bit of spice, so it was a translation issue on my part. Oh and we saw Graham Elliot, who was wandering through the restaurant saying hi to some friends and moving quickly back and forth to the kitchen. Oh final thought - I read some excellent reviews on here noting that the environment is not stuffy. This is absolutely true, and is true in the best possible way. Very comfortable, laid back, you can dress down or dress up. The music is a little loud (still - I understand they've reduce the volume) but not so bad that we couldn't talk.
