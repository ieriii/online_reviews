This was my first time in Chicago and this hotel helped make the visit a very pleasurable one. I was attending a conference held in the hotel....the place is huge! The location couldn't have been better. My window overlooked the Chicago River (more like a canal). It was a beautiful area...clean, full of nice restaurants and shopping. The architecture of the surrounding buildings was spectacular.My room was very comfortable. The bed was nice. I had a large flat-screen TV and a nice comfy chair and not-so-comfy couch. But hey, no real complaints here. My only real complaint was that the closet was a bit small and the doors make it difficult to get clothes in and out. (It's almost not worth mentioning!) The hotel staff were all very nice and helpful. I received top-notch service.I hope to stay at this hotel the next time I visit Chicago. (Hopefully not in connection with a conference, rather strictly for play!) If you're holding a conference here, please be aware that the food is less than desireable. But the meeting space is wonderful.I highly recommend this for families, business travelers, conventions or singles looking for a good time.
