I was here on a rainy Saturday night, which was unfortunate because everyone doddled longer than necessary, and the restaurant got into trouble when the 8 PM reservations showed up and no one was getting up. I feel like the restaurant could have done a better job managing this. Pastas were very well made, but the sauces left me wanting. I expected a blander sauce with flavorful pasta like ravioli. But we were getting olive oil and garlic on plain pastas.
