Great food with decent price! The downsides are the small space and too many crowds. We went there in a group of four and we waited for about 30 mins and still not get the regular table. We only get the long table so we cannot face each other. I think their tortas are great. Caldo is good as well but keep in mind, some of them are spicy!  The most important, don't go there on holidays or you don't mind waiting...
