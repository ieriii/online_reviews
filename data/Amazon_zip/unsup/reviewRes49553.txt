I came here for dinner with my husband on a Saturday night. As there were only two of us, we only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. The meal was phenomenal! There are so many unique flavors and menu options. It definitely isn't the typical steakhouse experience. I ordered the steak with pork belly, fried egg, rice, beans, sweet plantains and an avocado. My husband ordered a steak. Both were delicious. We had amazing mojitos to compliment the dish. The service was prompt and efficient. They also kept the water coming, which is very important to me! I highly recommend this spot for a different kind of steak dinner.
