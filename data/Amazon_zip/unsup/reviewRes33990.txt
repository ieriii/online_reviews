Mia Francesca is a Chicago institution. While I can pass on bread if it's not something special, the bread here is so yummy. It is always hot (sometimes too hot!), and their olive oil is delicious as well. Being the pizza girl, I usually order one of their pizzas for my meal. I have had a few pastas and the salmon, and those were all good. The desserts are also great here. The cheesecake is to die for, as is the chocolate lava cake.
