Simply amazing. Could not stop eating...and I am the world's pickest eater (think someone who eats off of the kids menu only.) Went here with 3 couples - great atmosphere and better service. Our waiter knew the menu like the back of his hand and gave excellent reco's. Everything we ordered was delicious. For sure try the Corn side dish - out of this world. If you like a good white wine, the Sav Blanc (Tamaya, limari Valley, Chile 2010) was out of this world. The table wine for $4 was a great buy as well.  White Russians downstairs are curio were amazing as well.
