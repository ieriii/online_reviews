I have been here numerous times now, and can say that the food is consistently good. I finally ventured to another Ethiopian restaurant, and I can say that I actually like Demera better. In comparison to Ethiopian Diamond, Demera allows you to choose what dishes you want to put on your sampler- I always get the vegetarian sampler here and have never been disappointed in the dishes I've ordered. At Ethiopian Diamond, the dishes on the vegetarian sampler are already selected, and there was one that I really didn't care for. I feel more confident in my positive review after several dining experiences here, especially for vegetarians, in saying Demera is my go-to Ethiopian place.
