This place retains its 5 star review. Why? It's awesome. Service is weird and the people who work there aren't attentive or very friendly.. but the food is delicious. The night before we moved to a new apartment, we packed up enough stuff that it was nearly impossible to cook... and we were hungry.  Plus, my husband needed black chickens for a dinner he's doing. That combination led us to Chinatown.. and Lao Sze Chuan was kind of a given for us. We still had stuff to do, so we ordered to go. We were given an estimated time for food pick up, so we strolled through the weird mall. We ran into a former coworker/friend of my husband, so they chatted about work for quite some time... long enough that we probably were about 15 minutes late picking up our food. Then we still had to drive home. By the time we ate, our food had probably been sitting 45 minutes.. but it was still delicious. We ordered our standby items-- orange beef tenderloin and dong po pork (elbow with fat). It took a while for the guy at the counter to understand we did, in fact, want the fatty elbow instead of whatever other dong po pork they offer, but we were served the correct items and they were super tasty. So tasty, in fact, we ate all of the protein in one sitting. I typically portion out my orange beef into a few meals.. but the glutton in me showed itself.
