I just had dinner with my friends here a couple hours ago and all I have to say is this place was absolutely delicious! Definitely get the White Dragon Roll....Amazing!!!! Everything was fresh and service was so quick! The staff was friendly too! Our server helped us make awesome decisions! I'll definitely be a regular from now on ;)!
