Parking was readily available on the street, across from this great corner, Cuban cafe. It was my opinion, and that of my brunch guest to start with the traditional Cuban Sandwhich, or, the "Media Noche," which it was not labeled as such on the menu. Based on the "media-noche" sandwhich, which was served on French-bread, and not the regular egg-bread that "media-noches" are served on, I can say that this restaurant provides a lighter version of traditional Cuban food. Media noches are typically consumed as a "midnight" (hench medianoche) meal. The sandwhiches are typically buttery and brimming with pork juice. The medianoches at Cafe 28 were still excellent, though a bit drier than I would have expected. Paired with a cafecito, or "cuban-style" coffee - a doppio of espresso doused in sugar, this sandwhich alone will keep me coming back to Cafe 28. My brunch partner also had the traditional cuban sandwhich and also thoroughly enjoyed it!
