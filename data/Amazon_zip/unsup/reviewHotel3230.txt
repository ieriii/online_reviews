Let's start with the bad. Obviously there is nowhere to park in Chicago, so the fact that the Hard Rock offers valet parking (for $46 a day) sounded like a great idea. WRONG. I got my car back and there is a HUGE scratch on the side, not to mention TONS of pine sap all over my windshield and the front of my car (that took FOREVER to get off). They for sure do not take good care of your car at all. Next, the food is terrible! I ordered a Cobb salad-how can you screw this up? They did. Also, the chicken bites were full of fat. So gross. The good? GREAT location-minutes away from shopping. Also, had a really nice experience with the concierge, Zach. He helped us with restaurants, a route to run in the morning, and getting cab. Also, the elevators were very fast which was awesome. We got a corner room which was very spacious but so poorly lit! There is an entire hallway in the room with no light. All in all not a terrible hotel; this trip was my second time staying at the Hard Rock Hotel but probably will not be staying here again-the huge scratch on my car was definitely not appreciated.
