Visited 8/2009 YUM! We visited hubby's hometown to see fam and had to take a trip into the city to eat here b/c well yeah Guy Fieri said so! LOL...He was right! All the food on this menu is awesomely tasty! The fresh fish goes on for miles. BYOB in the dinner not the patio. I would definitely make a reservation though! We waited 2hr 30min for a patio table...for 5 people.
