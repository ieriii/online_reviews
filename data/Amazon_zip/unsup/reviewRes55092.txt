Five stars all the way! Everything is well executed, from the simple food to the clever cocktails. Service also shines, and prices are very reasonable for the high quality ingredients. Overall, a great dining experience.This is the food I want to eat. Perfect roast chicken, bone marrow, purist pasta, delicious vegetables (e.g., blackened cauliflower, kale with white beans).Hurry over to River North! Gilt is a revelation.
