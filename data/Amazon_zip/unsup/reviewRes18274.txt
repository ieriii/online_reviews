As a big time beer lover who's just been told she can't drink alcohol for the next 6 months, it was probably not the best idea to go to a place with a rockin' local brew list. But go I did, and envious I sat as my friends enjoyed some of the many delectable libations Bad Apple offers (note to self: non-alcoholic options are never sufficient substitutes for aforementioned delectable libations. Chock it up to wishful thinking, and move on). Luckily, I was able to enjoy Bad Apple's uniquely concocted burgers and fries, and some of the BEST cheese curds I have ever allowed past my lips. Those curds were the highlight of my visit here. I think I might have enjoyed my Edmund Fig-Gerald burger a bit more, had there actually been noticeable fig on it. The truffle oil fries rocked my socks off though. My friend's bf ordered the Black and Blue and a small taste test proved it was bleu cheesey, saucy goodness. I was definitely a fan. The prices are uber reasonable, the service was decent (though my water glass sat empty more often than not), and the place is small but very chill. Not a bad jaunt from the Brown Line, and there was no wait for a table. For the most part, good times all around.
