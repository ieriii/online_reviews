Pequod's kicked off the first round of the "Pizza Challenge" at my place of work, and the general consensus was that this restaurant should either come in dead last or should not even qualify for competition. The Deep Dish pizza was about 90% bread, which might have been acceptable if they hadn't forgotten to include flavor. The thin layer of cheese and sauce weren't much of an improvement, and the "caramelized" (see also: burnt) cheese at the edge of the crust only served as the final nail in the coffin. Really, this was about a half step above Pizza Hut. If eating a burnt loaf of stale bread with a little sauce and cheese thrown on top is your thing, then please knock yourself out at Pequod's. I will pass, as will most of my coworkers. For what it's worth, this was delivery. I can't speak about the dining experience at the restaurant itself.
