My husband and I was looking for a good brunch spot and saw the awesome reviews on this local spot. It did not disappoint. I got the french toast special with vanilla bean sauce and topped with strawberries and chocolate crumbles. Omg, it was soooo good! The house potatoes were awesome too! There was an hour wait but it was totally worth it. Definitely recommend this place!
