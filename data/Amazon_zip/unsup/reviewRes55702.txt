I would not give out a 5 star review if this place didn't deserve it. I have had most of the menu, almost everything was simply perfect. By far, the best crab legs I have ever had, and at a fraction of fine dinning prices. For the reviewers that think that Glenn's is pricy, go to Denny's if you want breakfast for 5 bucks. I would suggest you go at least once for brunch, once for lunch , and a few times for dinner, all the fish is amazing, the scallops with that mushroom sherry cream sauce is like sex. Share a few apps, I recomend the shrimp cargo: shrimp in a dish of garlic butter w cheese melted over the top, and the mussels. The soups are very good as well.
