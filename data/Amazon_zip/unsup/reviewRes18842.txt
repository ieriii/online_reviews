The food in the Gage is a hit-or-miss. For this summer, the sesame beet in the lunch menu and the beet and cheese salad in the dinner menu are executed quite well. The former is quite refreshing, since the sesame salad balances out the creaminess of the beet and cheese tartar. The latter is the most beautiful beet salad I have ever seen. It is almost like a piece of artwork, but it is slightly too sweet. In terms of the winter menu, I enjoyed eating the hazelnut carrots, which were crunchy and sweet. The Gage is the only place I know thus far that provides hazelnut carrots in Chicago, besides Henri, which is its sister restaurant. However, most of the food in the Gage is too salty. According to my friends, the steak is over-marinated and the soup has been added too much salt. While I like the Brussels sprouts, I sometimes find it over-cooked. As a bar and a restaurant, the Gage is also extremely loud. Although it is a not a place for a date or a dinner with a close friend, it is a great place to have drinks with colleagues.
