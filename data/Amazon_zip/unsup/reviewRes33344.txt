I don't get the hype. It's not all that. I've eaten here several times and never understand the lines and wait times. Is it the location? HAS to be! How can you screw up an egg? It's impossible. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy my breakfast there but it's just not that memorable. I say try it but don't expect something sooooooo great.
