Okay, so maybe the decor isn't much to look at. Maybe it has seen its fair amount of plaid shirts (although I have never personally been particularly overwhelmed by an abundance of hipsters at Piece). And maybe the pizza isn't the best in the entire world. But it is pretty damn good. I like that it's thin crust in a deep dish town. Their red sauce is good, not too sweet, not too spicy. The toppings are pretty right on no matter what we've ordered (though we do tend to stick to traditional sausage, pepperoni, meatball, mushrooms, onions, peppers combinations). And my experience with their mashed potato pizza wasn't exactly revelatory. But, overall, Piece provides a pretty decent pizza. Also worth a try are the goat cheese appetizer and the salad with pears, pecans and gorgonzola. Piece Beer, however, is OUTSTANDING! If I was judging their pizza and pizza alone, Piece would get 3, MAYBE 3.5 stars depending upon the visit. But their beer brings it to a whole different level (if I could rate Piece with a 4.5, I would). They have something to please every palate. My husband loves their paler offerings while I really dig their stouts and darker brews. Roland the Headless Brewer's Assistant is out of this world (excuse me if I just completely butchered the name of this beer). Festivus (definitely its name and I LOVE it), which is available during the holiday season, is so incredibly tasty! We live in Cincinnati but visit Piece, growlers in hands, EVERY time we're in town. Three growlers of their brews are the ultimate souvenirs to share with friends after a visit to Chicago.
