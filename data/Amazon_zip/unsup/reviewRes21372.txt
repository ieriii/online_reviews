When this place first opened I would of gave it a 4, but now you can order take out, so I give it a 5 (used to have long lines, now not as bad). Sandwiches are very good and the hazelnut cookie is good too.  Soft serve and chips and Guacamole are good too. I go there about once a week. This place and Grahamwich have the best sandwiches in the city- Cafe Cito has good ones too
