By the time my kobe-hash hit the table, I had filled up on the free house-made pickles and bbq potato chips that our waiter kept maliciously refilling. The hash was delicious, and the 2 giant flakey biscuits that came along with it were amazing. My greatest regret in life is not being man enough to finish both of them. The bloody mary's were delish as well and came with a skewer of cured meat, cheese, and olives. I want that long lost biscuit :(
