Since most Vietnamese businesses on Argyle are closed on Tuesdays, the fact that Pho Tank is one of the only restaurants open gives them a bit of a monopoly. Because of this, they have no incentive to provide customers with basic service like offering water, tea or just general courtesy. I did like that their employees wore army/camouflage shirts. Goes very well with the "tank" theme. Supposedly, this is one of the better pho places in Chicago but I found it to be mediocre at best. The broth was bland and couldn't be fixed with hoisin sauce, siracha or lemon. It was missing a certain pho-ness to it. The prices are comparable to CA pho but definitely not in taste. They also have rice plates, noodle dishes and Vietnamese sandwiches so you can try your luck with those. One thing that stood out to me was the portion. The small here is like a large at other restaurants. Must be keeping with the "tank" theme. The veggies that comes with pho were surprisingly fresh too.
