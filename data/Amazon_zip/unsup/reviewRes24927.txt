Usually, at a "small plates" kind of place, I spend a lot of money for food that rarely impresses me. At Mercat, the $58 chef's tasting menu consists of various plates off the regular menu, and there wasn't a dish I didn't like! It is served family style, and they are conscious of how many people will be sharing these dishes, so that everyone gets 1-2 of each dish. Yes, it was expensive, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, and I didn't leave hungry. Our menu: Cheese plate paired w/apple marmalade and sliced raw apples Tomato & garlic bruschetta Spinach salad w/serrano ham & sherry vinaigrette (dressed just enough) Shellfish croquettes (IMO, was fried for too long because the crust overpowered the filling) Garlic shrimp Prawns Spicy potatoes w/paprika aioli (I thought these were a little dry) Porcini & sausage flatbread Rabbit dumplings w/candied cherries (a favorite for some of my friends) Warm spinach w/raisins & pine nuts (nice light accompaniment to the meats) Rack of lamb (my favorite - very tender and very little game taste) Ribeye The sauce pairings for both red meats were perfect. However, I thought the shrimp & prawns were overly salted and not very innovative. We also tried 2 desserts: the chocolate croquette with banana marshmallow and the "Crema Catalana" (figs with orange whipped cream (?) and a golf ball sized scoop of berry sorbet). The latter was the most disappointing (a dining companion said it was like eating "air"), and the former was just ok. Desserts don't seem to be their strong point. Mercat is suitable for medium-sized groups and intimate parties. The smaller tables/booths are along the perimeter of the sunken main dining floor, and the larger tables are in the center. There is a bar in the corner with high tables, which is appropriate for people gazing.
