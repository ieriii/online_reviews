Really fabulous food and ok (not great) service. Could use a better system of taking names on a busy night when a lot of people are waiting for tables-- Boss man was very crabby asking us first to 'leave' as we followed their sign which indicated we should go inside to give our name .....he didn't want us to go inside but rather to wait outside (on a warm night) for someone to come out to take our name... But we'll go back -- food was one of best Chinese in Chicago that I've found
