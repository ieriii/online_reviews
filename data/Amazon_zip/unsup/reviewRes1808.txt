Ummm. Besides watching cooking/traveling shows on tv, this is pretty much where I've gotten my culinary education. Seriously, where else can you get creme fresh or truffles on a sausage? Doug works the register, which totally rules. Unfortunately, some people think they are beyond his genius, and try to change his specialty dogs and ask lots of ridiculous questions once they finally get to the front of the line... hence the 30-minute wait. Visiting this restaurant in January is not for the faint of heart, but that doesn't stop me from going there every Saturday. Make sure to check the website before you go, though... Doug likes his vacations and takes them at random.
