My fiance had a gift card to a lettuce entertain you restaurant, so we decided to try RJ Grunts because of its laid back atmosphere. We really enjoyed it. I tried the salad bar and I'm so glad I did. The soup they had that day was Cheddar Beer soup and it was sooo cheesy and yummy. I went up for 2nds and 3rds ( I was also letting my fiance eat it too, oops!) The waitress was so nice and knew it was our first time there so she gave us a complimentary cookie and ice cream dessert. It was SO delicious. It is a warm gooey chocolate chip cookie that is warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with hot fudge. I am salivating as I write this. Needless to say, we've been back and we always splurge and get the cookie!!
