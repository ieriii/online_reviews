Ordered two pizzas, and used the buy one get one 50% offer. I love mushrooms, so the number seven pizza was perfect for me, it is VERY mushroomy and not sickeningly cheesy. The other pizza we ordered was the chicken Brasil, which was also really nice, there was a fair amount of chicken and sauce. The pizzas are not extremely cheap, but because they are really good, and they seem to use high quality ingredients, I would definitely order from them again. We picked up the pizzas so I can't comment on the delivery, but our pizzas were ready quickly and were soooo delicious. I'm looking forward to going there again.
