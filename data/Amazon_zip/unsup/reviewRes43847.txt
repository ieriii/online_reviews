I've gotta say - this is one of the best "healthy" breakfast places I've been to in a long time. Went w/ my girlfriend today and everything was great. We were both super hungry and ordered the yogurt / granola, oatmeal, chicken sausage and (this is the best part) a children's sized order of the pancakes dujour - oh and of course coffee (I do like the help yourself refills and water on tap w/ lemons...) Placing your order at the counter was a bit strange and different, but really worked out and I can see why they do it. The people taking orders were neither super friendly or mean at all - just very efficient at getting people in and out and were nice to us. I can see how it would be crazy there on the weekends though... Can't wait to go back!
