This breaks my heart. After VegNews named this place the best diner of 09, I was beside myself to try it. I made the long trip out from Bridgeport and squealed all the way down Halsted to the front door. It was crowded, but it was Sunday morning in a diner, what do you want? We sat and were given coffee in paper cups, since the mugs were all taken. Not a huge deal, but my guest wasn't amused. After perusing the menu very seriously, we decided - he'd have the sausage and biscuits with gravy, I'd have a pancake with scrambly tofu, taters, and seitan sausage. You're right - it DOES sound amazing. My potatoes were too large and underseasoned, the seitan sausage was dry and hard (my guest's was tender, maybe because it was covered in gravy?), and my scrambly tofu was one-note. I was really upset by this. I have mad respect for a place that feeds the masses without one fallen animal, but I was heartbroken with the quality of my grub.  I don't know if it was because it was a busy Sunday, or because I built it up too much, but I was just not impressed. Did I choose badly? Did the good cook have the day off? I don't know. I hope there was a good reason. Because I want the Chicago Diner to rule my seitan-eating ass, and when I come back to Chicago, I will trek back up to Lincoln Park from wherever I am and I will eat there again. I need to believe that this place can be everything I need it to be. Don't let me down, Chicago Diner! See you soon.
