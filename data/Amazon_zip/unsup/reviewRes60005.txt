I was born and raised in the South so entres such as: "Shrimp and grits" or "Biscuits and gravy " sets my heart a flutter. Needless to say, I am a poor unemployed graduate student and the prices have kept me from venturing over. Having a dinner date last night with some girlfriends gave me the perfect excuse to spend some money that I don't have. First and foremost, the ambiance is A+. Posh indeed. When you first arrive you are blocked off from the diners by a heavy velvet curtain. Only until the hostess has confirmed your reservation are you allowed past the veil. Secondly, the service....A+. Very hospitable and knowledgeable. Answered all of our questions about drinks, entres and deserts. The food....here is where I seem to differ from the loyal following of Yelpers who have reviewed Big Jones. I admit that as someone with no money who is hesitant to part with it, my opinion on what makes a good eatery is a bit skewed (Cheap, big portions and consistent quality) from other populations. The prices were just a little bit too overpriced I felt for the quality and size of portions. I ordered the Pork Shoulder (one of the cheaper items on the menu at under $20.00) and while the pork was DELICIOUS, there was not enough ( I would have priced this entree for no more than $10.00, anything more than that would be pushing it). Same with the desserts. Yummy but small. My girlfriends all had ONE alcoholic beverage ($10-12 a pop) and their bills were around $60.00. So, yes the ambiance, the service and the food is good...I still don't find that the small portions makes it worth the price. Maybe, in a couple years when I hopefully have some extra money, I will think differently. Maybe for a special occasion (or someone else is paying) but until then, I wont be returning.
