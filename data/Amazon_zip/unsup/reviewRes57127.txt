Delicious. Colorful, warm atmosphere. Attentive, knowledgeable service. Been to a fair number of upscale, trendy places for dinner, but most of them are loud, pretentious, and nothing special; I don't usually think I would spend the money to go again. Carnivale, on the other hand, is worth every penny. I want to go back!
