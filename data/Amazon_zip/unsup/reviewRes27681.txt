OMG Mr. Latinlover Bartender, Hola! Remember me I had the naked barbie on the bar taking photos of my cocktails.. (yes, cocktails, plural, that's how I roll) I want to thank you for serving me up some fantastic cocktails and making happy hour fun for all. I ordered the tequilla version of the bloody mary and a Topelo margarita. I like them both equally. The bartenders were fun, attentive and did I mention cute too? A great way to start the evening. Quick tip from the guy in 3A on de plane from Charlotte to Chicago... go early, they open around 5p. (Fact: really it's 520p). Sit at the bar and have a few drinks and appetizers. How did he know I would love Frontera? Maybe there is something about me that suggests I might enjoy happy hour. It could have been the wine we were drinking at 10a. Gee thanks 3A, what a fountain of information.
