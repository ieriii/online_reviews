Sprout is the perfect restaurant. Contemporary interior, intimate seating and incredibly professional staff. I really liked that it wasn't as intense as the other famous chef places around town. From the sommelier to E.C., Dale, they made you feel comfortable about everything they had to offer. It is clear to see Dale genuinely cares about the experience, food and guests. He was glad to talk to us about the menu and what insprired his dishes. Everything on the menu our table had was perfect. The prixe-fixe is the only way to go to when dining at Sprout.
