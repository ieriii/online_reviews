Food has been anywhere from good to very good, and our waiter seemed to know a lot about Willamette Valley Pinot noir, our favorite. The decor is comfortable and clean, dark (comfortably so). To start we were advised against the oysters, but the mussels in vindaloo sauce is great, and the haddock cake is totally good! (unexpected by me). caveat: Walk quickly from the entrance to the back room if possible, to avoid being surrounded by the loudmouthing and clumsy macking of Michigan Avenue suits.
