I just had the worst experience here. I've been here quite a few times over the last few years, and I was not expecting anything like what just happened. We got there, and the place was semi-busy. We ordered one burrito to split between the two of us. Thirty minutes later, no burrito came. Neither my friend or I complained the whole time. Then we ordered a taco to go because we figured that that would take a while. The taco ended up coming 20 minutes later. Still no burrito. When I asked the waitress where our burrito was, she said, "What burrito?" We decided just to leave. I told the cashier that the service was terrible. No apology. We eyed the waitress. She was too busy looking for our order to apologize to us either.  The food has been good previously, but the service was just completely horrible tonight. We left hungrier than when we came. I've been to this place a lot, but I won't be coming here again.
