Love, love, love Violet Hour! The cocktails are phenomenal. I don't think I've ever had anything there that I haven't liked. Whenever I go, I always sit at the bar. This allows you talk to the bartender and learn more about how the drinks are made. These cocktails are like works of art, so it's incredibly interesting to watch how they're made. I never order off the menu. Instead, I talk to the bartender and let him know what types of spirits I enjoy, and he'll make something special that's out of this world. It's a must try for cocktail enthusiasts!
