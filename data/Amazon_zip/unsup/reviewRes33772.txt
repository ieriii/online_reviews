This is a good, casual brunch/bfast spot. We luckily arrived just before the rush and didn't have to wait at all! Score! I was really hungry.  I was not impressed by anything on the menu. Fine, maybe the banana crepes caught my attention, maybe.... I still decided to order my usual Belgian strawberry waffle with whipped cream. When I got my waffle there was no whipped cream, WHAT! and my waffle was cold. The menu clearly states this waffle will have delicious whipped cream. I had to ask for the cream on the side. BIG minus for that one, Yolk. I ordered green tea which was the greatest green tea ever. Papaya... yes I think so! Yum!  My friend ordered a savory crepe, the size of a real live baby! The Zamboni crepe had scrambled eggs, ham, and spinach topped with hollandaise sauce. It was good, too bad I was craving something sweeter. He even got undercooked diced potatoes on the side. Meh.  The menu was similar to other breakfast places I have visited. Nothing special. I won't go out of my way to eat here again.
