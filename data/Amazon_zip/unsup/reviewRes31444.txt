The food at Nana was delicious. I had dinner there 3 weeks ago with 2 vegetarians, and they couldn't stop raving about the different types of vegetables in their food. I was happy for them. I, on the other hand, had the wood-smoked pork shoulder and it was incredible. The mac-and-cheese was also amazing, as were the biscuits. However, dieters beware. Organic does not mean low-calorie. This is a full-fat establishment which I am happy to support on occasion. Just can't come here too often :)
