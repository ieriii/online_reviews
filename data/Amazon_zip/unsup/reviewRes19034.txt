The first time I came here I wasn't expecting anything super crazy just because it didn't look any special to me. BUT after the first bite of a mushroom torta I was in love! Let's be clear: they are sandwiches. They are, actually, expensive sandwiches (+10). But really good ones! However, i wouldn't wait the loooong line that is usually in the door. When that happens, i cross to La Havana, a good cuban-latin style restaurant right in the other side of the street. Not as hype as Xoco, but the food is good and it is not expensive.
