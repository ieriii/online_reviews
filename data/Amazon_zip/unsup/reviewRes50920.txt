The husband and I just had Sunday brunch here with another couple. While the hostess & owner were really friendly, the table service was not quite up to par. Don't get me wrong - the food was absolutely delicious, but when 3 people order bloody marys, only two show up, and you have to ask 4 times for the 3rd one, which doesn't arrive until you are done with your meal - that's just not cool. (They tried to deliver the 3rd bloody mary twice, by the way. Bad communication). The complimentary beignets were fresh and warm. The two bloody marys we did receive were decent. I had the Eggs New Orleans and it was excellent - perfect proportion of all the ingredients. My husband had the Migas and enjoyed it as well. Our friends ordered the Shrimp & Grits and the Cheddar Corn Cakes. Luckily, the food was so good that it made up for the missing drink order. If Big Jones can get their kitchen/bar/server communication and delivery improved, this spot would be one of the best and worth making the trip to Andersonville.
