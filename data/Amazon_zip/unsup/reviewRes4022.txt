It was an interesting and fun dining experience at Schwa. I enjoyed all the dishes and loved hearing the inspiration behind each one. As other reviewers have stated, I had the same problem with the noise level. The music was just too loud and it was even worse as we sat at the back corner, right below the speaker. If I could, I'd give this place 3.5 stars between "A-OK" and "Yay! I'm a fan". I probably won't return, but I'm glad that I got the chance to try Schwa.
