Mmm, delicious meats. Just say it with me: "MEATS. MEATS. MEATS." Mmmm, meats. If you visit Texas de Brazil (pronounced "Tay- ha" for those in the know, or those who want to sound snobbish), I guarantee the following things will happen to you: - They will try to upsell you on bottled water vs. tap - They will try to offer you a capirinha. DON'T buy it- its $20 dollars! - You will realize quickly that the "salad" bar is really more about cheese and seafood than actual salad - If you bring a vegetarian, they will be disappointed in the "salad bar" for the reason above - You will be assaulted by gauchos one minute and ignored the next (despite what your red/green card says) - You will eat the bread on the table and wish you didn't, because it expands in your stomach and takes away room for meats - You will eat delicous meats - You will eat more delicious meats - You will say "I'm done," but the minute your favorite meat comes around again, you will have "1 more" - See the point above and repeat 2 or 3 times - You will finally quit at the point where you feel as if your death is imminent - You will be offered postcards for the email list- fill them out! BOGO meat coupons FTW! - You will go home and pass out into a food coma
