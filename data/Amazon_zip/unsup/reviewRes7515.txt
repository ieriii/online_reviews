=( Sadness. I was so looking forward to Sapori tonite! Just me and a girlfriend, reservations set and ready. It was another one of them popular nights so I'd think they'd be more ready but first, service though friendly, was slow and our food took a looooong time to arrive. It wasn't even piping hot and felt like it had been sitting around waiting for awhile before it was served to us. Thus, the jumbo shrimp was tough and the noodles quickly thickened with the olive oil drenched plate. The white fish fillet with cherry tomatoes and grilled veggies were also only so so. I hope this was just a fluke because I'd to say good bye to one of my mainstays!
