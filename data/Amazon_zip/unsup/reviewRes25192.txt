A great venue! The menu is extensive offering a variety of options, which makes it challenging to choose, but also a spot you can frequent anytime of the day. Ambience is casual yet chic. The pizzas are massive so be prepared to share or make a second meal of it. All the food everyone ordered was delicious, from the Greek salad to the Capricciozo sandwich to the Chicken Riganati to the Orzo pasta and of course the Greek wine and coffee!
