My meat loving husband and his family LOVE this place. They go all the time and have even had parties catered by this restaurant. I really really want to give the restaurant 5 stars. But I can't. My vegetable fried rice arrived with egg in it despite a clear "no egg please" request. I could smell the beef stock in my Mapo Tofu. I stayed hungry despite being terribly hungover and starving. Needless to say, my husband and his family thoroughly enjoyed their lunch. I know it's a lot to expect a good "vegetarian" meal from a Chinese restaurant. But if Melbourne can do it, so can Chicago.
