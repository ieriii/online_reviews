Oh Hot Doug! I am so sorry that it has taken me so long to return to the encased meat Haven. I do apologize. However, like an old friend, I dropped in and its just like old times. With exception of a few name name changes. I appreciate you keeping up with the pop culture times.  It was my chef friends bday and he had never partaken in the culinary wiener expertise that you exude! As usual, I always go for the specials. Gotta getum while they're there. On deck today, duck fat fries, Foie Grais dog, Sausage dog w blue cheese and almonds, and a veal/pork number that was like a super fresh yummy braut. You did me right! My friend was impressed as well. The Blue Cheese number was the best of the day. I would have voted the Foie, but the cool foie against my warm weiner...not a homerun. If the Foie was seared that it would be something from the Encased Meat Gods. Keep up the good work.
