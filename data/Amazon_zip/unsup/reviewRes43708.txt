Man...this was the disappointment of the month! Picture this...you're sick, you have a killer earache and you've had about two hours of sleep....you're on your 12th hour at work and you decide to treat yourself to a nice dinner via delivery. You can imagine my immense sad face when upon sampling of said dinner (which at $35 on a Tuesday is a bit of a splurge) I was greeted with a complete and utter lack of flavor. Now I know I ordered from a "chop house" but I wasn't feeling the red meat and I went with a stuffed baked potato and angel hair pasta, tossed with olive oil, fresh basil, tomatoes and mushrooms. The pasta was the blandest thing I'd ever tasted, the tomatoes were bitter and there were maybe three slivers of basil...all the olive oil was at the bottom and there was a lot. The mushrooms were greasy and tasteless, salt and pepper couldn't save this trainwreck of a dish. So move onto the stuffed baked potato, because you can't mess that up, right? Wrong. I like to consider myself a potato connoisseur...baked, fried, mashed, I don't discriminate, I love them all. But this was just a gross, mooshy pile of mashed potato, dumped into a hard, cold potato skin (with a couple of nasty spots) and covered with what looked like slices of american cheese...greasy, partially melted american cheese. Uhg. Just uhg.
