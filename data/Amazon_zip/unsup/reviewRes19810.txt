Coast is easily one of my favorite sushi destinations in all of Chicago. The ambiance is sheik and modern, and the sushi is top notch. If you like deep-fried sushi, this is the place for you. The White Dragon and Coast Crab Roll have never disappointed me or my dates. Wasabi lovers shouldn't think twice about getting the Wasabi Shumai for an appetizer. Dislikes: Service can be a bit flighty at times due to high volume, but you'll forget about that once the food hits the table. I strongly recommend making a reservation if you can as this place is usually packed to the brim Thursday through Saturday. I know that they keep 50% of their tables open to walk-ins, so as long as you are patient, you'll eventually get a table. Enjoy!
