Just returned from first trip here. We had brunch outside. Waiter - awesome. There were 3 of us and we tried: duck hash, chicken/waffles, and biscuits/gravy.  All 3 meals fantastic. We will go back soon! Great drink menu and great vibe from the staff. Parking difficult (if you don't want to pay) so next time we will take the blue line.
