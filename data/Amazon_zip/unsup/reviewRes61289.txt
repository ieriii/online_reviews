Wow! What a great dinner I had tonight! The food was delicious but the service was exceptional. I can't remember the last time I had such attentive service. My friends and I arrived early in the evening. Even as the room began filling up, the staff never left you wanting or needing anything. I highly recommend Brazzaz. I will definitely be returning. Although no time too soon, as i will be full for days!! Thank you David and staff!
