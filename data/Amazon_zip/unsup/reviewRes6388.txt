I have dined at Davanti a few times now and after last night finally have to give it the yelp it deserves.  We arrived around 8pm and the restaurant was busy but not crowded. We were seated right away after the host and hostess so kindly closed some of the beautiful windows that look onto the sidewalk just for me because I was a little chilly after being unprepared for the drop in temperature.  After being seated we were greeted right away by our server who asked what we had a taste for and gave a few of his favorites.  We had the ricotta and honeycomb toast, which quite honestly I could eat a bucket of. The Rigatoni with sausage, a delicious warm salad of hazelnuts, Arugula and peppercorn and a mushroom pizza to finish.  The food came out at perfect intervals, multiple people not just our servers checked on us and refilled our beverages. I always leave Davanti with a full stomach, feeling like a VIP.
