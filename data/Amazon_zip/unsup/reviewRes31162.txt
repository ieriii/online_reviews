Hello! This place is awesome!  Yeah, sure sometimes you have to wait standing over someone else while they're trying to eat. And yes, it's true I never spend more money eating out anywhere than here...but you have to get dessert! The shakes are amazing.  I say this: stick to sandwiches and you're always safe.  Having not eaten meat for eleven years sometimes makes it difficult to chomp into the giant meaty Dagwood, but you get over it and then you absolutely love it. Chicago Diner, I plan to love you for a long long time.
