My boyfriend and I went to XOCO for a weekday breakfast-- had just enough time in line to decide what to eat, and (just barely) found a place to sit right away. I had the torreja (french toast) and my boyfriend had the chilaquiles. We also tried the Aztec hot chocolate and the traditional (with dulce de leche). I was impressed by the food and the chocolate-- it was an excellent value and was a unique breakfast experience. Although the layout and decor of the restuarant wasn't the most inviting at first, I warmed up to it (with the help of that amazing hot chocolate) and we had a memorable meal.
