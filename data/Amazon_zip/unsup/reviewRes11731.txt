i had been talked into eating this pizza. the first time, i was at the map room and we were hungry & my friend, who likes the pizza, suggested that we get one, it's close, and prices are in line with other pizzerias. i'm not a huge fan of pizza in general, and like the atmosphere of the neighbor cheap pizza joint, santullos (i'm more of a santullos kind of girl)-and the place just looked like a haven for yuppies. they have choices of red or white sauce, lots of ingredient choices. when our delivered pizza arrived, i was suprisingly delighted. nice crisp crust, good sauce, good toppings. so we usually get a pie when we are at the map room.  one day my husband and i decided to eat inside. i was not aware it was also a brewery, which is a definite plus in my book. however, it seemed to be at least 50% children. with strollers, kids running everywhere, i was wondering where the playground was. so other than that (i am not a fan of going to restauraunts, especially brewery types, and the place overflowing with toddlers) i think this place turns out a very good pie. but i will continue with delivery and leave the playground to the kids.
