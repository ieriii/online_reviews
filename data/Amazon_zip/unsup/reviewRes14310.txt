Just visited this spot last night...WOW. Love it! My friend and I both ordered the Guarijito which is basically a steak sandwich that uses green plantains (instead of bread) and has grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, Swiss cheese, and chimichurri. DELISH! A few other reviewers complained that the guarijito was a bit greasy, and it was, but not overly so--and it certainly didn't ruin my admiration for the sandwich. If you've never been, you should definitely give it a go. The restaurant has a nice selection of sandwiches and sides. I found everything to be well-seasoned without being salty. I also ordered the congri (seasoned rice and black beans), but thought that it was just OK. However, that's small potatoes really. The sandwich more than made up for it! Also, the employees are so friendly and helpful. I think the owners may have been there as well. Very nice people. As far as the restaurant itself goes, it is tiny but fitting. I'm sure by now you've read enough reviews about the ambiance. So, go for the food. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And, apparently they're now open on Sundays (there's a banner outside of the restaurant that says so). Happy eating!
