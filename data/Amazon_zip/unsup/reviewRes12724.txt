When I caught wind that Texas de Brazil was putting on a 1/2 off dinner promo for November (Can I get a HELLZ YA?), I was there faster than the speed of sound... better yet, faster than Rod Blagojevich or the County Board pisses my hard earned tax money away. Since my experience at the Woodfield one wasn't the best, I thought maybe downtown would yield a better result. Although this place shares many similarities in decor as the Texas at Woodfield, the decor is pretty much the only thing they had in common. The service here was fast and extremely attentive - actually blows away previous Fogo and Sal Carvao trips. I had access to 70+ items at the salad bar area alone, not to mention a sushi chef that pumps out a steady stream of delish rolled goodies. So you want to get the the real stars of the show? (as if a neverending supply of shrimp, sushi, lobster bisque, and salad could keep you satisfied) The meats here were leagues above the Woodfield one. Everything was cooked and seasoned *perfectly* - I could only carve out and eat the middle of everything I had at the other joint. To round things out, I got to taste their super refreshing sangria - total value at about 30 bux a pitcher. Let me tell ya, that's one big effin' pitcher. Being able to pour off about 9-10 full glasses of this refreshing ambrosia satisfied even the biggest lushes at my table. So take a trip out to the downtown Texas de Brazil and get meat-drunk and just plain drunk! I did, and I LOVED it!
