My husband and I ate here last night and ordered off the restaurant week menu. He had the grilled boar fagoli, the roasted pork and rosemary potatoes, and the hazelnut molten cake with gelato. I ordered the spinach salad with gorgonzola, the house ravioli, and the panna cotta. For me, the high point was the dessert. Mostly I find myself overwhelmed with the meal and the dessert is just meh. This time, the panna cotta rocked my world. Don't get me wrong, everything was fine, and I'd even say that the roast pork and the boar fagoli were delicate, well seasoned and delicious, but my selections were just average. The place and atmosphere were awkward. The service is hit or miss, the music is all wrong, and there's just a vibe that they're trying too hard.
