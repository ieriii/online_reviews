The food was good although a bit pricey for what you got. The waiters need more training which is understandable for a new restaurant. Our waiter couldn't comment on the various salami choices (he said he hadn't tried many of them). He brought us the salt/pepper/chili dispenser with no spoon so we would have to use our fingers if we wanted to use them-not too sanitary. The iced tea comes in a bottle and is flavored but the waiter didn't tell me that until he had already opened it and brought it to the table - I would have ordered something else had I known. Very nice interior - they did a nice job re-doing it.
