I would like to use this review to thank everyone at Alinea for such an incredible experience. From previous reviews, I was expecting pretentiousness and narcissism. What I found was a staff of professionals, who take pride in what they do. To call it a meal would be to disregard everything else that came with the endeavor. It was food, art, ambiance, entertainment, and best of all surprises. I was delighted in the way Alinea can present the unexpected. The kitchen can best be described as an operating room. Absolutely clean, calm, harmonious. Everyone working in unison. Take the time to experience Alinea for yourself. It's worth the time and money.
