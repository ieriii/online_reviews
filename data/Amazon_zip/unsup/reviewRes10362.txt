Piece doesn't need my review, but here we go anyway. I went on a Wednesday night at 6:30 and there was not a wait. When I left at 7:45 there was definitely was a line. The food is great. I had chips and salsa and a HUGE pep/ sausage red pizza. Both were amazing and I left full. The server was great and did not rush us to make a decision on beer or food. The only reason its not 5 star is because it was really loud on Wednesday, I cant imagine how loud it gets on Saturday night. Also parking is a nightmare but its Wicker Park so its to be expected.
