Mostly love this place, and Bridgeport needed it! I've probably been 8-10 times in a few months, and have eaten breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. Some of my favorite things are that it's BYOB and has fun art and beautiful exposed brick walls. It has an interesting atmosphere the combines urban loftiness with a country kitchen. Great comfort food. Really like the staff, except lately, this lady kept calling us "children" and "young man" and it was so annoying. Once or twice, MAYBE it's a term of endearment, but after a while it was jarring and felt condescending. I'm probably being ridiculous, but it really took away from the experience. Favorite dishes: the chicken cobb salad, dessert (get the variety!), french toast. Less good: macaroni, pumpkin pancakes.
