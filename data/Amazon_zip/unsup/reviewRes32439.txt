I was BEYOND pumped to go and have dinner at Sunda. The bf took me as a birthday present. Let me just start by saying the place is way too small, I was expecting something bigger. With all the hype I was expecting something amazing, unfortunately I was disappointed. The best part of the meal was the edamame. I wasn't thrilled with the sushi and my bf's chicken wasn't even edible. I must say the service was great and our waiter was prompt and very knowledgeable. Go to Japonais and have amazing sushi with a better atmosphere.
