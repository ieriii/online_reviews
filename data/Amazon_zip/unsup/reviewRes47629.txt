I had my WEDDING reception at ZED last July and really think it is a great under considered option for such an event. The FOOD & DRINKS were AWESOME and SERVICE was IMPECCABLE. Many of our guests went on & on that they had NEVER experienced such quality at a wedding. And the best part is that THE COST WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE BANQUET HALLS. Also, we got COMPLIMENTARY PERKS such as using their shuttle service for us & some guests instead of renting limos. Additionally, we were able to use their space as a complimentary "rain out" option (our ceremony was in our backyard). Finally, we received a complimentary sangria cocktail hour for our guests on the amazing "viewed" rooftop deck, as long as we started our package at a certain time, I believe 5. There were a few minor things they "dropped the ball" on but no one's perfect. ALL in ALL, it was the PERFECT RECEPTION! One thing to note is that you can't take advantage of this option with a huge guest list. We only had like 65 but I believe they can accommodate up to 120 or so for a seated dinner.
