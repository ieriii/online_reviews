Wow!! Had a great meal with our kids ages 16, 12 & 10. Had something for everyone, even our pickiest eater. Stopped in at Fogo de Chao to compare and Brazzaz was a better price & atmosphere. Our waiter, Claudiu was fantastic... attentive and informative. Only downside was the coffee was weak. Claudiu worked to make it right though. Will be returning in the future!
