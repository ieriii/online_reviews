Went in for dinner and it was much better than brunch. Wednesday is half price beer night and it was fun to enjoy a rather pricey beer. I had the blue on blue burger. Delicious! An fyi on the Turkey Burger... there is a typo and it reads funny, it really is a beefsteak tomato, not a beefsteak. The veggie burger is a pre-formed patty, although they claimed that they made it there. Our waitress was quite attentive until it was time for the bill. We did notice that she had a table of an elderly group of people. I'll be going back and look forward to trying more beers.
