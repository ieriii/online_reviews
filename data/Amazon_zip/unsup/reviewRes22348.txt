Amazing....I love a good hotdog and this was a mighty fine frank! The first bite was hot and juicy with just the right amount of toppings. I usually am not a fan of the steamed buns that the Chicago style hotdogs are known for because of the wet soggy aspect it lends to the dog. That said...the bun was sturdy and not too wet, the dog was plump and flavorful - served with all the trimmings - golden mustard, tangy piccalilli, kosher dill pickle, chopped Spanish onions and a kickin' hot pepper, it was sheer dynamite! The fries were an afterthought for me, but they were decent and reminded me of cafeteria fries...which isn't a bad thing, but i ended up only eating a few of them and concentrated my eating efforts on the hot diggity dog! Love this place not only for all its kitchy charm, but for its great dawgs as well! Totally lives up to all the hype! The Black Kow was also a tasty way to wash down the hot dog. Nothing says gluttony like a root beer float to compliment a deliciously trashy hotdog! Worth the drive!
