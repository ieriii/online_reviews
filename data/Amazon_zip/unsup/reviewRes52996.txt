I liked this place a lot, they have a really great veggie and Portabella mushroom sandwich that was very tasty. My girlfriend had a pulled pork sandwich and she said it was awesome. Solid sweet fried plantains and fresh vegetable sides made the meal. My only worry is this place being so close to Irazu, and also being so similar (the food, shakes, atmosphere). I think 90 Miles should try and aim for their own kind of niche. Will definitely return!
