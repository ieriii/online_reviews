This place gets an extra star because they have a full bar and a big TV where I can watch a baseball game AND eat a taco. Too bad the taco isn't really all that great. I've eaten here way more often than I should but it's purely out of convenience. If I'm not desperate for booze and cable TV I'd much rather give El Taco Loco my money. Good, strong Margaritas and I love the salsa they serve when you dine in. But that's about where it ends. Their torta bread is usually stale and special requests (no sour cream, no tomato, etc.) is usually ignored. Actually, every time I've eaten with someone who has made a request to have something left off their plate has always recieved it. It's just not anything special. I'm telling you though, they've really got me between a rock and a hard place because of the booze and the cable. But that's it.
