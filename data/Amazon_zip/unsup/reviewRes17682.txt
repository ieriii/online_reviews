Mad at myself for not finding this restaurant sooner. I was invited here by a friend, to celebrate her husbands birthday. It was a large party, and we would not be seated until everyone arrived. That was a little bit of a bummer, but we hung out in the huge bar/lounge area and ordered drinks and waited. Once we were escorted into the main dining room and the curtains opened, it was beautiful in the restaurant, so many colors and a huge wine wall. Our party was a total of 12 and we only were given 1 waiter. I figured on a Friday night with that many people we would have more than one waiter. It started off really rocky, the waiter let some people order starters, then when I wanted an appetizer I was told I couldn't order it because she needed more help with our table. It was the strangest thing. I can't be mad at the restaurant for the waiter for making no sense. After a long 45 minutes wait, we had 2 waiters at our table and taking our orders. I ordered a Mojito Smoothie to start and it was really good. For an appetizer I had the Mac n Cheese which is actually a side dish, but It looked better to me than most of their appetizers. I'm glad I ordered it, it was fantastic and I would go back just for that. For my main course I had the Arrachera, Skirt Steak, rice and beans in a chimichurri sauce. The dish was full of flavor. I think our waiter was just having a bad day and I don't want to base my review on just the service alone, because the food definitely made up for it. My friends and I noticed that a group of girls behind us, got delivered a huge ball of Cotton Candy in a Vase filled with Carmel Corn. We did not see this on the dessert menu and asked, how do we get one of those? Sure enough they make Cotton Candy, it's just not on the menu. For $9 to split between a table of 12 wasn't a bad price at all. It was a fun night out and I can't wait to go back with a smaller group, hoping the service will be better.
