Please take down the banner claiming that you were voted the #1 neighborhood bar in wicker park/ bucktown. That must be a joke. Small Bar could make that claim, not Fifty/50. The food here is good, but I would only come Mon-Wed, as it fills up with dbags (who don't mind forming a line outside) on all other nights.
