My first experience w/Brazilian food... I give it a thumbs up. I am not a big meat girl ... but the bacon wrapped chicken was superb! Huge salad bar, loads of drink and desert options. The never ending plates of food coming to the table was almost too much to bare! My only problem with this place is the pace with which they serve the meat... I felt it was a little like a circus - a new guy coming to the table every minute with a new kind of meat.  Who can remember to flip that card when they are chowing down on all that good food?
