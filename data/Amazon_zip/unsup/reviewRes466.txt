If you search reviews of Alinea, "unforgettable" and "experience" may be the most popular terms. In fact, Alinea is both unforgettable and an experience. Have you ever wondered what it might have felt like to be Lewis Carroll's Alice? After walking into an empty hallway and happening upon the dining room, you are sent down a rabbit hole of gastronomic delight that leaves one in fits. Between a constant sense of awe (once my friend and I got over the awkwardness of what an affair dining at Alinea is -- tables of serious, serious people and equally serious servers) and an incredulity at the number of dishes presented ("We have FOURTEEN more dishes left?"), delirium is delivered in heavy doses. But you will eat, and you will be surprised, and you will be sated. And somehow, like Alice, you will find your way home, and you will be forever changed -- for the better.
