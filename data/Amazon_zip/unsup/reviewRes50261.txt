I'm not normally a sports bar kind of girl but this place offers something for everybody. For one, I'm a big fan of food that is cooked in house and not shipped in frozen. This place definitely puts an emphasis on fresh, tasty food that not a lot of other places in this category do. I've been there a few times now cuz it's walking distance in the hood and can easily recommend: the onion rings, the pulled pork sandwich, the cuban, the sweet potato fries! And lastly, the milkshake. Word on the street is it's made with gelato. It's creamy and delicious and not only does it fill a typical shake glass but they give you the extra in the metal cup to share. Kick ass! The outdoor patio is, of course, superb and canine friendly. Check it out some time.
