I tried this place again and the fries are still super greasythe hot dog was sour tasting and not even hotthey are way over prcedthe service is rottenthe very very long line must be people that are trying it for the first time or giving it one more chance like I didthey cannot be regular customersunless they like wasting their time and moneyand enjoy cold greasy sour tasting food.
