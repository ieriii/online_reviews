So a group of nine of us went here for a b-day celebration. It was a GREAT time! Great ambiance and great service. We didn't feel like making any decisions so we went for the Chef's tasting menu. I highly recommend it. It's 3 courses and you get about 12-15 dishes. Great choice for a group. And we got a ton of food- it just kept on coming. Some of the ones we LOVED: Some kind of a pepper w/some dip, lamb chomps were incredible, pork belly was amazing and I don't love pork belly at all, we also loved the strips of steak...I personally really liked the brussel sprouts- some of my friends didn't care for it. Desserts were not included in the tasting menu. But we got the rice pudding- amazing! Also, ice cream on top of what almost seemed like thick chocolate pudding. Great place for a group celebration! OH...they also have GREAT sangria!
