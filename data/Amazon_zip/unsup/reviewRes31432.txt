My office is in River North literally a block away from Sunda, which is dangerous because the food here is amazing and the ambiance is right in my wheelhouse. I love the entire vibe of Sunda and go there often for lunch. Not five-stars because I wish they'd change the menu items a little more frequently or have more lunch off-the-menu specials, but other than that no complaints. Haven't been for dinner because of how difficult it is for reservations, but will have to get back there for dinner, soon.
