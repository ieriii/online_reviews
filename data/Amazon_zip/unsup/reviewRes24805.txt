I've been to Artopolis several times. I'm usually happy with the food but put off by the staff. The last time I went there, both aspects were negative and I don't think I'll be back here anytime soon. We got the traditional soup (which is reliably delicious), the Mediterranean app platter, and the portobello mushroom sandwich. The sandwich was so incredibly salty that I actually couldn't swallow it. It might be the first time ever that I've spit out food in a restaurant. We told the waitress that we weren't happy with it, and she seemed annoyed but said that she'd talk to the manager to see what he wanted to do. He came over and seemed offended that we didn't like sandwich. I told him that it was so salty I couldn't swallow it and he told me us that the portobello mushroom is in a marinade, etc, etc... it basically felt like he was talking down to us and explaining that the sandwich was supposed to taste like that and we just didn't appreciate it. Anyway, they agreed to take the charge off but in the entire interaction with the waitress and with the manager, I felt like we had to continually defend ourselves... they never seemed apologetic once.  Also, I cannot fathom that the sandwich was actually supposed to taste like that., so why wouldn't they at least consider giving us the benefit of the doubt? I like salt! I'm your average french-fry eating, potato-chip loving american. But I don't like biting into a sandwich and feeling like I just poured a teaspoon of table salt in my mouth. No thank you indeed!
