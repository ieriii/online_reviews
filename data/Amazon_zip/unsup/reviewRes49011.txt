A bit disappointed - I've heard all the hype and since it was a Monday night, perhaps they had their 'B squad' working but service was terrible - slow, unfriendly and not helpful which is needed for the interesting menu. Food was decent but over priced for the portion size. Couldn't help but think maybe we ordered the wrong items ... if only our waitress would have helped. I did enjoy their new take on a squid dish but that's about it and just skip dessert all together - $8 for a sliver of cheese (that should have been served with the ham plate in the first place)
