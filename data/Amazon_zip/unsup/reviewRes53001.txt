My boyfriend really wanted me to give this 4 stars, and I'll admit it's at least a 3.5, and I'd go back and try something different. I just didn't love my sandwich, and my bite of his didn't blow me away enough to go 4 stars. I had the Bistec, which is steak, grilled onions, shoestring potatoes and a chimchurri sauce. The chimchurri sauce was the big seller, and there was hardly any on it. The steak was tough and made the sandwich hard to eat. The bread was really good though. The bf got the Media Noche, which is a pretty classic Cuban sandwich, and it was pretty good. I didn't love the sweet bread though, so if I went again I'd get the Cuban, which is the same toppings on white bread. Prices are very good, sides of fries and plantains were good, and the place is super cute with good service. So I would totally go again, and maybe upgrade to 4 stars after trying the Cuban.
