great for family, everyone gets some space and autonomy. its no design or aesthetic marvel, but gets the job done reliably for a reasonable price. great location (the Embassy @ Lakeshore may be better views) a couple blocks from magnif-mile, cab-able to most dining and shopping you'll do on a family tourist trip. LOTS OF FAMILYS...so don't expect quiet in the morning, and expect long waits at the hot breakfast buffet. but again, overall good value. *rooms here are a bit old and worn (next time i'll consider embassy lakeshore, for real).
