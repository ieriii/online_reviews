Good food selection if you like meat and great burgers. Wide beer selection, but heavy on the IPA and she-she craft beer tip. Lively and fun, not suitable if you're looking for a quiet hideaway. Also, for sports fans, don't expect the sound to be up on the TV, even if the the Hawks are in the cup final. Go to another bar.
