I've been a huge fan of Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for some time now and this review is for my last visit. I continue to find their steaks as excellent in taste and preparation - my favorite over other Chicago steakhouses. This past visit my friends and I ordered the crab filled mushrooms as an appetizer to begin with - I would skip this in the future as the taste was pretty bland.  Two of us ordered the petite filet mignon - cooked medium and one order of lamb chops - cooked medium with an order of mushrooms as a table side. When our steaks were served, one of the filets came out as well done and the lamb chops were over-cooked as well. The one filet that was cooked properly was fantastic - it literally melted in your mouth. Not so much with the over-cooked pieces of meat on the table however. Also, the mushroom side was nothing to write home about - pretty bland as well. I think we'll stick to potatoes here in the future! Now about the two over cooked steaks. We mentioned the issue with our waiter who called over his manager. The manager offered to replace the dishes for us and not charge us for the steaks and apologized for the preparation. It was really nice of him to do this and smart business. We did get another order of the lamb chops and split them - cooked perfectly this time and delicious. Despite this setback... I'm still in Ruth's Chris' fan club - great steaks - hopefully this was just a little road bump in our last visit.
