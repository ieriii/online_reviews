I imagine Violet Hour looks like what a heaven afterlife would be for rock stars and old era Hollywood elite. A heaven indeed, but secret, like it's for sinners who shouldn't be there.  After a horrible work holiday party last winter, I met up with some friends and needed my real night to begin. I had no idea this lounge existed, though I had passed it many times. The door is hidden, and the vestibule made me nervous- watching people in line being escorted behind a huge curtain. Once inside it was another world. The air felt sweet, and even though I saw strange faces, it felt like the lounge was private and reserved for us. There were clusters of candles and chairs whose backs reached up to the ceiling. We were seated in a cozy yet elegant high-back booth, and enjoyed the laid-back swank of this place for the duration. After a few cocktails and sweet-treats, I found that the champagne cocktail was my favorite (well, color me predictable). Oh yes and don't miss the peanut butter/ bacon sandwich *droooool* It's not a scene bar or a trust-fund clubhouse, although it could be if it wanted. The no cell-phone policy pretty much filters out the people that would ruin it's intimate urban charm. This could be a clever move for a second or third date- it's an absolute panty-dropper.  Now I've said too much. ***UPDATE*** This place now has a really long wait, and they tried to seat us at a big ottoman where we couldn't face eachother (?). Also, do NOT order the "americano," it's the only bad thing on the menu.
