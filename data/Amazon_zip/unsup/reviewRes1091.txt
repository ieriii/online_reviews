Doug is awesome, seemed like a great guy, and the dogs are great, and I would go here more if I lived closer, BUT... Can someone tell me why you would wait 2 hours for this??? IS YOU CRAZY? It's fries (yes, fried in duck fat some days-Awesome) and hot dogs, people. This is like getting up at 3AM on Black Friday to get a $25 DVD player and save $2 on Blurays at Best Buy. Perhaps I'm in the minority here... Visitors to Chicago, Hot Dougs is great, so if you want to blow your entire day waiting for hot dogs, then have a great time! Come visit our fair city again soon!
