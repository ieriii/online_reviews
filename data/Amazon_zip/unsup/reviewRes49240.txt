Well I've only been here once, while on a visit to Chicago, so I can't give a comprehensive review. But my red velvet cupcake with cream cheese frosting and a cup of hot chai (no milk) was lovely. The cupcake was moist and flavorful and the frosting was tasty, not cloying or greasy. My companion's lemon bar was rich and crumbly and buttery, which is just how it should be. It didn't hurt that it was a warm, sunny day and we sat outside (unlike most of my other Chicago visits, which have had uniformly abysmal weather). But the room next door seemed like a nice space to sit and read and drink your coffee, as well. A special note has to be made of the fabulous decorated cakes in the window. They had cakes that looked like designer handbags, lovely wedding cakes with trees and vines on them, and a hamburger cake. Does anyone else remember when hamburger cakes were kind of trendy in the mid 80s for a while? Around the same time as those "Where's the Beef?" commercials? Am I dating myself? damn... Anyway, I loved my cupcake.
