5 Stars, says it all! You can't get a better hot dog anywhere. My favorite is the Hot, or Kiera Knightley, but I still need to try all the others, so far I couldn't imagine anything better! Go on a Friday or Saturday and get Duck Fat Fries. I'm moving soon and after being in Chi-town for almost a year, I have to say this is the one place I will miss the most. The line can be a little long, but it's worth it. I've seen people come out and tell everyone waiting that it's all it's hyped up to be, and it sure is. It doesn't get better!
