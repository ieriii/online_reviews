The best Steak Burrito ever! I've searched across the Chicagoland area for the best tasting steak. La Pasadita is incredible. Charbroiled Grade-A Meat....no weird fat grizzle, only the best. comes standard with cilantro and onion. if you add sour cream, cheese and tomato it's .50 cents extra per item....plan on spending close to $9 per burrito with all the fixins....so worth it....I dream about it everyday...OLE` p.s. go to the location on the west side of Ashland, just south of the old Pizza Hut at Division...it doesn't look pretty but the food is amazing.
