I had lunch at The Gage with a group of 8. This was my first time there, and needless to say, we all loved it. The food was better than expected given that most pub food is mediocre at best. The special sandwich, a braised beef rib sandwich with greens, swiss and thinly sliced granny smith apple on a pretzel roll was the big winner. The service was a perfect match for the food. Our waiter was attentive and very nice. The beer selection was outstanding, including some nice Belgian ales as well as some domestic higher end selections. The decor was a nice combination of old world feel dark woods and more modern glass subway tiles. We sat in the rear next to the kitchen, but were not disturbed by sounds or smells from the kitchen. Highly recommend, even if a little on the pricey side for a pub lunch.
