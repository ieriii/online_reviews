I was a bit skeptical about this place because I've had several people tell me that the food wasn't very authentic or anything. Seeing as I'm of Lebanese origin, I've eaten a share fair of middle eastern food in my life. Well, I found Sultan's Market to be great. The food is good, the falafel tastes almost exactly like the ones my grandma makes and well, as someone mentioned earlier, you can't possibly go wrong with hummus. I found the people working there to be nice most of the time, although one time I did get a pretty rude lady at the cash register. Didn't really care much though, seeing as I got to sit outside on the patio and enjoy my food on a pretty spring day. The inside is nice as well, albeit a little gaudy and a little too cramped for my taste. The only thing that disappointed me were the baklava, I bought a box to take home and they were not as good as I hoped. Edible nonetheless. P.S. Good(ish) prices too.
