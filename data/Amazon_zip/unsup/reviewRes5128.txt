Eating here was really the highlight of visiting Chicago. I came here with 2 other people on a Wednesday night w/o reservations and had to wait about 30 minutes. The food here is served tapas style, so its great way for you to sample their menu. We ordered a bunch of things like, Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg and the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. However, the one thing that blew us all away, made the long wait worth it, made the trip to Chicago tolerable and change all of our perceptions of how pork can taste is.....wait for it....wait for it....the Pork Blade Steak with Nduja & Honey!! If you go to the Purple Pig you have to try this item on the menu. I guarantee that you will not want to share. Oh and for dessert go for the Affogato {Shot of Espresso over Espresso Soft Serve}!
