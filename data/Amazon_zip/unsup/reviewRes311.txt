On a whim, I made a food field trip to Chicago, and I knew that I had to see what the buzz was all about regarding this restaurant. With my reservation set for a month in advance, I eagerly anticipated the discoveries of a lifetime on my dinner plate. Now that I've been through the tour at Alinea, I can truly say that food is more than just nourishment. It's a way of life that evokes feeling and emotion; to be more specific, true happiness! The experience began as I walked thru the large unmarked wood doors. A long hallway awaited me and mysteriously directed me to the sliding doors of the restaurant. The decor was sleek and very clean. I was greeted by the host and brought up the stairs to a nice corner table where the food experience of a lifetime was to occur. 26 courses and 4 hours later, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. Some favorites of mine included a cauliflower puree dish, pumpkin and gruyere cheese custard served a bed of smoke, trout roe with tropical flavors, and a wagyu beef and mushroom dish with a maple infused sherry vinegar. I could go on and on with the food, but to conclude, dinner at Alinea is the experience of a lifetime!
