I went to Lockdown Bar last weekend when I was visiting a friend in Chicago and all the food I tried was so good. I usually never waste my money on buying a salad at a restaurant, but I thought I'd give it a try since I didn't want anything too heavy. It was not a waste of money! I had the Billy the Kid salad and it was delicious--the crispy prosciutto was a nice touch, and a really good combination with the vinaigrette. All of the salads looked really good so I think if I go back I'll try the others. I also got a side mac & cheese, which was to die for. I'm usually very critical about my mac & cheese because I like it a certain way, but this one was perfect--cheesy and full of flavor. I had a bite of my friend's burger that she was raving about the whole time she was eating it, so I gave in and had a try. Excellent. Really moist and hearty.
