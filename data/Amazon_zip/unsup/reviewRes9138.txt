My man and I were searching for something interesting to mix up our bland night. We stumbled upon Le Colonial and were blown by this French / Vietnamese style tapas. The ambience and music lure you while Our Server was excellent at giving us suggestions while we waited for our table. I believe his name was Kai, so speedy with coursing out our dishes once we had been seated. We had the Pho to start off with, then the red fillet snapper, Sa song, and finished with a decadent lemon tart. The food was all around flavorful and surprising. I gave it 4 stars because of the wait was not fun or entertaining. Non the less you won us over Le Colonial, we shall be back!
