This place automatically should get five stars because their Tahini is cheaper than Indian Village. Also, if you're into salad bars (and, I'm not talking grocery store salad bars) you should check out Sultan's spread. They have stuffed grape leaves and calamari that's NOT fried! Hard to find in the midwest. Oh, falafel is cheap here as well. Come one come all...seriously.
