This is my 1st review on YELP, but I was just so disappointed. After having received dozens of those Neighborhood Coupon things at home, we decided to check this place out. We had a couple of friends in from San Diego to visit us. The best part of the meal was the setting,,it's busy, loud, nice atmosphere, and very comfortable, and we had a window seat on a nice night. That is about it for the pluses. The negatives were:1. Hostess was really robotic like, never looked us in the eye, and just did the follow me thing to the table. Our guests asked us is this Chicago or New York City??2. We placed our order with the waitress, average job on her part. In the meantime, me and my friend both ran out of drinks while we waited for her to come back...wait..wait..wait..3. App came..fine..Calamari..not bad..good portion size.4. Meals arrive, the women got large portions of pasta, and we got   small portions of chicken and fish..We said Wow..big portions   of the pasta..Waitress says, Yeah,,we have smaller portions   available..     We ladies would have taken the smaller portions in a heart beat    if we knew, and they are not on the menu.5. My friend got a Caprese Salad too..like 3 slices of Fresh Mozz and  a few slices of Tomatoes, and Olive Oil..Pretty, but way overpriced  for what you get.6. Meal over, doggie bagged both pastas, and we, the men, still hungry   due to our small portions..great..but not yet over.....the busboy guy,   broken English at best, didn't understand the doggie bag and when   the waitress gave us our bill..we asked about the doggie bag, and   after a few minutes, we were told that it was thrown out...7. So....she offered to remake it, and we waited for a remake..8. We ran out of drinks while we waited too...Recap...Service was not good, food was okay, but overpriced forwhat we received. Atmosphere is nice, but you can get that everywhere in this neighborhood...Sorry, we will not be back..
