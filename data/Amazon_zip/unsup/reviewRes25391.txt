Had dinner here on a Friday night with my teenaged daughter while visiting Chicago. We loved it! What a fun place, imaginatively designed and with a wonderful and welcoming staff whose menu recommendations were spot on. Among the highlights of our meal were a wonderful cheese plate (including one accompanied by a roasted garlic dulce de leche sauce - yum!), a spectacular serrano ham and date salad, perfectly cooked garlic shrimp, lobster and squid a la planxa and a wonderful lemon cake for dessert.  A lovely experience, and thanks to my friend who recommended it!
