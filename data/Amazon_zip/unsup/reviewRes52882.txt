A BYOB worth the wait. This place definitely has the HIP factor for the BYO community. The menu is long, the kitchen is hot and fast moving and the waits are, well worth it. Overall I found the food very affordable, tasty and just like being in Miami. The heated winter patio is awesome and makes you think its warm again in Chicago. Great place for groups, friends or even a fun date spot. Truly enjoyed the food, not a Michelin meal by any stretch, but it has the soul-food substance with eye popping flavors.
