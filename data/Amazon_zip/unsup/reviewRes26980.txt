No taste or sameness of taste is all I can say about Frontera. The guacamole was some of the worst I have ever tasted; had what my granny would have called a strange "Wang.". I ordered the street food trio, and honestly it all could have been the same thing presented differently. I did like the grilled corn. We walked next door to xoxo by which is another rick bayless restaurant and we wish we had eaten there! it looked so much better. Perhaps we need to give it one more try - but for the money, I'm not sure i'm willing to do that.
