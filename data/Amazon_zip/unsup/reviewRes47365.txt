I had the Border Patrol burger and it was really tasty. The burger selection was interesting and varied -- it made it pretty hard to make a decision. The fries were solid, too. The heavy metal music inside was insanely loud. Luckily it was a beautiful evening and we were able to sit outside. We sat near a table full of loud and annoying drunks, but it was late...and it's a bar, so I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised. The service was adequate. Our server wasn't especially attentive, but she was prompt enough. To summarize, the food was excellent...everything else was average to below-average. That said, I'll definitely be going back -- the burger was that good.
