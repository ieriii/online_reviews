The first time we walked by this place, it looked like a grungy college bar. It wasn't till we'd lived in Chicago a year that we realized how amazing this place is. The beers are fantastic, the food really well done and extremely tasty. The staff is professional, fun and completely in the know about the various menus. I confess, we have tried to recreate the mussels at home and they are never as good.
