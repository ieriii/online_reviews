I've had so many great visits to Wildfire. The food couldn't be better.  My boss from Miami insists on coming to Wildfire everytime she is in town for business. She says there isn't a restaurant like this near Miami. She LOVES the bread they bring out. She ate three entire loaves in one visit ...she was in carb heaven. Thank you, Wildfire, for being the solution to dinner for a very picky boss.
