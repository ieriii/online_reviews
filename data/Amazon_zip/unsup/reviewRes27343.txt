After having lived in Chicago for a few years and having tried many of the "famous" deep dish places I'll put it like this... skip them and go here. It's a funky place, when you walk in on any given night it seems like a sports bar that serves food, but when you get walked upstairs to seat for food (if you don't get sat in the front bar area) you'll see the nicer side of the place--but that's just the look. The pizza is the kicker, their thin crust is good, but you're in Chicago and you want pizza, that means unless you're headed north to Great Lakes then go for the real thing, the deep dish. The deep dish here is awesome, unfortunately, those of us who have tried know that delivered deep dish is NEVER as good--the metal pans they use for eating in-house are key. In short, don't go for the ambiance go for the deep dish, and if you are lucky enough to be taking a date who likes a good deep dish, take her (or him) along order a pint or two and enjoy the amazing deep dish Pequods has to offer.
