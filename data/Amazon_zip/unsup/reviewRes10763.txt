Never again. The pizza was fine, but not enough to get me back here. Maybe it was the whole weekend crowd that got me, but I thought this place was not worth my time twice. The pizza, like I said, was fine, but you could get great pizza at lots of places and not have to fight your way through a crowd if you decide you need to leave your table. It was so packed, you would have thought there was a live mainstream band playing.  The music was also blasting here. I couldn't here anyone I came with. I came with a group of coworkers, and we were just looking for a good time. All we got was good pizza. You could only talk to the person next to you, so don't try a three person conversation here on a Friday or weekend.
