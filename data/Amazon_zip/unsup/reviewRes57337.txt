My favorite sushi bar in Chicago. I keep trying to find other sushi bars that are as good but are closer to me or aren't as busy, but I can't!!Our service has always been outstanding. Our waiters always recommend something amazing. We typically order sushi rolls and make sure to always order at least one dragon roll (our favorite).We have always had to wait for table, so that's probably the biggest negative. But they have tables for people who are waiting and it's BYOB, so just bring an extra bottle for the wait.
