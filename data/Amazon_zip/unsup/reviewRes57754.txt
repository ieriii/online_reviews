All the food here is fresh and delicious, but a little gem on the menu is The Amazing Turkey Burger. I am particularly fond of them. I have sampled Turkey Burgers all over The Chicago land area. I've gone from fancy hotels to bars and it just doesn't compare to The 3 Coast Cafes version. This is my secret indulgence I wait for once a week.I get it with grilled mushrooms and a slice of Swiss. They give you all the fixings on the side (which I like) lettuce tomato etc... Every bite is Hot, Juicy, Moist and Delicious. Not easy to do with Turkey. The mix of flavors just melt in your mouth with every bite. Amazing !
