Its pasta but ITS NOT ITALIAN!! Its a great place for me to eat high calorie food during those stormy winter nights in Chicago, as I live very close. Everything about their menu, I love!! They hand out a menu with a few vegetarian options and always, so far, the waiter/waitress have said that they can customize many entrees to make it vegetarian. Some of my favorites so far have been the mac and cheese, lasagna and gnocchi.
