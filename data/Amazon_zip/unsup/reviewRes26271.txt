this was my first experience with fondue. I thought itd be a good idea to have dinner here rather than melting pot because of the great reviews and the romantic atmosphere. the setting was nice but VERY CRAMPED. we were seated in the middle tables. people were bumping into us all night. the tables were so close together...there was nothing romantic about the night. the tables were small. i was afraid one wrong move and id knock everything over. the food was good. i heard at other places you get a choice of oil or broth but it was just oil here. by the end of the night, my boyfriend and i were not feeling well from everything being deep fried. it was also VERY DARK in there. we couldnt see if our food was thoroughly cooked. service was excellent though! i would recommend this place but i dont think its really worth the money... and not much of a romantic place to go either...
