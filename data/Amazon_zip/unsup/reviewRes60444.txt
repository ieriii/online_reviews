The first person I met in your restaurant was so full of attitude that I was grateful when there was a wait. "The Reservation Name...?" poured out of his mouth with such unwelcome, and condescension, as if too say, "how could you possibly expect to get a seat in this restaurant tonight without a reservation?" We were all on the same page... you and I both knew that we didn't have a reservation. If you did think we actually had a reservation, you never would have approached us with such an attitude. Too bad, all we were looking for was an idea of the wait time, and an invitation to the bar where we would have gladly dropped cash on drinks while we waited. People who are looking to dine in Andersonville, eat elsewhere... Calo, Great Lakes, the new Vincent, which had less open tables, and still sat us right away, with a smile and what seemed like a sense of appreciation for our business.
