I am always suspect of places that claim to do both Sushi and Thai...but in this case I was deliciously proved wrong. Sometimes you just can't decide: Tom Yum Soup, Red Curry, or Sushi?? I guess I'll have all 3. YUM! The atmosphere is really nice - plus even though they have a full bar it is BYOB. Shoot. Now I want to go there instead of cooking tonight. Boo.
