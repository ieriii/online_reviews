Really good pizza. We started with a (very deep-fried) appetizer combo and then two small deep dish: a garlic, basil, pepperoni and a sausage, mushroom and green olive. Very good and plenty for 4 people (two of whom are know for their ability to tuck away the pizza). I'm not going to weigh in on some kind of "best chicago style pizza" debate, but it really hit the spot. The ambiance was also very pleasant and the server was attentive. Five stars in the cosmic scheme of things? No. Five stars in the universe of pizza joints? Absolutely. Parking absolutely sucks.
