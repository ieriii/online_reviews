I've been lucky enough to dine at pretty much all of the heavy hitting restaurants in Chicago (Alinea, Tru, Trotters, etc.) and Schwa is the only one that I go back to again and again. Michael Carlson is a genius. Not only is he experimenting with bold techniques, ingredients and flavors, but he manages to make every dish scrape-your-plate delicious too.  Getting a table can be a bit of a trial, but do it -- you won't regret it.
