The lobby is gorgeous and grand. Rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. However, the walls were so thin. We were woken at various points in the early morning by people in the hallway. They didn't sound like they yelling and we could still hear every word of their conversation. Then, at 6:30am we could hear clearly the people in the room next door. Room service food was also bad and not at all worth the price. Wouldn't stay here again.
