I can't really say much outside what other people have already said. The short: -Tons of sides -All the meat we ordered was great -They kept the beer coming :) -They replaced our grill rack several times when requested -The service was great (I think it really helped to have someone speaking Korean) -We did a special for 8 people and about 10 large beers, so it ran about 40 a person I'd say you're fine to come with a group, but make a reservation.  All in all everything was excellent, so I won't bore you with a long review.
