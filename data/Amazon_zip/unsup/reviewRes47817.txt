If great ambiance and nice selection of endless food is what you're look for, Zed451 is the place. This brazilian-style steak and bar has everything to offer - from a cozy and elegant place to have a drink, to a swank dinning area with a really nice selection of a salad and soup bar. And like other brazilian-style houses, you have the a nice selection of meats that chef's bring to your table throughout the night. Not sure if i was all that impressed with the meat selection...there are some highlights like the Moroccan chicken and the grilled venison...because if you really want a true brazilian-style experience, go somewhere else like a Fogo de Chao. But this place does get high marks for the overall dining experience like the beautiful bar, dinning area with endless salad selection (try the seared tuna with horseradish sauce or the candied parmesan cheese), and friendly service. And i guess i do like the idea of paying one flat rate ($44) to have as much salad and meat that i want. Don't have to bother making a choice of what i feel like eating at a place like this. Plus, they have a really good wine selection.  Decent food and absolutely great atmosphere. Definitely go again.  P.S. while i didn't have my son with me this time, the place really seemed kid friendly. That's one nice distinction between them and a Fogo de Chao.
