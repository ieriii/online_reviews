Straight up I cannot recall liking a pizza less, which says a lot because I don't like a lot of pizza. We had thin crust -- I realize this isn't their "thing" but it's not that hard to make a good thin crust cheese pizza.  The crust itself was so completely tasteless -- like it was just flour and water. Not even salted, no pinch of sugar to get the yeast pumping. Just mixed bleached flour mixed with water and baked. The amount of cheese put on the pizza was insulting -- gobs and gobs of flavorless LMPS mozzarella. I don't mind a lot of cheese, but if it tastes like rubber, I'll pass. The little bit of sauce under the cheese was pretty tasty, but not enough of it and hardly making up for the rest of this wretched pizza Service wise, we ordered for pickup, arrived 5 min after the time they said to come, had to push through a crows to find someone to talk to and then waited nearly 15 more minutes.
