I have tried many of the 2 thousand pizza places in this city. Pequods is my only true favorite pizza place in Chicago to date. Super-tasty toppings, perfectly tang/tart thick and chunky red sauce, and 20+ year old cast iron pizza dishes seasoned to burn just the sides of your deep dish cheese crust: they just simply work! Don't bother with the thin crust...that would be a waste of your time and pizza. That said, I've eaten here over 30 times...you should too.
