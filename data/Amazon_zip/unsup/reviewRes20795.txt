I have a love/hate relationship with this place. BEST sushi, worst service/reservation policy. Have not been there in 6 months because you have to make a reservation a week in advance, otherwsie you wait for an hour to eat.  With so many other great sushi places in Chicago, I would rather spend my money at other places.
