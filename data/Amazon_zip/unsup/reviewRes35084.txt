Ordinarily I leave a sushi restaurant feeling hungry apprx. 25 minutes after paying the bill. I am willing to pay this price. However, be warned that the Sushi X will fill your belly and leave it full of sushi goodness.  My boyfriend and I stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon. Walking in this place is unique for a number of reasons. First, there is a constant movie reel projected on the main wall. Second, you don't see the sushi bar...this might be the first sushi restaurant I have been to where you can't see a chef rolling up your dinner.  We ordered a couple of rolls each and a seaweed salad. Holy moly. The largest helping of delicious green seaweed I have ever seen. Better yet, by far the largest rolls I have ever seen. These delightful, albeit difficult to eat, beauties combine a number of flavors I have never found in sushi including basil, curry and even bacon. I will definitely be back :)
