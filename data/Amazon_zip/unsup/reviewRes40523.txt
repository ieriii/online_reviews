Pasadita literally kept me alive for years when I lived nearby. Now that we've moved to Humbolt Park I've been searching for a place that even comes close and nothing does. So we come here if we're in the hood. Came in this week and OH NO! $2 for the pico de gallo now?? WAHHHHH! What a bummer man. I'll just have to think back to the gallons of it I've eaten there and reminisce.... -1 star for charging for the pico guys! In some ways I can't blame them but I was used to the freebie.
