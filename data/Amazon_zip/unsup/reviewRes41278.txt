I really don't understand the name, but I'm totally a fan now. We decided to pick one steakhouse this year for Chicago Restaurant Week (the perfect pick-me-up in the dead of winter: a steak dinner for $32), and ended up choosing Ruth's Chris. We were immediately smacked in the face with the stench of melted butter upon entering. It was fantastic. We were then seated upstairs in this tiny little room with about six other tables for two, and it was quiet, romantic and they were playing the Rat Pack. Atmosphere doesn't get much better than that. Our server was incredibly friendly and didn't cringe when my fiance ordered just a salad and other vegetarian sides. I got the 8 oz. filet, and the thing was served on a 500-degree plate sizzlin' in butter. It was one of the most glorious pieces of meat I've had in my life, and it honesty rivals my fav ... David Burke's. This stuff was melt-in-your-mouth fabulous. The mashed potatoes were amazing, as were the mushrooms and creamed spinach. I thought the mushrooms lacked a little flavor, but everything was still fantastic. We finished with a piece of chocolate mousse cheesecake, and the giant square that came to our table was too much for me to finish. It was scrumptious, though! Everything here was fantastic, and the only thing I can think to even complain about was the drafty upstairs room. But with such an amazing meal, that really didn't matter. Ruth's Chris is highly recommended.
