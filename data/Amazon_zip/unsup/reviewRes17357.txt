Eh... I thought it was nice. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. Cool ambiance. I actually went over the summer for a friends pre dinner birthday drinks. It's extremely dark. So dark that I had a hard time seeing the menu. The drinks were pretty good. This is THE place to take someone if you're trying to impress. I would definitely go again. I dug the vibe, though I think the place is a little over rated compared to the build up of getting in.
