Heard about this place for ages; finally was craving Belgian frites enough to make the trek to Andersonville. I would have been better off making them myself... the "frites" were soggy, burnt shoestrings, most of which were too small to dip into the delicious aioli. I've had better at carnivals and bowling alleys, not to mention the Belgian bar I used to work at (where they were fresh-cut, thick, and crispy). The entree my wife and I split was edible, if unappealingly presented. For the price? Unacceptable, as the portion size was more "appetizer" or "side dish." Regardless, it wasn't good enough for us to finish, even after the disappointment of the "frites." Our server seemed uninterested. We were never asked if we wanted refills (probably for the best; my wife chased down our [very nice] hostess to get more soda and was shocked when the refill showed up as $2.50 on our check). After getting our order, I don't think we saw our server again until our check appeared - they didn't even try to upsell us on dessert, which my wife was in the mood for. Maybe our server was just having a bad day, as we also got ignored when we thanked them on our way out. Beer selection had nice choices from local, national, and international breweries. "Best Beer Bar in Chicago," though? Not unless Quenchers and the Map Room (and probably other places) get sucked into a black hole. We won't be going back, not when I can get a better beer selection and better (and cheaper) food much closer to home at Quenchers; if I'm in the neighborhood and want to grab a drink, Simon's is right there, too - I'd rather support their friendly staff and awesome jukebox than the Hop Leaf's indifferent food and service.
