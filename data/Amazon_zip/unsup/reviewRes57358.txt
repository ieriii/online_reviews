Although the sushi is absolutely delicious, the service is horrendous! Now, my friends and I did not have reservations, but I called ahead of time and was told if we showed up by 7:30, we'd be seated in an hour and we could drink while we waited. Our wait turned into 2 hours!! And we couldn't even anesthetize our boredom with alcohol because they ran out of glasses! By the time we sat down, we were tired, hungry, and lost our mojo!! Coast, please work on your waiting area and we might return for your great sushi!
