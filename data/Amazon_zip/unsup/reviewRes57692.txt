I am a GREAT fan of this place. There are many things that I enjoy here. Starting with, I really enjoy their avocado tacos and their homemade lemonade. Delicious! I have tried their different salsas and like to usually blend the 3 together and get a really spicy version.My kids will eat just about everything off their dessert menu and their ochata (spelling?) drink they usually slurp in a heartbeat.My husband tried the shrimp fajitas last time and loved them! He didn't save a single bite for me. I will deifniently try them next time.As for desserts, I agree with my kids, the flan is amazing!
