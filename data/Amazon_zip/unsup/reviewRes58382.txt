Excellent service, superior food. This is the second Brazilian restaurant I've been to. It's real tempting to dive into the most excellent salad bar but DON'T! Save it for the better cuts of beef waiters offer you. You have a chip on your table. Leave it red and eat in peace, turn it green and within seconds a waiter serves you one of 15 varieties of meat. Pricey? Oh heck yes. You do not want to make this your favorite bar unless your The Donald but in respects of once a year or to seriously impress a friend/client this place is it. One tip though, emailing in a reservation only means you get in the door. We did have to wait another 20 minutes to get seated.
