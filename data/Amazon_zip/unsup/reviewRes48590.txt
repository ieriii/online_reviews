Wow. Fit for foodies. The vibe: The brick building's large windows give a glimpse into the dinning room where retro pendant lamps warmly light a horse shoe of wood communal tables, large pig images (a not so subtle hint of their specialty), and unpretentious but helpful servers. It feels like you're eating at the butcher's home if he had access to local farm goods and a whole bunch of semi-artsy successful friends. It's a bit loud but in a good way. To drink: Foundary dirty bastard beer: dark, semi-heavy with a chocolate aftertaste. The Czar: dark like the above but not aftertaste. To me, not as complex and therefore not as yummy. The wine list also is comprehensive. To eat: (served family style so it's easy to try everything) Corn: cream with delicious cream fresh and paprika. Each kernel exposed sweetness in your mouth. Beets with ricotta: the cheese! Sweetest ricotta I've ever had. The beets exceptional too. Suckling pig: I don't order pork ever and this was amazing. Served with kale, oranges and pine nuts this dish is a must. Crunchy but not greasy. Frits with two eggs: pipping hot fries with eggs, who ever thought of such a wonderful idea and why isn't this available everywhere?! Sausage (blanc?): mustard potatoes and cooked grapes. Probably the weakest of the lot but the standards are pretty high. Lavender apple crisp with almond ice cream: Wow. Crispy crumble and moist apple pieces. The ice cream has a thick creamy texture. Divine.  In sum, a beautiful meal.
