absolutley wonderful!!! my boyfriend took me here the other night for valentines day and everything tasted great. service was extremely attentive & friendly. at first the prices looked a bit high, but for what you get its totally worth it and is about what you would spend at any other place. didnt care too much for the cheese fondue, but i still ate a lot of it. also, i wish there were more potatoes with the entree, but i dont think they would have fit in my stomach anyways!!! dessert was also wonderful!! with the bill they give you a card for a $25 gift card to come back for a special occassion which is awesome. i recommend asking for a booth...you need space for everything they give you. overall it was fabulous and we will definately go back!!
