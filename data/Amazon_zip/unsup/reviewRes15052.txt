Super cool place! I love the music and dark setting. The chairs are really cool too. Lighting is a little TOO dark. You have to read the menu holding your candle over it and after awhile that got annoying. Drinks are so cool...I would definitely put this list up there with Aviary! A lot of them are made with egg whites, which made me a little hesitant ordering. It just gives the drink a nice frothy topper, kind of like froth on a cappuccino, but much thinner As for food Gnocci were great! Pork belly spread, with mustard and garnishing on baguettes. Just outstanding!! All of their food is super cheap! My boyfriend and I shared these two plates and were satisfied with the portion sizes. All drinks are 12 dollars Its nice to get different drinks so you can share tastes
