Weird name, awesome food, great service! When we arrived there was a bit of a wait, maybe 5-10 minutes. The hostess and the owner came by several times to reassure us that the table would be ready shortly. They brought us hot tea while we were waiting as well. We ordered beef pho, veggie pho, vegetarian steamed dumplings and taro bubble tea. This is one of the better bowls of pho I have had. All of the portions are very large, even the appetizer. And best of all the food was very inexpensive. Our total bill was $30! I highly recommend Simply It if you are looking for a casual, inexpensive dining experience that provides excellent food. BYOB if you want drinks. We will definitely be back.
