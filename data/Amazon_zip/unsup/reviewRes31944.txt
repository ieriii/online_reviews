Not being a vegetarian, I didn't know what I'd think of this place. But it was great! Great variety on the menu, complete with definitions of some of the less commonly known ingredients. The waitress was knowledgeable about the food but was also quick to admit when she wasn't (I asked about the wine selection) and she quickly enlisted another server to help me decide. It's a tight space but that never bothers me, personally. I'd suggest getting there at 5:00 or 5:30, not 7 unless you don't mind the wait - they don't take reservations.
