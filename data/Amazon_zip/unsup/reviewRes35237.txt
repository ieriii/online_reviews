After my previously scathing review about why everyone should go to Hon Kee instead of Sun Wah, I would like to point out one thing. Sun Wah's wanton noodles ($4.75) is MUCH tastier than Hon Kee's ($3.75). This might be the only reason why I would go back to Sun Wah. For everything else, you can't beat Hon Kee!
