You just can't go wrong with eating at Calo - - menu selection, food quality and consistency, atmosphere, service, prices are all spot on. Great specials, including wine, each night and big menu that ranges from chicken and veal dishes, to pizza to fantastic selection of different pastas. Bread basket is great way to start with yummy focaccia and every entree comes with really nice salad (served on a cold plate, which I really like) or soup. I always read through the entire menu but often get the same great dish - - ziti ala vodka with chicken. And, I always have pasta to take home. Weekend nights often feature live music and the bar area always has games on TV, so you can eat a nice dinner and catch the game. Dining room is great too - - young crowd drinking martinis and older couples dressed for dinner, too. On week nights, you can walk in but DEFINITLEY make reservations for weekends.
