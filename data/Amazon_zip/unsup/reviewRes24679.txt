Since my girlfriend wanted to go to Geja's and I had never been there before we decided go. We also got the groupon. Inside was romantic and magical. To start off we ordered the FLAMING CHOCOLATE FONDUE (Flamed with orange liqueur and served with strawberries, apples, banana, pineapple, graham cracker crumbs, pound cake, and marshmallows for roasting) This was simply divine! The marshmellows were fun to eat and it just like a campfire. We cooked and dipped them into a pool of delicious chocolate AGED BEEF TENDERLOIN WITH ATLANTIC SEA SCALLOPS This came with some scallops, beef tenderloin portions and some Vegetables. They replaced the cooking pot with one with cooking oil. it was quite fun to deep fry the meats. We really enjoyed cooking the broccoli and scallops. There were about 10 different sauces to dip our food in. The meats tasted the best with the garlic aioli sauce Compared to melting pot and fondue stube Gejas is more romantic and great for special occasions. Food wise melting pot has slightly bigger meat portions and has batter for frying but does cost more. So that evens out. Verdict: perfect for special occasions Make sure to order the chocolate fondue. That's a'more!
