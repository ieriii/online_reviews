I've had huevos rancheros done a bunch of ways. M&H comes baked in a ramekin. There's something comforting about it visually. Overall, I really liked the no fuss atmosphere, the good value for the money (unless you order juice, which is always overpriced anywhere you go), and the freshness of the ingredients. Also, not having to wait more than 5 minutes made this trip worthwhile. Otherwise, waiting for brunch makes me uber grumpy.
