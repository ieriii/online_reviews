Vegan meals @ meat prices. Why? The name? The famous cookbook? The Lakeview locale? Seriously, the best part of diner food is the cheap meat. Of course I'm talking about greasy spoon burgers, "was that really steak?" steaks and anti-hangover early morning sausage patties. I've been here a couple of times and each experience has been unique. First, let me tell you what I like about Chicago Diner. To begin, there's a very friendly (& heavily-tattooed) wait staff ready on the refills. Even before we got seated - there's always a wait- a member of our party was complimented on her sense of style. Secondly, I like the music which this day included vegan musician Beck. Finally, I like the diner aesthetic & the chalkboard menu. The problem is the entree prices hover around or go over $10. I guess I'm a cheap carnivore who prefers the deliciousness of Veggie Bites and Soul Vegetarian. Initially, I wanted to give the Diner two stars but their desserts are wonderful, really superb. That alone is a shining star.
