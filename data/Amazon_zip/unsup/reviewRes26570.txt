Que venden aqui?? Comida! *that was an inside joke* Ah yes, Nuevo Leon. There are two things about this place that never changes. 1 - the place is always packed. No matter what time of day I come, there's either a line out the door or I am able to snag one of the last two tables that were somehow empty. 2 - the floor is always greasy. Gotta love that Mexican grease. I've learned over time to NOT wear my high heels with the worn out heel tip because that exposed steel is a slippery little sucker. I now come in flats or gym shoes ('tenis').  Comida! This is truly a Mexican place, it's not my absolute favorite (there can only be one) but it passes the test for authentic. Even MY MOM recommends it and she's a critic. Born and raised in Mexico and cooking Mexican for over 30 years -- she calls it like she sees it. I remember walking out of Mexican restaurants many a time because my mom said the rice 'came from a box' and she was offended. I agree, you can tell the difference. Thanks Mom! Like mother like daughter.  I've had a ton of things off the menu here and each has been tasty and satifying. AND they don't overcharge you like crazy here. We had a dinner for 4 people for $35 total. And FYI, it's BYOB. We saw a group of ten walk in with a bottle of Tequila. Shots, shots, shots! Despite the lines and rowdyness of this place, I gotta give it to them, good food/good prices/close to my house... sold!
