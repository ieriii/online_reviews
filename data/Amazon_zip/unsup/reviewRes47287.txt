One of the best burger places! The atmosphere is similar to that of Kuma's - dark, edgy, heavy-metal themed - although this place sets itself apart by making it feel like a prison bar. My boyfriend had The Lockdown Warden burger. It's a huge Angus Beef patty stuffed w/ bacon, leeks, garlic, shallots, and cheddar cheese. it's topped w/ fried leeks and shallots tossed w/ truffle oil. OMG, this is amazing! And I'm not even much of a meat eater. I kept asking him if I could have another bite! He got the fries as his side and those were very delicious! I had Conjugal Visit. It's a huge turkey burger w/ brie, canberries and a patty of stuffing. OMG, so good! It tasted just like Thanksgiving! I wasn't sure if they could nail a non-red meat burger but apparently they can! I would definitely get that again! I had the mac and cheese as my side. I thought it was ok; I am very picky when it comes to mac and cheese. Overall we had a great experience here. Our only gripe was the server. She didn't come by our table that often and when it was time for us to pay she was MIA. The bus boy noticed that we had been waiting a while and kindly, on his own, flagged her down for us. Despite that, I'd definitely be back!
