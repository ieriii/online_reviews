So to start, how can you not like a restaurant that is open until 5am? Moving on.. if your not really sure what Korean BBQ is because you have never been before, it is exactly what the name says. It is Korean food, barbecued. Not just barbecued though, barbecued YOUR way. How is it your way? Well, when you sit down at your table, there is going to be a big empty spot in the middle of the table, and a ventilation duct over your head. As soon as you tell the waitress you want BBQ, a cart comes out with a flaming grill with charcoal bricks burning - or, if you are some place else, it could be a gas stove they have at your table. Once your food comes, you cook it yourself! You like your steak well done, then cook well done - yourself! You like it practically raw you can still give it a name - cook it (or warm it) yourself! On to the review: I have been to my fair share of Korean BBQ restaurants, and have had good experiences. However, this one is my standard go to. After a long night out, or a hard days work, a great way to treat yourself is by heading into San Soo. As with your traditional Korean restaurants, they bring you all the side dishes you could imagine. I mean, you have barely decided what you want to eat and already there are more little bowls on your table then you know what to do with. The only thing I have ever eaten here were the different varieties of BBQ meats from pork, chicken and steak. All very excellent and flavorful. The service here can vary. Sometimes they treat you like you are their best customer, other times they treat you like the red-headed step child. Either way, the food can usually make up for it. If have never tried Korean BBQ before, this would definitely be a great place to start. It would give you a pretty decent standard amongst other places. As well, if you plan on BBQing your own food, make sure you have someone with you, because you need to order at least 2 entrees to be able to BBQ at your table.
