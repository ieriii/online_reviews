My husband and I went here to celebrate our anniversary. I had heard many good things about Las Tablas from a co-worker who is Colombian and we thought it might be worth checking out. We made reservations for Saturday night. I highly recommend making reservations as this place gets extremely busy. We had 8:00 reservations and it was pretty packed, and people were waiting to be seated. I was really impressed with the menu options. We started off with a pitcher of Sangria which really was the best I have EVER had. I usually prefer the white Sangria but this one was so good we practically finished the pitcher. And at $24 a pitcher it was a sweet deal. Next we ordered the empanadas. The appetizer comes with 6 empanadas (2 cheese, 2 beef, and 2 chicken). The cheese were my favorite. For dinner I ordered the shrimp and steak combination and my husband ordered the steak and chicken combination. Each dish was served with a plantain, yucca and a half of potato. My only complaint was the my steak was over cooked and my husband's steak was undercooked. I would definitely go here again but probably not get the steak. Believe it or not I thought the chicken and shrimp were much better. I did give it 4 stars though not as a steak house but as an overall restaurant. Plus the coconut flan is excellent and I probably would stop in just for dessert!!
