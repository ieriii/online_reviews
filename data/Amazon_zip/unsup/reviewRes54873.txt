For a beer lover this place is meca. It has beers from all over the world served in specialty glasses to make them as tasty as they can be.For beer lovers who dont have a bottomless wallet however this place is a the ultiamate tease. $8 beers, $15 pictures (not everything is this expensive) is sadly not for everyone. The place itself is great though. It's got the feel of your favorite neighbood bar, and the bartenders are friendly and knowageable.
