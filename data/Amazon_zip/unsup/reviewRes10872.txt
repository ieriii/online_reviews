First time I went here, we had reservations for a large group (12!) but they wouldn't let us sit until we had half of our group present. By the time the whole group got there, we were split into separate booths in the same section. Kind of annoying, but no biggie. Everyone else wanted crazy toppings on their pizzas, but all I wanted was a standard margarita pizza (mozzarella, tomato, basil) I was very happy with my personal pizza since the crust was PERFECT! Perfect to the point of growling like a raccoon when my sister tried to swipe a piece. I think the quality of the crust goes down as the size of the pizza increases, so I wouldn't go bigger than a medium. I tried Piece again with a friend, since he's a Wisconsin lovin', vegetable hatin' carnivore we got pepperoni pizza. I was sorely disappointed when the pepperoni greased up the pizza so much that I could barely eat it, in fear of igniting my acid reflux. I'd give this place another chance since it's in a convenient location, the pizza's good when its on the smaller side, and MAKER'S MARK MONDAYS!
