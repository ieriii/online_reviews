This place is cheap and BYOB, which is such a wonderful combination. It's a fun crowd too - very diverse and really feels like a melting pot of Chicago residents. Some of the food is quite good, but some of the other items have a "you-get-what-you-pay-for" feel. Like the guacamole - it's very bland. Overall a great place for a cheap night out!
