So gf wante to come here because of the famous Rick Bayless, or whoever he is. We didn't even see the guy. Food was overpriced but very tastful. We tried some seafood soup. It was a bit spicy but very fulfiling. It was cool to look at the churro machine. Churro and choloate was good but small portion. I gave this restaurant 3 stars because it was too expensive for me.
