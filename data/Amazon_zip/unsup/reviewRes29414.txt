YUMMY!!!! Best Thai food I've had in Chicago, plus cheapest most delicious eats in town. 2 apps, 2 meals, 1 soda, 30 bucks!  Love the spring rolls, crab rangoon's, curry. Everything is fresh and delicious. Service is prompt and courteous. It is BYOB and NO cork fee. Menus were changed so I expected prices to go up, they didn't, in fact some went DOWN! The fried banana dessert is delicious but I had reached a delightful sufficiency and didn't order it this time, nor my usual Thai Coffee to go. Convenient parking across the street or take the brown line to western, it's under the tracks. Most favorite place for a fresh meal without the rip-off prices.
