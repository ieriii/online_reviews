This place is more about the ambiance and side dishes than BBQ. The BBQ is sub-par, but all the other side dishes and food are great. Trust me, there's better BBQ in Chicago. I almost worked there as a chef, but I just wish the chefs focused more on BBQ-ing and leave all the side jobs to the prep cooks. I could go on about what I didn't like about how they BBQ, but I'll spare you the time. Go there if you're looking for a pleasant evening, good drinks, or a nice date spot, but don't expect good BBQ.
