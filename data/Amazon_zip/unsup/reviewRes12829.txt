I wasn't really here for dinner, I was here for the 1st Anniversary Party/Charity Benefit. I walk in and the place is so impressive! High ceilings, a giant wine cellar with aerial wine acrobats getting your wine, an AMAZING looking salad bar (better than Brazzaz or Fogo de Chao) and the upstairs are that was reserved for the party. $15 donation to Prevent Child Abuse America got you 3 drink coupons - we got the caipirinhas which were AMAZING and extremely strong. My favorite person ever who will remain unnamed to prevent his reputation from being tarnished was buzzed after one. I won't let him live it down I don't think :) The hors d'oeuvres were AWESOME. These little smoked salmon things but especially the steak, chicken and sausage bites. I can't get over how juicy the chicken was, or how good the sausage was, or how perfectly spiced the steak was. I have to come back here to eat for real sometime. I WILL get my money's worth.
