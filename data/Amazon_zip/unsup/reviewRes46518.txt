Had a great time here this weekend, I loved our no nonsense, witty server. Got the buffalo chicken wrap, which was good, if not a little soggy, but the taste and flavor was there. What I really enjoyed was the salad bar, full of options for any palette. Our server was nice enough to leave extra plates at the table for return trips to the salad bar. My dinner mate got the burger which he said was great, a nice testament to what they are known for. Overall it was a nice, relaxing atmosphere, maybe a little pricey, but a nice experience and was exactly what I needed.
