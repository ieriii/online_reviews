I was visiting my sister in Little Italy, and she's been anxiously waiting to see what was going in on the corner. It looked packed at 7pm on a Saturday, so we figured it was open and walked in. My sister was surprised to see Patrick, the manager of Francesca's - the excellent Italian restaurant across the street (her favorite). Apparently, this was their friends and family pre-opening party - and we were inadvertently crashing! But Patrick recognized my sister, greeted her with a hug and kiss, invited us in, and gave us a great table right in the front window. Lovely! The inside is beautiful - very rustic, with cool industrial touches. Seating is at the bar or high tables along the windows. The wine menu arrived tied to a giant wine bottle. As you can guess, the selection is all Italian. Our servers were wonderful too - just as friendly and welcoming as Patrick, and quick to bring water or clear an empty plate. The menu is an Italian version of tapas or small plates. We tried a fantastic salad with roasted tomatoes (still on the vine), with olive oil, pesto and burrata - a creamy mozzarella-like cheese. It was wonderful. We also shared the giant ravioli - a huge ravioli stuffed with creamed spinach and egg yolk, swimming in butter and dusted with parmesan. You have to share, b/c it's so rich. It was sinfully good. The only thing that could have made it better was maybe a little bread to soak up all that wonderful sauce and oil! We will definitely be back, when it officially opens!
