i know this place gets mixed reviews but i am a fan. i've visited three times now and while i've never been blown away i've always left happy. first time we had brunch out in the cute back patio. it was summer, and warm, and while our hummus appetizer was boring, the biscuits and gravy were great! the next two times i visited it was cold and rainy so we sat inside, which gave us a great old-school diner feel. i've always had pretty decent service, and last time i was there they were extremely attentive. my omnivore date loved the famous reuben. their "fake" meats are decent ("chicken" nuggets were yummy), but i went out on a limb last time and ordered the sweet potato black bean spinach quesadilla. delicious with salsa and guacamole and teese vegan cheese. i always order a side of their mac and cheese, even though i've had better it's pretty good and just such a novelty to be able to order vegan mac and cheese at a restaurant.  i've had some mediocre desserts but last time i had a raw pumpkin cheesecake that was so creamy! also--vegan hot chocolate with vegan whipped cream! yes, i like it.
