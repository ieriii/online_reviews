I wish they would not take reservations within a half hour to their kitchen closing. We arrived for our 9:30pm reservation. The host did not look at us at all. Not once. Somehow he managed to keep looking at his monitor while he felt our presence in front of him. We told him we had a reservation and gave him our name. Then - while still having not lifted his head to look at us - looked over at the girl who showed up next to him and instructed her to sit us. We sat at our table for a good 15 minutes at least. The place was nowhere near packed and there were a handful of servers just kinda standing around, looking around. Turned out that none of them was our server. Our server finally arrived and we ordered drinks and food: - Mixto (Chef's Selectio of 3 Cheeses - $16) - Datiles Con Almendras (Bacon-Wrapped Dates Stuffed with Almonds - $7) - Verdosa (Mixed Baby Greens with Green Asparagus, Avocado, Confit Cherry Tomatoes and Shaved Mahon Cheese - $12) When the dates came out, it was two sticks, each one with two bacon-wrapped dates. Definitely not worth the $7. Then another server came and put the cheese down on the table, then quickly walked away. That's out it was with all our dishes. We weren't even informed what the cheeses were. The Verdosa was probably the best dish but still nothing to write home about. All the while, we were watching as servers came around and cleared the tables of their dinnerware and set out what looked like glasses and plates for breakfast. Even another diner a couple of tables away from us we could tell was having a terrible experience. He came in after us and left before us. When his server came to pick up the bill, he looked around to see if the diner was still around somewhere, then shook his head. Looked like he got not tip.
