This place is amazing! I went based on a recommendation and I am so glad I went. Me and my fiance sat at the bar, which was perfect because the bartender was so knowledgeable helpful and friendly. Everything we tried on the menu was delicious and the wine selection is great. If you are into wine bars this is definitely a place worth checking out.
