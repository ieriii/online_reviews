So after waiting months to try this place out, I was finally able to satisfy my curiosity - yes, curiosity in this instance...killed the cat! In search of southern soul food, I made my way to Big Jones. I was immediately impressed with the decor & the atmosphere. After being seated, I was furthered impressed with the waiter (Andy) and attendant (Mike). However, I was not so impressed with the food or their selection (lack thereof).  I had the crab cakes, which were Ok and very (did I say extremely) small. They were paper-thin & I did my best to keep them from floating away. These "crab-crackers" were delicately placed on a pile of cubed potatoes; making them appear hearty (I got a hearty laugh at this magical feat). My "Voodoo Greens" were missing the conjured up spirit of spice, but the cornbread made the greens more palatable. Oh yeah, my friend had the $14.00 hamburger & fries...I've had better burgers at Culvers! At least the alcoholic drinks made me delusional enough to enjoy the experience...oh yeah & Andy...and Mike! So, you are definitely paying for the service (excellent), atmosphere & decor. As far as the food...I think I'll try the place next door.  Sorry Big Jones...you have to do better
