Tucked away in an unassuming location Sprout is a quiet triumph. It has a understated yet stately vibe with excellent contemporary downtempo music pulsing in to the night. The staff was very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and attentive, but never cloying or invasive. Every dish I had was incredible. The Octopus had a smooth unexpectedly firm yet buttery texture. The combination of the light sauce and the nicoise olives made it the most appetizing tentacle I've ever had. The champagne/raspberry palate cleanser was startlingly piquant and certainly shocked me into the next state of mind for my entree. I had the Short Rib plate. The meat itself is stewed to a saucy perfection with amazing pioppini mushrooms in a delicious gravy. BUT! ( ..and here is the whole reason I signed up and logged on to write this review ) It is served with these gnocchi-like dumplings that come off as a perfectly cooked potato.. Infused with truffle oil. They are AMAZING.. if I was offered an endless supply of these tasty morsels, I would surely founder. An excellent take on a grilled cheese sandwich is served before the final course. It is fun and tastes great, it is served with some sort of slightly sweet berry remoulade that is a perfect sharp counterpoint to the crispy cheesy grilled sandwich. It is also served with little touch of a paired white wine that cuts right through the heaviness. Finally, I had a Butternut Squash dessert with what I could only describe as a slightly crispy Gulab Jamun. Although sweet it also had a savory component that I couldn't put my finger on, just past nutmeg.. yes, it WAS curry! Who knew? All in all a perfect meal from an infinitely gracious genius who has hit his stride. I will be back frequently and will tell all of my discriminating friends.
