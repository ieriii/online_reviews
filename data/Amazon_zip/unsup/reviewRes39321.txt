Wow-o-wow! Tastiest lunch I have had in a long time!! We ordered: -English Pea Soup -Pork Rillette -Pork Belly BLT The English Pea Soup was fresh and sweet. Remember that english pea soup is not served hot. It's served cool. It had an elegant finish because of the truffle oil and lots of whole peas floating along the bottom. This dish is probably not for everyone but it was definitely good eats. The pork rillette was tasty tasty. I love rillette a lot. It's slow cooked pork and then formed into a spreadable form (i'm sure with the addition of some pork fat). Mmmmmm mmmmm goood. It was accompanied by a small green salad (with meier lemon vinaigrette), an apricot compote, whole grain mustard, and cornichons. Scrumptous! The pork belly BLT was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! First of all, its HUGE! Secondly the pork belly was seasoned (possibly brined) perfectly. There is a LOT of pork belly meat as opposed to just fat. Their secret sauce is an aioli of some kind that really made the whole thing meld together perfectly. We added a fried egg on top and that was really the BEST sandwich I have ever had. Don't forget to eat it with pickled onions and tomato fennel jam. Truly amazing! I literally used a fork and knife to eat this bad boy! So tasty!!! The beef-fat fries were equally flavorful and tasty, but the BLT was a homerun! Love love love it here. Superb eats, L&E! I'll be back.
