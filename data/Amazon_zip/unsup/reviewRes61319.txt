My original review has been removed, talk about censorship. My review was not a personal malicious attack on the owners but an honest review and MY HONEST OPINION of what I thought of their food. They apparently did not like what I had to say and had my review removed. What kind of people do this when I am giving my opinion. This place is awful and obviously not honest when they only want you to see the 4 and 5 stars but can not take constructive criticism. Food is flavorless. Tamales are nothing but mush no filling just one extra dry morsel of pork. The Cuban Sandwich, the Pork was dry and flavorless. Plantains were not ripened the day we went, I have had them there before and they were OK, white rice and black beans a Cuban staple, no salt no sofrito and they tasted as thought they were from a can, awful. Casa Central has better, authentic Caribbean food, everything is good there and for a better Cuban Sandwich head on out down the street to The Orbit Room, they have a great El Cubano Sandwich and MUCH MUCH BETTER white rice and black beans and they're not even Cuban. I don't know what everyones talking about... this place is awful.I seriously want to like this place because I love Cuban Food.... but I can't, it's a disappointment; and NOW that they had my original review removed because I gave them 1star well that's just plain shady. Grow up and accept constructive criticism.
