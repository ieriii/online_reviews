Classic Italian isn't my favorite of cuisines, but Sapori is tops! Huge portions so you can eat lunch and dinner the next day, the hostesses are as sweet as molasses (I miss my Angie!), attentive service and the prices are very reasonable. I also get their coupons in the mail, so if using them is your thing, I'm sure you can score an even better deal.  The lobster butternut squash ravioli is good, but the risottos and gnocchi are fantastic. Order some Chianti and grab a sidewalk table if the weather allows! We also ordered a few trays for a party and everyone raved about their appetizers and entrees. Good food, great value-- a return is imminent.
