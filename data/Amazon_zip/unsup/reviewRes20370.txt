I hadn't been to Coast in a few years, and I went there last night w/ a girlfriend. It was way better than I remembered. The hostess and our waitress were both actually pleasant. The edamame was delicious, and the sushi was fresh and plentiful. I appreciate that their maki rolls are not simply rice rolls w/ a hint of fish. Nope - they are full of fresh ingredients, with just the right amount (i.e. small) of rice. I had the salmon and avocado and the sunrise roll. Superb! The only downside is I noticed that the menu states their alcohol policy is one 6-pack of beer or one 750 ml bottle of wine limit per every 2 people. Last night was a Thursday, so my girlfriend and I were fine w/ 1 bottle of wine.  But if it had been a weekend, and four of us went together, we could easily down 3 (or 4?) bottles of wine.
