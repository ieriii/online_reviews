When I think of Mexican food, I think about mixed flavors, rice, beans, and tortillas. XOCO is absolutely the best Mexican food that I have had! I grew up vacationing in Mexico and really enjoy the cuisine. My wife is a huge fan of Rick Bayless, so we've been dying to try this restaurant. We were not disappointed and loved every dish that we've had. We had a chicken salad, a sandwich, and the churros. The flavors are clean and very tasty! All of it lived up to the long lines, which is sometimes down the block. Now whenever we are craving Mexican food, we are willing to stand in line and wait for the great food. Tip: If you don't want to stand in line and wait for a seat. Call in your order or take it to go.
