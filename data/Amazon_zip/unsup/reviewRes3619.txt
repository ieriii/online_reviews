Um yum. Two words. Buddha Bowl. (the original) These things are delicious. Filled with delicious veggies (mushrooms, spinach, carrots, zucchini, sprouts, cucumbers), rice and topped with a fried egg and then I usually add chicken. Their sauces are great. It comes with a spicier sauce... but I usually also get the milder version and mix the two... its a satisfying and flavorful meal! Since i like the buddha bowl here so much Ive never tried anything else, but I am always tempted to. It all looks and smells so good. Im sure the other menu items would be disappointing... Ive eaten in but it also does well for delivery too!
