Went here last Sunday night, the food was great, the portions very large and the space itself was quite beautiful. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that our server was not very nice. She was grumpy, seemed disinterested in our table and seemed annoyed that she had to serve us. She never once came over to ask if everything was ok. Very surprised that such a great restaurant would have such mediocre service.
