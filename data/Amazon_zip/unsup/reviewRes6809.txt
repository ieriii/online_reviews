I walked in with a flat stomach and walked out with a food baby. Appetizer: Crostini di Avocado - Enormous amount of fresh avocado accented with the perfect hint of citrus and cheese. Avocado fills you quicky though so this four piece appetizer is meant to be shared by 3+, assuming one of you 3 is an avocado die hard fan, like me. Salad: Instala Stella - not much to it. Fresh leaves and drenched in vinegrette Entrees: Milk and honey baby back ribs - "tender" does not do it justice. As soon as it meets the warmth of your mouth it melts. Then the meat and the juice start hugging and dancing on your tongue. I don't enjoy beef as much as seafood but the texture and flavors of this dish are the best treatment of beef that I have ever tried. Zuppa di Pesce - humongous amount of food. Amazing scallops and mussels. The clams shrimps, salmon and calamari IMHO are a bit overcooked. I like clams and shrimps dressed in light(er) sauce. And I prefer raw salmon. The sauce in this dish is divine though. Ask for spicy. The subtle kick complements the dish very well. Dessert: Panna Cotta - please get it. I had no idea what suspended creme meant but I was sold on chocolate and hazelnut. The consistence is like a mixture of custard and flan. We couldn't finish it but every bite was an euphoric experience. Glad that we saved room for this dessert. I am definitely coming back to try more on their menu. Food baby #2.
