Being a bit of a Japonais snob, I was somewhat reluctant to try this place, but after checking out their bar on Saturday and then dinner on Sunday, I may have to change my ways. The lychee martinis (don't get the divine, just the regular) are simply delicious and not too sweet. The oxtail potstickers were super tasty, and the entrees that I ordered (yes, I ordered two entrees) -- the cod and the pork bell -- were simply heaven. Both dishes were so tender and mouth-wateringly good. To top it off, I had a dessert known simply as "Ridiculous" and, indeed, it lived up to the name. Unbelievable drinks, sublime food and dessert, and mesmerizing decor... this place deserves 5 stars. I've been told that I need to come back for brunch to try their famous Indonesian Nasi Goreng. I can't wait.
