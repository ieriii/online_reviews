It has been awhile since I've written any reviews, but after dining at The Publican I felt like I had no choice.  At first glance inside the restaurant, it was packed!! Packed with happy (at least they appeared to be), well dressed, and down to earth talkative folks. I absolutely loved the environment!! Between 2, we ordered pork rinds (ehhhh), pate (tasted like mushed up spam), sweatbread (EPIC!!!) , salt cod pasta (A-Amazing), oysters (had it cause I wanted something rare), & blood sausage (never again). Not to forget the wonderfully smooth & earthy Cab that our waiter suggested. I would say dinner was a success, simply because of the sweetbread and the vino. =)  One word of advice, call for reservations. cheerio!
