We were visiting Chicago for several days from out of state. Eating out all the time can be really expensive but we wanted at least one great sit down meal. I highly recommend Wildfire. It is a moderately priced alternative to Gibson's or Morton's that will not disappoint. I'll start with the food. Our party split two appetizers. A small thin sausage pizza and a goat cheese dip of some sort. The goat cheese was so-so. The pizza was very good. Next was a greek salad. Very tasty with a nice mix of feta cheese and garbanzo beans. Highly recommend the filet trio for your main dish. You can try their different crusts that come with their steaks. I went with the horseradish, mushroom, and parmesan cheese. Terrific dish. We split a piece of key lime pie for desert. The service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and Chicago. Visiting here at the beginning of our vacation was very helpful. He made recommendations for pizza as well as directions for places we were visiting. I appreciated that he took his time to answer any questions we had. The prices. You can eat a very good meal with salad, appetizer, potato and steak and even desert for just under $100 for two. This is w/o drinks. We had came from a nearby bar just prior so we skipped drinks here. Great meal for a great price.
