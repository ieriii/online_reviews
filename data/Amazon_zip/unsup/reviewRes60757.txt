Great addition -- a place that sits on the line between Edgewater and Loyola Park (err...Rogers Park). Awesome beer offerings and decent wine list. The best food options are the simpler (American) dishes. For example, don't get the Duck Confit instead go for the Roasted Chicken. It's a really pleasant place. Live music. Friendly bartenders and hostesses. In short, it's definitely worth a visit.
