Recently came back here for my sister, mom's and my annual RJ Grunts and zoo lights trip. We did the salad and soup bar and had some seasonal beer on tap. When we first got there we took a seat at the bar to wait for our table, we didn't know what to try from tap so the bartender gave us a sample of something he thought we would like. He was right, shortly after waiting we were sat and our server was super friendly and knowledgeable. Never have a bad experience here, besides always hitting my head on the salad bar sneeze guard! But that is probably just my own ditziness.
