Just stayed at this hotel on a business trip while in Chicago. Excellent Hotel!! Extremely well designed and decorated with impeccable service. The amenities were really nice including pool and work out room. The restaurant and bar was really nice and great food. Location is really nice and easy access to all the downtown Chicago hot spots.
