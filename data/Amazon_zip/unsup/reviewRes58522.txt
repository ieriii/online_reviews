visited Chicago for the holidays. wanted to go to frontera. heard a lot about it. alex g,'s best thing she ever ate. yes, the steak was very good, but chicago has MEAT,,,real meat. my only complaint was the staff. they work at a hugely popular restaurant, but seem to take no pride in it. no smiles, no 'thank you, no fun. cheer up, guys. if you don't like your job, stay home. you turn people off.p.s. had no problem getting in. don't be afraid of all the hard to get reservations hype. they know how to pack 'em in.
