So, it looks like I am the only Yelper who doesn't love this place. It is not that I dont get "it"--I dig Italian food the further it gets away from Italian-American as much as the next Italian kid--but they just don't nail. Now, it isn't that the ingredients weren't good--they were great. It wasn't that the wine list wasn't interesting--it was. It was the combination of things. Every dish was extremely under-salted--you need salt to enhance the flavor folks. The beet and ricotta ravioli was tasty--only after said table salt application. The appetizer selection of 8 things left a lot to be desired. Now let's talk about service: We never got bread/breadsticks or olives. Our wine arrived after our appetizers. The service just seemed rushed the whole time. The 6-top next to us was so close that every time the server was working with them his a$$ was on my friends shoulder--and then he would touch her and say "sorry". Not what I was expecting--prolly not a return visit in store for me.
