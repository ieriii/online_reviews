I'm not here to start trouble, but I didn't enjoy being here at all. I had no idea about the no talking rule, or I wouldn't have come. If you like Jazz, poetry and spoken word entertainment, than this place really is for you. It's just not for me. The area around the bar isn't good, music and entertainment I don't enjoy, plus limited interaction with friends equals what I think hell would be like. (For me). But if you enjoy it, more power to you! Have fun!
