So my mother and I had a girl's day out.... Henri Matisse exhibit, which was fabulous in it's own right, at the Art Institute and brunch at The Gage.. The Gage exceeded all expectations.. we made resos at http://www.opentable.com which is a must! We arrived just in time for our reservation and the place was packed! We were sat at a very nice little table for 2 in a more quiet area of the place. The volume level in the bar was rising higher and higher due to the World Cup being on TV. Our server was very pleasant... went over the menus and took a cocktail order.. an awesome glass of French Rose for me and a nice spicy Bloody Mary for my mom. My mother surprised me by ordering the Eggs Benedict that was served w/ a spicy hollandaise sauce (She never orders Eggs Benedict), a side Rashers (Roasted potatoes and Brie cheese... yum) and fresh fruit. I ordered the special sandwich of the day (Which the server described beautifully).. prosciutto, fresh mozzarella cheese, arugula & stone ground mustard served on a beautiful baguette with fresh cut fries... omg. All of my favorite things in the world! When we received our meals our table fell silent due to the fact that we were just truly loving our meals... oh was it good. The only problem that we found.. and this is way minimal.. the bathrooms were down this stairway with no proper signage... you could get lost down there ie the private party room.. which looked pretty cool (I would have an event there). So like I said the problem is ultra small! I will surely come back with my husband... and enjoy one of the many craft beers they have on tap!
