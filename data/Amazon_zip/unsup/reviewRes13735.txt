Seriously, Glenn's was a HUGE disappointment. Yelpers come on 4 & 5 stars?? The service was slow and amateurish. The Oysters Rockerfeller were edible but not that's about it. My wife's Scallops and my salad were decent but present no reason to return. Sadly once again the execution is not up to the concept.
