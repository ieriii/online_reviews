OH MY GOODNESS... Where to start. The location for those that want to be in the middle of things - well, you're at the wrong end of Michigan for that. On the positive side you definitely will get a workout from your walks.  Even though the lobby is wonderful, there is constantly a group of picketers right in front of the enterence.  Our room was small, and ancient., and to to add insult to injury, the toilet was not attached to the floor....I'M NOT KIDDING!!!.  The bathtub backed up and the water pressure was pitiful. The solution....put is in another room, that had no view. wonderful.  We booked online and the price of $129 a night was ridiculous...NEVER AGAIN.  One bright spot though, was the small smoothy place one block before the hotel...NOW THAT WAS WORTH THE WALK!!! My suggestion - find someplace else to stay.
