Came here on a date and sat at a table in the lounge area. We each had a red wine flight and shared a cheese flight. Both were quite good. I was more surprised by the not so foo-foo feel of it.  This place definitely deserves a return visit to explore the menu further....just make sure you don't have to drive home.
