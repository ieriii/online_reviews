Service was some of the worst I have ever experienced. He took over 20 minutes for our waiter to come to our table once seated and he then ignored our table and surrounding tables the rest of the afternoon. We went for the Sunday brunch special - $25 and the drink special - $8. The deal sounds awesome until you realize that you will only get 2 or 3 drinks within 2 hours because the service is so awful. Once complaining to the manager they comped one of our meals, which was much appreciated, but not enough to warrant another visit. I give this place 2 stars because the food was good and that is their only saving grace.
