my friend and i accidently happened to go to this restaurant and were pleasantly surprised. i love sweet crepes that include fruit and nutella. they had a wide variety and you can create your own so it allows for more flexibility than the regular chocolate and strawberry combo. i think if i was in the neighborhood i would go back again for breakfast. tasty food for a reasonable price.
