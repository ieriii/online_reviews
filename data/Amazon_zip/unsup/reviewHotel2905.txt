Got a room for about $95 with tax for a night and it had a great view of Navy Pier and the lake. The bed was comfy but the room was a bit hot but I could open my windows and enjoy the city sounds while taking a nap. For the price I got off of Priceline, it was a good deal.  I did think a gun battle was going on around 7pm but turns out it was fireworks. Needless to say, it's pretty safe around the hotel area although it is a little less populated than staying on Michigan ave. The lobby area has a good view of a river or canal that is relaxing.
