Let me preface this by saying I've been going here for about 5 years, so take it as you may. I feel that the Art is probably one of the best Stuffed Pizza joints in Chicago. However, I feel that success has hurt the quality of food in recent years. You pretty much have to order carry out to get the best tasting pizza, because delivery times murder the crust. (Don't order delivery unless you have a spare 2 hours) Another personal gripe of mine is their sausage: The grey, yes grey, spherical kind that I could probably get at Little Ceasar's. Why? Why is every other topping off the chain, and you blow the simple topping of sausage? I won't take stars away about it, because overall, the place is above average. Just don't expect REAL sausage. However, if you are a carnivore like me, go for the meaty delight stuffed pizza: It's like eating meat pudding! If you haven't been here, you need to go to see that it destroys Gino's, Uno, and Malnati's in the stuffed category. However, don't even touch their thin crust!
