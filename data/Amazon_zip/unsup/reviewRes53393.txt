1500 reviews and a 4 1/2 average? All Star Hall Of Fame status!This place is worth the hype and well worth the wait in line!Everything I have ever eaten here is AMAZING I am glad I stopped by while visiting Chicago. The owner was very friendly and glad to (briefly) talk baseball even though there was a line around the block (for serious!)
