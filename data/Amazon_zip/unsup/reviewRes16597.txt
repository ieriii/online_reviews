Excellent food, service and variety. The menu has soo much to choose from and the service is amazing! I love the inside of the restaurant! It is decorated with lots of Indian flavor and the music also compliments the ambiance! I love Indian food and I was so happy with the taste and service when I went for dinner. The menu is huge, but the waiter happily helped me with any questions and explanations. The prices are very resonable and the portions are large. They bring out fresh naan right when you sit down and it is sooo good. The sauce that comes with the naan is also very good! This is a must go to place for good indian!
