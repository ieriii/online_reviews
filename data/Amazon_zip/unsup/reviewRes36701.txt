Absolutely awful service. My friends and I are probably some of Meli's most routine customers. I was quite surprised with the level of service we received last Tuesday. The server was rude and demanded to know what we wanted to order as soon as she put the menus down. We asked for soup, and she switched the orders and spilled soup on one of us. No apology. Then she said "What are you having for your second course" - When a friend joked "How do you know we're having a second course," instead of laughing, she said "I never said you had to eat." When we ordered a panini to diffuse the situation, we received more of the same attitude. Soon after, the manager came by and seated someone right next to us (in an empty restaurant) and gave us one of her classic dirty looks that other Yelpers have mentioned. We left, told the manager what happened, and were asked to pay the bill in full (even the panini that hadn't come out yet). I know the food is fantastic, but this place needs to realize that good customer service is still important when your popular - and that hiring a real manager (It's a family run restaurant and the teenage daughter "runs" the show) who probably be a good move. With great food, it's too bad that neither my friends nor I will be coming here ever again.
