I had brunch here with a few other couples. They've got a very comfortable area near the bar to wait or have drinks at. Anyways, the place was very nice and the service was super friendly. Our server Katherine was very upbeat, attentive, and sweet. I ordered the chilaquiles with chorizo. At $10, it was priced well for brunch and it tasted delicious. They did first serve it to me with eggs over easy which I couldn't handle but they brought it back with new eggs. Chorizo was delicious with IMO the perfect amount of saltiness (that is to say, much less than typically found in chorizo).
