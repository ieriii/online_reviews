This is far and away my favorite pizza joint in Chicago. Gino's and Uno's are ok once a year or so, but this place is a monthly staple for me. I generally have the Plain (no mozzarella cheese) with Pepperoni, and it's awesome every time. For those who aren't big cheese fans, Piece will be a refreshing change. Also, they're brewing a beer right now called Dark & Curvy... If you get the chance, try it out; a great inadvertent banana flavor makes this beer. I've met the owner a couple times -- Bill -- and he's always a friendly, welcoming, conversational dude. Definitely check this place out. You won't be sorry.
