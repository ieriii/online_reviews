This place is amazing, I ate here twice, dinner and then lunch a day or two later. We ordered so much food, a huge variety for dinner, and there wasn't anything that wasn't amazing tasting. Everything was perfect. Then we came for lunch and I ordered the "Wild Boar Sloppy Joe, Crispy Sage and Onion, Pickled Jalapeno" it was fantastic to say the least. The food was great, the wait staff while young and hip were also very very friendly and helpful. The ambiance was great as well.
