I've decided that this places needs a new name. It should be called "Happy Belly," because when you leave, your belly sure is happy! My husband and I are not Korean, but we felt very comfortable here and received good service. We ordered the beef kai bi (about $19) and spicy pork kai bi (about $17), and were not disappointed! The meat is simply melt-in-your-mouth fantastic. The banchan was incredibly generous (we counted and there were 19 small plates!), and their was complimentary soup brought before the meal (kind of like a miso soup with tofu and cut up veggies - spicy and very yummy). All I know is - I may not know what half of what I ate was, but I know it was YUMMY! Plus, it's always a good sign when we walk into a Korean food place and see lots of other Korean families eating there. Just a note that this place uses a coal fired grill (some use gas cook top grills), which I've read is more authentic. Another note is that they serve sushi, and seem to have a sushi bar next door that is connected to the Korean bbq place. My belly is thanking me for this trip!
