How super random that like Melissa V, I too was at Publican on Sunday while visiting from the Bay area for the Thanksgiving weekend. So please see her review on the food as I agree - FISH was fab, but we' liked everything. Unlike Melissa, we only ordered 1 prix-fixed menu and then ordered other stuff like the pork rinds and oysters. Well worth it as they both were tasty add ons. The guy from our food tour said their menu was limited on Sundays so beware. Other randomness - apparently it's getting rave reviews on the food front in Chi-town, I tried to Open Table a reservation and only got 2:30pm on Sunday which I ended up cancelling only to get our concierge to call them and get a 8pm reservation that same night. They were open at 7 and 7:30 as well. When we got there, the place was 1/2 empty, was it superficial hype to limit the reservations? Things to know - if you are going by cab, the place is not walking distance to any hotel. Ambiance is great with all the pictures of Wilburs around, and the tables on the side that look like pig pens. Bathroom rocks and service is good!
