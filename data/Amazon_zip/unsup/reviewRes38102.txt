Do you like beer? AT ALL? If so, this spot is an absolute must. I took some out-of-towners and fellow beer lovers here last night after getting recommendations from friends and reading the rave reviews and was not disappointed. An eclectic collection of 200 beers are available for your drinking pleasure and I will have to go back to try the food, it looked yummy. Yes, it was a very crowded place, so be prepared to deal with that - it was out of pure dumb luck that we managed to nab a table. But like I said, if you are even remotely fond of beer, consider this your mecca and you must plan a pilgrimage, soon. :)
