I wanted to like this place because I had heard great things, but we did not have nearly the experience we hoped for. Service was pretty bad - we were told it would be a 25 minute wait for our table, and it took nearly an hour. Then even once we were seated, we waited...and waited...and waited. I was starting to think no one was going to come to our table. Once we finally got an order placed, the appetizer arrived pretty quickly. But then for the entrees, we waited...and waited...and waited. Once the food finally arrived, it was a huge disappointment. I ordered the duck reuben sandwich, and the bread seemed like it had been dipped in oil. It was so greasy I could not eat it. My boyfriend got the tilapia sandwich, which he said was pretty bland. Our server didn't seem at all concerned with the fact that we barely touched our meals - she didn't even ask us how things were. While this place has a fantastic beer selection, and the mussels we had for our appetizer were decent, we won't be going back.
