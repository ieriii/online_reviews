When, a friend insisted we go down to Pilsen for his absolute favorite Mexican place, I was skeptical. I doubted that any Mexican food could be so different from the places in my neighborhood that they'd be worth the drive. I was wrong. The food here is so flavorful. I could not get over how something so delicious comes out of a place that looks just like any other mexican place in the city. I had the best steak fajitias I've ever had here. I have not stopped thinking about eating here since I went. YUM!!!
