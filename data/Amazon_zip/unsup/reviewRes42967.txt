Went here Friday night after hearing a rave review from a friend. Obscure location right behind the Merchandise Mart but easy enough to get to, huge space, great lighting and decor (or lack thereof...i appreciate the simplicity), fun atmosphere and fabulous drinks. My bf had a dirty martini while i enjoyed some cocktail with St. Germaine, vodka, and something orange (sorry, i forget the name). it was served in a mini cocktail glass with a mini carafe on the side for refills - so cute! the bartenders were super serious "mixologists" - i haven't ever seen someone shake a cocktail shaker for that long for just one drink. they do serve up some tasty libations, so cheers to the shaking! I can't wait to go back here to try some food. The main thing i'm a little confused about...this is more of a restaurant than a bar, yet it's called Gilt Bar...seems misleading.
