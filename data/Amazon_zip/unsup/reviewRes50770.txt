Ate with a group of seven on New Years Day 2011. The andouille hash was bad. Shrimp and Grits looked like the best dish. Cheese grits were a 75/25 ratio of cheese to grits. Biscuits and gravy consisted of bulimia-friendly biscuits covered in a thick, flavorful white gravy with a vegetarian serving of sausage. These were decent, but I've had better. They had one bottle of Tabasco sauce in the restaurant. It was shared between three or four tables with the wait staff moving it back and forth as folks ate. An all too common mistake in restaurants. Bottled sauces have long shelf lives. Buy a few more bottles and a few more brands. They're about $2 apiece.
