Once my favorite restaurant, I would have given it 10 stars. It used to provide really nutritious and delicious food with an abundance of greens and vegetables. And a nice home-cooked feeling that only comes from cooks who eat that way. Now, the food is mediocre at best...with a heavy reliance on seitan, which is wheat gluten, the primary culprit for those who are gluten sensitive. When busy, the diner is noisy, though the outdoor patio is nice enough. The staff have been and still are very friendly and accomodating.
