Innovative flavors, jaw-dropping preparations, beautiful presentations. I was, but shouldn't have been, surprised that in 2006 Gourmet magazine rated it the number ONE restaurant in America (http://www.epicurious.co). Some of the dishes are created from the much-lauded "sous vide" cooking which explains some of the unique textures presented in the dishes. The kitchen hums with an unexpectedly quiet and efficient energy. I was unfortunate enough to have only the 12 course, and wish I had room (and money) for the marathon 24. Remember, though, a "course" can be as small as a bite-sized morsel (for one example, think Gobstopper on crack). Service was excellent. Case in point: my wife left her butter knife askew on the edge her bread plate and a waiter -- thinking the knife might clatter onto the table -- swooped in to adjust the knife to keep it on the plate! Make reservations and come prepared for an exquisite experience. Upsides: - The best in high-end cuisine. Period. Downsides: - Expensive, but you get what you pay for. - Might be intimidating for the non-foodie.
