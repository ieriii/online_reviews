I went here last week for a friends birthday and was amazed at how great the food and service was. After hearing many people/magazines talk about this restaurant I was expecting the typical hot spot, crowded, expensive and food that was soo. Sunda was just the opposite. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. Each dish that was ordered had great flavor and a great menu of drinks to go along with it. Because it was my friends birthday they gave us a free appetizer and dessert. They definitely know how to treat their customers well. We will be going back again soon.
