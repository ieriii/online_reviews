I had an all around GREAT experience at Bad Apple recently. Their beer list is impressive. We had a couple seasonal beers on draft that were excellent, and even tried mead for the first time and liked it. We started with a charcuterie plate that was really great. The burgers we had were excellent too. My wife even said that the burgers rivaled Kuma's in her opinoin, and I would tend to agree. The service was excellent; they were very attentive, but not pushy at all. And the price was very reasonable. And lastly, the decor was very nice - original artwork with animal skulls is always a plus in my book. I will definitely be back.
