Excellent!!! Always an awesome meal. Have been going here for about 12 or 13 year now and have never had a bad experience. I've also been to several other locations including a few in the burbs and have always had great food and excellent service. If you're looking for great, authentic italian food look no further. The locations on Taylor and Bryn Mawr are equally good as well
