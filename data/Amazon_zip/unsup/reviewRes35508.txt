Roast Duck Soy sauce chicken Barbecue pork Roast pig (lechon) Steamed Chinese broccoli Long has this establishment been the go to for the P - Units who would drag me and my sister along with them as they ordered the above items. I remember when I was young staring at the duck, and various other sides of pork hanging in the window. Now it is I who drags along my own kids to stand in line (and stare at the duck, pork, and squid hanging in the window) to order the above items listed. Many other items are offered from the printed menu and the menu which hangs above the counter, but these are the only items I have learned to eat since back in the day my parents would order. I have only been as far as the carry out/ register area. You order your delicacies and wait for the items to be packaged and bagged. The place has a restaurant seating area, but I can not rate because I have not experienced the dining area.  The place is closed on Thursdays. Weekends are really BUSY. I suggest sending in the significant other with the order while you window shop along Argyle/ Broadway. Train station elevated tracks are right above. Street parking is hit or miss and metered.
