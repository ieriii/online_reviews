When we arrived, we waited about 20 minutes or so for a table. The place kind of felt 'cafeteria like', but as soon as we sat down, we had water, along with chips & salsa on our table. Between the 4 of us, we had no problem polishing off 2 baskets of the chips. Shortly after, they came by with some beans & pork along with a tortilla. (All of these items are FREE!!) Needless to say, we did not order an appetizer, just the main course. I had the shrimp fajitas which were wonderful! They give you tons of shrimp and veggies to make 3-4 big tacos! Others at my table ordered the Chicken fajitas, Tamales and Tacos de Sabinas. Needless to say, we did not leave anything on our plates!  Having a liquor store right next to this place is a plus!
