There are one million green laser lights on All.The. Time. at this bar. You may have a seizure here. They also have a smelly smoke machine, not what you want on while eating. And music is way too loud. God help you if you don't like the band that happens to be playing on the nine million tv screens. Each concert lasts two hours.
