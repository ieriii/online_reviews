Hopleaf has a great selection of beers (mainly Belgians) and wonderful food. They also have a sign that says "absolutely no children" or something like that. That is my favorite part about it. Sorry parents, but don't bring your kids to the bar anymore. I'd rather have smoking back than see your dumb baby in a stroller in a bar. Beautiful space, nice people, good beer. (No babies)
