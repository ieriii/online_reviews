This place serves delicious food, and is a great less-expensive and veggie-friendly option. The first time I had Ethiopian food I was not that into it. This time, we skipped the meat and ordered the vegetarian messob for two and I loved every bite! Although, there was so much food, and the injera seems to expand in your stomach, so the two of us could have been ok with the messob for one. My favorites--the lentils, legumes, chickpeas, and collard greens. I can't wait to go back!
