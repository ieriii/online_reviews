Extremely small, quaint Mexican joint that has killer margaritas on Thursday evenings (get there early for a table). The staff is extremely friendly as well. The food is average Mexican, I would say a bit over priced compared to what you would find in Pilsen due to quality--but this is Lake View. The tamales are some of the best I've ever had and would make a good snack (even though Mexican tamales have nothing on Central/South American tamales).
