I don't love or hate this place. It's just okay. The atmosphere is fun and hip, and the beer selection and oysters are awesome, but it's overpriced, the portions are tiny, and I think the restaurant takes itself a bit too seriously. I mean why did I have to pay $6 for a plate of 5 tiny radishes, a cup of butter and a spoonful of salt?
