I really wanted to love this place and give at least 4 stars on my way into the restaurant. The Organic aspect is cool. As soon as you walk past the outdoor seating and see the parking lot there is an herb garden in the landscaping outside and on the roof. The vibe inside is earthy and warm and the people seem to be genuine and believers in the cause for homegrown and local food.  Now for the food.   We ordered the sweet potato fries and the calamari and both were delicious and tasty and I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes. The special gnocchi was fresh and garlicky. BUT the pork belly dinner I ordered seemed like it was sitting a while. It was good but was on the lukewarm side and slightly tough. The cut was good and was obviouly a high quality meat. Maybe I was just hoping the whole meal would be as good as the hype. i will recommend and will definitely try again. Very kid/family friendly.
