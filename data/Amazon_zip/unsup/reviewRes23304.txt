The food was ok... Not the best I have had in Greek town; but not bad by any means either. The service was fine and the wait staff was friendly. I went for lunch with some clients and had the grilled lamb skewers. They were cooked well and lean; but the flavor could have used a lot of help. Since it is close to work, I will probably continue to go there..
