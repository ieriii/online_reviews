I have no idea why people love this place so much. Arrogant bouncer on some type of power trip was not a good first impression. My friend got there before me and asked if she was at Violet Hour, and he told her that there's a purple light right there (or something stupid like that). There's no sign that says it's Violet Hour. When I got there, he was rude to a customer that walked by trying to find the place as well. Overpriced drinks. Uncomfortable chairs. Weird music that made me feel like I was in an antique shop in the slums. Yes, it was so weird that you cannot help but laugh; it was distracting. This place is so dark I had to use my cell phone (for light) to read the menu. Oh wait, I'm not allowed to have my cell phone out according to their rules. STFU. I must admit this place would be a good place for a date. It's a bit intimate, but too romantic for my taste.
