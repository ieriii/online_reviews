So apparently this is one of THE places for Breakfast.  I originally went here, because I heard about it from Diners Drive-ins and Dives on Food network.  It was good, but not my best pick for brunch. If you live near the Montrose Brown Line stop seriously get up and go though. Because it is a very pleasant atmosphere with cereal abounding.  I was disappointed with their eggs benedict... its a tough dish so I'll give them that, my friend had a scramble special and it was delicious. So use your best judgment and I'd say this is definitely worth the trip for some fresh orange juice, coffee and a lovely atmosphere. This place is known for its seafood so I'd be game for going back to try that for dinner sometime.
