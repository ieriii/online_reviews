The Violet Hour is the good looking guy in your high school art class that you develop a crush on partially because you think no one else has noticed him... Only to find out that EVERYONE finds him attractive... and then he loses his appeal. In seriousness, The Violet Hour has fabulous drinks and reminiscent of having tea with the Mad Hatter but if you hate waiting and hype then it's not for you.
