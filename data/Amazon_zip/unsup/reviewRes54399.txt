I've never heard of caramelized crust until trying Peqoud's. Woww, if they sold the crust alone, I'd pay. I'm not usually a big fan of deep dish pizzas. It's been a few months since I've dined here, but I remember that the service was good and quick, my cup of joe never went empty. I'll have to make another round here soon.
