This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Hell, if Shakira loves it, it has to be good, right?? "Seorita, feel the conga, let me see you move like you come from Colombia"... anyway... this is a great place for some SoAm food, BYOB, and a big group of friends. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth it. I normally get the steak with plantains and eggs on top. Works for me. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!
