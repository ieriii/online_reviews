This is a pretty cool hotel... the room was hip and ultra modern, albeit a little small. Comfortable bed, and free wifi... of course if you have that I'm generally pretty pleased. Two small complaints... the first time I tried to shower there the water was ice cold... they sen up someone and it was fixed soon enough. And the massage I had there was a mix of relaxation and pain when the therapist managed to find the most uncomfortable parts of my back to focus attention on (also there is no shower for the spa, so you will walk back to your room covered in massage oil). All in all it's a good place to stay if you can find a deal on a room, but I'm not sure I'd want to pay full price.
