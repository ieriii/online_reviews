We stopped here after a movie at the Logan Theatre. We were told it would be an hour and a half wait for a table for two, and I was not too keen on waiting that long, but we got seats at the bar fairly quickly and decided to eat there. The hostess told us our table was ready shortly after that, but we stayed at the bar. So their estimated wait was about twice as long as what it turned out to be. We both had the house special hot toddy, and it was warm and lemony delicious. The bar is well-stocked, with what appears to be a strong bias for whiskeys, and a nice selection of tap and bottled brews. The menu reveals Longman & Eagle to be an interesting gastropub, with plenty of meat selections, but also a fair number of fish and veg items. We started with the pretzel with Welsh rarebit, a cheesy mustardy sauce I had never before tried. Very tasty. The pretzel was warm, crispy on the outside, and unsalted. I moved on to the sunchoke bisque with scallops. The bisque was quite creamy and delicious, but I did have one problem with it. It was a fairly small portion served in an oversized bowl, and the bowl very obviously cooled the bisque before it made it to my seat at the bar. It was warm in the center, but quite lukewarm near the edges. A bowl that size containing a smaller portion of soup, should have been preheated, in my opinion. I think this was a fairly amateur mistake, and one easily corrected. Hopefully they will see this review and do just that. Other than that, I loved the place. The service was excellent. it did get fairly crowded and noisy at the bar, but that's the way it goes at a hot new spot on a Friday night. The ambiance is everything a Logan Square gastropub should be, and maybe even more. I'll be back for sure!
