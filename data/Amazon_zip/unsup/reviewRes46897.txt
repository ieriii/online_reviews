Went here last night for dinner with some ladyfriends. Shitty location for me, but I really enjoyed it. Especially the parking lot. I was surprised by the decor of the restaurant - very swanky, very cool. The food was interesting and tasty - I had a hummus plate for starter, pesto pasta dish for entree and the banana bread pudding for dessert. All were great, but portions are HUGE so some self-control is needed...self-control that I do not have. Prices were about what I expected, and pretty reasonable.  Our waitress wasn't very exciting. She seemed to be annoyed with us for some reason. Who knows. Otherwise, great place, will be back!
