Pequod's night staff completely made up for the turd burglar who gave me bad service in the daytime. My friend and I were allowed to sit and eat at the bar when the restaurant was packed. Our pizza was baked in a flash, and the beers were cold and frequently poured. Places like this help restore my faith in Chicago.
