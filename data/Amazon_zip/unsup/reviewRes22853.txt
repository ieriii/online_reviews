Best greek food in Chicago! Their cuisine comes closest to authetic greek food as you can get. The spinach pie and tzakiki with pita is delicious. The waiters - who are greek btw - appear standoff-ish at first, but once you get talking, they are very pleasant. I have never had to wait more than 10-15 minutes, even on a weekend, but its amazing how full they always are.
