I've been to Indie about five times and had a great experience every time. It's a nice atmosphere and we've always had good service. The food is high quality and a good value. I usually get the Thai dishes here- the pad thai with tofu and pad see ew are both great. They have a lunch special which is a really good deal where you get an appetizer, soup or salad and entree. My whole family loves this place!
