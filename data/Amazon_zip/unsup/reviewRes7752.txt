The food here was great! But, I am giving it 3 stars for the service. We were greeted and seated promptly, but we waited ages for the waiter to take our order. We could even see him standing at the bar chatting with the other waiters while we sat there, menus closed ready to order. It was a Wednesday night, so they were not packed, he was not busy with other customers. Then while waiting for our food and during the course of us eating, the hostess and the owner/manager (I'm guessing?) proceeded to rearrange about 6 tables right next to us. I have no idea why because no big party was coming in, it just seemed like they wanted something to do so they pulled and pushed and moved all these tables into various configurations. For like an hour. ??? But I have to say, the food was delicious. I had the pumpkin and butternut squash ravioli, which is a fav of mine to get when its on the menu and I have to say this was the best one I have had yet. So great food, not so great atmosphere/service.
