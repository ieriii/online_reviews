Loved this hotel. It is very pristine and clean. Everything in the place is white, so it HAS to be clean! I was in Chicago to work at Lollapalooza and the James Hotel was a great place to relax after working in the humid heat all day. I cranked the a/c in my room so high that I was shivering under the covers and it was amazing.
