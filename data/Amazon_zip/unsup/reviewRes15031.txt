Everything it's cracked up to be. i had a mint julip and it was perfect, down to the pewter cup. Mellody had a wonderful better martini with lemon and fresh berries. not to mention, the gnochi was indeed wonderful, slightly crisp and delicious carmelized onions. the olives were wonderful too. its a lot of fun, the ambiance it different and you have to let yourself go with it. but in the end you'll have a good time.
