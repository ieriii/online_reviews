I have been to 90 miles twice in the past month and both times I really enjoyed what I ate. The first time was for dinner where the girlfriend and I split some empanadas and a cubano sandwich. Both were excellent. The second time was for lunch and I ordered a Media Noche sandwich which was also excellent. I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are in the area. The only thing that I didn't enjoy was the Cafe Con Leche which of course can only be made correctly at a little place on Milwaukee. If you don't know what I am talking about just check my other reviews. They now have table service on the weekends which is better than the order at the counter then wait for someone to bring out your food.
