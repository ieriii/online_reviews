This is a great spot, I only wish I wasn't traveling by myself when I came here. Luckily there's a bar area so it's pretty easy to eat on your own, but the menu is a lot of small plates so coming in a group would be a lot better. There is pretty good seating for groups too - high-top tables for 6-8 people. Everything sounded good, but I just went with the prosciutto balls to start (which were good, but not amazing) and the turkey leg, which was really good. I love lentils and that was the side for the turkey leg, but it wasn't really what I was expecting -- just a few lentils and they seemed until cooked - they were sort of scattered along the leg, not an actual side of lentils. There was a good selection of wines, but I felt like the prices of many were steep, $14+. I had one for $9 and it was pretty good. The service was fast in the beginning, and the food came really fast, but the waitress sort of disappeared at the end and had to track her down. Overall, a good spot, and super crowded, even on a Monday night.
