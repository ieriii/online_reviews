This one had been on my brunch to-do list for awhile. The menu had so many options, I could have gone with several items. I knew what to order, and my meal absolutely trumped the boyfriend's. He had an omelet with jambalaya and said it was lacking a "kick." He understandably thought it would be spicy and flavorful and didn't get that. He also had an order of blueberry pancakes that needed about three times the amount of blueberries, but they were pretty good. I had the crab cakes with over-easy eggs which were so delicious. The breakfast potatoes were also awesome. I was expecting more from the corn muffin, knowing it was made in-house, but it was still pretty good. Overall, my meal deserved a 5, his a 3, so we'll compromise at 4. Service was excellent, no wait at 12:00 which is a requirement for me, parking was plentiful on the side streets, this is a solid brunch spot.
