The food is very good but what keeps me going back is that the service is phenominal. It doesn't matter who your servier is, because all of them will stop by your table to ask if you need anything. The bartender even stops by the table to make sure you're happy with your drinks. They really care about their restaurant. I've seen waiters washing the windows when they are slow.
