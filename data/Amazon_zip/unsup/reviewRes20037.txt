After visiting the museum, my friend and I went to get dinner at The Gage just across the street. I'd only been to The Gage once and it was just for an hour-long cocktail reception, so I was excited to give it a try. We split Vindaloo Mussels with toast, long toast, and Chips (Fries) with Curry Gravy. Oh, and we also got Duck Fat Nuts for an appetizer. I don't know exactly what this means. They just tasted like nuts. I liked the vindaloo mussels, but with the curry gravy, it was too much curry. We ended up getting ketchup for the fries.
