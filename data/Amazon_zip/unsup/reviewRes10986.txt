Piece offers a unique style of pizza here in Chicago which is simply delicious. Their beers are handcrafted on location and cater to all shades of drinkers (i personally prefer the camel toe or dysfunction ale). As far as the atmosphere goes piece has more flat screens than I care to be surrounded by but are usually muted and the staff is really good about changing channels to what you want (go red wings). Ryan the server is excellent and once did a rendition of "try a little tenderness" by otis redding that nearly brought me to tears. Try piece out on weekends because the 9 - 5ers take over!
