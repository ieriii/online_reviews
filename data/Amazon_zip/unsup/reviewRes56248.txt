What a great place to eat!The food is delicious! Flavorful, fresh, and excellently prepared. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked appetizing, and I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness and complexity in the flavors of the food. This is not your average Asian restaurant with questionable meats slathered in an overly sweet sauce. Ingredients are thoughtfully combined to create flavor, texture, and depth in every dish. The mango beef was amazing -- the beef succulent, the veggies cooked with just the right amount of fresh crunch, and served in a coconut! Speaking of coconuts, the coconut ice cream for desert was also a major winner -- light and sweet; a perfect end to a wonderful meal.On top of the awesome food, the service is truly spectacular. Friendly staff and an insanely gracious owner. A great place to bring friends and family for a lively meal out. The entire place was buzzing with warm energy all night long.
