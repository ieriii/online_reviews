Been going to Milk and Honey for 5-6 years. Continued giving it a chance, as it is 300 yards from where I live. Protocol has always been questionable. By the time I stand in line, order, pay, take a number, find a table, get my silverware, and get my water, I feel like I want to get in the kitchen and make some eggs. I The menu hasn't changed, nor the general attitude of the staff. Everyone there seems to resent the popularity the restaurant has enjoyed. Walked in for coffee on a recent Sunday at 7:58. Didn't realize that they weren't open yet (coffee shops are usually open at 8am on Sunday in the USA, yes?). I was greeted from the back of the restaurant with a "Yeeeeeeeessss???" The girl at the front counter didn't realize I was standing there. She promptly turned around and told me to "Give us like 5 minutes, ok?" They both looked at me like I broke in overnight and demanded the tired, soggy egg sandwich and a piece of the day-old quiche thing that sits uncovered by the cash register. Just wanted coffee. From a coffee shop. Won't be back.
