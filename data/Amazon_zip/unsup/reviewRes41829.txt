My fiance took me here for my birthday and let me tell you, I fell in love! Who ever thought of buttery steak is a genius! The portions are huge and the sides are so delicious! I had the mashed potato which was soooo creamy and my fiance had the spinach and that was delicious also. The steak is cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth! The molten chocolate cake was decadent. The service is superb. A perk is it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to dine here!
