**THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BAR ONLY** Hands down, the best drinks I have ever had. The bartenders are absolutely incredible. I had a Manhattan plus two drinks off of the seasonal menu (the Porch Swing and a Pear drink). The drinks are perfectly balanced, fresh, innovative, and delicious. I would've gone for a fourth drink.. but someone would've had to carry me out ;) And yes, the drinks are pricey, but they're the same prices you'd pay at theWit or the Signature Lounge, and definitely worth it.
