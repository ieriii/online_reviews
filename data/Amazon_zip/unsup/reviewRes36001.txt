I'm hesitant to write this review since I don't want this place to get any more crowded, but the Peking Duck service is amazing and a great deal at $35 for two people given how much food you get. Their other food is great, too, and the girls from the owning family are a lot of fun if they happen to be the ones who carve your duck for you.
