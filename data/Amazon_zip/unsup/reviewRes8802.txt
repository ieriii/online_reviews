I'm gonna go ahead and say this is one of my Top 5 favorite restaurants in Chicago Why is that you may ask? The food is spot on. Every time I have been here, I have always left wanting more. I always make sure to start with an order of Hummus, which comes nicely topped with olive oil and sliced olives. The plate looks beautiful and is the perfect compliment for the pita when you are waiting to place your order. My experience has been phenomenal when ordering entrees. I have yet to come across a dish I dislike. The chicken is juicy and lean, the Chenjeh (Choice Rib Eye) is grilled to perfection, and the rice is extremely tasty. I highly suggest going for one of the combination entrees, so that you can sample a few different meats. You can make a combination plate out of any of the meats: Chicken, beef or lamb.  The food here is extremely healthy. The meat is never salty, and the hummus is made fresh. When I leave I feel full and happy, unlike some other restaurants where I leave full and hurting. As long as you don't down all the rice, you shouldn't feel too bad! I do have to say that for dinner, the prices are a little out of my liking. I like kabobs and I enjoy meat so most of the time I will order two skewers. Combine that with the hummus and I'm pretty quickly over $20. Regardless of the cost, my love for Noon-O-Kabob is strong. The staff does an alright job, the food is INCREDIBLE, it's pretty healthy, and the price isn't too bad. Having Noon-O is like having a wild card in your pocket that no one is aware of. It's a gem of a restaurant and you won't be let down. I highly recommend this restaurant to all of my friends.
