After a particularly dour day at work filled with cranky judges and unsatisfied clients, I was in desperate need of some friendly faces, food, and a lovely cocktail. Lucky for me, I'd made plans with some fabulous ladies at an allegedly fabulous restaurant...that served cocktails. Hooray for my mad clairvoyant planning skills! One green tea martini for this girl starting to make the world seem a bit brighter, for sure. Zen in a glass, I'm telling ya. Not too sweet, not boozy tasting, just a simple drink adorned with a flower.  We started with some edamame, and I had some miso soup. I loved the big chunks of tofu in it, and it reminded me that the one thing that makes a hard day better other than a cocktail is a hefty dosage of salt...miso soup always does the trick! We ordered a few rolls and some sashimi, all of which were beautifully prepared and very fresh. The snow white roll was lovely, as was the godzilla and the Kani Chung. And the spicy tuna packed just the right amount of heat. What I enjoyed about the rolls was the fresh, clean taste. The proportions of additives were just right, packing the right amount of flavor and accentuating the freshness of the fish, rather than overpowering it. Service was slightly slow, but friendly enough. Starting with a warm wet nap was a classy touch, for sure. And dining with several people, we were able to pay with three different cards and cash with no problem.  I also enjoyed the simplicity of the decor, however the volume of the music in the bathroom was slightly alarming. Really loud! Seriously, if you need a break from eating or get a little carried away with the cocktails, come have a dance party in there. The mirrors are perfect for checkin' the booty bumpin' from all angles. It does get busy, but put your name in, enjoy a cocktail at Wang's next door, and relax. It's all zen from here.
