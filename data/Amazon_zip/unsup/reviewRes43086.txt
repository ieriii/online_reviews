THIS PLACE IS SUCH A GOOD DEAL. I got this delivered one Saturday night. For around $7 including delivery, you get an entree that can easily last two meals, a salad, and loaf of bread. I got the pasta special of the day which was something baked with a lot of cheese. The salad had a pretty good variety of vegetables for being a plain side salad and the creamy Italian dressing is the way to go. The pasta was pretty generic but better than what I would expect for the price. I will definitely order this again.
