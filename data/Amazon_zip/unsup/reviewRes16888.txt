I go to India House pretty regularly (like tonight) - it's always delicious and satisfying, and the service is always great. And ohhhhh, the naan - warm, pillowy, heavenly, obvously laced with crack or something similarly habit-forming Basically, I love everything about the place and have never had a single thing to complain about there. At first I thought I didn't have anything to say about the place that hasn't already been said a dozen times in these reviews. But I'm actually going to buck the trend and say that after many visits I PREFER having dinner there over the lunch buffet. Don't get me wrong, I've had both and the lunch buffet is great and it's certainly the better bargain of the two. But I find the food at dinner to be just stunningly good- and also a bit fresher and more delicate when it's brought to your table right from the kitchen than it is at the lunch buffet. The basmati rice is perfect and I can't say enough about the paneer makhani -soft fresh cheese in silky, creamy tomato sauce. [pauses to wipe drool] Sure, dinner there is spendier than at a lot of other Indian places, but when you factor in the location (it's no hole in the wall), expert service, and the quality of the food, it's a great pick for a night out. If this is your go-to place for a great Indian food buffet/orgy in the middle of the workday, consider it for a nice dinner out as well- it's a different experience and well worth the price.
