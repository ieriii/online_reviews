I tried this place with some girlfriends after work the other night.  Food was good- not amazing, but good and worth the money. Service was fantastic- I have nothing bad to say about this. All the servers, waiters, bartenders, etc. were extremely friendly and professional Environment was pleasant- pretty classy. More formal than I expected, but I was fine in jeans and lots of other people were in jeans. Prices are reasonable AND they sent me a gift certificate since it was my first visit! Great date spot or place to take the family. I will definitely be back to use the gift certificate and to take my boyfriend out for a nice dinner.
