You had me at hello. Well, not quite hello. But almost. When I walked in here for lunch the other day, Big Star was playing on the stereo. A very auspicious beginning. After taking a look at the lunch and drink menus, I decided on the Longman Manhattan and the banh mi. Definitely made the right call on the Manhattan. The Punt E Mes and cherry bitters lent a little bit of sweetness and crispness, just perfect on a hot day. The banh mi was very good. The sandwich is huge, with a generous amount of rabbit pate and a very nice crunchy baguette. Very tasty, just wish it had a little bit of spice-- maybe some jalapenos? In retrospect, should've gotten the wild boar sloppy joe. Dammit. Service was terrific. I was at the bar; the bartender greeted me heartily when I sat down and was happy to answer any questions I had. He even apologized when he had to leave the bar area for a moment. Overall, really enjoyed it. Four stars (and not quite five) because I didn't totally love the banh mi. Will be back, though, for dinner and more drinks... I have a feeling I may have to revise my rating.
