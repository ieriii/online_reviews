I refuse to read any of the reviews for this place because I simply do not care. I LOVE this place and you can tell me they serve donkey meat (but please don't!) and I will continue to visit and eat here whenever I am in Chicago. I had an amazing meal at Carnivale and that makes it my favorite Chicago restaurant so far. We went Friday night for dinner. Valet was only $10 (If I remember correctly). We went in and were surprised to learn the wait was.. wait for it..wait for it: one and a half hours!! Our group just looked at one another wondering if we would indeed wait that long. It turns out that the wait is actually for the main dining area, which if I may add is beautiful. Huge and very colorful umbrellas take over the ceiling and make this magnificent space a little carnival of its own. The dining room is very well decorated and although so many bright colors are used, it looks quite elegant. We decided to just seat in another area by the bar, which is not as attractive, but would save us 1 1/2 hours. The food was so delicious! I tasted several different dishes and every single one was better than the previous. My friend ordered a steak, she wanted it medium but it was brought out medium rare. I tasted the medium rare steak and it was exquisite! I really cant believe she returned it! I had a seafood dish, which was prepared to perfection. I almost took away a star because I ordered a Tres Leches for dessert and they brought me some chocolate thing that was NOT a Tres Leches cake! That needs to be taken off the menu. The waitress was happy to change it for a flan, so I decided not to take the star off. We also had a few drinks and an overall amazing time. They were playing Latin music which was very entertaining. I am really glad I got to visit this place, I really loved the food!
