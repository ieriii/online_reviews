EVERYTHING was fine BESIDES the room size. I stayed in a horriblely small room. I guess it was a standard room, but if I'd known it was very cramped I would of paid for a bit more. The next day I checked out and stayed at the W - Lakeshore and have been extremely happy ever since. The location at W - City Center is a bit better for transportational purposes than Lakeshore, but that's really it.
