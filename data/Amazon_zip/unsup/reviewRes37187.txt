My favorite bar in the city. If you are a beer snob this is your place. Huge list of craft and Belgian beers. unfortunately, even though the food is really good they do not take reservations and will not really accommodate large parties. I will continue to come back for their mussels and quality brews, but if I want to eat with more than a couple people I will go elsewhere.
