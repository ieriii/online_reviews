The format was interesting and seemed to fit the place well (order at counter then wait for table) but I'm not sure how well they handle crowds. From what I hear I was lucky to not eat at a particularly busy time. Went for a breakfast dish and tried the Huevos Rancheros from a friend's recommendation. Always an interesting choice because everyplace in the city makes them differently. At milk&honey, it's a casserole style. The eggs, salsa, onions, black beans, are all mixed together with cheese baked in a thick oozy layer on top. Can't go wrong with cheese right? Also got a taste of their pancakes which tasted as good as they looked. This place has a good reputation, and I'm inclined to agree with the crowd on this one.
