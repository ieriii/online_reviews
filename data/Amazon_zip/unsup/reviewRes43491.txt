I had not heard of this place before I went; a friend recommended it but I had no idea about its gleaming reputation. This was the best pizza I have ever had. I started moaning as I was eating. I am looking for the best pizza ever, and I am HOPING somewhere I find pizza nirvana, but this was close. Perfect crust, perfect sauce, perfect cheese. I don't like thin crust, and I was not converted when I tried theirs, but the deep dish? Ooooh my god. Plain cheese, spinach and mushroom, onions and peppers? All a dream.  I introduced my parents and now they order weekly. This pizza is incredible. Also, they recently converted their tiny space into a large dine-in restaurant so no more pick up counter that happens to have a few tables feel. The service has been OK when I have eaten there, nothing special, but who cares as long as they give me my pizza (and believe me, that is NOT something you will hear me say often.) Great specials too! Come for the pizza, stay for the funeral that will occur after you die of bliss.
