I went for the brunch as mentioned in Time Out mag. I arrived at 9am when they opened and was seated immediately. The staff did not quite seem ready yet, but I was not in a hurry, so no biggie. The beignets were great. My companion loved the coffee. I ordered the Big Jones benedict....and that is where it went downhill. I found the thick cut ham to be very chewy and almost gristly, but the most outrageous thing about this dish is that it does NOT come with hollandaise sauce! I consider myself to a bit of a benedict connoisseur and every benedict comes with some sort of sauce whether it be hollandaise or gravy. Nada here. Two biscuits, chewy ham and two poached eggs. I did opt for the grits as my side and they were phenomenal. Very good service but overall way to pricey for the portions. I may try them for dinner but I won't return for breakfast/brunch.
