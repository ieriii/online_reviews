I've been to The Pasta Bowl many times and the thing that always amazes me is how quickly these cooks make the meals and how great they taste. I really enjoy the fact that you can watch the cooks make your meal while you wait. The only negative is that the place is pretty small so it can fill up quick and also become hot pretty quickly. The kitchen alone adds a good amount of heat, now throw in a large group of people and it can get quite warm. Even with that, the price and quality of food is so good I'm happy to come here again and again.
