I must admit, the first time I ate here I loved it. The chicken was flavorful and crispy and the onion rings were perfect. However, on my second and third visits I've been very unhappy with the quality of food. The chicken tastes like it's been sitting under a warming light all day. Definitely not fresh. And the owner tries a little too hard at being friendly, which makes me uncomfortable. I guess if you like non-threatening Asian food, this is the place to be. I suggest the Korean fried chicken from H-Mart in Niles. That stuff is AMAZING! It makes Crisp look like a KFC.
