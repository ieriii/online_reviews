If you know anyone who lives near Division/Ashland or anywhere in Wicker Park, chances are they rave about La Pasadita. I've been listening to people sing the praises of La Pasadita for years; so, when I finally went there recently for the first time, I was disappointed. I ordered chips and guacamole, a chicken taco, and a steak taco. The guacamole was good. The chips were stale. The chicken taco was mediocre. The chicken was dry and had little flavor. The steak taco was pretty good, though. The veggies on both tacos were fresh. Overall, not a bad experience, but my food did not live up to the hype or my expectations. My conclusion: What's the big deal? It's average food at average prices.
