I'm addicted to their eggs benedict, fresh orange juice and especially the blueberry scones. I love the 3rd Coast for weekend brunch (and apparently so does everyone else.... It gets crowded) or a good late night dinner. They always have new art on the walls. It's a cute place to bring a book to drink a cup of coffee and get lost for an afternoon
