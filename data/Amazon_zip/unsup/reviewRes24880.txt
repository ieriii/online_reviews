Another five-star experience. But I dread trying to get a table on a Friday or Saturday night during the summer. We had another great experience at Mercat. And this time the service moved up to 5-stars too. On a Thursday evening, the place was packed. So when warm summer nights arrive, it's going to be difficult to schedule a table here. But I will! Key tapas we had: - Porcini and Catalan sausage flatbread, with roasted garlic and manchego cheese. Outstanding. - Serrano ham & fig salad, with la Peral cheese, baby spinach, spiced almonds and sherry vinaigrette - terrific again. I can't imagine coming here without ordering this dish, it's so good. - Wild mushrooms, confit potato, and shallots. A perfect compliment to the other dishes. - Garlic shrimp. Tasted great, but lost in the competition with the other dishes. - Pork belly with a cider glaze, green apples and truffle. Delicious, not overcooked, just the way a simple pork belly dish should taste. We had a few other dishes - breads, olives, and a couple tasty but very small desserts. Plus two bottles of Spanish Albarino white, a great Spanish Orobio red, and a few after dinner drinks. It made for a perfect three hour visit with friends over wine and tapas.
