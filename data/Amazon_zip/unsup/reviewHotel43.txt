We celebrated our one year anniversary by going downtown Chicago, getting a hotel room, and going to dinner and having drinks. This hotel was by far the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. The room was cold one second, and than unbearably hot the next. Everything was extremely old, and out of date. The bathtub was very dirty, and the carpet in the room looked like it hasn't been shampooed in over a century. I've stayed at motels that were better than this. The one star that I gave to this hotel is for it's location.
