My husband and I got a gift certificate for a overnight weekend stay at a charity auction - so I made reservations, confirmed them, get an early check-in, we were all set. When we got their to check-in and they couldn't find our reservation, we realized (when we pulled up the email confirmation on my husband's phone) that I had made reservations at the wrong Hilton downtown! I was really worried that we'd have to either stay at the other Hilton and pay full-price, because we didn't have a gift certificate for that Hilton... because the Palmer house definitely seemed really busy. The woman at the registration desk was fantastic - she definitely could have just turned us away - the gift certificate said it could only be used with a reservation. Instead, she was super nice about it and called the other Hilton, got our room cancelled there with no cancellation fees, then she booked us a room with an early check-in at the Palmer House and we used our gift certificate. Many other people would have just said, "sorry I can't help you" and moved on - she was fantastic! We LOVED the hotel, the restaurant was delicious and the bar at night was fun, although the drinks were pretty pricey, but we expected that being downtown anyways. I adore this place - can't wait to go back!!
