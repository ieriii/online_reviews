I really enjoyed Gilt Bar. Came here for a double date and loved the warm wood ambience and lighting fixtures in the dining room. Great beer and and spirits menu too-- gotta love a place that has Sofie on draft. I should say that I automatically give at least 2 stars to any place that has roasted bone marrow on the menu. So luxuriously fattening and delicious... In addition to the bone marrow, we ordered the roasted cauliflower and frites for starters. Both were great appetizers. I had the mussels and my husband had the pork belly. The other couple ordered the hamachi crudo and the pork belly as well-- everyone was really happy with their meals. Great restaurant with the perfect location for those who work in the loop or River North. I'm in the Merchandise Mart, so I'll definitely be back.
