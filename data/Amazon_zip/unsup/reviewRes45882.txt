Ugh. Went here with coworkers during a conference. I feel like I was tricked into eating at the Cheesecake Factory (which is basically what this is). The service was slow and horrible. The food was incredibly mediocre (and overcooked), and they got several orders wrong. The ambiance was nil--the tables are packed together tightly and it was crowded, loud, and obnoxious. Maybe it is because it made me cranky, but I'd pretty much beg to go anywhere else if I had the option again.
