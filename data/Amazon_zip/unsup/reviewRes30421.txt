I came here with some friends on a Wednesday night, it was packed and quite loud but the vibe was great. Our server was incredibly friendly and really helpful in giving us suggestions. We were seated in the back so the noise level wasn't as bad and we enjoyed our meals without having to scream across the table. We had some really interesting drinks, I had the pear sake and blushing geisha which were both okay but not my type of drink. They were a bit too sweet for my taste and their flavors were not working for me. My friend had a lychee cocktail and it was amazing, not too sweet and not too salty, just perfectly blended together. Another drink I would suggest ordering is a margarita type drink, it is green in color and has mint leaves, it was really refreshing and tasted like a margarita and a mojito mixed together. Our food was decent but it wasn't the "best" sushi I have ever had, it was really interesting and they had some really unique rolls but there was no, "kick, pow wow" melt in your mouth moment. I would definitely recommend trying this place, it is really unique and the experience is one that is worth having. The service was great, the drinks were unique, and their rolls were "A-OK."
