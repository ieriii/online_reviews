The elevators here are the worst. Is it too much to ask for a semi-intelligent algorithm that knows at least whether you've hit the up or down button? The fitness room is totally sketchy. The front desk employees tell you which floor it's on, and when you arrive on that floor, there's absolutely no signage. Not helpful, when the facility is on a floor surrounded by other hotel rooms. The inside of the room is a labyrinth of randomly placed machines, all pointed in different directions. The only treadmill is at the very end of the room, facing the window that looks out on the river. It's a nice view, but I was totally creeped out by the fact that I couldn't tell if anyone was sneaking up behind me while I was on my run. The rooms are a very generous size, but the bathroom was awful. The water wasn't hot enough for my shower, and I feel that as a 5'3" woman, I should *not* be able to look out over the top of the shower curtain. All in all, I think I'd actually prefer to stay at the Red Roof Inn next time. At least they have free breakfast.
