Wakamono is an OK place to grab some sushi and maybe some alternative dishes if you have friends that are not into sushi. I say "OK" mostly because of the location, at Broadway just north of Belmont. The place is attractive with lots of wood and simple decor that looks like it might moonlight as a club after hours. However, there is a crazy draft from the door that can really be nasty if you're sitting anywhere near it. And the chances of that are good since the place is quite small.  There are no reservations so be prepared to wait. The servers are *meh*, not exactly nasty, but not very nice either. They will, however, give your mother in law a fork to use and have the good grace to not make a funny face, we have learned.  As for the fish... well, I guess it's just fish. I am spoiled rotten by Sai Cafe which I maintain still has the best fish in the City proper that I've found. The pieces for nigiri or sashimi at Wakamono are pretty small, and the quality is just OK. They did not have Uni on a Friday around 8 PM, which is odd, but then again I don't remember having uni any time I've been there so perhaps they don't serve it.  The rolls are OK, but they are really just dressed up versions of regular rolls with flashy names and some extra sauce or toppings, such as the peter parker roll, which is a fancy spider roll (get it??), and the snow white roll, which is a gussied up tuna roll with some superwhite on top.  Maybe if I go again we'll order more of the non-sushi items and enjoy the food a little better.  At the end of the day, this happens to be a restaurant that happens to serve sushi, but I would not call it a sushi restaurant. If you want a pretty place to meet your friends or a date and are OK throwing down some extra cash because you're eating fish, go for it. I'm going to Sai.
