Absolutely preposterous, this is the most contrived bar in Chicago. From the waiting list to the Alice in Wonderland furniture to the lack of lighting that actually finds the servers instructing you to hold votive candles up to the menu so you can see it to the dark maze you have to navigate to find the bathroom positioned five rooms away and only reachable if you can figure out what curtains to crawl through to the 45 minute wait for drinks that is bragged about because they use 8 kinds of ice and are "discerning," Violet Hour makes me laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh . . . I am still laughing . . . I like their policy prohibiting cell phones, though. Wait, I am still laughing . . . WHEN will Chicago stop pretending it is LA and NYC mixed into one stupid bag, and just be itself and have some new fucking establishments that aren't contrived and shtick-crazy?!?!?! To paraphrase another reviewer, this place makes me embarrassed for all of Chicago.
