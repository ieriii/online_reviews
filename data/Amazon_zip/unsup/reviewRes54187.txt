Like the food but not love it. Not life-changing or mind-blowing but it was all very good. I love hot & spicy! Probably a lot more than most people so people telling me that the food was very hot & very spicy? Wrong.On second thought, the next time I should probably talk to the staff and ask my dishes to be made extremely spicy. The chocolate was amazing though!
