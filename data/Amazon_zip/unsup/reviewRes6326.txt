Had dinner here yesterday with a friend for a belated birthday dinner. Everything we had was good! We had the pork belly with apple mostardo -- the apple mostardo was the perfect sweet/sour accompaniment to the salty, crunch pork belly. Then we tried the giant ragu in a tomato sauce with sausages -- the sausage were so tasty, though the pasta was a too al dente for my preference. Dish was good overall. Came the linguine with sea urchin and crabmeat. It tasted like the sea... it was different but delicious. (Interestingly, my friend thought it was too salty. I have an aversion to salt but didn't think it was salty at all... it had just a very strong sea-salt taste to it.) Lastly, we tried the mushroom pizza with the leeks and truffle oil. We thought we wouldn't be able to finish the pizza between the both of us but it was too easy 'cause it was sooooo good. Crust was warm, chewy and soft -- just the way I like it! For dessert, we opted for chocolate mousse and glad we did it. They sprinkled bits of coffee beans around the mousse and the crust was a wafer/hazelnut bottom, a la Ferrero Rocher. The only downside was the service we got. I think we got a new server. He took forever to come to our table when we got there. It must have been more than 5 minutes before he finally approached us and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. He didn't try to explain how best to order since the servings were small/small plates. He was also dropping utensils on the floor -- must have been nervous or something. The place was packed. Nice ambience. You can go there for a casual bit to eat or a nice dinner. Overall it was a great experience despite the inexperienced server. We're definitely going back!
