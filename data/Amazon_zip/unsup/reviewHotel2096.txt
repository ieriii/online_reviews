I have to be honest -- when I told a colleague I was staying here, she said, "really? I'm sure there are other hotels in the area that are nicer." I stayed with it, and really enjoyed it. They must've done renovations recently, because the place looks great -- the rooms are terrific, the lobby is gorgeous -- great views, and more. The staff was outstanding -- very helpful concierge. One tip: Try not to get a room that surrounds the atrium -- it was a bit noisy with the bar and restaurant just below, although keeping the fan on drowned that out. But a bit off and you'll be happy as a clam here!
