Wishbone is great for breakfast because they make a mean Bloody Mary, but last weekend I had the pleasure of having dinner there and it was equally delightful (I think it had something to do with the fact that they promptly brought us warm cornbread muffins).  Anyway, I really love the set up of the menu at Wishbone... several main dishes to choose from, all of which come with 2 sides. Just so you know, thats a lot of choices (and permutations), not including the daily specials! The side dishes are really the standout items... mashed sweet potatoes, spinach, macaroni and cheese, etc. I could make a meal out of that alone! Wash it down with a flavored lemonade and you've got quite a tasty dinner. Can't wait to go back...
