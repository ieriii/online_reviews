Had reservations on Friday night. Was seated promptly at a two top in front. This was my first time here and was pleasantly surprised by how attentive and knowledgeable the staff was.  The beer list is great, though offers little to the unadventurous.  We ordered a dozen chef-selected oysters and they arrived quickly and seemed very fresh, if slightly small. Our server pointed out which oysters were which (very helpful to an oyster novice) and they were all fantastic. At $30/dozen I was a little underwhelmed but the service made it. For dinner we shared a pot of mussels and the beets w/burrata cheese. Both were outstanding. Never have I found myself saying, "I wish we had more beets" before in my life. Last thing I want to comment on is the washroom. OK. So that sounds strange. But as a bit of a germaphobe they have a BIG plus and a small minus. The mens room has no sink. OK. Thats NOT the minus. There is a big communal fountain style sink in the room adjoining the facilities. This is a HUGE plus as it FORCES people into washing their hands. This is using the power of shame for good! No one is walking out of that bathroom without washing up.  The minus? You still need to manually turn off the faucet, basically reintroducing any germs back to your hands. No paper towels are available to use instead. /crazy
