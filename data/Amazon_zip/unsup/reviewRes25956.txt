I'm so glad my coworker recommened this place. It's the best pan pizza i've ever tasted. It's absolutely delicious. The crust is exactly the way I like it, cheesy, crispy and buttery. I ordered the 10" pepperoni pan pizza and only ate two pieces. I didn't want to stop eating but they were filling.  I wish it was a little bigger. I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch and all the tables and bar were full. I can only imagine what it's like weekend nights. Forget Giordano's and Lou Malnattis, Pequod's is my new favorite (pan) pizza spot. I can't wait to go back.
