Hot Doug's makes one mean hot dog. With choices like rib eye sausage and sweet pepper and mozzarella chicken sausage, you can rest assured that you won't be eating a run-of-the-mill ball park frank. As a first-timer, I ordered "The Dog" - a Chicago-style hot dog with all the trimmings: pickle, onions, tomato... delicious! The duck fat fries may sound a bit strange, but they are so flavorful and fried to perfection. These fries were so ridiculously good. The restaurant is colorful, bright, and has lots of character. The line was out the door and around the corner when I went, but definitely worth the wait. If I'm ever in Chicago again, you'll find me here for sure.
