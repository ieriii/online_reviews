Savory, flavorful plates that will make you think you've died and gone to heaven. Cafe 28 offers authentic Cuban cuisine and also incorporates other contemporary Latin dishes in their menu. The setting is warm with dark woods and exposed brick, or you have the option of dining on their outdoor patio. They don't allow for reservations, so when you arrive expect to wait for a table in the evening. Don't worry...it's worth the wait! While anticipating your dinner and socializing with your friends, be sure to order a refreshing mojito from one of the cute bartenders. Ohhlala.
