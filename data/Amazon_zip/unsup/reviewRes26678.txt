Bo Lu Lac was tasty. Enjoy the fried rice and fried-banana ice cream were good. I could have passed on the Asian Noodles and Vegetables or Seafood Noodles. Went here for Mom's bday. The owner was a little over the top. He screwed up our reservation and seemed to be over-compensating. He kept handing us waters while we waited, then moved us around to different tables. It was a little weird. But I do appreciate his passion.
