Ate here on a Friday night and got a table right away without waiting. We opted for the patio which might be my only complaint. It was a gorgeous night out so the patio was packed and you could tell the waitress was overwhelmed, this being said she did a great job and was very apologetic when she was a little slow to get our order. We got the messob which in my opinion is the best way to try a little of everything for a great price. We asked for extra injera and for a few of our choices to be quite spicy. The food came out fast and exactly how we asked for it, I especially liked the kitfo or a tasty beef tartar. The servers assistant was quick to refill our waters which is great on a busy patio with spicy food.  As I said earlier the patio may have been the wrong choice; the first being something that is out of any one's control. The corner or Lawrence and Broadway is loud with cars, sirens and the colorful people passing by. They did however have a nice planter box fence that made you forget that there were bums arguing fifteen feet away. The second was the table which was not balanced at all and would move a few inches depending on which side had more weight. Over all this is an ethnic place I would recommend to anyone with a curious palate.
