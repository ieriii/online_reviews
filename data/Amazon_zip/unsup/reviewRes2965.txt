I wish I could give this more stars... TRU was one of the most magical nights of my entire life! A true foodie experience. It was food art. Every motion of the staff was like a choreographed dance. I just can't say enough great things about this restaurant! My BF and I had the 9-course chef tasting... which turned into 13 courses after all the little extras they throw in. Our waiter even hailed us a cab after our 4-hour dinner. Just when you think it can't get any better (because the food is beyond "so delicious"), they hand you a little muffin to enjoy with your coffee or tea for the morning after. If only I had a money tree, because I could do that once a month if my finances allowed it.... One day I'll be back!
