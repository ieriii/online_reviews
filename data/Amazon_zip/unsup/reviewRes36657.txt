If you are looking for a primo Thai option in Rogers Park / Edgewater this is it. The food is top notch and the service is always solid. We have done takeout as well and have not been disappointed. And as if I needed another reason to love this place - its BYOB. Even if you forget to bring something with you there is a Dominick's right next door and a local liquor store with a solid selection of wines and brews right around the corner.
