I really like Simply It. It's a stone's throw from work and so I go there quite often for the lunch special. Speaking of the lunch special, it's almost crazy how much food you get for the price. For example, the Beef Pasta is about $8 and comes with a drink (lemonade, iced or hot tea), salad, soup, entree and fresh fruit for dessert. The food always tastes fresh and healthy. The fresh fruit smoothies are also worth trying. The service and atmosphere could be better (a few changes and the place could be rather hip) , hence the 4 stars. Definitely worth checking out. Oh and it's BYOB w/ no corkage fee.
