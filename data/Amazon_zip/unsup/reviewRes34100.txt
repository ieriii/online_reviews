I had been dying to go here since I moved to Chicago, so I went for the first time this weekend. I know the menu changes, but for some reason on the night that I went, I wasn't that impressed. When I finally did get my meal though, it was delicious! The only complaints I had were that the music was a little loud and the service was okay. It was a very busy saturday night though so I will definitely see myself back there in the future.
