Love it!  We ordered Ricotta Pancakes and the Montana Omelet...both were delicious! The omelet came with fresh seasoned, browned potatoes, toast and what seemed to be homemade raspberry preserves. The pancakes were simply pancakes with maple whipped cream (no syrup, but perfect without it). All ingredients tasted very fresh, and portion size was just right. Just right for me is enough to be full, but not bursting. The cost is high, but with ingredients so fresh and such a cool menu it is worth it. Our server was very personable, able to make good suggestions, and great at reading her customers needs. We will be back many, many times!
