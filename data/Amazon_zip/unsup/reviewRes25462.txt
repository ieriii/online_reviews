This is the first place I've ever had deep dish pizza from, so I have literally nothing else to compare it to, but I can honestly say that it's the best pizza I've ever had. The cheese on the edges is delicious and caramelized, the toppings were amazing (mushrooms, sausage, black olives), the cheese on top was perfect, and the whole thing was just delicious. I'm a pretty big guy and two slices off the media pizza had me stuffed, and that's even after I ate lightly all day in anticipation for this Chicago gem. The crust is also perfectly crispy, which is just how I like my pizza. Absolutely wonderful.
