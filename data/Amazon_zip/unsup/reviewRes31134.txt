This Diner stands head and shoulders above any place i've been to, I've never had a bad meal here. I'm pretty new to the whole meatless dining experience so the first time I went here I was expecting tepid tofu and limp lifeless legumes. Boy was I wrong, everything here just tastes so great- seitan, soy whatever it is that masquerades as meat it is really tasty. The waiters are really helpful and efficient, the diner is brightly lit with natural light that streams in from the large windows and leafy plants add the decoration. Grab a booth if you get a chance, they look like church pews and are hard to enter and exit from but provide surprising comfort and intimacy. As a reformed carnivore I can honestly say that the Diner is my favourite restaurant and encourage anyone to give it a try!
