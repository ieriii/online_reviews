Went here for lunch by myself a week ago since I was in the area. I ordered the chicken po boy, and I was asked by the waiter if I wanted it blackened or grilled (menu says blackened). I ordered it grilled, and instead of getting a po boy with grilled chicken, I got a peice of grilled chicken on a bun. I'm sorry, but that's not a po boy. It would have been great if it was communicated that there'd be a difference, but no word from my waiter or the menu. The fries were decent, but nothing to write home about. Don't think I'll come back here or recommend it to anyone.
