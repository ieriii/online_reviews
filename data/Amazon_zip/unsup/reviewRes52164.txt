So, I'm half Italian and I would not recommend this place to any Italian person. The pizza sauce is like Ragu the cheese is like rubber. The service is bad we had a waitress who wouldn't even answer our questions about prices. Pizza sauce should not be soggy. I would go to Leona's, Carmen's,Lou Malnati's, California pizza kitchen for all you pizza lovers. If you are having family from Italy do not bring them to a pizza place bring them to Quartino.
