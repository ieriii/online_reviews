even for someone who isn't a beer snob, or even much a of a beer drinker, i was impressed with the Hopleaf's selection (and even tried a couple of beers). The wine list is pretty prolific and affordable as well. The mussles are fabulous and brisket sandwich was huge and delicious.  I only have two shortcomings: aside from the three salads on the menu, there aren't any veggies (just a bunch of starch, seafood and meat), and there isn't a server in the bar area which was super crowded and could have used one. But I can live with both of those as long as the keep the mussles coming.
