I'm a big fan of Iron Chef America and Jose Garces so I decided to check this place out. Very impressed! Besides being a little on the pricey end, you get what you pay for. It is one of the best Spanish restaurants in the city. I recommend the braised short rib flatbread and the spinach was awesome too. I would definitely go back!
