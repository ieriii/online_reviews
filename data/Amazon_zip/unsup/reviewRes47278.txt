The last time i went may have been my last! Im very disappointed with this bar, usually I go once every week or because they have great drinks and even better food, but this time the service was awful. It was about 2;45 I started by calling them because I had noticed that I had a groupOn for lunch. I clearly said "I noticed you have a groupOn could I order for pick up and just pay with that when I arrive." The man on the phone named Tim right away said sure and took my order. Before hanging up I repeated so i just show you the group on when I get there. to which he replied "yes" A few minutes later i got to the bar and waited for my food, just as i was about to get it the man named tim stepped out and the bartender was about to charge me. I was gonna give here the groupOn when she replied " for eating here only" I was gonna tell her that someone said I could use it. And she interrupted me and said" for eating here only" . I was gonna explain that the man named tim clearly told me i could but again she just said" for eating here only" I was getting pissed this grown woman with the conversation skills of a five year old. Looking at the time I had left for lunch I paid cash for the food 16.50 $drove back to my job, and just 30minutes later my group on expired 10.00$ gone!!! I ended up paying 26.50$ for A BURGER AND A SIDE OF FRIES. WORST SIRVES EVER I LOVE THIS PLACE BUT TO GET CHEATED LIKE THAT MAKES ME NEVER WANNA GO BACK.
