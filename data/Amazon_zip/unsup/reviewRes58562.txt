All in all, I've gotta say I was a little disappointed. Sure, their food is good and would easily get 4, sometimes 5 stars in and of itself, but several thngs bothered me.We had reserved a table for 4 - when we arrived, we were treated in a pretty arrogant manner by the maitre d', who gave us a cramped table right next to the kitchen exit. I understand that this place demands proper attire and we weren't exactly wearing bow ties, but no shorts with wive-beaters either (think jeans and t-shirt or polo shirt). Since this was 6 weeks ago, I don't even recall what we had exactly, but I do recall that especially the starters, two salads were excellent and would have earned the place 5 stars easily. The main dishes were still good, mine, with chicken, was solid but not too extraordinary, the seafood my companions had was better. What I disliked was the bottle of pleasant but rather mediocre wine they sold for 60$ - definitely overpriced. Without tips, the final bill showed 220 $ - pretty hefty, I think, considering that one can probably have slightly less exclusive but similarily tasty food at a more low-key BYOB Vietnamese place (somewhere around Argyle) with better wine for about half the price, without an arrogant maitre d' and lights being dimmed so low you can barely see your friends at the table...Final note: The decor is of course impressive, but IMHO doesn't make for the most comfortable dining atmosphere I can imagine - if that's what you want to enjoy, have a drink at the bar and skip the food here.
