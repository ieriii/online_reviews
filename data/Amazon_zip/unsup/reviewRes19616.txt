We came here on Saturday for an early dinner, arriving around 530pm. There was a short wait, maybe around 20 minutes. But well worth it. My husband and I ordered food like it was our last meal on earth. We ordered three tortas - pepito, the suckling pig, and the saturday special which was goat barbacoa. We ordered two churros, the maple,bacon, pecan streusel ice cream, and an almond hot chocolate for dessert. I had the highest hopes for the suckling pig torta but it fell short out of the three. The goat was actually the most memorable and remarkable. The pepito, although tasty, was safe, and able to be replicated with any good braised short-rib recipe. FYI - a torta is a sandwich with tasty bread...it's crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. It's not so crispy that it hurts the roof of your mouth but it's crispy enough to give your sandwich a good crunch and added texture. I'd say the one thing missing from each sandwich is some raw onion. The salsas accompanying each torta complimented the sandwich perfectly. The churros were good. Not too sweet, crispy, and have some other spices rather than just sugar crystals. The most outstanding dessert was the maple bacon pecan streusel ice cream!! So tasty - salty, sweet, yummy. It's as good as it sounds trust me!! Don't miss out on this. The hot chocolate, as explained by other yelpers, is not as sweet as american hot chocolate. I went in knowing this but was still surprised by how bitter it was. It was thick and rich but not in the way that you would expect. I might try a different version of hot chocolate next time I'm there. We will definitely be back. The caldos that were ordered by those around us did not look as tasty as the tortas but I suppose I should try at least one to confirm my suspicions. Thanks to Rick Bayless. Nice job. Keep up the creativity!
