I come here every so often as, honestly, there aren't many brunch places down in Bridgeport. Diners, yes, and maybe a coffee shop or two, but not really breakfast/brunch. They get plenty of brownie points for changing up their menu based on the season and the availability at local farms. All their produce (and I even think meats) are local products and beyond fresh. I don't have a normal thing here, you really can't since the menu changes, you'd just be left with disappointment. This place is definitely for the open-minded palate. Only 3 stars because nothing really "WOWs" me. It's fine, it's tasty but nothing really special.That said, it doesn't really deter me from walking in. I've never had to wait here and the prices are a bit more expensive then the rest of Bridgeport. I would love to try the dinner, I didn't even know they started serving dinner a while back. Definitely a place to try at least once to see if it tickles your fancy.
