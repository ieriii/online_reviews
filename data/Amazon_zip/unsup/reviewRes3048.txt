Phenom dot com. The best wings I've ever had...ever. I'm pretty sure they came from pterodactyls. So massive, so delicious. We had half of the seoul sassy and half bbq, I truthfully cannot decide which I like more. Both of the hot sauces on the tables were awesome, especially the one that was sriracha based. I'm a huge fan of bibimbap, and theirs was really tasty. It came in a huge metal bowl and I had more than enough for dinner the next night. You definitely get your money's worth. At first I was a little put off by the close quarters and tight seating situation, but was over it almost right away. Not a ton of seating, but I was with a group of four at 8:00 on a Saturday night and we didn't wait long at all for a space to sit. Lastly, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful when it came to menu decisions. Can't wait to go back!
