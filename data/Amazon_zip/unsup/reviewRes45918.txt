Got a seat by the window and enjoyed my lunch overlooking Michigan Ave...score! What we ordered: Mushroom Burger - a little oily but delicious. Great blend of a variety of mushrooms. Warm Goat Cheese salad - wish this was bigger because it was soooo good. The fried goat cheese was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the honey dressing was an awesome subtle touch. Beignets - so we were expecting like 3 little beignets, but our waiter came out with 7 HUGE piping hot beignets and some sauces. The hubbie and I devoured ALL of them (yes we are pigs), they were so good, almost as good as the ones from NOLA.
