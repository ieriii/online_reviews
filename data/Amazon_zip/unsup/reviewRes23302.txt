Irazu is cheap, has great burritos and empanadas, outdoor seating and fast delivery. The dining room is pretty small though so I prefer delivery. I love the black bean empanada and the sweet plantain empanada. I went to Costa Rica shortly after my first visit to Irazu and was sadly disappointed that I could not find an empanada anywhere. The Costa Rican style rice and beans here though are great and true to CR. Definitely get the hot peppers and try the homemade hot sauce. I love spicy food, and this hot sauce is truly hot! The sides, empanadas and burritos (and BYOB) are enough for me to give Irazu 4 stars. The other main courses are just okay in my opinion. Also I'm not terribly impressed by the oatmeal milkshake, but check out the other reviews. Most people seem to love it.
