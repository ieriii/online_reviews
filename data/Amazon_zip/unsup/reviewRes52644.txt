I just heard about this place a couple of weeks ago and I have been dying to go ever since. I finally got the chance and it was everything I was told it would be. If you are a meat lover this is a place you have to check out. The Black Pepper Filet Mignon is to die for! The side orders were a plenty and they were good at refilling them when you get low. Unfortunately I have only been there once so I can't comment much on the other meats but if it is anything close to how good the Filet Mignon was then I am sure I would love it. The only thing that was somewhat disappointing was the service could have been better. They weren't rude I just think they were slightly understaffed. Besides that I have to say this place is defiantly worth checking out.
