l liked Graham Elliot. I waited too long since I have eaten there and I can't remember exactly what I ordered but I do remember I really liked the stroganoff dish. The pork belly was a good solid dish. I think the popcorn had a little too much truffle- I think it would have been better if it was more subtle. It was also pretty loud and somewhat difficult to talk- I did enjoy the modern music selection. I totally loved rocking the Cure songs. Also had a nice wine selection.  Overall it was a good solid meal that I can't find much to fault. I may not go back just because there are so many better restaurants in Chi town and there was nothing there that really amazed me. But then again since its a seasonal menu maybe I'll try again in the spring.  Just a good solid meal and a nice atmosphere.
