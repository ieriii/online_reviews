I have never written a Yelp review, but I feel compelled to do so this evening because of the SHEER DISAPPOINTMENT with my meal at Bon Soiiree. I have been 4 times and, before tonight, it was my favorite Chicago restaurant (fun, small, BYOB, etc.), but this evening's meal was really a sad state of affairs. From bland and overcooked dumpling (tasted like something frozen from Trader Joes), to very dry and uninspired pound cake, it felt like paying $75 for something that was worth $15. To be fair, as I noted, I loved them in the past. All I can say now is that I sincerely hope the restaurant reads this review and comes up with a menu that is more creative and more worthy of the high price, especially since most of us go for a special occasion. It really was bad enough that I will never be going back. I wasn't even full after the 7 course meal... For those of you on the fence, I hope you at least wait until the menu changes because the current menu is not worth the high price. What a bummer- take a look at all the recent review, mostly terrible. Not worthy of a Michelin star...
