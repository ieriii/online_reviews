Every time I eat the crab rangoon, it feels like the very first time: I popped it into my mouth, my eyes widened, and I realized I had experienced taste nirvana. It's really that good, I recommend it with every fiber of my being, and whoever came up with that recipe should be famous. The service can be a bit disorganized, but they manage somehow. They get everything taken care of in a reasonably quick time, so I have no complaints there. The menu is broad, and the depth of its offerings varies. The "Japanese" section is the biggest by far, which is fantastic for someone who likes sushi, rolls, sashimi, special dishes (like a crocodile made of eel), and so on. However, a Thai fan wouldn't enjoy the same variety. This may be a good thing, though, considering many people probably wouldn't want to stray too far from basic Thai dishes, anyway. The food is good. I don't think it really differentiates itself from what other restaurants of that ilk offer, in terms of taste, but it's definitely very well-presented and worth the price. While the sushi and special dishes can reach $20.00 and beyond, the value you get for the price is excellent. You can order a dish for $7.95 and be satisfied, or you can drop phat cash on an extravagant meal and come away from the experience feeling it was money well-spent. The verdict: go there. Go there a lot.
