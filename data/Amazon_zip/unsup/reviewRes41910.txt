I can't believe I waited so long to dine here. The food, atmosphere, and drinks are fantastic. I'm a huge fan of the dim lighting which instantly makes everyone look more attractive. You walk in and you know you're going to have a good time. I'm not a fan of listening to Johnny Cash, but I guess it goes with Gilt's theme. They offer a nice selection of drinks plus $16 bottles of house wine that don't give you headaches or hangovers. My first visit was for a birthday and we had Andy as our server. He was hilariously sarcastic. We had the steak tartare, mussels, truffle pasta, chicken, brussel sprouts, pork belly, and fries. Everything was so good! The truffle pasta was the only thing I wouldn't reorder. I take that back, everyone suggested the brownies but I wasn't a fan. I actually returned the next night (yes, I enjoyed it that much) excited to have our other friends try Gilt. Unfortunately, our server sucked. I'm not sure what her deal was, but she was blatantly rude throughout the night. If we had only ordered one dish to share I could understand, but we had ordered a crap load of food in addition to drinks. Luckily the manager came around and took care of us for the remainder of the night.  In regards to the food, we tried some new items in addition to some of my favorites from the night before. I highly recommend the: -pork belly -short rib pasta -steak tartare -mussels -fries -brussel sprouts I've heard that their sister restaurant, Maude's liquor bar has even better food. Seeing how Gilt has set the bar pretty high, I can't wait to try Maude's as well.
