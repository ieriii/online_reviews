I thought I couldn't love Cafe 28 any more than I already do, but alas... I can. This is one of those Chicago restaurants that really stands out; I love taking friends who've never been and people from out of town here because I know they'll love it.  The honey jalapeno pork chops are maybe the tastiest pork chops I've ever eaten - and you get a huge serving for a pretty reasonable price. I also love their skirt steak (it's a bit spicy!), their halibut, the comal (so so so so so good), I even love the butter that comes with their bread. If you're in the mood for a mojito, you might have to stop yourself from ordering every one on the menu. Desserts: the pistachio rum cake - you've never tasted anything like it (and I mean that in the best way possible.) I had my master's graduation party here - we were able to order family style. The quesadillas are great to start, as are the empanadas. They are quite accommodating when hosting events and I've had a great experience working with the staff. Also attended one of their Rioja restaurant week events - $12 for wine tasting and tapas. It was a lot of fun and the wines were great.
