my bff and i went on a romantic date (she is a girl. she is pretty.) girls' night!!! they say that coast is the place where you bring 253 of your closest gf's, meaning 334 bottles of wine (since it's byob) and talk about only the best gossip.  probably a great place to pick up chicks (gentlemen, write this down). the rolls were great. we split the coast crab, spicy scallop, and the ebi tempura. edamame was different in an awesome way - smokey. yum. oh the lava cake! it wasn't really a lava cake, but maybe more like a mousse or a ganache. either way, it was totes yummy. so a LOT of their rolls have either cream cheese or mayo (which i love) but my date wasn't too crazy about it. we got the ebi without the mayo to compromise, but it wasn't that good, in my opinion. i will definitely come back though. there were about 5 more rolls i wanted to try, but i wanted to get drunk so my date would be impressed with me. im classy. WAIT WAIT WAIT. i totes forgot. our waiter looked like ryan gossling!!!! my date loves him. so she couldn't help but stare a LOT. a LOT.  like, hello?? i'm your date!!!! it's okay, though, she brought me a gift which involved justin timberlake dancing and singing. i guess we're even.
