A good venue for coffee, and listen to quality music in the folk genre' . When there is a cover charge, it's fair. Lovely bar area, and eating area. If I had complaints, it would be two. Coffee's are a bit overpriced for the old style diner mugs they serve them in which were designed to give the illusion of a hearty heavy mug but scrimp on the liquid inside. I ordered a Cappucino and it was literally gone in two gulps, and the price wasn't cheap. They certainly need to serve an honest-sized cup of mud. Can those diner mugs. The other complaint is seating is limited in the bar area. If you don't have a spot at the bar, you're watchin, waggin and wishin...unless you like sitting on ottomans. But, it's a great place. Don't judge it by my crabby ass.
