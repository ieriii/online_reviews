Sadly, nothing special. More of a neighborhood gathering place/watering hole. Points for the simple decor. The menu selections sound very interesting but in execution are mundane. I think most of the rave reviews are from people who have not yet ever eaten at a real restaurant. The pork belly was dry as a dog bone. Service was OK, staff was nice, though I couldn't help but notice how some self-absorbed tables would occupy the server with inane banter for unseemingly lengths of time. Although not affected by this ourselves, it seemed inappropriate to act like you rented the server for your own table the entire evening and not share them with others who might be waiting to order. Of course the server could help by taking more charge of the situation. I would not recommend eating inside on a busy evening to anyone but the masochistically insane as the noise level is beyond pandemonium. Outside is nice. My wife enjoyed the Unibroue Maudite. Me, my tiny wine pour, not so much.
