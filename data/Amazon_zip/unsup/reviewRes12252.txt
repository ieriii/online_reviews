Phenomenal beer, and an escape from deep-dish-dom. Very good pizza, especially for those that like thinner style that you'd find on the east coast (Connecticut?), with good toppings, and not thick awful salty, oily cheese. The pizza is excellent, and lighter. My lactose-intolerant friend even liked it (probably had some lactase pill on hand somewhere). Beer is made by a guy named Jay Cutler, who is neither the football player nor the bodybuilder. Just a great beer maker. On of my favorites is the Cameltoe. Yes, the beers have strange names and blow away many well known micros you buy in the store. Live band karaoke makes this a good destination for out of town guests on Saturday night...I think it is Saturday night. Great as a sports bar too, where people don't get too obnoxious like at some of the northside sports bars. Usually has all the NFL games going on, as well as key baseball and college games. If you like binge-drinking bud light, gourging on cheap pizza and hot dogs, yelling your throat out at the tv's when watching cubs games...this is not the place for you.
