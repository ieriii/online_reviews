This was our first experience with Ethiopian food, and we are now big fans of it thanks to Demera! The service started out kinda iffy when the host told us there were no high chairs available even though we called ahead to reserve some. And, it took a while for a server to bring us menus and take our orders.However, things quickly improved. Food came out fast, everyone was SUPER nice, and overall we had a great time. No one seemed to mind that our table for 8 included 4 kids, and the host went out of his way to keep the toddlers entertained and happy.The food was awesome. I know I will be craving it again soon. We'll be back!!
