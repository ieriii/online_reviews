The food at Bonsoiree was terrific -- definitely 5 stars for that! The combinations of texture, flavor and appearance were inventive, yet accessible. Everything was fresh as could be and the presentations were whimsical works of art. The servers (two for the entire room -- almost aerobic!) were congenial and knowledgeable. The disappointments I had were associated with the space. For me, the dcor is way subpar relative to the food, and some of the tables are in little alleys that lead to the kitchen. Also, the room is NOISY when full -- partly due to oblivious diners who like to shout at one another, but mostly due to the hard surfaces and room layout. Loved the food, glad I tried it, but not sure I'll return...
