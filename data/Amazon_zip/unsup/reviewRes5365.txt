I was in Chicago last week visiting a friend. She brought me to the Purple Pig and it was so good we came back the very next night.  The menu has tons of interesting items, far too many to try in one night between 2 people. Even after two nights of indulgence, there were still many items left to try next time. The best thing about this place is the design of the menu. The portions are small and inexpensive (meant to be shared) so you can, and should, order 3 items per person (we got 4 so I could try more, haha) and get a taste of a lot of great food.  The wine list is extensive, over 50 selections available by the glass. Thankfully the bartender and server we had on our 2 visits were both very helpful in navigating it and making suggestions.  We tried many dishes, but I'll briefly highlight the stars Roasted Beets With Goat Cheese and Pistachios: Awesome dish, light and extremely flavorful Pork Blade Steak: AMAZING, a great combination of flavors Bone Marrow: this was a first for me, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I love bone marrow! Octopus: Another fantastically put together dish Honestly not one bad thing to say about this place; food, service, drinks, and atmosphere were all amazing! Its in a great location, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I know I'll be back next time I'm in Chicago.
