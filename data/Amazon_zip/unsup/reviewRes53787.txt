Worst bartender service ever. Go out of business and do all of us a favor. The one four-eyed bartender is a real piece of work. I look forward to seeing him working at McDonald's flipping hamburgers. What has this world come to where complete rude jerks without any educations are serving us alcohol and allowed to give us attitude. Al Capone would roll over in his grave. I can't wait to see the day when Green Mill is going out of business. It will be coming soon. The musicians will easily find a new gig to play at, where they actually aren't rude to their customers.
