The Publican was a great experience, but I won't be returning. Although they were super accommodating with my 3 phone calls adding more people to my reservation (5 people, 8pm on a Weds) we ended up waiting over 30 minutes for a table. Our server was great and very knowledgeable. However, I just cannot justify paying so much for such small portions of food. Yes, the food tasted great, but over 20 bucks for 4 thin strips of steak? Fourteen bucks for some strips of lox? Perhaps I don't have a fine enough palette, and I know most of their food is imported, but still. Seemed overpriced. Overall it was a good time, and the environment was fun and lively, but I just can't afford to spend a hundred bucks on appetizers!
