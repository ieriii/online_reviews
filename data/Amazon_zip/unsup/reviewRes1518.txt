This is NOT just another run-of-the-mill Chicago hot dog joint. Take a look at the web site and menu, and you'll see why. Add to that the friendly fun atmosphere, and you have yourself a truly unique establishment. I work nearby, and frequent Doug's for lunch - especially when having a bad day at the office, it always cheers me up. Be prepared to wait in long lines outside anytime on the weekends, and sometimes during peak lunch hours during the week, but it's well worth it. Vegetarians, never fear - veggie friends of mine have touted the veggie dog as one of the best they've ever head. Go now!
