I've been here a few times and every time, it's been great. The most recent visit was last week. There were four of us catching up (one of us was from out of town). We got there about 7 on a Thursday night and it was really busy. We had to wait for a four person table to open up. A couple groups of two went in while we waited, but the hostess was trying to figure something out for us. She created a kind of makeshift table for four at two of the high backed chairs, pulling up two stools for us to sit. About ten minutes later, a booth opened up, and we were promptly moved to be more comfortable. Much appreciated. The decor/ambiance is great. Very hip. There are dark, thick, textured curtains, tall-backed chairs, and lighting is dim. We saw a lot of dates happening that night. The best part of all is definitely the drinks. The menu is arranged by liqueur choice - gin, vodka, brandy, rum, tequila, etc. You really can't go wrong with any of the choices. My personal favorites from the night were: 1. Juliet & Romeo. A refreshing mix of Beefeater gin, mint, cucumber, and rose water. This may just be my favorite cocktail of all time. 2. Blue Ridge Manhattan. If you like whiskey, you'll love this drink. 3. Poor Liza. This one tastes like an alcoholic pear. Much better than a pear martini. I don't think they take reservations, so be prepared to wait if you go. But, it's worth the wait.
