Kinda standard for me. Had a large vegetarian selection, but not many things with tofu or mock meats (only 1 thing with veggie chicken and it was a cold dish). I ended up getting something with rice noodles and a boring description but it turned out pretty good. I asked for tofu and veggies and the tofu was super soft, like dessert tofu. Should have said bean curd instead. Still was good. bathroom smelled like a pack of cigarettes being smoked all at once. Kinda gross, above and beyond the normal bathroom smells. I didn't realize people still did the smoking in the bathroom thing. The owner guy was really friendly and quite the host. Made sure to interact with everyone and make sure they were ok. You can tell he's a character just watching him.  I'm not sure this will end up on my go-to list. I'll try a few other places in C-Town first, but I'll always be comparing them to this.
