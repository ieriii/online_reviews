10 stars. I like everything about Violet Hour except for the long lines. The room is designed so everyone feels like they're in a private area and the volume is perfectly suited for civilized conversation. Add to that the drinks are expertly crafted and the price is the same for every drink (don't you hate having to guess when you order a cocktail?), this is a slam dunk cocktail bar. This is the gold standard against which I compare all cocktail bars.
