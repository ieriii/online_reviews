My husband and I stopped for a bite at La Sze Chuan over the weekend after a stop in the neighborhood. I was craving Dim Sum, but I'm not at all familiar with any of the restaurants in Chinatown, so we decided to walk around til we saw something with pictures that we recognized (we are complete Chinese food novices). Unfortunately, we meant to go to the restaurant next door. But, we didn't realize that until we'd finished eating. So, we sucked it up and soldiered on through the entirely daunting million page menu. We were so confused by this point that we just ordered as basic as we could. I got the broccoli with garlic sauce plus tofu. Hubs got the kung pao chicken. Mine was good, but I would've preferred the tofu a lot firmer. I tried a bite of some of the veg in the kung pao and it tasted quite different than I remembered from kung paos of old. But, I have to hand it to them, all the vegetables in both dishes were very fresh. No canned mushrooms here! Even better, I had enough food for leftovers (although, they didn't include my rice with the rest of my leftovers...sad).
