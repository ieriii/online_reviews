Too bad you can't rate for certain characteristics. This is one of my favorite brewpubs anywhere, specifically because the building is awesome, the beer is better and they make a damn fine thin crust, regardless of how it's prepared. It's also not too often you find a brewery that focuses on such disparate styles of beers as weizens and hop-bombs, but that is definitely what they do, and quite well I might add. Just don't go during playoffs or final four or dinner on the weekends and you're solid. Oh, and the Sunday $25 for a large pie and growler is an unbelievable deal.
