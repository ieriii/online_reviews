Here for a few days in Chicago, I heard raves of the Purple Pig. Arrived at 8pm, and they were jammed packed. Waited for about an hour before getting seated.  Honestly, the food is definitely good, but not heads or shoulders above anyone else (Chicago or elsewhere). Went two nights ago, ordered 7 dishes (tapas), and frankly, I can only remember about few dishes or so...so lets review... 4.5* - Milk braised pork shoulder 3.5* - Bone Marrow Spread (This is supposedly their signature dish, but, didn't intrigue me. The olive oil overwhelmed the spread, and the entire dish did not impress) 4* - Wagyu Beef Meatballs Yes, I also did have their cheese - again, good, but did not blow my mind by any means. So at the end of the day...just another above average restaurant to add to the list.
