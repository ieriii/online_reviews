Ordered delivery based on the reviews from Grub Hub since it's been awhile since I've ordered from here. Was craving vegetables and ordered edema-me, crab rangoons and the veggie delight with chicken. All delicious and was exactly what I wanted! I am going to add Indie Cafe to the regular list and keep trying new dishes.
