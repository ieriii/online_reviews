WAY Overrated. I doubt I'll be back We had the Pepito torta, and Seafood caldo.  Even tho the Pepito was extremely tender, it had too mild a flavor, which was likewise for the caldo, The caldo's seafood was alright overall, but the muscles were overly ripe. With both items we felt under served. They gave us a seat in the corner that the bussers hit every time they came out from the dishroom Props for the unexpected beer selection tho - we were happy to add a Goose Island Matilda and Three Floyds Pride and Joy to our meal Would probably be 3 stars, but its overpriced for what is basically a soup and sandwich joint.  There was no line on a Wed at 7pm
