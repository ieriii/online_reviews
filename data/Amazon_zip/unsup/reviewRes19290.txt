My girlfriend and I had been anticipating Bad Apple from back when the construction was still underway and the teaser menu posted on the window. We stopped in on opening night over two years ago and continue to go on an average of once a week since. The burgers are inventive, original, consistent, and perfectly sized so that you are full but not in a coma. The pulled pork sandwich is the best I have ever had in Chicago, it is true backyard bbq and should not be overlooked. The beer selection is notoriously amazing, this is a true beer lovers restaurant. With so much great beer on tap it must be really hard to update the menus but they somehow manage to do this, putting nearly every other quality beer destination to shame. Since it would be impossible to update menus mid-day, you are ALWAYS told what is not on tap immediately by the staff. Just one of the many reasons that I would rate the service 10/10 every single time I have visited. Even the things I could care less about are above average. The decor/art/lighting are dark, comfortable, and a bit "metal"...in other words: perfect. Unlike a notable competitor, they are not actually blasting metal at full volume to a sea of people who have been waiting for 3 hours in an un-ventilated room. I love metal, but prefer to also be comfortable and speak at a normal volume to my friends. Maybe it's just me, but I like things like great burgers, great bbq, quality beer, great service, and overall comfort and by those standards The Bad Apple is the best restaurant in Chicago.
