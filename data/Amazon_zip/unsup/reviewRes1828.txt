While visiting Chicago, my friends decided I must try Hot Doug's. As we drove by looking for a parking spot, I was shocked to see that there was a LINE OUT THE DOOR. And it was RAINING, so everyone is huddled together with their umbrellas, waiting in the line that snaked around the corner. I thought, "WTF. This is just a hotdog place. It can't be THAT good." I was wrong. I thought that Costco's $1.50 hotdogs were heaven. Costco, I'm sorry. You just got crushed. We ordered the Elk and cheese hotdog, the Cajun Spicy Pork, and the Pheasant... all with specialty cheeses on them. And, of course, the duck fat fries. Trans fats? What trans fats!??! Really, it was the best hotdog I have ever eaten. The juicy, greasy meat, the blue cheese piled on, the rich, flavorful fries. And Doug, who took our order, was so nice and friendly. But, I really couldn't help but think of the fat that was slowly clogging my arteries, and that's what kept my 4 stars from being 5.
