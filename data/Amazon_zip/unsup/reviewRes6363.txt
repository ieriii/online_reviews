I visited Davanti for the first time on a Friday night, and although we got there around 8:30 pm, we had to wait 1 1/2 hours to be seated (party of 4). On the bright side, there's a cute little wine bar across the street (with a substantial martini menu as well), where we happily passed the time.  The food was very impressive! Definitely worth the wait. Our group tried the shaved hearts of palm salad, 2 pizzas, the burger, and the pasta with sea urchin. Each dish was fabulous. Will definitely be going back! Very cozy atmosphere as well.
