Pizza : Good, but not the best, not even in the top 10 in Chicago. I was disappointed because I was expecting awesome pizza. I guess I'm not accustomed to East Coast Pizza.  You do get generous portions however. The salads are huge, which is a plus. Beer: Very good. Specials througout the weekService: GoodOn the downside. Trafic is congested and parking is horrible. Hey, it's Wicker Park, what are you going to do.
