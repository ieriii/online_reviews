Everytime I walk by this place in the heart of Greektown, it is very crowded. So one morning, my brother and I went to see what the hype is all about. Overall, it was quite aiiight. I gave this a three star rating mostly because I feel that the quality of the food did not match the price of the food, which was expensive for breakfast. I could have gotten my omelet somewhere else that was cheaper for the same taste. The atmosphere wasn't worth it either because it was small and crowded. One thing I would recommend though, as trivial as it sounds, is their jam. It tastes very fresh and like actual raspberries and blueberries. Very, very good.
