Being a self-proclaimed breakfast connoisseur, I couldn't have been more pleased with Yolk. I had read so many great things about this place but had never been in the area at the right time to enjoy it. I spent my Memorial Day in the area and was able to start my day off here. My boyfriend and I stopped in and waited a little less than an hour but boy, was it worth it! I had the Stuffed French Toast and my boyfriend chose the traditional Eggs Benedict..both were absolutely delicious. While the wait was a little long, they really move people in and out quite quickly and it is an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend Yolk!
