Alright driving by this place you can smell that's it gonna be good. I've been here 3 times and everytime it just gets better. Although kind of expensive it's very well worth every penny and then some. The salad bar is good but really? It's a freakin top notch steak place save room for the good stuff. Service is cool too .... guys with swords...come on now... all kinds of meat you can dream of and it's cooked very well indeed!! And you can have as much as you want as long as your coaster thing is turned over....very creative by the way! I think I'll be coming here much more in the future!!
