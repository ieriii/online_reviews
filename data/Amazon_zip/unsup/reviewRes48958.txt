I don't really get the hype about this place. OK, so I don't eat any pork product and I can't understand the pork craze that has been popular lately but I suppose it's nice for pork enthusiasts to have a very nice restaurant to go to to get their pork fix. Great beer list, just OK on the wine and the only real complaint was their dessert menu...it hardly exists. I would imagine it's not even necessary after a full pork meal, I think most people roll out of this restaurant. I had the beet salad and it was very good. The space is very unique and appealing but there is no way I will return. Sorry Publican.
