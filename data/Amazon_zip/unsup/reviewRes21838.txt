Little bit pricier than most hot dog joints, but you don't just come here for the food. This place is an institution, I grew up not far from here and it is a taste of home. Great dogs, but the shakes are hands-down the best thing on the menu. Definitely good for a stop if you're in the neighborhood. addendum: just went here yesterday, giant metal devil horns for the dogs and malts! \m/ \m/
