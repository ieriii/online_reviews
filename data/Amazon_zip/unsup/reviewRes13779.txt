I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. This place is mediocre. The beer is, at best, the workings of a novice home brewer. I tried 3 of their beers: the IPA, Scotch Ale, and Wit. All were watery and tasteless. For food, we had bruschetta, bacon popcorn, fish and chips, and goulash. None of them were memorable in anyway. We were also quoted a 1 hour wait, which wound up being 10 minutes. I understand the confusion considering its a new place, but that's a hell of an overestimation.
