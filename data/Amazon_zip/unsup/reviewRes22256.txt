We just had another FANTASTIC catering experience from Irazu. From the first phone call to the delivery. - AMAZING. So courteous, pleasant to speak with, and AFFORDABLE. They have a really great team over there! The food was delicious, our staff loved the sandwiches, guacamole, plantains and chips. It was a real crowd pleaser. I personally love to frequent the restaurant, but am glad that the catered food is just as excellent as what you get on-location. We look forward to using Irazu again in the future! I
