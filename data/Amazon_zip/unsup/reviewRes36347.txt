Starved, I eagerly awaited my lunch; It arrived quicker than promised, which was good -- I was famished! While I didn't have as much of a tip as I usually give I paid the young man and promised to give more next time. Now, Unwrapping my food?  OMG!! I have loved crab rangoon since I was introduced to it 10 years ago. This is *easily*  the BEST Crab Rangoon -- in the WORLD!! It's wrapped so nicely -- the only thing missing is little ribbon bows!! Quite honestly, they look like little presents!  I will be back again and again -- Thank you Indie Cafe!!
