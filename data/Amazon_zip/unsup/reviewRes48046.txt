Finally had dinner here last week, and I might have to convert to a dinner girl here! (From brunch, which I already raved about). The Publican does everything from scallops to hamachi to pork belly perfectly. And they have Zombie Dust on tap! A win. Don't skip dessert! The belgian waffle (same recipe as used at brunch) is amazing, as is the chocolate cream pie.
