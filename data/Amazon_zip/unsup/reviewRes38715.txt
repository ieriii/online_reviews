You can order with a blindfold and just point your finger anywhere on the menu - all the dishes have unique twist. I always crave the steamed mussels. They come with fries & garlic mayonnaise - plus a crunchy baguette to sop up the sauce. Big fat menu of Belgian beers. The upstairs bar is nice and roomy in case you have to wait for a table.
