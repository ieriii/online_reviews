This place used to be my favorite bar. Not too crowded, free baskets of pretzels & chips, Huge beer selection ($1 Huber Bock!), and a wonderful jukebox (45's I think).  Now don't get me wrong, the Beer is still great, but there is no more jukebox in the main bar, and the addition of food, good though it may be, made the place way to crowded and loud. Finally more so than now, the staff can be extremely conceited. You can get sneered at for ordering a beer that is less than $7 or $8. Or conversely, when asking how much a expensive beer is, your response might be "More than you can afford".  The bartenders on two separate occasions, didn't know what a silver dollar (Sacagawea or Susan B. Anthony) was. They almost didn't accept them. The first time they though it was play money, and the second time thought it was a quarter and I had to make him look two times to get him to understand. All in all, during the day, or week night with the right bartender, this can be an amazing place. If you can ignore the staff, and the crowds, add two stars.
