5 STARS for the food and atmosphere. 1 -2 STARS for the continually lackluster and un-attentive service each time I have returned. The food is one of the only reasons that I keep coming back, and their unique cocktail list. The outdoor patio is cute and comfy, but for some reason, the most un-attentive and nowhere to be found servers normally get this section. Why, I will never understand. I have been to this location at least 6 times, and while I absolutely love the food and drinks, and the atmosphere, the service all but one time has been mediocre to not there at all. And the gal I got for my best service experience was a shorter gal with brown hair that sometimes wears a bohemian looking skirt. She rocks! Sorry that I forgot your name. Other than her, the other servers have been memorable more for their mistakes. I have had to ask for water, silverware, steak knives, spoons, wait a long time to order, wait a long time to get the check, etc, etc. Also, one night we went there and sat outside for dinner, looked at the menu for about 25 -30 minutes before our server actually acknowledged us to take our order. And as I went to order the much anticipated Trout, she informed me that they were out of it. I can't stand that!!! Also, on that same night, I ordered a martini and she brought the shaker out to the table to pour it there. As she was pouring, the top part of the shaker fell into my martini glass. I'm no germ-a-phoebe, but she didn't apologize or even ask me if maybe I wanted a new martini. She stuck her hands into my glass and retrieved the shaker, like it was no biggie. It was gross. Ultimately, we had one of the best meals of our life that night, so again, they are always redeemed by their food. But, someone needs to train the servers properly on better server standards.
