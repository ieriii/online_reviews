After a thoroughly enjoyable first-time experience at Uncommon Ground with my fiance, we just can't shake this place from our minds. We try to expand our horizons and eat at other restaurants, but we undoubtedly always say "we should have just gone to Uncommon Ground" or "This dish was soooooo much better at Uncommon Ground."  I can't quit you, U.G.!!! We live nearby and always stop in for some fabulous drinks on the weekend even if we aren't eating. They're so good about mixing up drinks with herbs/fruits that are in season. And we always end up encouraging other people at the bar who are "just stopping in for a drink" to try the food because it is incredible. I need to stop eating anywhere else. I am always disappointed that other restaurants can't even start to compete with the dishes at Uncommon Ground - simple but HUGE flavor.
