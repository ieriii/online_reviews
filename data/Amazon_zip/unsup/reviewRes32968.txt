I don't know why this place doesn't have higher ratings.  I came in at a busy time but was greeted nicely and seated promptly by a nice gentleman. I ordered a South of the Border Benny's (I think that's what it's called) and it rocked my world. The chorizo and Hollandaise on it was perfect and it came out VERY fast. Their service is just great. I also ordered a side of bacon, not realizing that their portions are very big. It was so good that I managed to eat everything still. The restaurant style is very modern and the bathroom is very clean. Please come to California!
