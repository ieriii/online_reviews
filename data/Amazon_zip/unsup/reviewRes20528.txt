Wow, what a great lunch experience. We stopped by for a Friday lunch, on a day off work, and checked it out. We ate up at the bar, and the bartender was super friendly and attentive. I had heard about the Scotch Egg appetizer, so we tried it out, and it was delicious!! Overall, the menu was a refreshing change from your average pub food menu. I really enjoyed my truffled ham sandwich, and my fiance loved his salmon club sandwich. It was a great atmosphere, and if you're downtown at Millennium Park, you can't beat the location. It's a nice alternative to the Park Grill, in my opinion. There is a small patio out front, too, for al fresco dining.
