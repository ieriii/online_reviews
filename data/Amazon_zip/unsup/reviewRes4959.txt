Came here on a Thursday night. Service was quick and friendly (but nothing noteworthy). I enjoyed the Roasted Bone Marrow, as it reminded me of pho (because of the cilantro and onions) without the broth and noodles. I preferred to eat the dish without adding sea salt though. Also, the mussels were delicious! The broth was savory and the temperature was perfect. I really enjoyed coming here. The ambience was quaint and cozy, albeit the music was a bit loud. It's a small place, but a nice wine bar to wind down and have a bite to eat. Their dessert menu was a little small and sounded unappetizing. Soft serve ice cream? Bleck. 4 stars because, yes, I'm a fan (of everything except their dessert menu).
