I'm usually not a fan of the big conglomerate hotel chains and much prefer the smaller local places... but when i looked it seemed that this was the most bang for the buck. I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel has an updated style and a modern feel. The check in was a little confusing to me, but that's probably b/c i live in a place that doesn't normally have basements and such.  The hotel lobby has a modern water - statue thing that was pretty neat looking till my bf said that it resembled an urinal... uhm, there goes that modern feel! lol. nevertheless, my initial take was that the lobby was clean and comfortable. The suites are well maintained and clean. The bathroom was updated with granite counters; unfortunately, they didn't update the whole thing and the wall paper was peeling a little, but it wasn't a huge deal. Otherwise, the bathroom was fine. Love that they had a microwave in the room, esp. with all those HUGE Chicagan portions!  Really loved that they have a managers reception with free drinks and snacks at 5:30 - 7:30. Helped me finish some reports before i starved to death before dinner!  The gym was ok, on the small side, but it had most of the equipment one needs. The pool was a lap pool, but there were kids in the pool that didn't treat it as such, so i didn't try it out. Breakfast was fast, lots of choices. Overall, a great location, great price and good service. Only thing keeping from the 5 star rating was that the business center was incredibly small (3 computers, one printer) and they charge for internet which i think is ludicrous in any hotel!
