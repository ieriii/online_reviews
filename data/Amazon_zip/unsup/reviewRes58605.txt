We decided to try this place because of the name. But we'll go back to this place because of the beer list, friendly service, and the amazing and unique burgers -- and I'm a vegetarian! The decor is kinda Snow White meets tormented art student. Our server was very helpful in narrowing down the overwhelming selection of beers (which also could be chosen on interesting names alone ... ie the cereal killer).This place is known for their burgers, but I'm a vegetarian and even I walked away smiling! They're veggie burger can be substituted in any of the burgers on the menu -- I certainly didn't want to miss out on a burger topped w/corn salsa and avocado. The veggie burger is made out of chickpeas and yummy spices, with the consistency kind of like a falafel. Delish, is really all you need to know. Next time, I'm trying those cheese curds!
