Demera was awesome! We went last night after waiting entirely too long. We've been in Uptown for almost a year and I've wanted to go since the first time walking by the place.  We did the meat and vegetarian messob for two.  We knew we HAD to have the ye-misir wot because I love Ethiopian red lentils. We also had ye-shimbra assa, and shiro as our vegetarian dishes. For our meat, we had doro wot, doro alicha wot, and spicy michetabish. It comes with a house salad in the middle. Everything was yummy. The reason I'm not giving the place five stars is that everything was essentially the same texture. I've had Ethiopian food elsewhere and the lentils still had bite-- they weren't mush. Aside from the little chickpea dumplings and the drumstick, everything was almost.. blended.  Also, I hate that, even when you order for two, you only get one drumstick with the doro alicha wot. Fortunately, I was with my husband and it's not awkward to split a chicken drumstick. Had I been with a person I didn't know so well, one of us probably wouldn't have had any. Overall, the food was pretty freakin' fantastic. We could have consumed the entire meal, but did leave a little bit (a few square inches of injera and a bit of one of the meat entrees) on the platter. The server seemed to be surprised by how much food we consumed. Pretty much all of the other diners had quite a bit left on the plate. The portions of each dish aren't particularly huge, but with all of the injera one consumes in the process of eating the actual veggies and meat, it's a ton of food.  My husband ordered the hot tea, which was delightful. It was quite like chai, spicy and fragrant. We loved it.  The food is super flavorful and delicious. Make sure if you go, you take people with whom you're fairly comfortable. It's kind of intimate, for lack of a better word, to eat everything with your fingers. I'll certainly return, and I hope it's soon!
