Really good deep dish and I love that you can order pizza by the slice-what a great concept! One of the best deep dish pizzas I've ever had-fresh and perfect mix of ingredients. Come and ask for the pizza that just came out of the oven because you don't want one that has been sitting there for an hour or so under the light.
