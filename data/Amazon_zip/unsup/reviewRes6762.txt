One of the best dinners I have ever had! My boyfriend and I had been to Q before but this time they stepped it up even more, which is hard to believe! I hosted a dinner for my boyfriend's graduation and invited 16 of his friends. Mary Catherine, the event coordinator, set up everything for us including a set menu with our top picks and was there to see that we had everything we needed. She introduced us to our wait staff and everyone couldn't have been nicer or more attentive.  Our menu included: Hush puppies - delish Wings - Spicy Briskey - yum! competition ribs - my fav!  mac n cheese - tables fav cornbread - must get beans - very tasty carrot cake - if you like carrot cake its a must try sauces - amazing! i loved them all But by dessert everyone was so full it was hard to finish the cake, but we all tried! The set menu was only $40 a person which is a fantastic deal. Plus they box up all the leftovers which is a win win. Definitely give Q a chance to host your large party, they do a wonderful job!
