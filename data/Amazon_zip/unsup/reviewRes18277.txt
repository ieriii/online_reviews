I can't believe how long it took me to get here! Now that I've been, I'll be returning often! Great atmosphere, great service, great food. I had the Earthly, and it was to die for. Why isn't truffled goat cheese on everything!?!?! It's freaking amazing. Bf seemed to enjoy the Slowburn, and we both loved the fries. Good and crispy, with a bunch of different seasoning options. Plus craft beers for very reasonable prices - how can you go wrong?? The burgers definitely aren't as big as some places, but they're not as expensive either. And considering that burgers make pretty terrible left overs, I'm a much bigger fan of this method.
