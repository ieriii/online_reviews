I'm completely twitterpated. with Fox & Obel. The grocery (ok, aside from being pricey) is beautifully stocked with goodies from near and far. I can just sit and stare into the prepared foods case, or smell each and every bag of coffee that they carry. Even if I'm just stopping by for a "quick shop" though I NEED to go to the cafe here. The cafe space is cozy with great windows overlooking the street (you can watch doggies frolicking in the park or tourists on their way out to Navy Pier). I was a fan of the lunch and dinner here (the sandwich & salad combo is a must) but now I'm also a fan of breakfast! The coffee is strong and there's a wide variety of menu items. The wait was a wee bit longer for breakfast than at lunch or dinner but maybe that has to do with the complexity of certain egg dishes? I am an oatmeal convert now though...the huge bowl was garnished with chopped banana and a maple cream topping (if you skip that you're either crazy or diabetic).
