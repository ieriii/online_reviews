pretentious? you found it right in the center of tourism. but now that you're ready for that, embrace it, and the staff will play along. foodies will love the apps, the grape selection is sometimes flat, but hey, there's still about 50 or so bins by the glass, so enjoy. if you don't like, spit. cheers, steve
