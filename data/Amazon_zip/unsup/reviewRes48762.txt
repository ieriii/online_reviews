This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The brunch is fabulous, the dinner is even more fabulous. Every person I have ever brought here has also fell in love. I literally have not has a bad dish here and I have eaten here more times than I care to admit, which is why I am giving a five star review. Some highlights have been the waffle...whether for brunch or dessert at dinner, is one of the best things I have ever tasted. The duck hearts are amazing, as well as the farm chicken with summer sausage. And of course, the fries with the egg on top are to die for.   The entire staff is lovely, especially Katie who remembers us every time we come in. The Publican will remain a favorite go-to spot for amazing food and great atmosphere.
