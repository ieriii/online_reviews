All right. My bf and were headed to the Congress to catch some bands and, as always, had the "where to eat" conversation. I read some reviews of the Revolution and decided to give it a try. Bacon fat popcorn. Uh...yes please. We got there about 4pm and had a very short wait...maybe 20 minutes. Good music was playing as we stood by the fireplace, people-watching. We saw some employees arranging some tables by the front window and we looked at each other, hoping that we'd score one of those, away from the really crowded dining room. Minutes later..."Bob?" Yes!!! We sat down and checked out the menu, which I'd already looked at online...I perused the beer menu and went with the Belgian Wit which had an orange zesty taste...very good for those that enjoy a lighter-tasting beer. We got the bacon fat popcorn. Sweet Jesus. I wanted to just stick my face in it. Really. It was almost embarrassing. I could stop there and say no more. It was that good. The bacon. The Parmesan. My eyes are glazing over now.... I digress... We also got the wings for a starter. They were good, as well. For entrees, I got the fish and chips which were really good...the fish portions were huge...I couldn't eat all that food. And the fries were so fresh. Excellent. My bf got a burger and said it was excellent. Our meal was topnotch. The food was great. I would've given then five stars had the service been better. After we were initially seated, no one came to the table for about 20 minutes. Then, we waited the same amount of time for our drinks, appetizers, etc. It wasn't that they were that busy because they have other people running their food to the tables. Not sure what the deal was but that was kind of the downer to the whole thing. We weren't too bummed about it though because, well, the food and beer were good! I can overlook a lot of things for good food, good beer, and great conversation.
