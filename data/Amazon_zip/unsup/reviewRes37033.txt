Dear F&O - You've always been slow. You've always been expensive.  But low quality and rotten???? But now....the meat department is a disaster. I used to love your pork and beef, but the last two have been really quite unimpressive. You forgot to cut the spine out of my pork chops and I nearly sliced my hand off at home. Your veggies and fruits seem to spoil on the walk home. You're my closest grocery store - but frankly I'll make the hike to the new kid in town if this is the standard you're holding yourself to.
