This hotel is pretty good for travel on leisure, especially if you are trying to save money on a group, but it falls short on business travel. Basically, I care about three things when travelling: 1. Free Internet 2. A good gym 3. A good breakfast The internet here both cost money and was difficult to set up. The gym was OK for a hotel, but still not great. The breakfast seemed pretty good though. My suite was fine and actually quite large. Overall, it's definitely a good value, especially for downtown Chicago, but I don't think I'll be coming back here when I'm in town on business.
