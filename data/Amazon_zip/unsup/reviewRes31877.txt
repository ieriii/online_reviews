I went here with a large group of friends for my birthday. It's pretty hard to find good Filipino food around the city, let alone a place that would make fancier plates of it.  Amongst the group of 15 people, there was not one dish I did not like. The sushi was good, but nothing I would crave out of the blue. The Filipino dishes were delicious. Great use of prime ingredients with the traditional flavor. The menu prices were decent, not too ridiculous. Portion wise, its what you can expect from any fusion/fine dining restaurant. The restaurant seemed almost like a lounge with a lot of seated guests. It was pretty loud and the crowd was there to party.  I would definitely go back anytime for the adobo pork bellies, crispy pata, and a cold hitachino.
