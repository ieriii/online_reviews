$50 cancellation fee PER PERSON!! I made a last-minute reservation at TRU for 9PM(table would have gone unused), changed my mind and when I called to cancel, they said they would charge $100 for the late cancellation!!!! I called back and talked to the manager and after debate, he cancelled my reservation without charge. I personally find this fee excessive, but appreciate their waiver. Here is their confirmation email from OpenTable, sounds like it was written by an English professor in the 19th century: Thank you for your reservation at TRU. Please be apprised of the following: 1. Jackets are required for gentleman at all times in all areas of TRU.  2. There is no smoking in any area of TRU. 3. We call to confirm all reservations. If no confirmation is received by the date of the reservation we will have presumed that youE(tm)ve made other dining arrangements. 4. Your dining experience will be two to three hours depending on your menu selection. 5. Valet parking is available. 6. With courtesy and respect to all guests please refrain from the use of cell phones or pagers within TRU. 7. Dessert reservations can only be made by calling TRU.
