Get ready for a fun and unique experience! First of all, don't go overboard on the salad bar - you'll need room for all the meat you'll eat! Staff members are literally running around with giant skewers of meat, and offering cuts of it to anyone who is ready for more. There are a large number of choices, and it's almost guaranteed you'll be able to try every one to find your favorites. The meat is available in different temperatures on the same skewer, depending on where the server cuts it, so I who enjoys medium rare got my wish, while the guy next to me who enjoyed medium well also got his. The service was impeccable. Our sides were constantly being refilled (sweet caramelized bananas, yummy mashed potatoes, and plantains), even if they weren't completely empty! And we were almost never in want of more meat. I have never left a restaurant feeling so full - I'm not exaggerating! We'll definitely be going back. We LOVE this place!
