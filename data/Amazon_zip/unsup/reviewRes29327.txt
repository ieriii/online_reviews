I'm usually hesitant about places my girlfriend loves and rants about because sometimes we don't have the same taste. But Opart is simply delicious, we came on a Tuesday afternoon and the place only had a few people here, so we war able to sit with no one around us, we decided to order the crab rangoon witch she is always raving about and the were good really good. For our main meal I ordered Pad Preow Wan (Sweet and Sour) and she ordered Pad See-Iew and the only complain is that I wish the portions were more bigger and if the vegetables were cut smaller. I definitely recommend coming to eat here you will not be disappointed.
