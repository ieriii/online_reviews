Stayed in the "Motor Inn" section of the hotel. While the appointments were nice and everything was clean there were a few issues with the room, which should be addressed by the management.  First... the walls are like cardboard. I could hear everything my neighbors were saying, even though they were speaking at normal level. Fixing this would require sound insulation in the walls, during your next remodel. Second... there was a constant roaring sound coming from the bathroom vent, presumably from a fan. While the noise might not be that noticeable during the day, at night when everything is quiet, it becomes very noticeable and very annoying. Just get a new, quieter fan. I've read other reviews that complained about this as well. Third... get firmer mattresses. The mattress was a very cheap, weak mattress. The kind that squishes down to about 30% of its initial height. This makes for a very uncomfortable night sleep and a sore back the next day. With the above changes, this hotel could go from being second rate, to a real first class establishment.
