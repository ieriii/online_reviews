I was desperate for some authentic Cuban food in Chicago since Seattle's sole purveyor of real Cuban cuisine - the guy who had a food truck on Greenwood Ave - sold the truck to focus on his band. 90 Mile Cuban Cafe satisfied about 75% of my black-rice-braised-pork fantasies. This places looks as I imagine Cuba to be: festive music, big white lights strung along the rafters, a mural with dark-skinned woman with pendulous breasts ... I felt the pressure to order something good since it was to be my one visit - I went with a classic Cubano sandwich with a side of moros (black beans and rice). We got tostones, maduros, and yucca to share. My brother and sister also got sandwiches - beef for my brother, and something with plaintains instead of bread for my sister. The food was good, but my expectations were so high I felt only "eh". The sandwich was solid, but not memorable. The moros was disappointingly dry. My brother's beef sandwich was the best. The fried appetizers were all tasty but not to-die-for. We finished with flan, which I suspect was not house-made. Ultimately, I will remember this place for its fantastic name and ambiance more than its food.
