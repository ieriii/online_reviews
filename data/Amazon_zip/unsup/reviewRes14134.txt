they re open till 10 :) ordered the tuna --AWESUM and stuergon sorry about my spelling. it was ok - really good sauce. they serve the entrees w/ aspargus, lemon, red skinned seasoned potatoes & sum have dipping sauces. very good sized portions. we also had a really good salad. if i was hungrier i wouldve ordered sum soup. - i will next time. its right under the montrose el stop....but its not too loud. BYOB, so thats cool. & they serve lotsa cereal, although a bowl of it costs almost 5 bux....which is guess is ok cuz it comes w/ fruit. im not a cereal person though.... anywho, i'll be back cuz i need 2 try the scallops, ribs, crabcakes & french onion soup.....or all u can eat crab legs   HA!
