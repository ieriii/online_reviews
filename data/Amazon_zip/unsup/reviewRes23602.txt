I love this restaurant! I've tried three others in Greek Town, & this is the ONLY one I return to time & again. The place is huge, with 4 or 5 separate dining areas. I think they even have an outside area, but I've never sat outside, so I could be wrong. Their tzatziki is the BEST, as is their fasolakia. I order the same "meal" every time I go: Fasolakia, Tzatziki with a couple warm pita, & Saganaki. Seriously, what more could you ask for? :o) Oh yeah, everyone that goes with me orders other items, & they enjoy them as well.
