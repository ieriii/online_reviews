3.5 :) Their oatmeal shakes are a MUST. So good. But my friend told me it just tasted like rice water? Huh? Anyway, I got mine made w/soy milk :) mMm. Btw, I got it for free by mentioning yelp ;) I got the tilapia. It was O-K. Love their condiments/sauces though. My friends got the pepito sammich and the milanesa. Both thought it was O-K. I'm def going to come back to try the potato tacos.. sounds interesting/I never had mole! I want to come back when they have dining alfresco!
