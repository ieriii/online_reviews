The food here is amazing. And the decor is modern yet recycled. It appears that much of the light fixtures and wall treatments are re used bits and pieces of recycled building materials. way to go green on the decor folks! it looks awesome and can hopefully remind folks that great new things can be made out of great old stuff! This is a large space and would be great for a happy hour after work gathering, or a birthday party dinner. Although I am not sure if the take reservations Locally produced fresh ingredients; I like that there is a blurb on there menu about the family farm and there efforts to provide local sustainable food. Some great modern twists on good 'ol classics. e.g the blue cheese potato salad; a traditional potato salad, with a healthy helping of blue cheese! So good, and a great tip for my own homemade potato salad. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a mustard Cole slaw. I love pulled pork and coleslaw, and I thought the combination of tender spicy juicy pork bits and sweet tangy coleslaw atop a warm fresh golden brown kaiser bun, were spot on! My friends ordered the fish and chips; they were both very pleased. The fish tasted fresh, and the homemade tartar sauce was perfect. Excellent service, friendly, fast and efficient! I know this is a Brewery, but we did not try the Beer, so please note this is a review on the food, decor and service only. We had a delicious lunch and were so happy that we discovered Revolution Brewing Co. Thank you yelp!
