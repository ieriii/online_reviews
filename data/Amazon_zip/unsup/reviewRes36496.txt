This place is special. The skillet I ordered was spectacular. I've never had egg whites that fluffy and the rest of the ingredients were absolutely delicious. The potatoes, avocado, jalepenos, cheese and onions in the rest of the skillet were perfect. Additionally, the decaf coffee was as rich as one would find in any specialty coffee bar. Lastly the decor was warm and the wait staff very attentive. 5 stars all the way!
