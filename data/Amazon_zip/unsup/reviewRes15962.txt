I give the food 4 stars but the lack of adequate service gives Carnivale a bad rating. I get it, you service hundreds of people but that doesn't mean that you forget about the small tables. Perhaps it was just my waitress? Or Maybe it's too big for it's own good. I will not step food in Carnivale again..... thanks for the bad service.
