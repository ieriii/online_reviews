We have never stayed there but my wife loves the lobby scene and they pour one helluva drink in the lobby bar, so we just go and hang there, have drinks and enjoy the feeling of a past century. I took my boys in there once and they spent a long time going up and down the escalators. Eventually we were very politely asked to stop the game. They were so nice about it my youngest remarked on how if I yelled at him like that Security guy, he'd listen to me better. It probably helped that the guy was six six and never unfolded his arms, kind of reminded me of the jolly green giant, except darker...
