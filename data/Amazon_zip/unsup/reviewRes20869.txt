love this place. sandwiches are so good! on my third time here i finally got a chance to try the soup - not too impressed. going to stick w/ the sandwiches. the churros are pretty good too but i prefer the ones from churro factory (in pilson i believe?) the hot chocolate is just not for me. not sure what exactly it is, maybe i should give it another shot. but i liked the rich hot chocolate they had at "hot chocolate" a lot better - probably just to satisfy my sweet tooth. i saw rick bayless here when i came so i liked that it's not just a restaurant he puts his name on to make some money but actually cares about quality control.
