This is one of the best places I have ever gone out to eat at and trust me I have gone out to eat at too many restaurants. I have always fancied myself as a man who loves a good steak. A well done filet mignon is exactly what will put me in a good mood after a long day of work. The vibe inside of the restaurant is incomparable. We sat next to the 2 story wine cellar which was spectacular! The whole time there was an acrobat inside who was performing mesmerizing twirls. I have travelled all over the world; however, I have never come across anything like this.Now onto the food, wow! After splitting a delicious bottle of wine with my business partners, we decided to flip over our circles and start eating. The men who brought the different kinds of steaks and chickens were very skilled. Not only did they cut the meats impeccably but they also accommodated us when I requested a well done piece which they didn't have. Not to mention the buffet table was delicious! I am a huge fan of sauted mushrooms and was pleasantly surprised to find that they had it!Overall, this was a great experience and I plan on bringing my family next time! I can only imagine how excited my 18 and 14 year old sons will be, not to mention I'm sure my wife will love the ambiance.
