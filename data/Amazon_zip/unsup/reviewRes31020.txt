This place is As Good As It Gets! The food is beyond words. We were greeted by the manager as well as the chef during our time there. We were celebrating my birthday, and the chef treated my whole table to shots of sake! I've never had such wonderful service, and even when we were putting our coats on to leave, the manager came back to say goodbye and even remembered our names. I thought that was a great touch to the evening.
