My closest encounter to Costa Rica was the South Park episode with Jennifer Aniston, so I can't claim to know if it tastes like authentic Costa Rican food or not. However I've been there twice now, and the food is incredibly tasty! It's different from Cuban and other cuisines.  The Empanadas were good, a little heavy on the crust but they were good and I'd order them again. I had their Milanese Sandwich which was a fantastic combination of flavors in a unique sandwich you can't get anywhere else! Flank Steak breaded and fried with their mustard and mayo, lettuce and tomato! Yum. The Yuca fries are AWESOME and I highly recommend them! Popular in Cuban restaurants too, I thought these were every bit as good as Habana Libre! In the past I've had their pork-chop which really had some unique flavors that made the pork taste really come out and altogether tender...and I devoured every bit of it.  The atmosphere is really comfortable. The lamp warmers make it cozy in the winter and the bachelorette party, particular the bride, was helpful in helping me throw up my dinner so I could eat another entree....well....almost.....God bless the man that marries her. They say marry for the cooking, and not looks. The looks go down, but the cooking can only improve with age. And if not, there's always Irazu!!!
