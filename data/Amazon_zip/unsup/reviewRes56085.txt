This place was referred to me by a friend in the city. She told me they have the best hot dogs and a cool drive in setting so I decided to check it out. I think the food was great, but these prices!?!?! A hot dog and fries was almost $5. $5! I admit, they use real cool packaging and the dog was very tasty, but the price was a bit much. It seems like you can't get a decent meal there for less than $8. It's a hot dog place...
