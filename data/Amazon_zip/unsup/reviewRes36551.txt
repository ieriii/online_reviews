This place rocked! The inside of the restaurant was beautifully decorated which gave off a good first impression. As I sat down and looked over the menu, I was torn. One side of the menu offered Thai food while the other side offered sushi. What to do... what to do... Pondering my decision, I made a quick scan around the room. There was a big group celebrating at a table in front of us. They definitely were members of the cool kids club. I wouldn't mind being a voyeur for a few moments but my stomach had its own ideas. Looking back at the menu I decided to get the sweet potato roll and the salmon and avocado rolls. The consistency of the sushi tasted spongey but in a good way. I don't think I've ever tasted sushi like this before. My girlfriend had a couple of pieces of salmon with quail eggs on top. That was awesome! I don't think I can get sushi with quail eggs in Houston. As I though about that fact, I got sad.
