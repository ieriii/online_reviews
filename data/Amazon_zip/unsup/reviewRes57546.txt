Food was just OK. The restaurant has an oil smell, and the food doesn't justify the price. We had better fondue on the Melting Pot. Stay away from this trap.In addition to at most an average experience on the food, the most unacceptable and disappointing thing happened to us. At arrival we used valet parking. My husband left his sunglasses in the car. When we arrived back home he noticed his sunglasses disappeared. We called the restaurant right after getting home and their response was that their employees are honest and would never do that. Well, they did and probably will do it again. Don't be the next victim and don't support business that don't respect their customers.
