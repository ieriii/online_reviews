This is probably my favorite place in all of Chicago. And the Greek Islands is definitely the Best Greek Restaurant in Greek Town and beyond. No Doubt about it. The Dish to get is the swordfish shishkabob. I've eaten here hundreds of times. Its the best. Trust me. My brother loves the Arnie Fornu (Spelling?) which is delicious lamb. But the Swordfish shishkabob is it. The atmoshphere is great. Very noisy, very open. Multiple tiers of seating. All of the employees are greek. They are all extremely friendly. There is free Valet parking too. Which only adds to the enjoyment. There can be a wait sometimes and they don't take reservations but its still worth waiting. The Nostos, cheap red house wine, is very good for the price and a nice compliment to a lot of the dishes. You should order the saganaki just for the "Opa!" Factor, the waiter will light the cheese on fire and exclaim opa! The smapler appetizer plater is very good. I love their salmon spread and tzaziki. You'll also love how the bus boys clean your bread crumbs (from the delicious loaf of fresh bread you'll be dipping in olive oil) briskly from the table with a metal hand sweep. I've been with amanda and she's had the pastichio, which is very good and enough to feed 3. I've also tried some of the lamb kabobs and the chicken. They're all great (but no swordfish). The helpings are very large and most come with a side of rice and potato. So bring your appetite. You will not go home hungry and you'll feel like you were at a big greek house party the whole time you're dinning. If you go and don't get the sworfish shishkabob. Go a second time, get the swordfish shishkabob and then tell me I was right. This is a can't miss place. Go with friends. Then go back alone.
