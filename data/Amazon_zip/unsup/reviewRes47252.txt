A year ago, I listened for months as a friend raved about Lockdown's food and beer selection, but was kind of thrown off by the super loud metal music gushing out the front door each time I walked past. When I finally made the leap and had dinner/beers at the Lockdown, I realized what a total dufus I'd been! Gah! Just a few of the things that make Lockdown special: -nice draft list (albeit not extensive, includes Daisy Cutter, Three Floyds rotating, Bells Two Hearted, etc.) -RIDICULOUSLY TASTY angus burgers on pretzel buns; the border patrol (pepper jack, spicy roasted peppers, carnitas, and avocado) might be my favorite burger ever -great hand cut fries, OR fresh side salads with a nice selection of dressing for your sandwich/burger side -great weekly specials, especially Tuesday (half-price burgers--after 6:30 p.m. expect a wait) and Thursday (half-price drafts) -sure, it gets loud in there, but that's because Lockdown plays full-length concert DVDs (pretty cool, even if you're not a hard rock/metal fan), AND they'll put on the game if you want Now somehow, my burger tastes better while listening to Pantera.....
