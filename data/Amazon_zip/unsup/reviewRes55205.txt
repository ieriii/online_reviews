Meat. An obscene amount of it. I don't know how else to describe Fogo de Chao. We went there last night, it was me and my boyfriend's first stop for Restaurant Week. The Costela (beef ribs) were my favorite, followed by the filet wrapped in bacon, and the pork sausage. The lamb was also divine. Who am I kidding, it was all fantastic! Perfectly seasoned with a delicious flavor you can only get from grilling over an open flame. What surprised me was how good the salad bar, sides and desserts were. Make sure you have room to try everything or you'll really be doing yourself a disservice. The caramelized bananas were my favorite side, and the cured meats served at the salad bar were to die for. They also know how to make a damn fine mojito. For dessert we had turtle cheesecake and crme brle. Both delicious, although we couldn't finish them. Our service was also amazing. We just could not have asked for more. We paid our bill (it's not cheap, but it's a little cheaper during restaurant week so go now!) and waddled out of there feeling like we had never been that full in our lives. A carnivore's paradise, a vegetarian's nightmare, what more do you want out of a restaurant?
