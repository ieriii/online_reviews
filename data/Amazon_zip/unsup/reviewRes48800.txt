i would give publican 3.5 stars. we had an early friday reservation, and the restaurant was about 1/3 full when we arrived. we were seated in the middle of one of the communal tables. by the time we left, we had a party of 8 on one side, several couples in a row on the other, and the entire place was packed and very, very loud. what i loved - the beer selection (was FANTASTIC), the cheese plate, the bass, the chicken, the lighting what i wish i had loved - the service (started off well enough, but by the time we left i felt as though we were being ignored while his other tables were getting super-attentive service... maybe we didn't spend enough? or order the "right' things?) the charcuterie plate - we ordered it.. it never arrived... service quality had already decreased, and i was actually pretty full. but to not eat a bit of pig while at the publican seems semi-shameful. if i lived in chicago, i would definitely go back.. another try at dinner, and i'd love to try their brunch.
