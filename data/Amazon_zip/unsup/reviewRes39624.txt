This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I used to come here a lot shortly after they opened and now, it's almost impossible to get a table. Last time I was here, on a Thursday night, we had a two hour wait. Brunch is also amazing. This is my second most favorite place for brunch (Nightwood being number one). They cook eggs to perfection up in here. And there are often duck eggs to be had. And the bloody mary's are fantastic, too. Everything I have tried here, I have loved. I also love the people here and the decor and the vibes. Hearts all around!
