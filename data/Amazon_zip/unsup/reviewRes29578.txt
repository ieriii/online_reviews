Very solid neighborhood Thai joint. Extensive menu without too many choices, most dishes as good as you'd hope them to be. Portions are substantial, prices are very reasonable, and BYOB keeps things that much cheaper and more flexible. There's a liquor stock right next door which is quite convenient. This is our local Thai place, we'll stick with it.
