wow, i had no idea how popular this place has gotten since i've moved. my family and i have been going to this location for nearly a decade, and it's gone through several owners/spouses. i'll spare you the gossip... the place was always somewhat busy but never packed when we used to go. but last Sat, the waiting line was out the door! good for them.  as for food picks, of course you get the spicy dishes, but tell them 'little spice'. trust me, it will still make you sweat and your nose a little runny. i personally like the tender fish fillets. yum.
