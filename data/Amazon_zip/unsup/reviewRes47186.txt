Great bar to have in the neighborhood. The burgers are equivalent to Kumas Corner. Huge beefy patties with toppings galore with prison themed names. I love the border patrol burger and the godfather meatball sub. The drink selection is pretty solid too. I would definitely recommend going when you are really hungry , because the portions are so big that they should be illegal. :)
