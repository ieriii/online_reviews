First visit to Chicago, and a friend recommended this spot for good tapas and wine. You can't make a rezzy, so be prepared to wait for about an hour. The good thing is they will serve you drinks outside while you wait. The first thing we ordered was a cheese plate (we asked the waitress to put something together) and it was AH-MAZING! We ordered the Sirloin, Bone Marrow, Meatball Sliders, Eggplant parmesean balls and Pork Shoulder...and all were to die for. I think I'm leaving some of the items out, it's hard to remember it all now. We ordered a panini which was just ok and they comped us for it which was great. Dessert was the affagato which we loved. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll be back, we didn't get to try everything, which was sad.
