Pretty cute Algerian cafe, complete with both sweet and savory crepes. I ordered the Carthage crepe, which had goat cheese, cilatnro, basil, tomatoes, and salad greens with walnuts. It was a flavorful dish, and the crepes were very hearty and the size of the portion was huge. The crepe came with a side of fruit, and the grapes were a bit too sour and the watermelon wasn't ripe. But the flavor of the crepes were pretty awesome and made up for the lackluster fruit on the side. Every savory crepe comes with a side of soup. I had the chicken soup, and it was really good. The cilantro worked well with the chicken and the broth, and although the broth was a little salty, the soup hit the spot well. It would have been better had it been colder outside. The Algerian kafe/coffee was delicious as well. The cardamom in the coffee was a nice touch. I would give this place four stars, but there was something off about the presentation and the price. $10 for a crepe and soup is okay, but it seemed a little too pricey for what I was getting. I will definitely try this place again, though!
