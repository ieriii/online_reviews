24 hour korean bbq? strange but really good food none the less. so you choose however many meats you want, we tend to do chicken, beef and maybe pork (the octupus or squid is a bit too rubbery), and they bring it over on huge plates for you to cook it over an open fire with a grill on it. and then they serve you like 20 mini dishes of stuff that you have no idea what it is, but most of it is delicious so take a chance and try them all. and when you order a beer, even though they list 2 or 3 different beers, if you just say you want a beer they will bring you over the most expensive one which is only $6 so its not that bad. and they also serve you miso soup and a bowl of rice with each meat. you don't come to korean bbq's for the friendly service. they aren't rude but they got shit to do and aren't going to waste anytime with trying to talk to you. they get in and out. no smile. that doesn't bother me at all but i'm sure it'll bother some.
