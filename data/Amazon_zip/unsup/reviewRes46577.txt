The original Lettuce Entertain You eatery, RJ Grunts serves up fantastic grub in a pleasant, fun enviroment. The decor is warm, with random pictures and photo realistic paintings covering the walls and dark wood tables being highlighted by soft yellow light. The food is very American, anchoring the menu is their burgers and salad bar (they claim to be the first to ever put in a salad bar) with a wide assortment of other offerings for every taste. Besides the wonderful food (burgers cooked to order, amazing cole slaw and cottage fries), the drinks are great. Be sure to order one of their malts, they are incredibly good, well sized, and offered in a variety of flavors. Bottom line, this is a great place to eat lunch or dinner after a day in Lincoln Park, either at the beach, the zoo, or just walking around. Go with frriends, family, or whoever.
