This was my second time at Calo. My second visit was late night after a trying day. I wanted some yummy and filling food around the way. I walked in about 7:30pm and was seated promptly for one...yay! I was scared it would be packed. I stayed with the water, but the bread in the meantime was a varied selection of white bread and a pizza-baked item with butter. House salad was nothing to rave about. My entree was the ROTOLO DI PESCE, colorful pasta with shrimp, cheese and crab meat. It was tasty and very filling with a great presentation. It was served as two big rolls that I could only get to one.  After getting my entree packed to go, I asked for the HOMEMADE TIRAMISU, which was ok. I'm really not into tiramisu, tho. I just needed something sweet without being chocolate cake. I was overall happy with this visit and can't wait for dinner today to get back to the second roll of the rotolo. Quickly, The first time to Calo, I went with the hubby after a mentor of mine recommended the place . We loved it! I had the cheese ravioli that time, which was very taste and a big dish. The had wine, which he enjoyed as a random wine-drinker. We had a great time and thought it was a good 'date' restaurant that was OK for the price. Service is always good and prompt. Looking for some good food with a 'date' atmosphere, or just a filling place to eat, try Calo!
