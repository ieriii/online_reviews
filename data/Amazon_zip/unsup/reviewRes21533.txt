I had been trying to visit Xoco for a long time, but always managed to be in the area on Mondays, when the place is closed. Finally made it there this past Friday, and I was pretty disappointed. I had a pork torta,and I have say that the pork was kind of dry and not as flavorful as you would want it to be. The broth that it was served in was strangely flat with very little developed depth of flavor, just really not what you would expect from a Bayless enterprise. The staff was lovely overall, so cheers for them during the very busy lunch rush. Would I go back? Probably, but I wouldn't make a special trip.
