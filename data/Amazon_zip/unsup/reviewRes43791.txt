Service: 4-5 stars Food: 2-3 stars Good: Exceptionally friendly service, from the hostess who took our coats, to the waiter who explained to us the different cuts of steak. Meh: I went for the Kansas City steak because hey let us get some flavor from being bone-in. I ordered medium but I got unpleasantly charred on the outside and less-cooked-than-I'd-like on the inside. But since I'm a shy midwestern boy who doesn't view himself an expert on steak and would hate to waste any food--or as they would say in New York: a putz--I ate the thing and didn't complain despite the fact the exceptionally friendly staff kept asking me how everything was. Meh: My steak came with a free side concocted from mashed potatoes, onions, veggies and shrimp. Given the quality of the shrimp, I suspect this side was assembled from surplus ingredients. They should have just left the shrimp out. Good: Castle Rock Cabernet. I'm not a wine snob but this glass had plenty of flavor and kept up with the steak just fine. Okay: Dessert. The shell on the creme brulee was awfully thick up top. I had something chocolate that was pleasant enough.
