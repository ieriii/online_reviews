Say what!?!? A white guy cooking authentic Mexican in Chicago? You've got to be kidding me! I was so in disbelief I took a flight out of LA just to eat there. What a surprise! Sadly, there is no Mexican restaurant in LA that can compare (fortunately he just opened one up in LA, or lent his name to be completely accurate). Rick Bayless takes Mexican cuisine to a level that it aspires to be. Complex flavors, high quality ingredients, but yet recognizable as Mexican. The ceviche trio is the best ceviche anywhere, light, refreshing, spicy, sweet, and it is not gastrointestinal risk. I also had the ribeye Oaxaquena and it was wonderfully cooked. The dry rub added a great flavor without overpowering the steak. My GF had the smoked mushroom pozole and she loved it. Nice smoky mushrooms with a rich flavorful broth, not watery like many of the other places. LA has to make up in quantity what we lack in quality. But seriously, what gives with the public parking prices in Chicago? My plane ticket was cheaper!
