Went here a few weekends back for dinner before heading over to Park West for the Adam Carolla show. We were pretty excited to eat here, after hearing such good things. First off, its pretty small. We were cramped into a 2 person booth that was so close to another table that the waitress could barely squeeze through.  Checked out the famous salad bar, but it didn't look that great to me for the money. We had Buffalo Chicken nachos, which were AMAZING. I then had a cajun chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries (decent, but nothing to write home about). Then came the Pumpkin Cookie with ice cream. Oh man is this awesome. I did like it, but I can't see myself going back. Its uncomfortably small for my liking and the service was sub par. I'd rather check out other places than come back here.
