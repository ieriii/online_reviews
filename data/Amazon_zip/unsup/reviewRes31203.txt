Overall a very nice spot to enjoy a dinner with your special someone. Owners were very friendly and insightful.  Food gets 4-stars: They are running a program right now where every day they have their chef and drink-master come up with a unique cocktail and dish for that particular day. It changes every day and there's no real names for any of these things. I had the cocktail of the day and was very pleased with it. Sort of a gin, lemon, licorice combo that was blended perfectly. We didn't get the special dish but ordered off the menu instead, a veggie torta for my better half and a turkey pot pie for myself. Overall I thought the dishes were good but not quite enough to blow you out of the water. Same with dessert. Service gets 3'-stars: Despite it not being busy on a Monday night we found ourselves having to make a bit of an effort to get our server's attention for our order and eventually our check. When we had their attention they were very informative and nice so I don't want to get too carried away in dinging them but while I like to get left alone during the experience it's nice if they at least glance over once in a while just to make sure we're fine. Decor gets 5-stars: I'm a sucker for brick walls, exposed ductwork and the like. Atmosphere was nice and warm.
