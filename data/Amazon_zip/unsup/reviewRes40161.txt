My boyfriend and I live in Logan Square and we've been wanting to try L&E for awhile. We were pleasantly surprised when the wait was only about 45 minutes on Thursday night. The hostess offered to call me on my cell phone when our table was ready. So while we waited we had a drink at the tapas restaurant next door. We were wowed by the food! Everything was simply delicious. We ordered the marrow bones and the foie gras as our appetizers, the duck and the fluke as our entrees and the chocolate torte (so good I closed my eyes to give it my full attention) and bread pudding (very, very sweet) for dessert. Each dish was bursting with flavor and we left with full bellies and plans to visit again soon.  A week and a half later we had a friend in town and we thought we'd try out L&E for breakfast. We got there at about 10:20 and waited about 30 minutes for our table. While we waited we had the most amazing Bloody Marys. They are served in large glasses and are garnished with a cube of cheddar and a gherkin. The cheddar was sharp and delicious. Our server was very helpful and gave us a few suggestions. We followed his suggestions and were so glad we did. We had the crab eggs benedict, the ham steak and cheese grits and the duck egg hash. It was amazing. We especially enjoyed the eggs that were served with our meals which were rich, creamy and cooked to perfection. We again left with full bellies and smiles on our faces.
