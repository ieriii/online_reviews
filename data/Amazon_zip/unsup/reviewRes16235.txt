I had high expectations coming into this place, but slowly, my expectations started to dwindle. I didn't mind waiting in line, but it was rather obnoxious seeing a bunch of douchebags pull in with a Range Rover and automatically skip the line, but thats alright I was still enjoying myself. Then, a guy who is obviously going through a midlife crisis is standing behind us and he brings his mistress. He walks up to the front and pays the bouncer 40 bucks to skip the line.  The point of saying all this is that there were a ton of pretentious, pseudo-intellectual snobs. However, this is the type of place where you get a table, so I appreciate the fact that I did not have to deal with them anymore. The drinks were strong and I thoroughly enjoyed mine. But I think my girlfriend thought they were too strong. All cocktails were 12 bucks, which I thought was reasonable for the place and the interior was beautiful.  Aside from the line, I enjoyed this place a lot and I hope to come back here again on another night (preferably a slow night) and hopefully give this place five stars.
