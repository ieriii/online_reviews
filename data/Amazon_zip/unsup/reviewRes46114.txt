Food is tasty, portions are huge, wait can be long, atmosophre is swank without trendy.......I feel like most of my feedback from this place has been shared (with the 100+ reviews!). I do think their "order dessert first" idea is genious! They know their serving sizes are HUGE so they trick you telling you it takes 30 minutes to bake, so place your order first and it will be ready for you when you are done. Why can't I be that clever?!?
