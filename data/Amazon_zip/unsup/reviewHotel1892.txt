I stayed at the W on a recent business trip...nothing but great things to say. Location is perfect if you're in the central loop. The room was clean and cozy! WE, the restaurant in the hotel, is so yummy, with a fabulous wine list to boot! The lounge is great with free wifi to tap in, check emails or go online. All in all a great trip. I'll certainly be back.
