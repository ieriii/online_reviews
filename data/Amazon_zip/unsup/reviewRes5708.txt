Believe the hype! Everything we ordered was fantastic. Don't miss the pork neck rilletes, braised pork shoulder, pork saltimboca and beets with whipped goat cheese. Wow. Service was absolutely spot on---not rushed (yet, timely, just the same). We dined with a person who doesn't eat meat and she had more than enough delicious options to choose from. The wine list is varied and affordable (as was the whole meal). I can't give enough praise! While loud and bustling on a Monday night, it was still the perfect place for three friends to enjoy a fun and conversation-filled evening. Go there.
