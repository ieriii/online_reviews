I don't know if they improved, or if I am just crazy, but the melted goo that I ordered (cheese curds) were f'ing awesome. Perfectly fried with that oh so lovely cheese, well, curded, inside... yum-tastic. Had the Ole Imperial burger, and it was just as good. The bf had the Pat special (can't think of his last name), and it was eh. We both liked the Ole Imperial much better. Impressive beer list. Would say the ambiance was best in front,. The 'game room' really did feel like someones basement, the back dining area felt way too boring with crappy lighting - the front was perfect for me. Loved the red ball lights with the glow against the brick wall. And now this review is over because I can't believe I am yelping about lights against a wall.
