There are long lines here for a reason......the variety of sausages, and quality are far greater than most hot dog places...anywhere. I've ordered the special gourmet dogs on a few occasions and enjoyed them more than the regular dog. I'm not a fan of standing in line...and fearing that there will not be a seat when i eventually get my order...but for some strange reason, a seat is always open. I didn't get the duck fries, because another person in line told me its hard to tell the difference from the regular fries. I'm not a fan of the hours they are open...closes early....but if when you have quality product and people standing in long lines to eat your food...you can afford it.
