Despite the recent press (and the bacon), I didn't think the burger was spectacular. I'd suggest the sloppy joe instead - though less saucy than a traditional version, the sandwich was stuffed with plenty of pork and flavor, from the crispy sage to the fiery, roasted jalapeno. After starting with three small plates and an entree for everyone, our party of 4 shared the banana bread pudding for dessert, and it was fantastic - practically molten and full of banana chunks. There was just enough in the portion to satisfy the table. Try requesting a julep made with lavender - they were out of mint when we visited, but the substitute was perfect.
