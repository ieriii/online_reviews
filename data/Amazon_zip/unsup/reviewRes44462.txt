ORDER YOUR CAKE HERE! My mom and I wanted to surprise my sister with a fancy cake for her graduation from film school so she sent me on a hunt around Chicago for a cake that could rival the ones seen on "Cake Boss." If you're willing to throw down a bit of $$$ for a cake that is truly a piece of art, turn to Alliance Bakery. Their friendly staff took time to sit down with me and go through options to make a cake that fit into our budget. The end result was a cake that turned into a film reel with black and white frosting... it was so gorgeous and unlike anything I had ever seen. At our dinning table to feast on this cake were the harshest critics on earth: both of my grandmothers. I have to admit that when we sat down to eat it we were all worried that the fondant wouldn't taste very good and that the black coloring would give the icing a bitter flavor. Much to our shock this cake tasted even better than it looked. Everyone had a second piece. There was a lot of moaning and eyes rolling into the back of heads. Normally at the end of dinning on a cake that we brought to a restaurant we give the rest of the cake to the server to eat w/ their coworkers but there was no way we were going to give this baby up.... we at the rest for breakfast the next day! LOL It's been months since all ate that cake and it has been brought up numerous times by not only my grandmothers but also the rest of my family. We can't stop talking about how frickin' delicious it was. As granny said: "That cake was worth getting fat on." Now if only I had another special event coming up so I could justify ordering another. Guess I'll have to get married or something :P
