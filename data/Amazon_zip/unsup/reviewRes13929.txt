Cheap, Easy and the Hotter than Havana Staff makes 90 Miles Cuban Cafe 5 Sexy Star Worthy. My only regret is that I wasn't a fatty fat fat and ordered not only food to eat there, but some delicious things to take home. Next time, I won't let thinking thin get in the way of my happiness. It's a teeny little place but it has a small parking lot and street parking is easy as well. The staff are friendly, sexy, and knowledgeable. Really, I could not ask for more. My veggie sandwich was delicious, delectable, and devoured in a matter of minutes. It was the perfect combination of portabella mushrooms, red and green peppers, zucchini, grilled onions and Swiss Cheese. Add a little of their hot sauce and you've got yourself a wee slice of heaven. Oh, and don't forget those fried plantains... a little smattering of the hot sauce on those bad boys and you'll know what ecstasy looks and tastes like. For a beverage I went with the mamey tropical shake. I have no idea what 'mamey' is, but the sexy pants behind the counter said it's his fave. Done and done, no regrets, can I stare as you make it? I'll try to keep my heavy breathing down, promise. The rest of my friend-Os went with the BYOB factor and sipped some beers as they inhaled their Cubanos. I think everyone agreed that this was the first of many future visits to 90 Miles Cuban Cafe.
