ok, so here is my thing about Pequods... I'm a New York Pizza kind of girl. Give me a slice loaded with veggies and meat that I have to fold in half and shove in my mouth for it to fit, all for like under 3 bucks, and I'm in Pizza Heaven. I've lived in Chicago for 4 and a half years and have only had deep dish twice because frankly, to me, there is something wrong with having to eat pizza with a fork and knife. But I will tell you that twice that deep dish has been Pequods. (Side note: why the HELL do you midwesterners cut your thin crust pizza in SQUARES.?!? That is the worst thing I have ever seen. That has no bearing on this review, I just felt the need to mention it. Now back to Pequods). I like their pizza, but it's not life altering as so many of these other reviews state. If someone comes from out of town and wants deep dish, I'll probably take them here over some other deep dish place, but It's not my be-all, end-all pizza place like Ray's Pizza in NYC is.
