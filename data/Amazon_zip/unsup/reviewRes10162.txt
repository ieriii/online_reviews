After reading so many glowing reviews, my boyfriend and I were very disappointed in our visit. Our waiter was very pushy with the wine, dismissing my comment that I would stick with my mixed drink rather than switch to wine. He looked at my boyfriend, "who said the lady is in charge" and then said, "I'll pick you out a nice white for the entrees." We were a little shocked and my boyfriend explained we don't care for white wine. The waiter looked at my boyfriend and smiled, a nice red, then. We looked at each other speechless. When the waiter walked by, my boyfriend asked him how much would this "nice red cost" and he said around $40.00 (that's fine, didn't want to be socked with a hundred dollar bottle). Of course around forty really meant fifty. The food was just okay. My companion liked the oxtail appetizer and I had an interesting artichoke salad. I think it was artichoke- it was all shreaded and very bland. The main course of sea bass was wonderful, but the gnocci was poorly cooked and uninteresting. Dessert was good but it's hard to mess up chocolate and ice cream. It's a very pretty place and very good for elite rich people. Plenty of uglier Italian restaurants with better food at reasonable prices. Also, very snooty at the front desk when we arrived with reservations and upon seating. We came early (at opening) on a weekend. We're not pretty, but did we really deserve the worst seat in the house?
