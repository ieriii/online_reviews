Why should such a nice space be wasted on a place a mediocre as Fifty/50.  The decor is boring. Upscale sports bar - just what I always wanted. Either be a nice restaurant or a trendy or divey bar. The combo isn't working in this neighborhood. The food is overpriced, under-portioned, and doesn't stand out from any other similar sports bars. I left with a fairly large bill, and still hungry. The wait staff is over-eager to a fault. Every time I set my water glass on the table instead of a coaster, they came by and placed it back on the coaster. After this happened four times, I felt like I was dining at an uptight aunt's house. Just give me a little space - I won't ruin your water-sealed table. Some patrons can be annoying as they block the Division side walk, making it difficult to walk by Fifty/50 to better bars. Pick a spot people - indoors or on the patio - not in between! And you have to love all the hootchie shirts and popped collars. The Boundary is actually better, which is saying a lot. I will not be back to Zero/0, despite living around the block. Give me Small Bar any day.
