Had big expectations from this place a) Had some nostalgic memories and Cuban cuisine of my trip to Miami b) Hungry Hound had wonderful reviews of this place, as it was featured on last week on Channel 7 Food + Vacation= Heaven Had the skirt steak dinner, with white rice, black beans and plantains. I was VERY disappointed in the skirt steak. I thought the outside would have a sort of char, still keeping the inside the medium rare that I always order for my steaks. Not the case...I dunno if it was steam mixed with the take out box it came in, but it made the steak very chewy, almost as if the meat was BOILED. Gross The accompanying sides were the savior, and again, because of the fact that it was take out, I'd be willing to give 90 miles another try and a fair shot dining in.
