I went to this restaurant for my birthday after hearing good things. The atmosphere was stuffy & not very inviting. The service & our waitress were all very good & she was very knowledgeable about the food. I had a seafood soup which was good but definitely not worth what it was priced. I also had a sangria that had an asian twist with leeche fruit. It was excellent! I think I liked my drink best of all. I definitely would not recommend this restaurant because I feel that I can get better asian cuisine at tons of dive restaurants through out the city. The only thing I would recommend is if you are in the neighborhood, their upstairs bar area seemed really fun & they have good drinks to choose from.
