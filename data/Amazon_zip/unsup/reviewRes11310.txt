Rarely do we agree on a pizza, so I ordered a small white 'za with sauteed mushrooms & black olives. My husband ordered the medium red 'za with BBQ sauce, chicken and onions. Both were scrumptious. But, alas, we had too much pizza leftover so we'll be set for the week (not a bad thing).  4 stars only because it's a cluster if you eat there - you can barely hear the person across the table from you....and I have never gone there when it's not busy. There could be worse things and they deliver and do carry out so who really cares. Oh, and the crust is sometimes too hard at the edge. Like it hurts the roof of your mouth or could possibly crack a tooth hard.
