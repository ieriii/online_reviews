I, too, am not typically a deep dish kinda gal. I'm a "regular" pizza or thin crust all the way. However, on a quick trip to Chicago I wanted to do it right so I hit up Gino's since I had seen it on Best Thing I Ever Ate and figured I couldn't go wrong. Boy, was I right! This pizza is some of the best I've ever had. It's a bit on the expensive side but I guess you are getting a ton of food when you order. I went with my partner and we ordered a medium and had more than half the pizza left so I'd definitely recommend a small for 2 people! I will definitely recommend this place to anyone I know visiting the city and if I ever go back, it'll be on my list of things-to-do!
