I cannot believe that more people haven't pointed this out: the service here is terrible. The last time I went here, my friend and I nearly left after it seemed as though we'd been forgotten about. Later, I had to ask for our check after we'd been sitting with our table cleared for ten minutes. After I asked, we waited some more while we could actually see our waiter hanging out and chatting with two other employees by the register. The fact that he knew we were waiting for our check, and yet he still stood around talking and joking, all the while knowing that we could see him put me off so completely that I have to recommend that you forgo this restaurant.
