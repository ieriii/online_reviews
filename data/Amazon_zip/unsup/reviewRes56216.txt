I've only come for dessert, baklava to be precise. But it was delicious and the atmosphere is fun. I recommend sitting by the window. We also got greek coffee which was pretty good but the grinds were so sludgy at the bottom that it wasn't good for telling fortunes. The wait staff is nice but a tad slow. Their pizza looks good though, maybe I will try it sometime. Being in greek town, they also have greek liquor for sale. I will come back in the summer to try their raqi.
