We stayed the James Hotel over St. Paddy's Day weekend while in town for a wedding, and the place is very nice. The staff is super helpful, the rooms are great, and overall we had a great experience. Perks: - They have fresh water in cute little jugs in your room when you arrive. - Chocolates in the room - Super nice/upscale furniture and beds. - Really close to Michigan Avenue and tons of great restaurants. Downside: The Valet Parking was $52 per night, so if you are renting a car just take note there are plenty of parking garages in this neighborhood so it might be a little cheaper to park in one of those. Overall, I'm a fan and would definitely stay here again!
