This place is my jam. I've been coming here at least once a month since I could probably walk, or chew solid foods. Love it! The service and the food haven't changed since! You also ***HAVE**** to take home some flour tortillas, you can purchase them at the counter where you pay. The beans are also another reason to come here, they're most likely not vegetarian or vegan so don't bother asking. The chicken soup you get before you order is good too. Love it.
