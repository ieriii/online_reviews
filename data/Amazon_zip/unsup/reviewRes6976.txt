Mmm. Sapori Trattoria just gets better and better each time I visit. Tonight we started with the Crostini De Avocado and my main was the stuffed chicken with mushrooms, asparagus, and sun-dried tomatoes. It was incredibly tasty, and all the flavors just melded so well together. The service was really good too... kudos to Jenna. And we keep getting coupons to come here since we live in the neighborhood, I just feel bad cause we always forget to bring them with us! Next time...
