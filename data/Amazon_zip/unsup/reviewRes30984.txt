This place was mind blowing. The vibe was super cozy and just like an old fashioned diner, with all of the diner essentials except completely vegan! The staff was incredibly helpful in helping us decide what to get off the extensive menu, and we ended up getting the country fried steak and the Reuben. Absolutely amazing, the seitan on the Reuben looked exactly like real meat, and tasted like it too! I have no doubt if a meat eater was served this in a blind tasting, they'd think it was meat. Also, the vanilla chai shake was the greatest thing I have ever drinken. Got some brownies to go too, can't wait to try them! Why oh why is there not one of these in Austin? It would fit in perfectly!
