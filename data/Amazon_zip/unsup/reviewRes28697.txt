If you love eating Chef Boyardee in crowded places, the Pasta Bowl is the place for you! Otherwise, gross. I think I ordered the penne bolognaise, and I went with friends who each had something different (including one sandwich). All items were really bad. Worse than mediocre. The sauce was boring. It tasted like the mass-produced sauce you might find in a hospital cafeteria, or on an airplane - but greasier. One previous review said that if you are a 19-year-old sophomore at DePaul, you might think this is a good date restaurant. I would tend to agree, but I give college students more credit than that. You could only like this place if you are a high schooler from a small town whose only Italian food experience is the Olive Garden. Even faced with that choice, I would probably choose the Olive Garden. I honestly wonder if this establishment forces its employees to write rave Yelp reviews. There is just no way that it naturally received 4 stars. Stay. Away.
