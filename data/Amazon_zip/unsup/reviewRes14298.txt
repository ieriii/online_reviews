I just moved to Chicago from South Florida in October and have been craving really good Cuban food. Found it! The place is adorable. Really nice covered patio, great music playing, very colorful. We shared a salad. Very simple but authentic Cuban style. Tomatoes, onion and greens. Perfectly seasoned. For lunch I had lechon asado (roast pork), rice and beans and plantains. $10..portions were great. I could have split my dinner. My friend ordered ropa vieja, also very tasty. We also shared a side of yucca with garlic. Everything was seasoned perfectly. I really love this place. Our server was a sweetheart which always adds to the experience. Definitely will go back.
