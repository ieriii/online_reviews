Going to have to give Sheraton Hotel & Towers three stars. I've spent the night at at hundreds of hotels in my 26 years, and the decent majority of them all keep up with the times. Completely understand the dire economic situation we are all facing, but hot DAMN! An air conditioning/heating unit with DIAL-KNOBS? In 2009?? On the Club Level??? Really?!?! Mmmmkkaaaay. Otherwise... B+ for the staff A+ for the restaurant service (granted I used to work for Shula's so they hooked me up because I'm a member of the fam) A++ for the bed quality, even though I couldn't sleep at all due to my fear that my alarm wouldnt go off and I would be late for my morning appointments. Still can't get over the 80's style heating system. Totally bunk.
