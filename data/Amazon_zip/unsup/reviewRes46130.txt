I really like Grand Lux Cafe. Since it is part of the Cheesecake Factory, the food is delicious for an upscale casual restaurant! Very well priced, and potions are large. I ordered the Avocado-Chipotle burger with fries. This monster of a burger didn't disappoint! Also try the Buffalo Chicken Bites. Although I was intially skeptical of trying something that sounds so simple, they were absolutely delicious!
