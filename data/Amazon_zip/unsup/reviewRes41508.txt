This was a fun dining experience. I love not having to order off the menu. We had the 4 course dinner and they threw in an extra course which was a beautiful scallop dish. Each course was beautifully presented and so tasteful! The room was oddly shaped and seemed a little cold, but the friendly staff helped to make it an overall warm and great experience. A treat for adventurous foodies.
