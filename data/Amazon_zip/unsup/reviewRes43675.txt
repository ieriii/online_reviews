Wow, I am baffled how a place with such prices in Chicago can get such good ratings with such low quality. Leaves only two conclusions: (a) either people who dine here don't know what a good steak is or (b) they screwed up all 3 of our meats But then a steakhouse should know how to cook a perfect steak blindfolded and with hands tied. Hence no excuses. The meat was overcooked. After the first cut I could already tell that it was wrong. The waiter offered to refire a new one and it would only take five minutes. What ?!?!?! How do you get a perfect steak in a few minutes. Service was also mediocre as our waiter forgot drinks, the fries arrived after we were done with the steaks ..... Go to outback and you get better value!
