While the food here is of standard 1-star Michelin fare roughly comparable to restaurants such as Tru, Boka, and Everest, the setting and service leave much to be desired. The restaurant is located on a street where police cars patrol vigorously. The tables are small and without linens. There is poor cutlery management service. There is no bread or mignardises service. A lot of clients seemed disappointed. This is not the quintessential Michelin star experience you were expecting.
