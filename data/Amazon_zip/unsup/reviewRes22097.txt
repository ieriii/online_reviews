Went here as a surprise. I've seen it on tv all the time saying how good it was and such. I don't eat meat but I do eat grilled cheese sandwiches and they have one of the best grilled cheese I've ever tasted. Their fries are pretty good as well. The service is really fast. It's a fun late night stop after a night out.
