This place has so much old school charm. What gets me is the quality of the food and the prices. Chateaubriand for two cooked perfectly medium rare not to mention the flambe' and sparklers that came with it( I didn't get that presentation when I ordered it in Vegas) It also came with soup,salad,dessert and coffee with it under 60.00?!?!? Not to mention they have a great wine list and the server was really helpful when I started asking about different wines and was present throughout the dinner....considering the place was packed that impressed me. Overall a great value and charming...will be back again!
