This place is great and bustling with people. Staff is friendly so be prepared to hand out lots of $2 tips. The beds, bathrooms and living space was greatly decorated and comfortable. Amenities were good as well as in the nice pool lounge, Tea room and the gym was great. Be prepared to pay $10 each day you use the gym eh j the hotel fails to tell you over the phone. The hotel is very well maintained considering its age, and maintains the lavish look even tho the rooms ate greatly reduced on priceline. There is a Starbucks downstairs which pleased all of us in our party and it's not far from Michigan ave. great shopping and eateries nearby as well. I would def come again and stay. Happy hoteling!!
