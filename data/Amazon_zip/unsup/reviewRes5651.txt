So happy this place opened near my apartment. I have been a few times and never disappointed. They have a TON of wine/beer choices and all food is great for sharing. Beet salad is a fave, so was some fish dish with coleslaw. Their gelato is great too. It is also pretty reasonably priced. Outdoor patio is great!
