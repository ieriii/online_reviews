Quaintness in the middle of Boystown.  We set my in laws up here when they came for their first visit after I stole their daughter away to the big scary city! Needed to find someplace that wouldn't make them drag her back to Texas with them.  This is also the closest hotel to our apartment which helped as well. They absolutely adored it here! Their room was practically two rooms with lots of space, nice sofa - all the goods. They loved the patio outside to enjoy their coffee, cigs and morning papers. The people who worked in here was so incredibly friendly and accommodating.  They've already informed us that this is where they're going to stay the next time they visit. Hands down. I think it's because they discovered Ann Sather's across the street though....we kept trying to get them to go somewhere else, but Miz Ann won over every darn morning!
