The only times I write reviews is if a restaurant is really good or really disappointing. This, my friends, is one of those disappointing moments. We came here for my Grandpa's birthday on saturday with two tables reserved seated right next to the kitchen. The service was typical for a chinese restaurant, you pretty much had to tackle them for any service. No rice, no water, not enough plates, not clearing any of the finished plates, we stacked the plates to get space cleared on the table.... and even after making the job easier for them they still did not take the empty plates. Unfortunately, my Dad could not join us for dinner, so we waited in the line at the front of the restaurant to order the Roast Pork for him to go. We were very specific about getting just the ribs... of course that's the tastiest part of any pig and that is why they charge you more for it. We saw the butcher cut it and weigh it, but what happens behind the counter when he chops it, you really can't see. When we got home, very surprised to see there were no ribs in that box. The butcher replaced it with all bones and a few pieces of meat! Ok, I could give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was a mistake (although it's hard to mix up if you are only taking one order at a time). This has happened to us multiple times already! Lesson learned... keep an eye out for what happens behind the counter. Although I am a northsider and it is very convenient to go to uptown, from now on I will be taking the extra time to drive to chinatown for my roast pork. Yes the peking duck is good, but It could be better.
