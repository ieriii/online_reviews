The only Costa Rican restaurant in Chicago. The place is small, but always packed with people waiting in line to get a table in the back. No one complains of the wait, for they will be effectively accomodated with friendly service and delicious food at a good price. Mango Lime shake is awesome, which my husband and I received for it was our one-year wedding anniversary. Just try everything at least once and you will be hooked. The only issue is that you are taken off-guard when you are charged for the guacamole for $6.50, which you believed was complimentary, due to how they ask the question. The guacamole was not even that good and not worth $6.50, but everything else is good. Big portions that I could never finish, so I always have something for the next day. Enjoy.
