I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  We were seated in a high traffic area when there were plenty of tables available. I felt pressured to make an immediate wine or drink decision as soon as we sat down.  The salad bar looked wonderful, but the flavor on everything seemed mediocre at best. I thought the mushroom risotto was the only item that was worth a second trip. The meats were good and not over portioned, allowing us to try many of their selections. Sadly none of it was so good that I would want to go back for, especially for $50 a plate. I have no problem paying that for a meal I love, but the love was not there. Not bad just not great.
