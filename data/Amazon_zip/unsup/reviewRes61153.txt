I almost gave it three stars for the hours they keep. Late night options are limited and after midnight this place is definitely a three star choice but before that it is way too bland to be an option at all. I had ordered the same things a few times and it was remarkably consistantly bland. The salsa was hardly hot and the quesadillas lacked flavor.
