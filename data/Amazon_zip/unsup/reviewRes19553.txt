Holy fish belly, I've found my Sushi mecca. Went here with the gal on Friday and aside from the wonderful service and fancy dining room, I was determined to try this wonderful sushi. For me, I'll try it sans wasabi or soy sauce, to see how fresh the fish is and if its the right kind of cut. It was IMPECCABLE, seriously I want to go back and just order the menu, topped it all off with this insane flourless chocolate cake thing, well, it was quite the experience. Great date spot too!
