I watched as firefighters fought the blaze when the original Hot Doug's on Roscoe was burning down. Figuring the dogs inside were well-done, courtesy of a the 4-alarm fire, I rushed toward the smoldering front door to save the encased meats within. Fortunately, the firemen held me back. I lived to see another day and Hot Doug established new roots on California, where I once downed the most delicious steak-dog ever created. From the flames rose a Phoenix!
