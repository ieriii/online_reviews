I died and went to pizza heaven. I've heard all the recommendations - yadda yadda yadda - and decided to go here. The wait was crazy... About an hour, and this was around 9p. We didn't order until about 10p that night. It was so busy!!! We ordered the infamous 'stuffed' pep and mushroom pizza ($20) and a Hawaiian thin crust ($15). WOW, is all I have to say... I can honestly say it's the best pizza I've ever had. The cheese just oozed right out and my taste buds seriously had an orgy...I attempted 1 slice of my stuffed and 1 thin, and I was literally full. I'd fly back to CHI-town just to have another "o"...
