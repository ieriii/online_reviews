I went here for dinner on Saturday night and I was slightly disappointed. First, it was so hot in the restaurant that I couldn't get comfortable. We asked our waiter, the hostess and other servers who came to our table to turn down the heat or turn on the air conditioning. It was so bad that my boyfriend actually got up from the table to go stand outside to cool off. I think the heat wouldn't have been as bad if the seating situation was different as well. We were a party of four sitting in the middle of one of the long tables in the middle. So I felt squished next to strangers, people were standing behind me at the high top bar tables, and I was sweating because it was so hot. The communal tables are fun, but not when you feel like you can't get any air. Now for the food. I ordered some oysters and they were excellent. I also had the mussels and they were divine. The broth was buttery and light and was delicious with the fresh bread. We also waited for 25 minutes after my reservation so the restaurant gave us complimentary pork rinds and French fries. That was a nice touch. The French fries were ok, the pork rinds had too much dry cheese on them. Great texture and perfectly crunchy. We also ordered the three types of ham to try. It was delicious. The blood sausage was too far out there for us. Our waiter suggested it, but I could only eat a few bites. The scallops were very good, the pomegranate seeds added a nice touch. We also ordered the suckling pig, this was the best dish by far. The potee was ok, a little salty and I didn't care for the one cut of the meat. We ordered the chocolate cake and coconut sorbet for dessert. They were ok. We really enjoyed the New Zealand Pinot noir. It was light and was a great pairing for both meat and fish. I will probably not return, but I would like to try one of the other restaurants the chef owns. This place was definitely worth a try though.
