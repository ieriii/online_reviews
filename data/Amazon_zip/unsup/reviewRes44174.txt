I didn't see talk of the Snow White Roll in any of the reviews, and that's a travesty! The Snow White roll is super white tuna, avocado, masago and almonds. Amazing. I'm not really a huge almond fan and I've never had it on sushi, but it definitely works. It's like any roll that has tempura crunch on the outside, but better!  Speaking of tempura crunch, we also got the Oedipus roll and asked for tempura crunch with it, and it was almost as good as the Snow White. The Oedipus is fresh salmon, avocado, spicy sauce, cucumber topped with salmon roe, wasabi mayo. Love it. I can't wait to go back!
