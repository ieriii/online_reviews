So my friends and I came here for an early Saturday night dinner after hearing all the rave reviews from my coworkers and it certainly did not disappoint. Anytime you can get bacon fat popcorn and crisp micro-brews, you just gotta do it! I personally enjoyed the loft style decor and the laid-back atmosphere a lot. The place was very spacious and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. We waited for about 45 min for a table of 6, which gave us enough time to sample a couple types of beer by the bar while catching the final four on TV. The "Cross of Gold" stood out as the favorite for the group. After we sat down, the mussels appet-tizers immediately jumped out to the group along with the bacon fat popcorns. In fact, we wanted them so badly that we got 2 orders of each. I'm pleased to announce that they were all VERY good. For entrees, some of us got the burgers while I went for the daily special - pork schnitzel with sauerkraut and brussle sprouts, without knowing what a schnitzel was. My one moron friend thought it was German sausage and of course, he was way off but I trusted him anyway. I still enjoyed the dish in the end. I also tried farm burger that my other friend got and the roasted beet was surprisingly complementary on the burger (Dwight K Shrute style). Definitely a very interesting combination. In the end, while not everyone in the group enjoyed their meals (mixed reviews on the duck pizza and bbq pulled pork sandwich), it was a cool experience just to visit this place so that's a star in my book!
