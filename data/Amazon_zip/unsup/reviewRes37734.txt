NOT FRIENDLY TO VEGETARIANS! I know most people don't give two hoots about the above statement, but it is important to me. I am a vegetarian and it is nice when a restaurant has several "Adult" options for us. There was one entree option( a PB and J with cheese) and a couple side options: french fries, mac and cheese, and onion rings. And that is it. I like all of those things, but it really is lacking in the meal department. I guess the take-home message is TOO BAD FOR ME AND OTHER VEGETARIANS --cuz the place is cute and the beer is great. For most of you reading, you won't give a rat's hind area that this place has very limited veggie options. Actually, you will probably schvitz at all the "gd" meat options they have on the menu. TONS and TONS and TONS of meat. So go in meat-eaters and eat your meat-lovin hearts out. I will just go for a beer and then head over to LaDonna (next door) and have something to eat.
