I wish this place were just a little closer to my work so I could go more often. After hearing people talk about it forever I finally went for lunch. We started with fried pickles and squash with came with a great chipotle sauce. Probably the best tasting fried pickles I've ever had. Then I had the fish special for the day which was sea bass over a bed of barley and morel mushrooms with a venison broth. Um, heaven!!!!! I scavenge Chicago for morels this time of the year, and combined with sea bass they were great. The sea bass also came with perfect crispy skin. Such a treat! I like The Gage better than Henri (owned by the same chef) simply because I do not feel wealthy or snooty enough for Henri! The Gage is much more relaxed and I would love to go back.
