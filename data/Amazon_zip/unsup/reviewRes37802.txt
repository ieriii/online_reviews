This is where I was taken by a bunch of gay guys for my 21st birthday (a straight bar, because of its close vicinity to where we were at the time--and it wasn't the rainbow banana Porn Shop down the street). It is also one of the most horrible, yet rememberable nights because I found out then that I was allergic to the ingredient Hops which happens to be in most beers. I must say that I will never touch a can of Delirium for another 21+ years. I should have known with little flying pink elephants as its logo. I had one glass and was in the bathroom for 2 days (I must say, the glass was a neat shape). Before that set in, we had a great time here. Since then, I have seen this bar on several lists putting it as one of the best bars in the city. I guess I should try only their food next time since it hopefully can't do as much harm!
