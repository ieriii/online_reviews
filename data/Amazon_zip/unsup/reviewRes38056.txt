Yeah, Giordano's is a Chicago legend. Yeah, I need to always take out-of-towners here. Yeah, I don't really like deep dish or stuffed pizza much. Yeah, I need to always announce to them that Giordano's is not deep dish, but rather stuffed pizza, another Chicago classic. That being said, I much prefer the Loop location! This one is too touristy, too loud, the service isn't good at all (I wish they did made a little more of an attempt to be nice to out-of-towners). The wait here is often more insane, the place itself is loud and crazy. So given that Giordano's cannot be avoided, I pick the Loop location over the River North location!
