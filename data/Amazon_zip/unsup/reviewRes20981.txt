the food here is good, but i have 1 complaint. i ordered delivery last week and got 4 rolls. i asked if it was possible to cut the rolls in smaller pieces. they said no problem. when i got my food and looked at the receipt i noticed they charged $1 extra PER ROLL to cut into smaller pieces. are you kidding me? if they were going to charge for that, they should have mentioned that they charge an extra dollar per roll. however, charging for that request is absolutely ridiculous.  coast, you have nice sushi. but, come on!
