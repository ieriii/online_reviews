The service at Noon O' Kabab has become less exceptional with each visit. The last time I was there, the waitress seemed upset that we did not order alcohol and we had to wait for thirty minutes for the check at the end of our meal while she stood by the bar glancing over at us after we told her that we were too full to order dessert or a round of after dinner drinks.
