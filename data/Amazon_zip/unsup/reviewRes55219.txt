Fogo De Chao is the best place to go if you love meet. My husband and I have been 7-8 times and each time it gets better and better. The staff are great and friendly, they acknowledge you as soon as you walk in. It's my favourite place to go. The endless sewers, especially the amazing picana, the cheese bread and the fried banana are my absolute favorites.
