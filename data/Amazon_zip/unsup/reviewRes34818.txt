I love this tiny room that fills my belly with amazing sushi rolls. Especially the honey roll that must have been invented here and now similar ones can be found at other restaurants. Often imitated, never duplicated. Other must trys are the Godzilla (sans the cream cheese for me) and well, pretty much anything else that tickles your raw-loving fancy as everything has always been yummy. The rolls are delicious and creative, reasonably priced and it's BYOB - triple whammy! boo-yah! They used to have a happy hour special where rolls were half-off from 4-7 Sun-Wed, but I'm sure that was chaos as it's a CRAZY good deal. I think I may have outdone my welcome at one point....oopsie.  This is always a solid spot to fulfill your craving and/or a chill date night. We never really had a problem getting a table - I think the size pushes patrons to the carry-out/delivery option, which works out just fine for me.
