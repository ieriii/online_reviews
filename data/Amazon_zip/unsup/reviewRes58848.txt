Sunda was recommended by a coworker and found it to be delightfully decadent, fabulous environment, with sexy and mature people. The appetizers, entrees, and desserts were absolutely delicious, full of flavor, simple dishes with a twist, and fully Asian inspired. Also, the General Manager, Aeron and the staff are warm, inviting, and professional. It's definitely a hot spot in River North!
