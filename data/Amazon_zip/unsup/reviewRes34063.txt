When I worked in Lincoln Park, Sultan's was a staple. I made almost weekly trips west for lunch. The falafel and the lentils are excellent. The price is hella cheap, but definitely not lacking in quality. I miss working in the area and not being able to dine there much more frequently. Warning: The salad bar looks yummy, but way too many times, Ive witnessed the yuppies picking at the food with their bare fingers. I love good food, but I can't stand NASTY!
