What can a person say in a review that hasn't already been said? I am only adding a review here to keep their star count up as close to five as it deserves to be. My boyfriend and I went to Schwa in December 2009. He called, they answered right away, he talked to Michael Carlson directly, and got a reservation for the following night. That was quick! Nice Yelpers gave me the advice to bring in some alcohol for the staff, as well as for ourselves, so we brought them a nice six pack. The experience was just what all the other five star reviews say: a one of a kind experience where you savor every flavor, and hold the food in your mouth and taste the complexity. It was great. I loved every dish, and I will probably never forget them. I also very much appreciated that they gave us an extra course of the quail egg ravioli on the house. Ahhhh. That ravioli is not overhyped. But I have to say, I would probably go into a coma if I ate more than one. They are rich! If you can afford it, go to Schwa at least once in your life. You'll never forget the experience. Last note: people who have not eaten there should not write one star reviews to complain about the reservation system. Reviews should be about the food. Anybody could call Schwa up and find out on their own that the reservation system is tricky. Useless reviews.
