The desserts here are to die for!! I tried the tiramisu, which was incredible, and some of the best I've had. It's a must when coming to artopolis! The lemon tart is also really good. Perfect balance of sweetness and tartness. I also tried the baklava which was incredibly flaky and delicious!! The staff is also friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommend this place!
