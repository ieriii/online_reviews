The best part about my meal at The 3rd Coast was the conversation at the table. My friend told me how he had just flown a WWII plane the weekend prior. He had a blast. AWESOME! Unfortunately,The 3rd Coast was a big crash and burn. Went here for brunch on the basis of a lot of the great Yelp reviews and was severely disappointed. I'll start with the positives because they're quick... The physical restaurant is pretty cool. It's old school. Also, we only waited about 10 minutes on a Sunday at 11a. Nice. However, I think I know why the wait isn't longer... Once we were seated it took 5-10 minutes for a server to come by...that was just to give us menus. Another 5 minutes later and we ordered our (cold) drinks which took 10 minutes to arrive. THEN we ordered food. There were three of us and none of us were impressed by the food in any way. I had the Italian Omelet. It sounds interesting and tastes like nothing at all. The other dishes at the table were Eggs Benny and Huevos Rancheros. "Gross" was actually thrown around when describing some of the food. It's a very rare day when I eat somewhere and know that I can make better food...but that's what happened on Sunday. It was pretty unfortunate considering how welcoming the place seemed when we got there. Ah well. As a famous poet once said...On to the next one!
