"Oh my god, I am still dreaming about that amazing fish sauce," my dinner companion whispered 4 hours after we had left the restaurant. The 2 1/2 hour wait to get a table was totally worth it. Her fish preparation, the Pescado en Escabeche, was indeed delicious. It featured the day-boat catch, mahi mahi, in a tangy beet escabeche. My Enchilada de Mole Poblano was also mouthwateringly good. Three chicken enchiladas were served in a spectacular mole perfectly infused with chocolate. Our tamales were unlike any I've had before. They were sweet and light, almost like cake, topped with crumbled cheese and roasted peppers; without doubt the best tamales I've ever tasted. The Duo de Flanes dessert featured a classic flan and a horchata flavored version. In my humble opinion, the classic flan is the better of the two. I also tried the chocolate pecan pie and was amazed at how much I enjoyed it given I'm not usually a fan of pecan pies. Not a crumb of that dessert was left on the plate when I was done with it. For those of you who are balking at the idea of a 2 1/2 hour wait, you always have the option of putting your name on the waiting list and returning later. But trust me, should you choose to wait, the signature margaritas served in the bar area sure do help make the time fly.
