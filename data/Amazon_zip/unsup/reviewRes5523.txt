Have wanted to go here for quite a while and will go back to try one more time but this visit was NOT great. Would like to be able to give 2 1/2 stars. Good: The butternut squash appetizer is perfection itself. Not as good: The french fries of the sea had a great aioli sauce but the fries themselves weren't anything special, just a vaguely fishy flavor. The pork shoulder had way too high a fat to meat ratio and the 'mashed' potatoes were more like a soupy puree. We saw a wonderful dessert go by, so we asked about and ordered it. It's the fried iris dessert that was featured in Bon Appetit magazine.  First, there was a REALLY long wait before it arrived and then it was way overcooked, dark brown and a bit greasy. Looked like it had gotten forgotten in the fryer. The waitress asked how it was and I told her. Boy, her 'smiley isn't everything great' attitude disappeared. No apology, no explanation, needless to say no replacement. Just the check. Rather disappointing experience for someplace I've really been looking forward to trying. From the other reviews, perhaps our experience was unusual but unfortunately it's memorable to us! And, I ALWAYS spread the word to friends about restaurant experiences.
