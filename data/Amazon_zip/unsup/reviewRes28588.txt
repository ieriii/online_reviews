This is seriously the best pizza in Chicago! I've tried Lou Malnati's, Amato's, and even Pizzeria Uno, and while Uno is the best out of those, Pequod's still beats it! The deep dish pepperoni was excellent! It had it all, great sauce, spicy pepperoni, and gooey cheese. We live all the way by the HIP, but I seriously doubt we'll be ordering pizza from anywhere around our house. Pequod's is worth the drive...seriously, it's that good!
