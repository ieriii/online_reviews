Came to this location during a trip to Chicago. We waited on line for about 35 minutes. I'm not a big fan of pizza, but since its a famous spot decided to go. When we get in and sit down my party ordered a deep dish pizza. The waiter said it would be 45 mins!!!! 45 mins I think they should have taken our order when we were standing outside so that when we go in we would just have a 10 min wait. Makes sense to me. The Buffalo Wings are really good, I must say.
