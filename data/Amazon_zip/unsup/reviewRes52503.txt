As an avid meat eater, I gotta say that Brazzaz impressed me. Not as well known or pretty as Fogo de Chao, but I think just as good. The premise is the same, funny pant wearing waiters carry around massive quantities of meat and serve off of the spit. Something about Brazzaz makes it a little more casual than it's more attractive cousin Fogo.  The meats are just as good, the salad bar can be beefed up a bit more in my opinion, and the sides on the table are almost identical and they do have that great Brazilian soda which compliments the meat very well.  I would say this is more of a special occasion place or a meat eating contest arena, either way you're going to walk out too full for your own good and unbuttoned pants (happened twice).
