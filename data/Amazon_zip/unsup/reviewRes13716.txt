From the the time you walk in to the diner the atmosphere is incredible. From the hostess to the servers to the owner, you are only met with kindness, understanding and a willingness to give the best experience possible The only thing that the service is out done by is the food. From the hyped up crab cakes to the employees picks to anything you might want on the menu everything is perfect. Nothing is over seasoned or under cooked. Best seafood in the midwest hands down.
