Overall, not bad. My wife and I are not much on paying for ambiance; we're just there for the food and the food was good. We had the Devil's basket and the oxtail potstickers. Both were great. The Devil's basket is two softshell crabs in a huge pot of dried red chilis.  For dinner, my wife had the sea bass and it was also great. Good sized portion and lots of flavor. The only loser of the night was the dish I had: the beef long rib. Little flavor and super fatty. I realize that rib meat is usually "well marbled" but this piece of meat was a good 30 - 40% fat. Oddly, Sunda also doesn't serve any kind of carb with the dishes, apparently. I'm Chinese and I like rice or noodles with meat, especially meat that's really fatty. Pricewise, everything was pretty reasonable. The food was about $80 all told and two drinks were $25. I'd go back, but next time, we're probably just going to order 4 - 5 appetizers and go dim sum style.
