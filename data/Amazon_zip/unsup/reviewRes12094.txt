I'll begin this post as I did with my review of Mixteco. I have been fortunate to have eaten a lot of Cuban food prepared by natives of the country. Therefore, I am a harsh critic. I came here for friend's b-day dinner and I did have high expectations as all I hear about this place is rave reviews.  #1 It smells like fried food and a lot of it....eww. #2 The food is good. It is definitely not terrible. However, if you are new or inexperienced with Cuban/Latin food, I bet you will love it. I am all about fresh and Cafe 28 didn't cut it for me. However, I would go back. Great cocktails.
