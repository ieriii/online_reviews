Just went back for dinner and it was another wonderful one!! The menu has been updated to include autumn flavors. The pear and arugula salad was light and a great starter. The spring chicken was moist and flavorful as was the pork dish. Another guest at the table got the seafood stew and said the broth was the best she has had for that type of dish. Everything from the bread to the drinks was great! Again, I am thrilled about this addition to the neighborhood and highly recommend this place!
