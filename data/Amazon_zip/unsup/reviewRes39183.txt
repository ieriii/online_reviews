I lived in South Korea for a year, and living in the South Suburbs, hadn't found the time to travel soooo far to quash a craving. With HP coming out, an old college friend and I decided to travel an hour and fifteen to try San Soo Gab San. When we finally did arrive, I had to let her park my car for me....I am a great driver, save parking, and this was just about my worst nightmare, literally. She parked like a pro, and as we were exiting the car, talking about how bad the lot was, 2 other women pulled up and made the same "look of terror" face. They parked next to us, and we ended up dining together, since this was their first time as well. (fyi you cook your own food, which i thought was common knowledge, but our new-found friends were unaware) That was an awesome idea! Korean food is meant to be shared, and share we did!. We ordered the Dak kalbi, dwegii kalbi, and bulgogi (chicken, pork, and beef, respectively), kimchee jigae, and dolsot bibimbap. One girl also ordered the ribs. The dak kalbi was ok. I was more so wanting chicken thighs cooked with cabbage and dok, but it was pretty good. Dwegii kalbi was my favorite, as i placed a lot of banchan, the pork meat, and rice inside of my lettuce. The bulgogi was good, as well.  I have never seen so many sides served in one sitting. As I stated, I lived in Korea for a full year, and went to numerous restaurants there, but never had I received 25 at a time, though at one point or another had tasted everything before. All in all it was an awesome day, we had soju and beer, pretty good food, and great conversation. I will say i was spoiled by the freshness and flavor of "real" Korean food, but the taste was good enough to satisfy my craving for the time, and great for first timers being introduced into Korean..
