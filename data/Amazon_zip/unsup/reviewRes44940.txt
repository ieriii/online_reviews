We came here to experience Chicago Deep Dish Pizza - and experience it we did! Yumyumyum! I am not much of a pizza lover but I most definitely had love for this amazing pie! It is a lot like pie actually - it takes 40 mins to get your order but it is well worth the wait! We got pepperoni & mushroom stuffed pizza - so good! This made Chicago feel like Chicago to us!!
