The portions are huge! Unless you haven't eaten in 2 days and absolutely starving, I don't see how anyone can finish everything in one sitting! I always get something different every time I'm here, and always leave with a doggie bag, so it's hard to pick a favorite right now. They're all really tasty! At least the quality and quantity of the food is worth the price (and the wait). And everything is very clean and orderly. The utensils are hot, so you know for sure that they're clean. Major plus for me.
