Luckily happened to walk up to stand in line at just the right time (thanks to not changing the watch from EST), and being able to sit at a 2-top table in the bar area, didn't have to wait too long, as this place is apparently always packed, and has a 8+ week reservation wait list for the dining room reservable tables. My friend had the Champagne Margarita, and I had the Blood Orange Margarita - both deliciously refreshing & just the right amount of alcohol. Started with Verduras Asadas, Tres Chiles appetizer, one of the best I've had, my friend seemed to agree.She had the Puerco en Clemole Castellano, which was the low point of the meal - rather bland compared to everything else we'd had. I had the Enchiladas de Pato al Pasilla, which was a unique combination of flavors, but it worked well, quite tasty.The service is extremely efficient & well-informed about the menu, and helpful, but not exactly friendly.
