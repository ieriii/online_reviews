They serve a decent selection of beer on tap and bottled. Service was more of a sports bar attitude and not a dining institution. Regardless, the food is good and service is not bad. It is a good go-to spot for late night pig outs on those weekends where you kinda want to drink a little and eat but can't decide where to go.
