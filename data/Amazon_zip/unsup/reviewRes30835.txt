I've stopped by this place 4 or 5 times and I never fail to try a great new dish. Great if you're vegetarian, vegan, or just feeling like a hearty, healthy meal. One thing that really impresses me is their take on raw veggies. I had this great all-raw zucchini humus as an appetizer one time. Delicious! Their menu has a lot of variety as it is and they've had different specials every time I've been. Standouts for me were their take on shepherd's pie, portobello wrap, and sweet potato quesadillas. Service is great and steady paced (perfect for a meal and conversation with a friend, probably not the best for a quick eat and run). Decent beer selection (and I was surprised to learn that Red Stripe beer is not vegan?) I'll continue to hit this place up and bring friends!
