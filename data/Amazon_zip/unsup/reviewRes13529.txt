I have loved Glenn's since I first discovered it over the summer, but I feel like every time I have gone in recent past, it's gone down a notch. I don't know if it's becoming over-crowded, or what, but the food has gone slightly downhill, and the service has taken a huge dive. I took two out of town guests here last weekend, and through the first 15 minutes of our meal, we got to listen to this blond girl who was a server, host or something, complaining loudly to her coworkers about how she got shafted on some kind of shift or something. It was completely unprofessional and obnoxious. A guy who seemed to be her boss (only saying that because I see him every time, and he looks to be running the place) didn't say anything about her continued outburst. If I were him, I would have asked her to take her conversation into the back room (vs. the tiny dining room) or go home.  I really hope this was just a fluke, and that Glenn's will return to its original fabulousness soon!
