I always stop by Superdawg and Gino's when I'm in the area. The hot dogs here are good and packaged in a box with fries. It's convenient if you're at the drive in, eating in your car, to have the hot dog and fries in one box. I wouldn't say Superdawg is the best "Chicago hot dog" but it's good and what I crave most when I think about Chicago. I tried the Chicago style hot dog at Sonic, thinking it would satisfy me enough until I had the real thing, but it was disgusting and very disappointing. No one can do it like Superdawg!
