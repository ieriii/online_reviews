After many weeks of anticipation, we finally made it to Shaw's for dinner! We were seated right away (we had a reservation for that night. It was crowded at 7 on a Saturday so I highly recommend making a reservation). The decor was nice and we had a great table.  We had the crab fingers for an appetizer and they were so good and fresh.  We also ordered a bowl of lobster bisque to split but our waitress forgot about the soup but it wasn't on the bill so no big deal. I ordered the Club Room Combo which was a filet, sea scallops, garlic shrimp and rice.  I do not know what was my favorite because everything was so tasty and delicious! My husband had the surf and surf which included crab legs and lobster tail.  Yum! Yum!  We split a side dish of potatoes au gratin which were amazing!  Finally, we split a piece of the southern pecan pie. Delish!!! Our waitress was great and friendly and so attentive!!  The food at Shaw's was so awesome! Perfect for an upscale date night!
