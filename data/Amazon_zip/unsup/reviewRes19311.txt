Head to The Gage or a wonderful dining experience. Greeters, servers, runners, bussers all are well trained in making diners feel comfortable. Our server was so helpful in guiding us to the right beers from the enormous list.They also offer four ounce pours of wine which is so nice if you want something small or just wish to sample a few. They split a salad in the kitchen for us which is always a sign of a place that knows how to please. Fresh mushroom soup was delicious. Pork chop entree was cooked to perfection. Tuna was fresh and well seasoned. Even fish and chips were spot on. The only drawback is the noise level. However, the farther you go into the restaurant, the less noise as the place is large and deep.
