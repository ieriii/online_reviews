God this place is good! And it is BYOB! You can't beat that. The sushi is high quality and they have a large variety of rolls and sushi as well as other entrees. The prices are quite reasonable and when you factor in being able to bring your own wine it makes it even more reasonable than a lot of other sushi places in the city. They make a great spicy scallop roll and the volcano roll is super tasty as well. Their pieces of sashimi are healthy servings and they melt in your mouth. Highly recommended. It does get quite busy on the weekends and often times if you don't have a reservation you have to wait quite a while. The restaurant is big so it holds quite a few people! Enjoy!
