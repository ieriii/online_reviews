I have a confession: I've been to Big Jones before for dinner. But it was so long ago, that I don't clearly remember what we had. I would have given it about 3.5 stars at that point in time, but I don't remember enough to write a review. So sue me. Anyway. My husband had just run a sprint triathalon (OMFG) and we were going out to brunch to celebrate. We had been up since 4am and we were super starvin'. We went to Big Jones, since you can't go wrong with New Orleans type of food. We made a res and were seated immediately upon arrival. We both got huge cups of coffee, which was the best coffee I had in a long time. Did they put crack in it? It was addictive, rich, but not too bitter. We got a plate of complimentary beignets, which were HEAAVEENNNLY. Piping hot, fluffy, fresh and coated in powdered sugar. They were gone in about 2 seconds. We both ordered (yeah, we're lame, but it was too good to pass up) the Eggs New Orleans. It was poached eggs, on top of crab cake, on a popover smothered in Bearnaise sauce. There were also fancy hash browned potatoes. Wow, the flavors certainly popped. The popover was hot and had the consistency of a croissant . The crab cake was rich and flavorful. The Bearnaise sauce was buttery and delicious, and the potatoes were just sassy. My only complaint was the egg, which had been poached for too long and the yolk was SOLID :( Total bummer. This is where I had to deduct a star. I would go back here 100% for brunch, because that's where Big Jones seems to shine. It was pricey (15 per plate, eep), so it wouldn't be a regular occurrence, but Big Jones knows how to deliver. I just hope they don't poach their eggs so much, next time.
