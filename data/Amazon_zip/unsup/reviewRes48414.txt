Too bright? Wha? I think this place was really nicely lit with all those big glowy things. Maybe it's too bright if you've not been... anywhere else? Ever? And you're a moleman? One of my most favorite (and generous) humans, Kris W., and I went here at 6:30 on a Tuesday night. We had a reservation, but I think it would have been okay anyway. The staff was kind and accommodating. We were pleased to be seated by the window and warmed by gentle overhead heaters. There's a little shelf under the chair to put your purse, and they took our coats when we came in! Who does that anymore? We had a wonderful cherry ale to start with and enjoyed some fabulous chewy sourdough bread, sister's upcoming wedding be damned. Also in the "wedding be damned" category were the fantastically spicy and loud pork rinds (too loud to eat with anyone you want to impress, but generally cool) and frites, which came with a super fresh fried egg on top (!) I don't particularly care for french fries, but these were great. Apparently, all they need is a little bright orange egg yolk and I'm good to go. Roughly 2500 calories in we got to the showstopper, the country ribs, which tasted like no animal I've had the pleasure to snack on. Totally tasty and perfect to share.  For dessert, we also shared the pear and cherry crostada, which I really enjoyed-- not too sweet, and went really well with a deluxe cup of coffee. I especially enjoyed the brown sugar cube in lieu of my usual Splenda and the pretty little tea cup in which it was served. It's supposed to be a Belgian beer hall, or so I was told by the chef on our way out. I also overheard the host on the phone saying that the new Iron Chef was going to be dining there sometime soon (!). We easily found street parking- the neighborhood is exclusively made up of meat markets and new fancy schmancy boutiques. Someone should write a dissertation on how that works. Hurray! Thank you to Kris for a wonderful evening! :)
