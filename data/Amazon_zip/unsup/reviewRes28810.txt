I thought I had rated these guys before... I've gotten take-out from Opart about 50 times. The delivery is prompt, and the food is always correct. I am a fan for sure. I will say that yesterday's beef pad thai was solid, but a little bland. Having made my own over the years and browsed a lot of recipes, I'd say that this dish is getting a little too Westernized...
