I went to India house with a co-worker for the first time months ago. I have never really had indian food before so wasn't sure if I would like it. The food is sooooo good, sometimes I crave their food in my sleep! I absolutely love the naan dipped in the orange sause! Just amazing. The tandori chicken melts in your mouth. Great paneer, tiki masala chicken, eggplant dish, lamb! You really can't get better Indian in the city for the price! I go back at least once a month!
