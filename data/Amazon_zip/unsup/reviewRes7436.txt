Ribs were OK, nothing special. They were COLD, what's that about? Get the pulled pork sandwich instead, absolutely AMAZING! Being from Texas the brisket was way off, tougher than usual and again just slightly warm. Did I mention the pulled pork was awesome? Great bar area in front, arrived with a rather large group and had no problems. Reservations are a good idea. The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars was due to the Luke warm brisket and cold plain ribs. I'm still dreaming and drooling about the pulled pork though. Yes, those damn pickles everyone raves about are the real deal, very good. I'll be back.
