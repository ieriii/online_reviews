I've attended two of their 'underground restaurant' Saturday night events, and really enjoyed myself at each. Everybody here's covered the details pretty well- the small cafe shuts it's doors after seating everybody and you all are served dinner together- the place holds about 24 people so the whole experience is pretty intimate and cozy. The food's really well prepared and chef Kurt comes out and chats with everybody looking for feedback toward the end of the meal too. Overall, you leave with a good feeling of having enjoyed a fine meal in a unique setting prepared and served by some really nice people.  Two factors stand out about the 'invite only' process that make me love it: 1. You show up and your table's waiting on a Saturday night! Seriously, reservations seem to rarely work that way at a conventional dinner. 2. The menu is defined a week in advance and it's BYOB. The makes it so I can control exactly which wine (or beer) I'll enjoy with my meal ahead of time- that's so much better than picking from a wine list when you're on a budget! Plus water, coffee, sodas, etc are all included with the price as well. I haven't been for the cafe/deli part during regular hours, nor for dinner on a weeknight. But Saturday's are so good I wouldn't hesitate to.
