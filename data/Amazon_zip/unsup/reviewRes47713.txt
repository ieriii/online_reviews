Bacon, and frittata, and crabcakes, oh my! What do you get you add $25pp unlimited sampling brunch + 6 girl friends + pitchers of Sangria? A: A foodgasm, great laughs, & tipsy! :-) I went to Zed451 for brunch this Sunday, and let me tell you, it was fantastic! It was all that I hoped it would be. Zed's brunch, is not your prissy brunch. You must come prepared to be overwhelmed with good food & great service. All in all it was amazing, and I will definitely be going back.
