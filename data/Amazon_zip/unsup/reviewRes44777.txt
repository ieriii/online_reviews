When I worked closer to this location, this was our de-facto place to order pizza for parties, or even to visit on a slow day. The problem? I do not care for their pizza, and the menu offers little else that's even remotely appetizing. This location is set up kind of cramped - we couldn't stop bumping elbows wherever we sat. Despite the close quarters, for whatever reason, every server we've had has somehow missed 2-3 people at a big table. Very odd. The thing that killed the outings was when we showed up with a reservation twice in a row, and they couldn't sit us all together - some were in booths, others were at a table in a different room...it was really awkward and irritating. Add to that, we had to shuttle plates of different pizzas to the other people in our party and practically had to beg for refills. So, going to Giordano's is something a non-native Chicagoan should do - you should go everywhere, check everything out. But this place has sang for me and I think it may be tone deaf. God love it for trying.
