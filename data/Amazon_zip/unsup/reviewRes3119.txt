I don't really like chicken, and i especially hate eating things with bones in it (just a weird thing i have) BUT i can't resist eating the wings at Crisp. How do they make them so crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside?! The sauces are so good. The Buddha bowls have me literally obsessed. I like them with the Seoul Sassy sauce, which i would put on all my food ever if i could.
