I don't take lightly the fact that I am rating this place 5 stars. It very well may be the best breakfast option in Chicago. While I like Orange's creativity, I prefer to eat here. The atmosphere is very comfortable. Modern interior with lots of wood. It may be the cleanest restaurant that I have ever visited. Our waitress was a lovely young woman with a greek accent. While she seemed to be shy by nature she was very proud of the food and made a few suggestions from the daily specials. Again when she delivered the home made jams and honey butter she explained them with pride. As others have mentioned, the menu is huge. Normally I find this is an indication of a lot of frozen foods bought from Sysco, but that is clearly not the case. All of the menu items are original and appear to have been prepared with love from scratch ingredients. Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. I tried the signature dish, Meli honeycakes. They were delicious. Much lighter than I expected. The cornmeal gives them a wonderful texture. I ate much more than I expected (the food portions are crazy big). My wife had a delicious frittata that was light and filled with fresh vegetables. I had one of the hand squeezed juices (orange grapefruit). Fresh and delicious with just enough pulp to reassure me it was just squeezed. I loved it. There are lots of things for me to try on future visits including an assortment of crepes and 8 different types of eggs benedict. We were immediately seated at 0830 on Saturday morning. When we left a little after 0900 there were a couple of parties waiting to be seated, not bad for Saturday morning breakfast rush. This place is well loved on Yelp, but does not seem to have much buzz beyond that. It is worth the trip to the heart of Greektown for breakfast.
