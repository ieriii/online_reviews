For the longest time I thought this place had only chicken. Actually they have quite a few vegetable bowls, albeit marinated in sesame oil, and a couple salads. They offer an option of brown rice for $1.50 extra and tofu, chicken, or steak for 1.00 extra. So its not just fried chicken here, you can actually get a pretty balanced meal. I ordered the Bad Boy Buddha bowl and asked for it without oil. I thought this meant they would steam the vegetables, but apparently not. All (or most) vegetables are marinated in the morning and he can't make any exceptions/special orders (I'm sure he would but I would have to call very far in advance and pay a hefty service charge). I get my vegetables and there is oil on them and I ask him about it, he said he thought I meant the extra squirt they put on top before serving. No. So we had the conversation resuting in the info presented at the beginning of this paragraph. Still I ate it and it was good. What's an additional estimated 20-25 grams of fat with my veggies, anyway? And its sesame oil, not like, lard. The sauce that comes with the Buddha bowls is good, also, and they will sell it to you a la carte if you want. The decor is bright with beautiful long tables that encourage communal eating. I didn't notice if there is a bathroom or not...probably...I would assume.
