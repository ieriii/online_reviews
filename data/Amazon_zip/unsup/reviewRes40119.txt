this is a charming restaurant with a menu and prices comparable to lula's. we ordered a butternut squash appetizer and a seafood dish with a truly incredible sauce (the truffle oil made it), but the most impressive course by far was the gruyere/goat cheese donut dessert. fresh donuts and fried cheese: two of the best things in the world combined with a sweet (but not sickening sweet) sauce- brilliant! the beer and wine selection is impressive, though hardly pretentious (you can order anything from a delirium tremens to a $2 pbr). my only complaints: 1) the portions were a bit on the small side, so we spent a bit more than we wanted to. 2) there weren't many vegetarian options (we're fair weather vegetarians who sometimes eat fish when we're really hungry and options are few.) i think next time we'll just order sandwiches.
