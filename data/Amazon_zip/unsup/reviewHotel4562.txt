I have stayed at the PH for about 10 years to attend an annual conference here. It's always been a good hotel. Great location, Rooms are usually fairly nice, though they do seem worn out. Well, they're working on that now. RIGHT now. I flew in last night from California, did not get to bed until very late. This morning at 7:00 (Note: that's 5 a.m. Pacific time, where I am coming from), I wake up to the sounds of hammering and what sounds like a router drill on the other side of the wall at the head of my bed. No chance of sleep. I called the front desk. They were apologetic, but the hotel's full, they can't change my room until later. So be warned: this hotel's under construction, and if you value SLEEP, you should ask for a room as far from the construction as possible.
