My boyfriend took me here to celebrate my birthday, for their ultra special underground menu. Since it was not a typical dining experience, I loved it. There was no guess work in figuring out what to eat, we simply focused on staring at each other and our beautifully sculptured entrees. My favorite was our 4th Course - Pulled Pork, Scallion Sabayon, White Chocolate Barbeque Sauce Gooseberry. I think that I have not even listed half of the things in the title, but it was great! A perfect balance of exquisite taste of chocolate, bbq and tangy zest! My next favorite was desert, 6th course - Caramelized Brioche, Pumpkin Caramel, Pecan Pudding, Candied Lemon, Thyme & Vanilla. It tasted like sweet bliss. Thyme on a desert, who would have thought of that! What a great combination of flavors! I can only dream of it again. The only reason why I can't give it five stars is because I don't think I will come back any time soon. It was so expensive it broke my appetite, and I had to bring my own wine!
