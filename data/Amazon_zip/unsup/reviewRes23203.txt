This place has good food and good portions with a good price! Great vegetarian options! The Costa Rican rice is highly recommended! In the summer there is great outdoor seating. The place is small though which some people like but also can be tough to get a good seat on certain times of the day. I will also mention that it is a cash only place! Two thumbs up for this place!
