If you're looking for a breakfast place where you'll be waiting outside for more than a half hour, and when you will be finally seated you'll be rushed by the busboy to finish your meal by constantly asking you if they can take your dishes away, even though the food is still on your plate and if you're unfortunate to be seated in a middle raw table be ready to have your chair constantly bumped into by the constant moving of waitresses, busboy, managers and people who are seated. If this doesn't stop you, go ahead and enjoy a not so great meal for a high price where they charge extra if you want some more maple syrup for your pancake. Dan
