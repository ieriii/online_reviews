Too bad I can't tell you how great the food was or how kind the wait staff was during our visit. The owner, Jonathan, turned away 20 people who didn't even need to be seated at the same place in the restaurant and were willing to wait and drink until things opened up. When calling earlier in the day, the girl who worked in the restaurant knew that he'd be a jerk about it and let us know when we called that if it were her restaurant, she'd never turn away business like that. Apparently, he has a disgust for getting lots of paying customers at once. We had to wait for him to return our call to see if we would be allowed to come to his establishment. Pshhh. We called as a courtesy to give him a heads up. His explanation for telling us NOT to come? Our "party" wanted to come to the restaurant during their dinner rush. Last I checked, we would have been customers as well. It's too bad you didn't accommodate our group, Spacca Napoli. Major thumbs down. We will take our business elsewhere and make sure to steer people away from your restaurant.
