Yummy! Frontera Grill is one of Rick Bayless's (from Top Chef) awesome establishment. My Chicago Native friend took me to Frontera Grill for the first time! I was informed that there is always a wait so it is best to make a reservation ahead of time. Even so, expect to wait in a line. We came for lunch at 11:30 and did not wait very long.  With new menus every month, this place gives you the incentive to continuously revisit this nice venue. Food was excellent!! For appetizer, we had their Ceviche Yucateco which was steamed organic shrimp and calamari served in a margarita cup in lime, orange, habanero, avocado, jcama and cilantro mixture. As my main course, I had their Tacos al Carbon with marinated duck!! I never had duck at a Mexican-influenced eatery before, so that was definitely different and exciting. Definitely worth it with their unlimited homemade tortillas!! MmMm. While I had their tacos, my friend had the fish of the day special - which I was informed was filled with yumminess as well. For dessert, there is always room for dessert despite how overly stuffed I was with eating all of their amazing tortillas!! It is all in the mindset - one should always make sure that there is ALWAYS room for dessert, or else the meals just doesn't feel complete! We had the Duo de Flanes! This included TWO Mexican caramel flan. mMmMm! One was a lemon based while the other was vanilla with pomegranate-orange salsa with raspberry. OMG! Yum. Amazed. Happy. =D
