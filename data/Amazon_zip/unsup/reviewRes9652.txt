What a delightful evening at Sprout! The adventure starts with the minimalist menu descriptions, forcing you to dig more clues out of your server. My brother took Yelpers advice and ordered the foie gras to start. I am not a fg fan, but this won me over. It was like my tastebuds were twinkling! My main was the rabbit, of which the truffle gnocchi stole the show in the best possible way. Between mains and dessert we were served a grilled cheese with aged Wisconsin cheddar, paired with a fragrant IPA. This was another highlight, and I know I will hazily reminisce about it after a long night of drinking. For dessert, my brother's corn dish was really, really good. You must like corn, however. But who doesn't like corn?
