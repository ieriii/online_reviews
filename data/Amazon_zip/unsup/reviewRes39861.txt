Quite pervasive with the scent of smoked meats. Not carniverous by any means, but I can recognize the smell of exquisitely executed fare when I come across it. Extensive whiskey list and a few carefully crafted $8 cocktails. This place is pretty much perfect for the appreciator of fine meats and whiskey. Unfortunately, of those things I am not a fan. However, I AM content sip on a beer ($2 PBR if you MUST) and enjoy the dark, intimate and warm atmosphere - a nice accompaniment to these still-too-cold Chicago nights.
