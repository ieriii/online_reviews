My favorite pizza so far in the city (and that is a big claim). The pizzas are huge. Salads and desserts are equally delicious. I really loved this place and plan on returning often. My only complaint is that its a bit small, when its busy, it feels cramped. But that is the only bad thing I can say about this place. So good! My stomach is growling just thinking about it!
