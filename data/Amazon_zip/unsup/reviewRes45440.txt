Not terribly impressed with the Wilde Bar. I went there for dinner on a Thursday evening at a reasonable dinner hour. The hostess sat us at a large round table near the front of the restaurant. I was surprised by how large and new everything looked, but annoyed by how cold and loud the place was. There was a mixed crowd eating there... a few people at the bar drinking, but most guests were at tables eating dinner. Therefore, I didn't understand why the music was so loud. It was difficult to hold a conversation with five people at my table.  I decided to split the Chicken Pot Pie and Mac and Cheese with my friend. The Mac and Cheese was better than my Chicken Pot Pie. The pie would have been great, but the carrots inside weren't even cooked throughout and I found one piece of fatty chicken in my half. I hate fatty chicken.  My other friends ordered the Fish and Chips, the Reuben, and the Meatloaf. It was my sister who ordered the Reuben and she didn't like it because she said they used a different dressing instead of the normal 1000 island.  Our server was friendly, but sparse during our meal. We actually got more and better service from the bus boy and wanted to give him a tip when we left, but we couldn't find him. Too bad for him.
