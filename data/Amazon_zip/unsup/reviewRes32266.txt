Demera, Demera, Demera. You have been silently stalking me for the two years that I've lived in Uptown. Day in and day out you've watched me get on and off the Lawrence Red Line. Finally, I have decided to pay you a visit. After hearing nothing but great things about Demera for a long time I finally have the chance to stop by over the weekend for dinner. Friends have been raving about it, especially the vegetarian and vegan options. I arrived with a friend at about 8:30ish and the place was packed. Great! Always good to see a neighborhood restaurant supporting itself. Finally we sat down and I was starving. I started off with the vegetarian sambussa and I'm going to say WOW. Awesome. It was one of those strange vegetarian moments where you could have sworn you were eating a meat. The lentils, onions, and peppers were perfectly spicy. Time for the main dish. I went with the ye-misir wot which was described as split red lentil stewed in our rich berbere sauce with onions, garlic and ginger. Sounds good! My friend got chicken so I looked the other direction and acted like I didn't know him. It took awhile for our dishes to come out so I was starving. The plate came out on the huge plate with a little bit of extra lentils and what looked like spinach. This was my deal breaker. I was told that you dip and use your hands. Cool, that's fun. What I was told, was that the bread was nothing like pita or naan, but a slippery, sloppy, rubbery sponge. The food was fantastic, but I just could not get over the "bread" that was served. I know it's ethnic, I get that but it was a little distracting. Loved the stew, loved the spinach, and everything else. But you can keep the bread. I did enjoy it though! The different food made for a fun night out.
