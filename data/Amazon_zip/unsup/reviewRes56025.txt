This is a good restaurant with very good food, but it's a little pricey for what you get. I'm not saying the food isn't good, because it is good, but what I am saying is that you could go to portillo's for a burger thats just as good for 1/3 the price. nice environment for working lunches, or an after-work drink. and there are cute guys, but they're married.
