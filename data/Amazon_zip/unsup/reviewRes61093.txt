I had the chicken tacos on one ocassion, and the fish tacos on another. Both times, I got them to-go.Dude, the place was as smokey as all get-out -- my brother had to exit the place cause he couldn't stand it. It smelled really badly of grease. Just today I was walking by the place, and it smells up that whole area like grease.The chicken tacos were underwhelming. Why charge extra for guac, cheese, etc.? Why not just make a good taco, and then charge whatever is appropriate? Both the chicken and the fish were dry-tasting (even with salsa) and needed sour cream or cheese or something. My brother said the same thing about his ground beef tacos. If I'm forced to go again, I'll definitely pay extra for the cheese, but can't they just make that the default....
