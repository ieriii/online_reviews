Bad Apple, I don't think so...more like, Golden Delicious Apple! Where do I begin, this burger and beer haven is one of my favorite places within the 1 mile radius of my hood. The ambiance featuring dim lighting and local art is cool and hip without coming off as pretentious. Good music with flair and an accommodating wait staff bring the experience full circle. What makes this a staple is the fantastic and extensive beer list (complete with a number of sour beer choices). I will always order the cheese curds to start. You just cannot find a better pairing for your beer. Light yellow soft perfect curds surrounded by an almost tempura like batter...HEAVEN. Next you have to somehow decide between a sandwich or a burger. So far, I can say Elvis's Last Supper is perfect if what you want a rich and indulgent burger, this sandwich is not for the faint of heart...but it is oh so amazing! Also, the Edmund Fig-Gerald is the perfect blend of light and flavorful...oh so tasty! All paired with fries that can be doused with your favorite flavoring (truffle, firecracker, old bay, curry, garlic, sweet & spicy chipotle, creole or natural) and complimented with the home made ketchup. I suspect a curry infusion is happening behind the scenes. I will bite this Bad Apple any time! I've heard that's what got us here in the first place.
