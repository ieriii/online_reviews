Pig, meat, and fish focused. Perfect spot for this pig lover, and her Pescatarian and beneficial B-blood type friend. The vibe is Harry Potter dining hall gone country coral. Communal dining galore. I will return just in hopes to sit in the "pig pen" booths. The standing room only "pre dinner" area is a genius offering. The kitchen, open, busy, and beautiful. Service was ever so accommodating and knowledgeable. The fares are served family style and will arrive at the table courses out and when ready. If you think you are too full stop thinking and get dessert. Two actually. Totally worth it.
