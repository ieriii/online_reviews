BURNT CRUST.Some of you out there will not read any further and think yuk and with any other place you would be right,HOWEVER,the burnt crust on the deep dish pies here is THE reason I have been coming here with my friends for going on 4 years. Place can be dingy with meaningless sports/other visual noise staffed by bored barely 21 gum chewers, but all that fades into the periphery once the 20 minute wait is over and the piping hot slab of caramelized cheesy dough is plopped into your waiting maw.Honestly a must-try chicago experience.
