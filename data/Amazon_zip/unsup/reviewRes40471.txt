I went to Tank last night with my boyfriend, because I had a hankering for some pho. I've never frequented any Uptown Asian restaurants, because I have always been a Chinatown fanatic. All that changed last night! Of course, I ordered the largest pho dish on the menu, the one that's only $11. The bowl was huge, and the server gave us plenty of fresh bean sprouts and greens to add. Tank's pho exceeded my expectations! The broth was savory, but also had a sweet side to it. The beef was tender, sliced very thin. They added just the right amount of tripe, which is that chewey white stuff. The server was very friendly, and outgoing, joking with me about getting that XL pho bowl. If you're a pho fanatic, and are on the adventurous side, I recommend taking a visit to Tank Noodles! You will not regret it.
