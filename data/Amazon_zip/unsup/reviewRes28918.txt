Oh, Mr. Bayless. You can pretty much do no wrong. While I love that he is gaining more popularity and national recognition, the wait for his restaurants I do not. Most of the time I just go and wait, or go later and wait less. My favorite thing to do is go and order a bunch of tapas so everyone can share and try the best of the best. That being said, the chicken mole enchiladas are my favorite item on the menu and would order those any day. The seasonal menu is great since this is a fun place to bring people, you can mix it up and try something new when you want- including drinks. And if you're lucky, catch a celebrity sighting or Mr. Bayless himself. Well done!
