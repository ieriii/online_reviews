Great burger bar. One of the best in Chicago. For starters there is a great beer list by tap and bottle. There are some creative cocktails as well. Try the cigarette and hot sauce. The cheese curds are awesome and the different burgers are great. I had Elvis's last supper which had peanut butter an bacon. Totally worked. One great thing is the burger to bun ratio is perfect.....bun all the way to the last bite.
