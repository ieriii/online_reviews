It's a tradition for my group of friends that whenever someone moves, we all pitch in and come here after to celebrate the successful move. This time was no exception. It's a great place, can accomodate large groups reasonably well, and serves delicious beer and pizza. Highlights : Try the mashed potatoes on the pizza. Just try it. We usually do a red with pepperoni and giardinera. It's always the best one, no matter what the other pizza we get is. Today was a bit of a struggle because someone had ordered a perzonal pizza and it came out 20 minutes later than the 2 large pizzas we ordered, but they comped it and everything else went off with a hitch. In her defense, it was lunch time and we were sort of a larger party. If this would have been my 1st time here I probably would have given them 3 stars, but because we'd been here before and it was a great experience I'll roll the two into one and average at a 4 star rating. Also their beers are delicious. You can get a flight for $8. Amazing! The 3oz skippers cost $1 each, which blew my mind. The bathrooms are a little skeezy though. I'm really struggling with the 4 star rating because this experience was not a 4 star experience, but their pizza's fucking delicious and 3oz tests for a $1. So there it is.
