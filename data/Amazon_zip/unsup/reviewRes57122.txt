Really fun, excellent service, amazing food. We ordered every appetizer on the menu and the cheese sampler. We spread everything out over the course of the evening. I will go back for entrees. Many reviews complained of it being too loud. I was really worried about this and found it not to be an issue whatsoever. I was also worried this would be a tourist trap, but never felt that way. And, by the way, what is so wrong with being a suburban visitor?
