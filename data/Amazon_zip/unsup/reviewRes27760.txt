Please do yourself a favor, splurge and order The Experience. You get a slew of smaller sized portions of pretty much everything on the menu. It is not too much food, it is a phenomenal dining experience that is worth the price - you'll be talking about your meal for months. Deconstructed food that is so fun, fanciful and oh so delicious. Very, very creative. Presentation is absolutely beautiful, every dish seems to have a theme. Service is great. I loved every course and to my surprise out of all the amazing offerings - my favorite was the chicken. Still can't believe this, but it was seriously special. Once again, order The Experience. I don't think just getting an entree is representative of what Graham Elliot has to offer. This place is amazing and you don't want to sell yourself short.
