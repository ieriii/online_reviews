To come here you must first like deep dish pizza or be like me and want to try everything Chicago has to offer. There is usually a long line of tourists. You can get around this because if you go to the Jon Hancock Observatory the concierge can hook you up and give you a pass so you can go to the front of the line at Gino's pizza. So my group and I go. We ordered mozzarella sticks and a deep dish pizza. The pizza takes a long time so be prepared, if your forget they will remind you. The pizza was umm deep, and very cheesy. If you like deep and cheesy, you will enjoy this. It was personally too much for me. I prefer thin pizza. So basically I was the problem and not the pizza. The atmosphere is really cool though.
