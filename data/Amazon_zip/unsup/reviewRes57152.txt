This place is pretty good. The beers that they brew are all pretty good. I don't think they're the best thing in the world, but they're good. They're reasonably priced. It's kind of a nice novelty.The burgers are really the deal. They're big, they're delicious. The pizza leaves a bit to be desired. I don't know why they're doing pizzas--they're just not that good. But the sandwiches are great. The chicken sandwich even is pretty good. I don't usually get a chicken sandwich, but I dare you not to like theirs.What else...service is find. The atmosphere is pretty nice in that it's got a bit of a hipster feel to it, but it's not dark and loud. It caters to a wide variety of people.
