One of the best Sunday brunches in the city! I came here with my husband for Easter Brunch, the food was amazing (you must try the bacon!!!), the service was impeccable and very reasonably priced. We had $3.00 mimosa's - I think this may have been for Easter though...whatever the cost, we can't wait to return. I saw a poster that they have music on Wednesday evenings from 7 - 10 pm, this is a must try. I would also call to find out when their upstairs patio opens as I bet that is as amazing as the rest of the place. Again, a great place for brunch and excited to go back for dinner and drinks!
