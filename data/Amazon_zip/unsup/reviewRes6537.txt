1) It was cold, and 2) it was raining and 3) we were hungry! A sad trio.  We drove to Taylor Street anxious for a yummy meal at Mia Francesca. OH NO! Closed until 4pm!!!  What to do? Ah ha! There, waiting like a knight in shining armor, was our savior - Davanti Enoteca. We scurried across the street to find it rather busy and settled in to a table in the Wine Store section. Italian Tapas? We were game. We ordered the Pizza with Tomato and Basil - Excellent! We then tried the roasted squash + farro + whipped goat cheese + hazelnuts + watercress ... another score. We ordered the Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori al forno- giant rigatoni + sausage + oven roasted tomato + parmigiano and the Ravioli (a large round one). I give big points to the Rigatoni but not for the Ravioli. All in all, a pleasant experience and certainly an excellent substitute when Mia is not open or too busy. Our tummies full, we were happy with our find and left happy with the remaining pizza. $40+ for 2 without wine.
