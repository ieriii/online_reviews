If you're obsessed with beautifully decorated restaurants with a hint of attitude...welcome to Wakamono. While the demure servers are attentive and friendly, the host nine times out of ten has an attitude and seems uninterested in helping you. Once seated, the music can be more than a little distracting. There's a koi pond in the front, which is supposed to be relaxing...and there's hip hop blasting from overhead speakers. Their classic maki rolls are A-ok, but they're best at making contemporary maki. Definitely try the Peter Parker Spider Roll, it has softshell crab and eel (not for the feint of heart). For the vegetarians, the Sweet Potato Roll contains yam and cream cheese to satisfy your sweet tooth.  As for their drinks, the martinis are nothing special. After trying several, the running theme is to water down the drinks so people will order more. Because it has soft lighting, this would be the ideal place for a first date--if you don't mind P.Diddy rapping while you're gazing into their eyes.
