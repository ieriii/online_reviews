My wife and I love this place! The food is delicious, the salad bar is remarkable, and the service is always good. The selection of meats is fabulous, except for the unfortunate waiter who comes with the sausage, which I tend to refuse.It can be a bit pricey, but the atmosphere is awesome, the place tends to stay quiet, and is a good place for a date.Compared to Fogo de Chao, I prefer Texas de Brazil; however, I've never been to Brazza's.They take reservations so take advantage and call ahead of time to guarantee seating; I never go without calling ahead of time.For parking, if you're willing to pay, they provide valet parking. Otherwise, if you take Ohio and get there about 6:00, street parking starts from 6:00/6:30 depending on the night. We always get there around that time and we've never a problem finding parking. It's $5-$6 an hour, max 2 hours, if I'm not mistaken.
