How in the world it took me this long to go here is beyond me. This place is hands down the best hot dogs and fries. The atmosphere is pretty much awesome. How can you go wrong with great food, fun/retro/kitschy decor, and the owner taking your order? And seriously, the food is good. The ingredients are of excellent quality (not always true for hot dogs...). If you have yet to venture out to Hot Doug's- go. go now. And make sure you have cash with you.
