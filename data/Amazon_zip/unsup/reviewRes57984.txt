Great place to have dinner when going out for a night on the town.My friends and I came in from out of town for my 30th birthday and I wanted a place to have a good meal and something that was nothing like anything else where I come from.The food is great and I like how the menu changes daily based on what they have on hand. The prices on the menu are moderate and you can leave the restaurant without having to spend more than $40, including food, drinks and tip.The only thing that I have against the place and the reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is the wait we had. I had a reservation for 10 and only half where there, so we did not get seated until 8 of us showed up. So I will suggest to eat here by all means but if you have a large party, make sure they all get there on time or you will be waiting until they do.Again, great place for dinner, great service and great atmosphere.
