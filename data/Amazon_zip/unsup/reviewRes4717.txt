The little restaurant right across the street from the Intercontinental Hotel is awesome. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the Fried Pigs Ears, Razor Clams, Beets Andre Goat Cheese and the Pig Liver Pate was better than Foie Gras. The atmosphere with the communal seating is relaxing and more enjoyable than private tables. People watching is highly encouraged so you can see what other table-mates are having and maybe have another tapas by watching their enjoyment of the dish. I will recommend this restaurant to everyone that I know. They are awesome!
