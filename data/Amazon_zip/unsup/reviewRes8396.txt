Well i wanted to give it 5 stars, but my pocket hurts. As far as the food & service EXCELLENT! !!!I can see why it would be pricey. It's pretty great that there is no thinking involved for this place. I went here on a Sunday with my sisters. So this is how it all went down... Came in, smiles everywhere..was sat down by 3 servers who pulled out our chairs (honestly not used to that, very nice!) asked for drinks (received within 2min),and then the process explaination. First off, there really is no menu other than what you can get for meats and drinks. What you need to know: 1. there's an open salad bar and 2. there are servers with meat constantly walking around, ready to serve you meat when you flip your card to green, red for 'no serve'(you'll get it) and 3. you better be prepared to eat. Point to be made: you're never waiting, constantly being served (but not in an annoying way) and better come with a HUGE APPETITE. I came out with a food coma, that means GOOD EATING in my book. Guaranteed FULLNESS! To meateaters, THIS IS HEAVEN!!!!!
