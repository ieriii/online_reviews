this is the first bar i went to when i moved to Chicago last year. what a high bar to set (no pun intended)! in love w/the rooftop lounge here and the tasty cocktails are FAB! last wkend i had a strawberry mojito and watched the bartender muddle up that scrumptious concoction right in front of my very own eyes! talk about fresh ingredients = YUMS! only thing i don't like is the somewhat pretentious "line" and handing out of pagers to get up to the rooftop. last wkend we got a table downstairs while we waited to go up to the roof, got paged about 20 mins later to go up, got up to the roof and it was HALF EMPTY!!! WHAT?!?! you made ME wait downstairs whilst there is NOBODY up here anyways??!! that kinda wore me out, not gonna lie...i'm willing to give Zed a pardon for that experience since that has only happened this once. but if i have to wait again just to go up there and hear crickets, i'm knocking at least 2 stars off...
