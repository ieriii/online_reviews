Very mediocre. For a restaurant that prides itself on using fresh ingredients and unique suppliers, I find it odd that the food tastes very "diner - esque". On many occasions, I find the staff uninformed on the menu and very aloof. Also, for the pricetag, I will spend my money elsewhere, where I am guaranteed a great meal with freshly bought and prepared ingredients.
