I've been a regular here since it opened. This is a perfect place for any meal. Although the specialty is the fish for dinner, I have come to be more a Glenn's fan for the breakfast. Fantastic and underappreciated brunch spot. There is everything from specialty dishes to never ending bowls of cereal and huge breakfast sandwiches.
