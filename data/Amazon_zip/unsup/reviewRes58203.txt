What to say about Alinea? A dinner at Alinea is an intense journey through a world of flavor, texture, and truly artistic presentation. Chef Grant blends flavors in ways you could never imagine. In this process he often creates a dish so unique, so beautiful you almost hate to consume it and would rather simply ponder the complexities of something that is, in essence, nothing more than fuel for your body. Chef G takes a lot of risks with his food. Some are absolutely triumphant. Hot Potato/Cold Potato and the Ravioli Explosion were both courses highlighting the unparalleled decadence of black truffle (other than maybe white truffle). Also a cold foie gras/crabapple morsel blew my mind. But as stunning as Chef G is in his successes he was equally abysmal (albeit only 2 out of 25 courses) in his failures*. One example features a delicate piece of cobia suspended above a smoldering cedar shaving, the smoke of which permeates the air around the table after the lid to the bowl is removed during presenatation. The cobia has been flavored with the not-so-subtle flavors of tobacco and radish in addition to having been saturated by the smoke. The flavor was something I have come to describe as Bitter Campfire Charcoal. And this is coming from a guy who orders his steaks rare+ charred. Taken as a whole however, this meal was spectacular and whimsical. 4+ hours flew by and when dinner was over I found myself ready to plop down another $1000 so my g/f and I could do it all over again (although this may have had to do with the generous wine pours throughout the 25 courses). And if you're going to go to Alinea on a budget - don't. Do yourself a favor and put away the extra $'s so you can spluge for the full tasting menu and premium wine pairings. In my humble opinion you won't regret it.
