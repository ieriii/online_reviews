The hotel Felix is NOT a design hotel, but it is a much better alternative to  chain hotels of any sort. It's located in the up-and-coming Near North neighborhood which is comprised of galleries, bars and amazing new restaurants. It is an "eco-hotel" which I love and wish more hotels would do but I found myself bored by this place. But then again, I am a designer and I base my reviews on snobby things like lighting and architectural features. Most will enjoy this place, but next time I'll stay at the James. I should mention that the service was great and there was good coffee.
