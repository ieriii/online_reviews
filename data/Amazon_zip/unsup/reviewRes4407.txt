Great atmosphere. Great history. Great music. Especially if you're a music lover. Whether it's a friend or family member who's coming to visit me, I love taking them here. Be mindful of the band playing though, as certain acts here may have a no talking policy during the performance. If it's a date and you want to let your eyes do the talking, this might just be the place. Good drinks here too. Be warned that it may be crowded and you may have to stand for awhile. Arrive early if a seat is most important to you.
