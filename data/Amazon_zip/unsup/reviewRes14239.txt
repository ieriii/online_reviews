After living a stone's throw away from 90 Miles for a couple years, I can finally say I've tried it. Damn is it good! What took me so long??? I stopped in to grab some dinner to take home after a very long day at the office. I honestly wanted to try everything on their menu, but settled for the bistec dinner and an order of croquetas. The bistec was tender and juicy and covered with onions, garlic, and other wonderful things of which I do not know the name. The rice was yummy and went perfectly with everything else. The plantains were very sweet, a nice change up from the bistec. The croquetas were awesome, as fried, diced ham sticks should be! Huge portions? Yuh huh. I was famished and there was enough food to fill me up and still have a complete dinner for the next night. The people there are very cool, I ordered based solely off their recommendations and was very pleased. The food was up very quickly, but not at the expense of being cooked before I ordered it. I'll be back early and often, perhaps for breakfast next time!
