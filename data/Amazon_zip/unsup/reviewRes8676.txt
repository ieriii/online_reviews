This pizza is truly a recreation of what one can expect when visiting Naples. I was so impressed with the quality of the ingredients! Real Buffalo Mozzarella. Prosciutto (di Parma?) that isn't cut too thin, which is how one encounters it in Italy. The Aceto Balsamico was of a very good quality and it makes a difference, even when used in a salad dressing. The tomato sauce was perfectly done....not too bitter and not too sweet. I could go on...All I can say is if you are having withdrawals from your summer spent in Italy, go to Spacca Napoli as soon as possible!
