Went here on a mini cupcake crawl. The shop looks very mom & pop, which I really liked. It made the goodies look even more homemade and yummy. I tried the red velvet cupcake, which was huge! Unfortunately I found the cupcake too dense and not sweet enough for my liking. It was still very good, but not the best I've tried. I'd like to go back and try some of their other goodies, especially their cakes.
