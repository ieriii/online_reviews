WOW is all I can say. This place is amazing. I grew up in Chicago and have had pizza from all the best places, at least I thought so until last night. We had a small group of 3 couples and everyone (2 Canadians and 4 Chicagoans) thought this was the best pizza we have ever had. We tried a Deepdish and a thin crust. While I prefer a thinner, thin crust the crust was amazing. The deep dish had the caramelized crust which was a first for us all, and we thought it was really good. Our server was just as good as the pizza, friendly and attentive.
