Buzz-ay Buzz-ay is all i can say about this place! Psyche! Just kidding, i have a lot more to say about this establishment. I came here yesterday after a hard workout and in my moment of being gluttonous, i decided to try out Nuevo Leon. And there goes my workout! But i have to say, i was not disappointed. I got the carne tampaquena and it was hearty serving of a gigantic steak and it's side kick was an enchilada, rice, and beans. Mmmmhh, mmmh good! The steak was awesome but the enchilada was incredible. It had cheese inside and a sweet mole sauce on top. Simply divine! Bad: (Or rather sorta bad) Friday night is called "caution night", ladies and gentlemen. Why? Because starting off, we were lining up in the middle of the restaurant and staring at people eating while waiting for a open seat. And when it was our turn, we got seating sat in the middle and newly arrived people were staring at us. So word of the wise, go on less peak hours. Also, double wrapping a taco with 2 tortillas would be a good idea because my friend's 3rd taco was near destruction after consuming the first two.(The corn tortillas got too soggy and ripped) Another topic of discussion would be the service. Wait, did i even get any service?, don't think so. I guess this could be overlook just because it was so busy yesterday. The line started in the front of the restaurant and traveled to the door in the back. Wow, everybody probably thought the same thing i did yesterday. Go to Nuevo Leon. They must be psychic!
