I had really high hopes for L & E and the food absolutely lived up to that. It started off a bit shaky... Confusion related to our large group of 8 (even though we called ahead to make sure this was okay and were told "absolutely"--weird), which was ultimately split into 2 tables of 4 (sad face). Speaking of odd, it was SLAMMED at 6 pm on a Friday. We didn't know there'd be such a rush for the blue plate special, but as it turned out, there was an entire restaurant FILLED TO THE BRIM with losers like us, eating during happy hour. Once we sat down, everything was incredible (and the super contrite managers and hostess were focused on our collective well-being). We got the meatballs (mmmmm) and this insane classy version of a tater-tot filled with ricotta (Ricotta Gnuddi) on some sort of mind-blowing sauce. We literally (but subtly) licked the plates clean. The bus boys were more than a little amused. I had the maple braised pork shank for dinner; so tender, you could breathe on it and the meat would fall off the bone. I also had a Harvest Sidecar drink which was delicious and complemented the food's earthiness. Dessert was almost too experimental (I say that as someone who's been to WD-50-- the house of weird-- but enjoyed it)... of course we ate every bite, but I don't know if I'd die to eat them again. A meal that was well-worth it. Now if only we could all sit together...
