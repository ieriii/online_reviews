Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and he seemed to love it. The concept was great and the decor was beautiful. i loved the woman who flew around in the wine area. Only problem, me being the vegetarian, didnt have much options, unlike what the website has. Most of the "40 item" salad bar is meat. I'd recommend to anyone who loves meat, its all you can eat.
