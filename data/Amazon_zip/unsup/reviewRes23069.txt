This place is strictly a tourist spot. Family owned for years. Can't miss the hot dog couple on the roof on this joint. They have parking hops, you park your car under a shanty roof and order your food from a menu on the hop. Waitstaff comes out to your car with your food. You can walk inside to a crampt space in front and order your food through a window. There is no inside to this place, you either sit in your car or sit at the picnic tables outside. Its like a typical hot dog joint. They use that bright green relish, the dog is served in a box with your fries on the side. The plain dog is nothing special, its small, and compares to a dog sold at a gas station. Prices are moderate, though some of the bigger dogs are too pricey. if you like char-food, I'd say, move further down the street to Booby's. This place is better for families with children or older people that would like a blast from the past. (as said in Camille's review)
