This restaurant left a lot to be desired, and I typically love Jerry Kleiner restaurants. They get 5 stars for decor and atmosphere. I agree its VERY loud, we were actually seated in a more quiet dining area although it was still hard to hear, it was not the main room so it also lacked in atmosphere. Service was ok. We felt very rushed and that our food was being thrown at us. The guacamole was touted as amazing and we were all unimpressed. The ceviche was fine, nothing too special. My entree was a fish special (an austrailian bass) and it was fine but completely forgetable. Its a great scene, lots of beautiful people--don't expect too much from the food though!
