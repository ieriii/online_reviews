Oh my what a restaurant Gilt is. Sexy, sexy, sexy.... I visited last night (sat 9/24) around 10ish without reservations expecting to wait at least 30 minutes for a table but as soon as we walked in we were seated. Beautiful interior and a trendy crowd flowed throughout. I was really hoping check out the basement lounge but unfortunately it was rented out to a private party. The food was phenomenal, the drinks were strong and the service was friendly and attentive. Make sure you get dessert, trust me! The banana split is amazing! I will definitely be returning soon!
