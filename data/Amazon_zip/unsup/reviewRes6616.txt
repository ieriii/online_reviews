We live just a few blocks away and I've been smelling their bbq for MONTHS! Having heard about the smoked oysters event, we came for July 4th weekend. Turns out they'd stopped having smoked oysters (doesn't that sound good though?!) but we stayed for dinner anyway. Kobe brisket, half rack of St. Louis ribs, fries, cornbread. Thought it'd be too much but we finished every bite. AND we munched on a bunch of their complimentary chips and pickles too! Everything was very good though perhaps not amazing.. but many components were a nice extra touch -- the free apps obviously, the spicy bbq sauce and the south carolina mustard, the water glasses constantly being refilled. And how our waiter changed our order a bit so we got more food for the same price! Restaurant is a little fancier than your usual bbq shack, but it still has a nice homey feel, and the waitstaff were all very sweet. Wish we'd have left room for their cobbler! *only annoyance, and it's a minor one, is that I'm pretttttty sure it's not KOBE brisket, and I don't like it when restaurants just slap on that name to sound cool. no one in the US has kobe beef, okay?*
