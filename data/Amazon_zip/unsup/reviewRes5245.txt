I have been here a couple times now and have to say I am torn between whether Purple Pig is just ok or whether I like it.  I am going to say I like it because some dishes I had were stellar.  Some dishes were just so-so in my opinion, but now that I know what to order, I am a fan of Purple Pig. It was packed when I came for a weekday dinner. Good thing I had a reservation. Not sure if a table would have been possible without a reservation.  It was pretty empty when I came in for a Sunday lunch at noon. I have had a lot of dishes here, but will just group the more memorable ones. Dishes I really liked: -Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey - may sound boring, but this pork steak was one of the juiciest steaks of any kind I have eaten! -Purple Pig Platter -Sicilian Iris Dishes I thought were good: -Grilled cheese -Quail with Salsify & Pomegranate -Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette Dishes that were disappointing: -Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Too bland for my liking. I have had stellar versions before.
