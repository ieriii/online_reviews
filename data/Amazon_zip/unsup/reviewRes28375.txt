There was a time I went here almost every single week for two months. I was just into it that much and would have given this 5 stars. The popcorn is great, the pork on a bone thingy(forgot what it was exactly called) was great, the desserts are indescribeable. That said, since I first went there it has gone downhill a little. Just a little! But the last time i went the popcorn didn't seem just as fresh, and the menu had changed. Pork on a bone thingy was gone, replaced with another pork dish. But the gnochi is excellent and I love how it had the egg. Not sure if they still have this dish has it's been a little while since i went. A nice, trendy place still and look forward to going back again.
