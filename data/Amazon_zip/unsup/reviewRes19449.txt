Overall: Simple food that's full of flavor. Food/Drinks: My favorite thing on the menu is the mushroom & goat cheese torta -- BUT -- i'm fairly confident you could throw a dart board at the menu and be happy where it landed. The flavors are simple, but that's the point. The bread is fantastic! The proscuitto option has a salty sweetness to it and doesn't taste like you would expect, but it is still good. As for the hot chocolate - order one and drink it while you wait in line. My personal favorite is the almond milk hot chocolate, my dad swears by the espresso variety. If it doesn't taste thick & rich, send it right back. They will happily make a fresh one for you. Service/Atmosphere: Once you make it through the line (and let me tell you, there WILL be a line) the food comes out fairly quickly. My advice is to order it to go. There isn't much seating and it is a tad chaotic inside. I also feel like the to-go service is a tad quicker. As for the line, as long as it isn't down the block you should be ok (from my experience, it's about a 30 - 40 min wait if the line is just out the door.) Cost: Tortas are $9 - $10; the soups are (i think) $12; both are the perfect portion size (soups on the rather large size)
