Read all the positives reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a try. It was a huge disappointment. We ordered the sausage pizza and it was terrible. Cheese tasted cheap and the meat wasn't any better. We would have been better off ordering a pizza from Little Caesars. Big disappointment, came all the way from Bridgeport for bad food.
