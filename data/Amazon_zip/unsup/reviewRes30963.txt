Nana's...yum! I love the food and the space is super cute! Local art is hanging from the walls available for purchase which also adds a nice touch! I would recommend the baked chilaquiles and the stuffed french toast! Also, at my last visit 2 days ago I had the pleasure of trying their "dessert of the day." I have no idea exactly what it was called but it was excellent. It was a white cake with some sort of citrus (maybe blood oranges) that had an extremely rich frosting and these slightly burnt perfectly placed marshmallow fluffs on top of the cake in the shape of hershey kisses! Needless to say it was amazing and was not TOO sweet either! I hope to try dinner very soon! And, yes, the prices are slightly higher than your average breakfast/brunch place but it is definitely worth the extra bucks because everything is CONSISTENTLY super fresh and, obviously, organic!
