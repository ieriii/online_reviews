Hands down, one of the best Italian meals I've had in Chicago. I had the Risotto Pescatore with a little spice added and it was a complete hit! First of all I appreciate that this place gives people the option for a little spice (for some dishes). But this dish was 1) healthy serving size, 2) layered with seafood, and 3) was cooked to perfection. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this meal. It is truly authentic Italian dishes. We also had the mussels in white wine for an appetizer which were on point and split a Stella salad which was also good. If you can get a Groupon for this place - DO IT! They didn't mention any menu restrictions other than the desserts, which I didn't even care about after eating everything else. And the service was superb. Never had an empty glass, the waiter was attentive, provided suggestions, and seemed like he enjoyed his job. Definitely give this place a try.
