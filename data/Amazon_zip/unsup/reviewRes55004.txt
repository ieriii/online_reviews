Went here for my birthday this week...in a word: terrific. A demure and unassuming storefront from the street belies a very intimate little restaurant with simple yet elegant decor. Our waiter (who may have been the chef) was incredibly friendly and attentive all night. We had the grand (7 course) tasting menu and I loved every one. Highlights included braised rabbit paired with very tender gnocchi and vension with a black currant salsa. I wish they offered a wine list but I didnt mind bringing a special bottle of beaujolais I had been saving. All in all an excellent dining experience, and I plan on visiting again soon.
