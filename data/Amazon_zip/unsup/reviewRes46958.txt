Yummy yums! My roommate and here had coupons to this place (courtesy of a past Yelp event!) and tried it out. We both loved it. The ambiance is really great -- dark but not too dark, tables placed sort of close but it still feels private, not too loud. They have musicians play at night, but there's a cover to sit in that section (understandably so, since the show is otherwise free). What's extra nice about this is you have the opportunity to listen to a great musician while you eat or, if you're not in the mood for live music, you sit in the other section of the restaurant and enjoy you conversation with your fellow diners. They close off the music area, so those who don't want to listen to the music have their quiet. The menu was great, loads of eclectic and delicious items. We started out with the sweet potato fries with goat cheese fondue -- amazing. My roommate then ordered the meatloaf wrapped in bacon and I got the chicken with swisschard, brie, and a butternut squash compote-of-sorts. It was all so yummy. I will definitely be back!
