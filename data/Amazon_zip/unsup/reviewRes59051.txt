This place is fantastic! I have been there several times now and the food is great! I did take away a star for the fact that last time I was there we sat at the counter and the way the manager/owner deals with people, staff and patrons, is a bit rude and condescending. Come on man, when you have an open kitchen and suck at dealing with people, take your staffing issues in the back so you don't look like a complete shmuck!
