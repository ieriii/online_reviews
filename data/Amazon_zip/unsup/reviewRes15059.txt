This is one of those places that have not been remodeled since it opened, but it works. As for the food it is definitely above average, but the sheer quantity of food you get is unmatched in the city. Pizza bread, italian bread, soup, salad, and then finally your meal. You never leave this place hungry or without a to go container. I highly recommend the spinach soup followed by the homemade gnocchi followed by the cannoli followed by food coma. The service is great and the place seems to be always packed so plan ahead and make a reservation.
