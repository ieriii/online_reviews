I remember this place being better. My wife and I went there on a Friday evening and the wait was "20 minutes". Being a beer lover, I thought this was just enough time to sample a couple of outstanding beers at the bar. The bartender was attentive and even let me try a few shots of various beers to help me make my decision; very accommodating. It took only about 15 minutes and we were seated. We were starved so we ordered right away: Cheese Quesadilla and the Fish & Chips. My quesadilla was great but my wife's fish & chips could not have been worse! SOGGY fish and GREASY potato chips - not at all what either of us was looking for.  The waitress was as quick as she could have been; the dining room was packed. When she brought us the check I let her know about the subpar entree and of course there was nothing she could do.  Total tab: $35.00 including the beer at the bar. The price seems fair, but I can get a flour tortilla with some cheese, fish sticks and potato chips for far less! Probably won't be back!
