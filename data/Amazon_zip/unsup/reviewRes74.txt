FH and I ate here last Saturday for our 7th anniversary. Note that I made reservations on January 3rd or some shit. All I can say is that it was fan-freaking-tastic and I can't wait to come back. The menu was inspired and in no way gimmicky, which was what I thought I might think. It's hard for me to pick a favorite thing that we ate. The venison goulash was cray cray. There was a whole roasted fish served with caponata and shit, which was old school and scrumptious. Basically everything was crazeballs in the best way ever and the wine pairings were TOTES worth it. That all being said, the dinner with pairings, tax, and tip, cost more than our flat screen TV. Just saying.
