Meat roasting next to a fire pit, securely behind glass door....a warm sight on a cold night in January! A lot smaller than Texas de Brazil for sure, but I am certainly not complaining! The waiter was very attentive for our birthday boy's family night out, that;s for sure! He helped the boys chose the perfect wine and cheerfully pointed us to the salad bar to start.  I of course went salad bar only...along with cheesy-bread balls and mashed potatoes. The rest of the family were immediately bombarded with all of the met they could want. Unlike Texas de Brazil, when someone was looking for something ad the waiters noticed, they would send the guy over right away. If they didn't not have the one you wanted cooked the way you wanted, they ran back and found the right one! Desert was delicious! Enough to share amongst the 7 of us, even with our own! A wonderful night at a meat emporium for sure!  Oh and I must say, I enjoyed NOT being nearly sliced with the meat like I have elsewhere; here their is lost of space between you and those oh so sharp knives! ....yea I know this is a bit late, but I totally forgot to post it from when I started it on my phone :P
