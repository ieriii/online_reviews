I LOVE Rick Bayless (even before Top Chef Masters). There is no question that Rick Bayless is one of the most creative and talented chefs out there and I am so glad he doesn't forget about us out here in Chicago. I heard great things about Frontera Grill and Topolobampo before I had the honor to eat there. When I finally got the chance to taste some of Rick Bayless's creations I was ecstatic. I stepped into Frontera Grill expecting great things, and I wasn't disappointed. We ordered 5 or 6 things off the menu, ceviche, tacos and an array of other items. All of which were fantastic. I munched on my food slowly so I could savor every last bite; I wanted to lick the plate! If I was in the restaurant alone I may have done just that. I have to tell you about my drink. I make it a point to try something new when I go out so I decided to try the ginger margarita. When the drink arrived, our sever said, "this is my favorite drink, you are going to love it" In my experience that is either a good sign or a bad sign. I am happy to say, in this case, it was a great sign. The ginger margarita was perfectly mixed. It was everything a margarita should be, chilled, smooth, sweet, tangy and at the end a wonderful hint of ginger. Superb. I enjoyed everything about Frontera Grill, the food our server the amazing cocktail. I will be back, many many times. With all of this said, I would recommend reservations. Since Rick Bayless was on top chef masters his food is in more demand than ever before (damn you Bravo!). The food is definately worth the wait and worth every penny.
