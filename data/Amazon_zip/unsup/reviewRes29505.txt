TIGER CRIES. Yummy - I dont know how the name relates to the dish (juicy little pieces of steak served as an appetizer) but it was unbelievably delicious. I also got the Spring Rolls which were one of the best that Ive had at any Thai restaurant - the peanut sauce was thick and flavorful and went very well with the rolls. However, my main entree was kind of a let down after the amazing appetizers. I got a seafood with egg noodle dish which was pretty mediocre - I've had better elsewhere. But my other dinner guests all enjoyed their meals, especially the red panang curry with duck meat. The thai iced tea was also pretty good. Fairly cheap prices at a pretty decent location. Service could be a little more attentive but then again we did go on a busy Saturday night.
