The food is so good, the cocktails are excellent, and the staff fantastic.  But it's crowded. Crowded with hipsters who don't live in the neighborhood (or, even worse, have just moved to the neighborhood and are definitely making it a less great place to be). Crowded with hipsters who have been drinking heavily and thus show great asshattery frequently. Solution? LUNCH. Lunch at the L&E is fantastic, the food is just as good, the clientele is much more neighborhood-centric, and who doesn't occasionally want the 2 (or 4) whiskey lunch?
