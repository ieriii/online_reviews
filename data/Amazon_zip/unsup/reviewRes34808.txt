Soooooo close to that fifth star! If only the service was not this bad. We didn't know if happy hour still existed on Tuesdays because we couldn't find it anywhere and they were still not answering their phones at 5pm, so we just risked it and went. Lucky for us, as of December 1, they stopped doing happy hour on Sunday and just do it on Monday on Tuesday. Went in at 6pm and got seated right away (2 people) but there was definitely open seating all around. We brought our own bottle (this is BYOB) and they gave us the glasses and opener and we self-served. When we got the menu we ordered Miso soup and it came right away. When she brought it we order our rolls and an order of edemame. I got the chicken and the buddah rolls (both absolutely delicious) and she had the omega, spicy tuna and Alaska rolls (she loved them and brought a bunch home), but the edemame never came. Everything tasted amazing and I cannot wait to go back, but again the service was terrible for no reason because it was not even busy. All of this was $35, by the way. As a side note, the feel of the room was really weird. Everyone was in close quarters because the whole restaurant is about 300 square feet, it was dark, there was weird music and anime playing off a projector to a wall screen measuring about 12'x8'.
