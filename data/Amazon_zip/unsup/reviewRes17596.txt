I ate here just a few days before having my wisdom teeth removed, which for me meant I had an infection and wanted something soft and tasty to eat. Their food (depending on what you get, of course) is both of these things. The wait staff is excellent and prompt. Under the circumstances, I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
