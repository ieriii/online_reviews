I have been wanting to try a Brazilian steakhouse for a while to see what all the talk was about. Brazazz was very good, but not great. It is a beautiful place and they set out a really nice salad bar, which has everything, shrimp, some sushi, and different greens. The fechuada (not sure on the spelling), which are black beans to accompany the white rice was super bland. It was like black beans cooked in water. I ate them anyway because I love black beans. Then you move to the steak as this is where I expected to be impressed. It was nice to have the items brought to your table in cut fresh right on to your plate. However, the meat was not melt in your mouth good. Some like the like the filet mignon brought to me was over cooked and dry. However the whole experience was fun. I know there are many similar style Brazilian steak houses popping up, such as Fogo de Chao, so I'll give it another try. The desserts were great. Staff was nice.
