The service is amazing. People are super duper friendly mofos. I just got home after having the "Frenchie". burger with the regular fries. Fries and burger were tight. Also, since it's right around the corner de chez moi, i will surely return. Great neighborhood bar and did I mention that their beer list kicks ass?
