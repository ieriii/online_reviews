After hearing about how great this place is for years, my boyfriend and I finally got around to going. We went on a Friday evening, so I guess the hour wait we had is probably pretty normal. We had a couple of beers while we waited and all was well.  The food here is sooo good. I was instantly intrigued by the creativity of the menu and ordered the CB&J (on sourdough; house-made cashew butter, fig jam and morbier cheese, pan fried; w/ Stilton mac-&-cheese). The combo of the cashew butter, fig jam, and cheese definitely sounded interesting, and it turned out to be amazing! Also, there was A LOT of food with this dish, so I did not leave hungry.  I'd probably come here all the time if I didn't feel so daunted by the thought of having to wait each time. Nevertheless, I highly recommend the place for its food, drink, and atmosphere.
