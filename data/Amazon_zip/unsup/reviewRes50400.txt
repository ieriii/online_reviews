Came here for brunch at 11am on a sunday with a party of 6 that turned into a party of 8. Mark (one of the owners) was unflappable and handled seating our party with panache and grace. The food was truly divine (corn cakes! gumbo ya ya!) and the bloody mary was just great. I just love Andersonville and I am so glad that my friends chose Big Jones!
