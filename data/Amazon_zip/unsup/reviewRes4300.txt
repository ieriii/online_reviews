This place used to be 5 Stars, hands down. But it has since fallen into the hands of usurpers. I remember going here, back when getting to and from here was a dance with death... when the crowd was a group of people who really cared about Jazz and not just a throng of pseudo-intellectuals and hipsters/yupsters who are just there to seem "well-cultured" and hook-up with people. I am sure there are still some of the old die-hards still bumping around here night-to-night... but I am sure that, like me, their patience is wearing thin. The prices have gone up a lot too, in the past few years. I remember when I used to come in here on a Friday night, show up at 10:00 and immediately get a seat and listen to some Jazz with a group of people who were there to do just that... listen to the music. Anymore, it is nigh impossible to hear the music because of the cacophonous din of loud drunken ne'er-do-wells. At least they still serve Maker's Mark... and the staff keeps the crowds quiet during the higher-end paid shows...
