My party and I got here an hour before they started serving, the helpful and friendly staffs open up the bar early so we could hang out there while waiting. I got a little overwhelming because by the end of the meal, I actually feel gross from eating so much meat in one seating. The meat is hit and miss, some are really good, while some are a little dry and salty. I think the price is a bit steep for my liking
