This is pizza! I love Lou's, I love Gino's, I love Giordano's and I LOVE The Art of Pizza! This is not the place to go expecting a fancy sit-down dinner. It's simply beautiful that this is a grab and go kind of joint that does not forget to add quality and a lot of love to their pizzas. They have classic Chicago deep dish and they also serve Chicago-style thin crust (yes, that is a distinct style). It's hearty, it's unbelievably bursting with flavor, it's cheap, it's classic and it screams Chicago. No. Questions. Asked.
