I can't quite get myself to the four stars. I really do enjoy the food here. I really, really do. The winter menu had some stellar buccatini, and I always enjoy their wines. They have solid cocktails as well. Whenever I get the check I feel as if I've gotten my money's worth. But the service, oh the service. I'm a server in fine dining so my standards are pretty high, but it's gotten to the point where I've considered asking if they'd like to hire me on as a consultant. I don't want to wait 25 minutes for my check as I watch you leisurely bus tables with only a few other guests in the restaurant. You're not in the weeds, so don't act like it. I don't feel my waiters are ever THAT knowledgeable about the menu (I mean, they know what's on it, but not what's in it). I've had some servers who are downright aloof, and only once have I ever REALLY felt welcomed by my server; it was the woman, and I don't think she works there anymore. It's down the street from me and it beats Bella Donna by far, but Ante Prima is one of those places where I tip 20% (not 25-30%) because it didn't outright suck, though that's not to say I haven't been tempted.
