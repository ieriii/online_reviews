Not impressed at all. The music is obnoxious and all over the place - and not in a good way. As soon as you slip into a sexy vibe, they blare jarring country tunes at you. The decor is interesting, but the acoustics make it hard to have a conversation, the back, wall seating areas are drafty, and the staff seems stressed out and snappy. The only redeeming quality is the unusual cocktails - which is good since you may need a stiff one to get over everything else.
