Good attention to detail and friendly customer service Alejandro was my waiter. I hate cilantro (http://www.ihatecilantro). He hooked me up with extra avocado because the guac has lots of the nasty herb.  Tuesday and Thursday they serve up half price house margaritas (something like 8+ flavors frozen or on ROCKS). Wednesday is mojito day. Food is top notch for the price.
