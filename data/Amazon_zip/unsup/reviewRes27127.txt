2 stars for the mediocre food. I had the CARNE A LA TAMPIQUEA, not great/not terrible, just mediocre. I've have better Mexican food at the 5am burrito joint. Guacamole and salsa were nothing special. Calling the service inattentive is being kind.   So, why 3 stars for lackluster dining experience you ask? The neighborhood. I seldom get south of the Eisenhower, but Pilsen is so great. Driving through made me miss NY. Pilsen reminds me of the Bronx, or Brooklyn, maybe Jackson Heights. While I won't be back to dine at Nuevo Leon, I will certainly check out Pilsen again.
