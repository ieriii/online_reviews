Excellent food, drinks, atmosphere and service! I didn't really know what to expect since this was my first Cuban restaurant, but it was wonderful! I tried the Ropa Vieja, which was deliciously fork-tender and the fried yucca...mmmmm... I've had yucca before, but never quite so good! I think I'd go back to Cafe 28 just fo the yucca! Great margaritas, too, and the flan was yummy!
