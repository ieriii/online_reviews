Every time I go here, I think this is a solid place for food and a pint. As already mentioned their beer selection is outstanding to meet the preference of any beer drinker ranging from the hoppy Anti Hero to the smooth Cross of Gold. What I really like about Revolution is the breadth of their menu. They have a number of great vegetarian items, which works perfectly for my wife, and then I can enjoy a burger, fish & chips, or mussels. It's not always easy to find a place that works so well for the both of us. The only thing that I haven't been very impressed with food-wise is their pizza, but I'm picky with pizza and they aren't a pizza joint. So enjoy their other great food! The upstairs addition enables so many more people to enjoy their food, but I must admit my last two times I have been seated up there it was right next to the empty stage. It just doesn't have the same lively feeling as downstairs or close to the upstairs bar. Great place. Go eat an enjoy a pint... or a few...
