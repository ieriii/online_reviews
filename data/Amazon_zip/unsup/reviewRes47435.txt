finally a good burger in u.k. village. 50/50 is decent too. ordered a burger to-go and some mac&cheese. burger was tasty and cooked properly and hot. the pretzel bun was soft and toasted. mac and cheese had a little kick but what i liked most was the noodles weren't overcooked. for those of you reviewing comparing Lockdown to kumas. its not apples to apples. get a clue d-bags!
