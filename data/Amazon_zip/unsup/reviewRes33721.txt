This place is great. I guess if you're one of these whineyfaces and don't like to wait, it could be a bother; however, the longest I've waited on a super packed day was about 25 minutes. It's quite large inside, so the tables turn over quickly. The food is excellent. The frittata and scramblers are yummy; the eggs benedict options are wonderful. The menu is expansive enough that I still have tried everything i want to. The brunch universe only has so much room to expand, but I feel like Yolk has pushed the edges out a little bit. It's worth venturing into the South Loop.
