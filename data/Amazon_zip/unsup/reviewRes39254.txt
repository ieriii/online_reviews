I haven't been here for a while, which is kind of the thing - nothing ever draws me to go back.  The whole cooking it yourself thing grows old after a while, especially if you have a bunch of people hungrily eyeing each small piece of meat while it cooks and then scrambling (fighting) over each piece once it's done. And no joke - you will smell like smokey shit when you leave. It was okay, just not my thing maybe, but if my man gets into one of his carnivorous moods in the middle of the night, maybe I'll find myself back here again.  I wish the people were just...cooler maybe. Why does it have to be such a pain in the ass to ask what I'm actually eating? I've been to Korean BBQ places where there service is not so bad, so that should not have to be part of the "experience." And yes. The parking lot really is THAT crazy.
