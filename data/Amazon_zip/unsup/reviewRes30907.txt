I suppose I'll go ahead and add myself to the list of people who adore Chicago Diner. I actually first visited this place about a year ago and was mostly unimpressed. I believe I ordered the "chicken" and "steak" fajitas. The "chicken" was indistinguishable from the "steak" and overall the tastes and textures were not that appealing. I went back last week though and was blown away by how delicious my food was. The boyfriend and I ordered the wilted spinach salad and the Reuben (on the suggestion of the waiter) and shared both dishes. Both of them were excellent and I am already looking forward to going back here and getting another Reuben sandwich. The lemonade was some of the best I can recall. And though I do not drink tequila, I have it on good authority that their margaritas are fabulous as well.
