I came here for a conference with a friend I hadn't seen in ten years. The server got really cool points for being patient with us while we took forever to decide what to order. We had a lot of catching up to do. We had a cheese flight that was excellent. We each had wine flights that were good. I didn't fall in love with any of them, but they were good. My steak was probably one of the best cooked steaks I've ever had. And, the strawberries for dessert were a perfect ending.
