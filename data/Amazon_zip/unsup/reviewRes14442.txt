No complaints here. I went in hearing nothing other than "wahhh this place is overcrowded." Yeah. No, not really. We went right in (weeknight probably helped) and were immediately seated. Our waiter was a pretty damn nice guy. The beer was good, the burger with pulled pork on it was.. you know, exactly what it sounds like as far as the level of deliciousness and holy-shit-that-is-bad-for-you-dudeness. Especially in concert with.. what were those? Cream cheese garlic mashed potatoes? Heh, sorry about that, body. Everything was pretty damn good. Definitely warrants a second trip, at the very least. The pizza looked tasty and will probably be given a go by me next time. Again.. sorry, body.
