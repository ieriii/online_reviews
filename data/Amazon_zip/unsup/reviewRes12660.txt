***THIS IS A TASTE OF CHICAGO REVIEW*** (I have not eaten at the restaurant) I'm a born and bred Chicagoan so I have sampled many Brazilian Steakhouses here and elsewhere. It makes no sense to me why a restaurant would serve a sub-par meal as the one I received at "The Taste" on opening day Friday! "The Taste" is a way to introduce yourself to a group of people that either have never heard of you or can't get to your establishment. It's a great way to drive-in future business. Knowing this why would TDB present their "Platter" (3 meats) so poorly. The Beef Picanha was a 'charcoal' (both in size, taste and color). Inedible. Chicken Breast wrapped w/ Bacon was a marshmallow sized chicken wrapped in bacon (not to bad after I microwaved it at work..sigh) The Brazilian Sausage was about the size of an adult thumb. It was overly charred and dry inside. To top off this 'grand' platter a very dry lifeless dinner roll (please see picture above^^ click on "1 photo"..I'm really not exaggerating) ~The cost...12 tickets= $8 Yeah, a whole book. I understand that the conditions are not the same..a Grant Park booth, compared to a gourmet kitchen. But, if you know the history of the churrascarias, the gauchos ate the food prepared OUTSIDE on an open pit!! Guys, you should not be getting this so wrong. PS: Directly across from them I got a 7 ticket Vietnamese sandwich that was about 8 inches of soft bread, cilantro, carrots, and tender meat. It saved my lunch break.
