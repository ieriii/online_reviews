I eats a lot so I get my money's worth whenever I go! To the average eater, expect to spend a lot of dough on very tasty MEAT...my favorites are the rack of lamb and the bottom sirloin steak, medium rare. Also has a huge variety at the premium salad bar which is included. Tip #1: Try to go at lunchtime if you can...almost half the price of dinner. Tip#2: Don't go here if you are allergic to salt!
