How cool is it that every room is a suite? I love it.  Pros: 1. absolutely beautiful hotel 2. in downtown, right on the strip so everything was easily accessible 3. there is a walgreens right across the street - perfect for buying some water and snacks 4. the concierge. gotta give it up for my man marcus. so incredibly friendly, so incredibly knowledgeable 5. the staff overall was incredibly friendly, and not in a pretentious fake way 6. the restaurant 676 serves pretty decent food 7. there is a starbucks cart right in the lobby! (but it's not free, boo) cons: 1. kind of a weird floor plan. you walk in, you take the elevator up to the 3rd floor (where the main lobby is), and then from there you can take an elevator up to your rooms. why not just have an elevator on the street that accesses rooms using room keys? 2. this really isn't a con, but i found this to be perplexing. the bathroom is huge. and there is only one tiny trash can, and it's against the far wall by the toilet. i would move the trash can so it would be more central, and every day, house keeping would move it back by the toilet. 3. the mini fridge is kind of small. thankfully i'm the master of rearranging fridges to make things, like my cupcakes from more and my leftover gino's east pizza, fit in there. I had a great time at the Omni. It wasn't the fanciest hotel I've ever stayed in (one had a pillow "menu" so you can ask for pillows you like), but it was very pleasant. Kudos to the staff, you made the stay very enjoyable.
