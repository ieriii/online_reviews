Sometimes okay, the rest of the time not really worth it. Expensive for what you ultimately get. They definitely pile the stuff high on your plate (way more than even I would eat comfortably). I have been here a number of times, mainly because of the proximity to Columbia and to add a little variety. There isn't much in the area.  They claim the Eggs Benedict are the best in the city, but I have definitely had better elsewhere. The omelets are pretty big, but more of just a mash of ingredients... tasted more like a stirfry of eggs and the filling than an actual omelet. Disappointment. The skillets might be the best thing I've had there, lots to eat but because it is *meant* to be mixed together, it works. I kind of think they just have big barrels of the extra ingredients that they add to your eggs. Not very inventive and quality is sub-par.  Traditional breakfast might be a good way to go... but I dunno. I'll eat here once in a while, but wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
