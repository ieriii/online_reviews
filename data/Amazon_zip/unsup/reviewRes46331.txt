Cheesecake Factory much? This place has the look and the style of Cheesecake Factory (CF). The food is also very reminiscent of CF, too, which is good because I like CF. My first experiences of Grand Lux was the Vegas one but I'm going to talk about the Chicago one. The food comes in very "grand" proportions (like my play on words? jk). We ordered the buffalo crisps as an appetizer and I had the tomato, garlic chicken pasta. Not a good idea for lunch nor was it a good idea when I wasn't even that hungry to begin with. I hardly put a dent in it, which is abnormal because I can usually finish everything regardless of how big. Don't get me wrong though. It was really tasty! I would just really think twice about ordering anything here without the intention of sharing amongst others. My girlfriends did the same thing...ordered their own thing and hardly ate any of it. We spent about $20 a person. If I was eating this at home somewhere, it would have been nice because I would have had plenty of left overs, which would have meant my $20 would have stretched far. However, I ended up wasting a lot of food, which is very unfortunate. Moral of the story? Don't order your own meal. At least have one other person to share with!
