I'm visiting from California, so I had to see what real deep dish pizza is all about. Pequod's has kind of a dive bar feel, which I like. Brick walls and music blaring, ranging from old school punk to Johnny Cash. The pizza was amazing. It's all about the caramelized cheese. It gives it an added tasty kick. They were also very generous with the toppings. I definitely had no regrets, just a happy belly.
