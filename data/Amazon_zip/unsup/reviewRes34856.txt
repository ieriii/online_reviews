Price is right...and all of the food has so much distinct yet comforting flavor. I love the foreign groceries and baked items as well as the salad bar. Falafel is good, so is the tabouli and the rice. Last time I had the fish and it was soooo delicious that I often fantasize about it. Great comfort food after a long day of work, on a cold winter day, or for a unique lunch with friends. Also great for carry out!
