After reading all of the mostly positive review on Yelp about this place, I really really wanted to like it, but alas, it was average at best. I went on a Wednesday night and was surprised at how busy it was.  First the good. 1) The decor was not to bad and the ambiance was inviting. 2) Our server was very attentive and answered all of our questions and was overall generally pleasant. 3) The Sweet Potato Maki was really good. Now the bad. 1) The Nigiri that I had (Scallops and Sea Bass) were blah at best, nothing remarkable about them at all. The Maki Roll that I had (I believe it was the Sunny) was mediocre, not a lot of flavor. 2) Despite how everyone raves about Crab Rangoon from this place, it was average at best (I am on a mission to find the perfect Crab Rangoon in this city). The inside of it was somewhat soupy and they were a little cold. They were cute though. Mei Shung and Yes Thai have way better Rangoon. 3) Before we left, I order the yellow steak curry to go because I wanted to try it for dinner the next night (curry always tastes better the second day to me anyway) but instead of Steak, I wanted Tofu.  The next day for dinner I open up the bag and what is in it...the Yellow Steak Curry with Steak. Very annoying the tag stapled to the outside of the bag said Tofu. Needless to say, I was quite annoyed and that automatically bumped it down one star. I really wanted to like this place, but it was unremarkable at best.
