I'm only giving it a 3 because of the service. Our waitress was slow and a little bit rude. When one of my party ordered a Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato sandwhich, she didn't comprehend. He had to explain that meant a B.L.T. other than that, the food was pretty good. I had the bangers and mash and it was a perfect cure for the hangover i was experiencing. Generous portion sizes, prices were what you would expect. We didn't have to wait for a table even though the brunch rush was in full swing. The atmosphere is very casual and laid back, perfect for a Sunday outing. We didn't feel rushed- I almost felt forgotten but I think thats again part of the less than stellar service. I definitely think we'll be going back, we'll just have to remember to speak slowly for the waitress.
