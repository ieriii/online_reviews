I had to try deep dish pizza when visiting Chicago, but none of my experiences with deep dish pizza have been good. Giordano's changed my mind about deep dish pizza. The tomatoes, sausage, onions, and mushrooms on the Special pizza were fresh and plentiful, but the thick stringy cheese and the soft semi-sweet dough blew me and my friends away. Great place to try if you're visiting but the wait can be quite long.
