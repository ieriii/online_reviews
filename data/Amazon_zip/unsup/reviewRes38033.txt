If you want an absolutely staggering selection of great beers, this place is for you. Everything from epic IPAs to mead (although not so much anymore) can be had at Hopleaf. I'm pretty sure that if you ordered a Miller Lite here, you'd promptly be thrown out and spit upon. Additionally, the food at Hopleaf is (expensive) but out of this world. The mussels are fantastic, and the French Fries are guaranteed to be an instant classic. My only complaints about this place is that it's extremely difficult to get seating in the bar area, and they've stopped serving mead for the most part. For shame. If you're a serious beer drinker, though, you should definitely check out Hopleaf.
