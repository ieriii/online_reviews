I can now see why other reviewers had a hard time getting into the detail of each course; when there are 21 courses, it's not only hard to remember them all but they are each so unique, creative and an absolute culinary masterpiece, it's best to just experience them for yourself and not spoil the surprise.  Service was impeccable, each course served perfectly, with a nice explanation of each ingrediant and flavor and on most courses, special instructions on how to eat it.  We opted to order a bottle of wine vs. the wine pairing; prob saved us $100 and we were so focused w/ the food, I think having to focus on wine pairings would have been too much (imo).  A unique dining experience unlike any we've ever had; def something you should treat yourself to at least once if you're in Chicago. It was our anniversary and Alinea was the perfect venue for our special dinner. Only minor complaint (and it's small enough not to deduct a star for) is that the servers could have been a little bit more relaxed and engaging. Not a big deal as they nailed the explanation of each course and anticipated our every request but a little more interaction and conversation (possibly a little humor) would have been nice. But then again, that's not really why you come to a place like Alinea.
