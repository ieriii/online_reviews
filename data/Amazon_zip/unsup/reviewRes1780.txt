So, We went there last week on a Saturday and sure enough there was a line out the door for-everrr away. We ended up waiting a little over an hour. ugh! But we saw the place on Anthony Bourdain's and hadn't tried it before... So we waited it out since we had nothing better to do. Ended up trying the duck fat fries, which my fiance liked, but I thought they tasted like regular fries-- nothing special. We tried 5 encased meats total-- the typical hot dog and a couple of the specialties. I had the Irish Bangor which was awesome--had Guiness Mustard on it and yummy cheese. I think my man had that Wild Boar... Overall, definitely tasty. Worth the money. The owner was super cool and didn't rush people. But, the wait, well it sucked. It was like waiting for a ride at Great America. But, if you can get there on a day that isn't terribly busy, I think it's worth it.
