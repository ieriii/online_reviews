I am spoiled. Truly. Was in Chicago for a conference, and a large group of us (12?) went to Sundha ~ 9:30pm for a Wednesday dinner. It was fabulous. Everything: cocktails, sushi (sashimi and rolls), entrees, service, atmosphere. *Cocktails - fresh and interesting, well made (aka: not 90% syrup) * Sushi - sashimi was fresh and silky; rolls were innovative (lobster and kobe?!) and tasty * Entrees - the black cod and eggplant was perfect....mmmmm... * Service - we had to squeeze in a table set for 9 at most, and our servers were always spot on, frequented the table without being obtrusive, and made a sincere effort to make our experience a great one. * Atmosphere - yes, it was a tad loud, but that was the point! Everyone dining that evening in the restaurant looked like they were having a grand time, so of course it was lively! Bill was a bit steep, but we really did go all out, and I do think we got our value (just don't plan on leaving with less than $50 pp) Enjoy! I can't wait to go back!
