Brought us back to Italy! The pizza = molto bene! The dough is perfectly cooked and the red sauce and cheese taste extremely fresh. The staff is very attentive and friendly and the ambiance is lovely and very clean! Definitely a place we would go back to! We had the Bufalina and the Salsiccia as well as the Porchetta as our appetizer. All tasted very fresh and perfectly cooked and seasoned!
