I've been going to "P. Bowl" religiously since I started college at DePaul in 1998, and God-willing I will be going there the rest of my life! I have literally chosen where I want to live because of its proximity to this restaurant, and have never moved more than 1 mile away so that I may walk there whenever I please! Sound a bit dramatic? Maybe. Is it worth it? TOTALLY! Here are my reasons: 1. Garlic cheese bread with marinara: To die for. Best cheese EVER. 2. The price: totally reasonable for good sized portions. 3. The tiramisu: ooooh, so good it should be outlawed. 4. Any of the pastas: I've had almost all of them, and love them all. My favorites are: Linguine Pesto, Gnocchi with half marinara and half alfredo sauce, Cheese Tortellini in marinara...the list goes on and on. 5. The staff: a lot of them know us on sight, but even those we don't know are super friendly and very efficient. 6. The Coastal Ridge Pinot Noir: SO good and SO cheap! 7. The location: Granted, I am partial to Lincoln Park in general, but what better place than on Clark Street where there's so many places to hit up after dinner? Just go there. Seriously.
