I am a big fan of Greek cuisine and I am really happy with the choice I made to go to Greek Islands. There were so many amazing sounding dishes to choose from that it was a bit overwhelming at times but I was able to sample a couple good items off the menu and would love to go back and try more. The flaming saganaki is always one of my favorite appetizers and this one didn't disappoint. The vegetarian mousaka was delicious as well and I can't wait to go back with friends and try more dishes. Service was also fast and very friendly.
