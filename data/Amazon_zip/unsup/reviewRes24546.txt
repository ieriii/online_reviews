Updating a previous review (and I don't do this often). Gotta say, second time back to this joint now and it's still wonderful! Our server Amanda was a pleasure, and the food is always good. Got the oatmeal & banana milk shake and the shrimp & veggies this time around, and boy, it was a tasty meal with a wonderful outdoor atmosphere. Definitely will be back again!
