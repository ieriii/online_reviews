i've been here a couple of times, i love the tortas (the grilled ones), and the hot chocolate in the winter time. they also have complimentary sparkling water which i always love. conchinita pibil very good...can't remember the names of the others, but i really really liked this one that you dip in a soup...man that was a nice winter day!!! thick spicy mayan style hot chocolate and toasty torta dipped in red broth! they have interesting drinks and they also serve breakfast.  the biggest complaint i have about this place is that they have mad wierd hours, i've tried going there for lunch and there is a line out the door, the menu is confusing because they only serve certain things during certain times of day...like i've always wanted to try the soups but they never seem to be serving them when i'm there. also their system for ordering and getting a number for a seat is separate and very confusing. simplify it please! if you want to sample rick bayless' food without the long lines and confusing management, try the macy's food court - they have items from both the frontera grill and xoco menus available for the same price and the system for ordering is not complicated.
