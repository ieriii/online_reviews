Solid fast food with a super cute retro feel. Their fish sandwich and root beer float are absolutely delicious and I always have a good time here. Hell, I don't think it's possible to NOT have fun at a drive-in! I can understand why people think the Superdawg's a little on the expensive side, but I personally think it's worth it. It's one of the better hot dogs I've had in the city and it's very filling. However, the fish sandwich is what keeps me coming back! So yummy. Definitely one of my favorite places to hit up when the weather's nice.
