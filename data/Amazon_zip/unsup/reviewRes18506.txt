Caro Mio was my favorite restaurant. I love the atmosphere, the food, the byob... Carlos is the greatest. BUT I had a terrible experience there a few months back and it ruined the place for me. It was a Friday night - always busy - and we were told it was going to be a 30 minute wait. Totally bearable. After 1.5 hours, we were fed up waiting and asking when we were up... always to be told the next table. Even more frustrating when you see a 2 top open. The other main server (not Carlos) proceeded to b a complete jerk to us for asking when we were going to get to be seated (we had a show to get to). So, we left. I was totally embarrassed because my friend had never been there - and it left a very bad impression. I hope to go back because I love the food, but its going to take quit awhile for these wounds to heal.
