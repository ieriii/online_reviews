Hello Cheesecake Factory's twin! I had high hopes for this place as some friends had come to this place heard a lot of good things from them. The menu has a great variety ranging from salads, sandwiches, steak, and pasta to everything in between.  Oddly when I asked about Happy Hour specials that were posted on Yelp our server said there was none. Hmm..ok? *akward* I ended up getting the cream of chicken soup and shared a tapa sized plate of calamari with my friend. For my entree I got the Spicy Chicken Flat bread sandwich which wasn't spicy at all but definitely very flavorful. Foodwise I'm wavering between 3 or 4 stars but I am going to go ahead and give 4 because the service was good & more than made up for it. Oh and one more thing, I didn't notice till I was walking out but I saw that the entree salads were very popular as every table around us seemed to have ordered them. Apparently I didn't get the memo! Next time I think I will have to give one of the salads a try!
