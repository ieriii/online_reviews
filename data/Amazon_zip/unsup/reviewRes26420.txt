this was not a great experience at ALL. the service was horrible, overall, and we got a 5 minute speech on what tapas were when we sat down. annoying. the restaurant was really busy, especially considering that it was a wednesday night, but it almost seemed that there were more waiters than people. the people who sat down next to us waited about 45 minutes (!!) to get someone to take their drink order. yikes.  the tapas were good...not great, but good. my only real complaint about the actual tapas is that, without fail, watercress was sprinkled all over every single dish. seriously-even my dessert (essentially, the orange creme brulee) had watercress covering it. it really gave the impression that there were sprouts planted on top of each piece of food.  despite the bad service and apparently ubiquitouswatercress, this really would have been a 3 or 4 star review. after we paid our check, our waiter brought out these complimentary chocolates. so we popped them in our mouth and they were DISGUSTING. they were salted chocolates, which they had told us, so we were prepared. i also happen to really like salted sweets. however-it really tasted like these chocolates were dipped in sea water or dipped in morton salt and then just thrown on our table. the salt was NOT a complementary flavor and was completely overpowering. after we got over the shock of that disgusting chocolate, we decided to try the little white chewy thing that the chocolate was on top of. it was apparently really sour lemon? i am still not completely positive beause it was just so disgusting. it was insanely saltly, incredibly sour and really ruined the entire meal. truly--it almost made us nauseous. i can inmagine that the only worse flavor than those 2 things alone would have been those 2 things together which is, i believe, how they were meant to be eaten. don't do it people!! those 2 innocuous looking little chocolates will ruin your entire meal.
