This is my default hotel property when I visit Chicago. One block from the Northwestern University Med Center office I do business with, this property works great for me as a business traveler. Around the corner are several good restaurants: my personal fave for an early dinner, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBq (3-6 p.m. food and bev happy hour. Check it out.) For breakfast, West Egg is just down the street (the huevos rancheros...real live chorizo. Yum). Three blocks away is the Purple Pig wine and tapas bar. BUT WAIT... This Courtyard has what no other Courtyard has, in my extensive experience. Their restaurant, Viand, is really...really...good. The first time I tried it (out of necessity...sorry Jerry), I was knocked out. Food was great. Nicely outfitted beer and wine selection. Quiet. Sports playing on the tube. DUDE! Breakfast is great too. The coffee is bold, unlike most "institutional" blends. Last visit, I had the eggs benedict. Hollandaise was a little citrus-y but didn't detract. This is a great value in my experience. Plus, the manager, Jerry, writes follow-up emails. Dig that.
