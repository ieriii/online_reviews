Bridgeport definitely need a good breakfast place, but the food here is overpriced for the taste, cost of the ingredients and location. Nanadict is 13 bucks, with the meat resembling taco meats we get from public school lunch. The sauce is the saving grace of the dish. I would say it's worth not more than 9.99.  Garden omelette.. the veggie is fresh but they are all falling apart from the egg? I thought the proper way to do an omelette is being wrapped by the egg and semi mixed in?  overall service is good although one of the server spills the creamer on our table and it splashed on hubby's shoes.. and myself as a female not really appreciate the 'friendly' gesture of shoulder tapping from a big guy server..
