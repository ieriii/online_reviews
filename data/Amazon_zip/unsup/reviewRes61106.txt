One of my Favorite restaurants! I come here often.I was a little upset with the remodel, it seemed to have lost it's cozy appeal and the White wall divider made it feel cold and unwelcoming. The last time that I went in though, papel picado hang from the ceiling and the environment was much improved. The food here is amazing, I am in love with the burritos, quesadillas, guac and horchata. My only complaint now is that some drinks run a little on the expensive side, but to split a pitcher of Margaritas (so delish) among friends is great!
