The foie gras with duck sausage dog RULED. So did the Elvis Dog (although Portillos still has the best Chicago Dog). The venison and cherry dog with smoked cheese was too sweet for my girlfriend, but I thought it was "interesting" but it needed an acid to cut through the richness. Doug waited on us his own damn self and couldn't have been nicer. It was a sausage fest in the best sense of the word. Encased meats? Don't mind if I do.
