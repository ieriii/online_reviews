OMG. Last night was the first time I went to fogo de chao. I have heard amazing things, but until last night, I did not get to delve into all the goodness. I am familiar with the area, so I knew that there wasn't going to be any parking available. We opted to valet our car, although there was a lot across the street for $9. We met for a friend's birthday and made a reservation for 8 people. When we arrived at 7:30pm for our reservation, our table was ready. It was one large table in an open space and it was perfect. Often, when we reserve seats for a large group, restaurants put several tables together and it is in a crowded spot. The salad was delicious! Lots of great choices, but while the girls were eating their salads, the men began eating the meat, so of course we got jealous and ditched the salad plates. Everything was so delicious, amazing seasoning, great choice of meat cuts. I liked the bottom sirloin the best. I found some of the cuts to be a little fatty, but there at 16 total choices, so I definitely had a lot to choose from. The service was AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING. Bill was pricey, but we knew what we were getting into. As a couple, two dinners, 2 cocktails, 3 beers = 167.00. I believe they have the same selection available for lunch at a cheaper price, that may be the way to go. At the end of the night, our car was even warmed up for us first. Five million stars, will definitely return.
