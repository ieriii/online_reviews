One goal for the Chicago trip was to sample Chicago's claim to fame: deep-dish pizza. Now I've had Giordano's before in Evanston and I've tried both the Nancy's location in Atlanta, but none of those were really satisfying. After seeing good reviews on Yelp and elsewhere, we decided on The Art of Pizza for our deep-dish pizza experience.  We made the trek out here and opted for a salad and a 12" pan pizza with sausage. The salad came out pretty quick and was a pretty basic salad - nothing much to it good or bad. The pizza took a little over 30 minutes to come out and after we made it one slice in, we realized we REALLY should have just gotten slices because it's just a ton of food.  Anyway, the pizza itself was great. There was a good bit of cheese, which gave the pizza some good chewy action. The flavor of the cheese was pretty good, but it could've been a little sharper/tangier. The sauce was solid as well - I liked the oregano in it. I was also pleased that the sausage was quality. Probably the most unique part of the pizza was the crust - it was very buttery and almost biscuit-like. The crust was quite tasty.  Overall, AoP is an excellent choice for Chicago-style deep dish pie. It may not be THE best, but it's definitely great and shouldn't disappoint.  4.5
