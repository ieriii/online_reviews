Whenever i see a clean chinese restaurant with modern decor, my first thought is to be wary, since typically the best ones are hole in the walls that only have asian people eatin in here. Lao Sze Chuan had nice waiter service (seriously? a nice waiter in a chinese restaurant?) and was clean and modern. But most important, their food was really good!!! We first ordered the Mapo tofu. The waiter was accomodating -when I requested mildly spicy, he asked "on a scale of 1 to 10, how spicy." - i thought that was a thoughtful and helpful question, as no one wants food that turns out spicier or blander than expected. Also loved their Chicken Lo Mein - that really suprised me how much i liked this dish, considering it's really more of an americanized dish - but man they make it really well here! Tender steaming meat in a tasty perfectly seasoned sauce and i think the noodles are homemade as it had a great texture. I mean, i really do think it's hard to make a standout Lo Mein dish, of all dishes. But this one was one I'd go back just to have! Also liked how fresh and perfectly seasoned /stirfried was their Garlic Chinese Broccoli. Almost refreshing in a sense that the veggies just tasted fresh and "crisp". Their Beef Noodle Soup is their signature - but for americans, watch out how spicy this can be. It's quite intense and a red colored brot, and not what i was expecting. Very flavorful, a little too salty for me. I think i prefer Taiwanese style Beef Noodle soup over this. Lastly, unlike most chinese resaturants that service dry cheap rice, their rice was pretty decent and the better quality stuff. That totally is rare. In summary, their chinese food was pretty good for the chicagoland area.
