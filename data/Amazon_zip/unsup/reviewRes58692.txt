Went here on the Saturday over Memorial Day weekend and I was very, very impressed. I have been to a few of the tapas places in the city, including Cafe Iberico, Cafe Ba-ba-reeba, and Emilio's. This place beats them all, hands down. First of all, I thought the decor and atmosphere were a cut above. Mercat is a more high-end, scene kind of place than the others. I mean that as a compliment, too. The beautiful people were milling around at the tables and the restaurant bar, where I had a chance to sample a couple of drinks - Spanish Fly and the pineapple mojitos. Not a mixed drink kind of guy by any means, but these were outstanding. Once we sat down, things got even better. We had the serrano ham and fig salad, which was basically a spinach salad with the ham wrapped around the outside instead of mixed in. From there was one great dish after another - the setas al horno (wild mushrooms), the patatas bravas, the bacon-wrapped dates (these were ridiculously good!) And dinner topped off with the costillas de ternera, which was beef shortribs, horseradish, parmesan and bacon on top of flatbread. Amazing. When I didn't think things could get any better, we finished off a dessert of chocolate croquettes. Service was outstanding - efficient yet relaxed. I got what I needed quickly yet never felt hurried to make a decision or to eat and get out. When I got up to leave after a couple of hours, I was satisfied yet not disgustingly full. I was also sure that I had to come here again, as this is one of the best restaurant experiences of any kind I've had here in Chicago.
