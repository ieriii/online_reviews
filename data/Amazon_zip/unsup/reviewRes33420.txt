I am a brunch lush. Options and quality are everything. Yolk has the most extensive brunch menu I've [ever] seen complete with trusty eggs + meat + toast combo all the way to the amazing chorizo + avocado + cheese scrambler. Umm, yum. Best thing - they have healthy options too. Fresh fruit instead of potatoes? No prob. And I'm talking good fruit - pineapple, watermelon, honey dew - not your cheapo banana plus grape combo. They also have English muffins (an MB indicator of a quality brunch spot). The coffee is yummy (flavored creamer option is a guilty pleasure of mine) and the juices are fresh squeezed. Strawberry orange = fantastic. They have interesting pancake options that you can get as one of your side items for an extra buck or so. Perfect for a taste if you're like me and don't like a sugar overload at bfast. I'm leaving one star off because the wait can be long (just have common sense and try not to go at 11am) and it can be loud. Service is always friendly, but sometimes slow. Food is always fast. But really, it's all about the eats.
