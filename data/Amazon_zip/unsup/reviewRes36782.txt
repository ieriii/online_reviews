I just want to add my voice to the wave of positivity that this place seems to inspire--and warrents. Went with some friends with very different appetities--vegetarian, carnivorous, hungry, not so--and all were happy. Everything was tasty, well prepared, and well presented. The service was charming and our seating was comfortable. The crab rangoon and the hamachi were as good as reported. The sushi wasn't extraordinary--but was good, fresh, and reasonably priced. The beef teryaki was delicious-and such a generous portion that the trencherman carnivore in our party had a hard time finishing it. Really nice place.
