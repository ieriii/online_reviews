I really love meat. I tried going vegetarian for a year, but I couldn't handle the denial of my love for animal flesh. While I respect vegetarians, I'll eat twice as much meat to make up for what they're missing. Hot Doug's only makes it easier to eat lots of meat. Although I've never had an entire normal hot dog from here (I've only had a bite or two), I imagine it's good, but not as tasty as their gourmet hot dogs. Those things are deadly on the body and pocket. They're too good! So far, I (inspired by Anthony Bourdain) have had the fois gras hot dog with gratuitous slices of duck foie gras. I don't know where else you can get a hot dog like this, so this was a real treat. I've also had the Saucisson Alsacienne, which is/has: "Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Crascenza Cheese." Dee-licious. Best hot dog I've ever had in my life. Although the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage (topped with Sriracha mustard and seaweed salad) was delectable as well, it doesn't compare to the Saucisson Alsacienne. Doug made me pronounce it and didn't humiliate me too much when I butchered the pronunciation. Fries were okay, but I didn't pay much attention to them because I came here for the hot dogs, and I'll be back for more despite the long wait. It's wellllllllll worth it.
