Went here with three of my friends. We were seated immediately. I am not at all an expert in vietnamese food, but they seemed to have a lot of options. We decided to split a papaya salad and three entrees - tofu with sprouts, catfish in a clay pot, and some sort of chicken/lemongrass dish. The food came fairly quickly and everything was so delicious and flavorful. The papaya salad and the chicken lemongrass dish both had very fresh, bright flavors, while the catfish was nice peppery. I wish I had known the place was BYOB or I would have brought something to drink. But regardless, I very much enjoyed my meal and soon I'm sure I will return to try more of their dishes!
