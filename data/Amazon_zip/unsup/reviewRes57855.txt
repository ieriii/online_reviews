Demera is the second Ethiopian restaurant that I've tried in Chicago and it's the one I prefer. The service has always been stunningly nice and very helpful. I sometimes still need help navigating the menu and they always explain what each dish is and make great recommendations. I too cashed in on the Groupon and took a friend who had never eaten Ethiopian food before. She was a little hesitant, but immediately liked the honey wine and the lentil appetizer that we got. I will agree with a couple reviewers that the lamb dishes had some stealthy bones, but we chewed slowly. I tend to be more of a meat eater, but the lentil and chickpea dishes at Demera are probably my favorites.The food has great, bold flavors and eating it with the bread is fun. I give Demera two thumbs up!
