Not that this place needs more reviews but I am gonna write one anyway. My first time having shawarma was in Hyde Park. Oh, back then, my standards were low, so when I came to Yelp, I was surprised by other folks' reviews saying that the food was not authentic. Well, if you are similar to me, Sultan's Market is one of those places that show you exactly why some other Middle Eastern restaurants are not up to par. It's real good. And folks are nice too. When I came, I forgot my wallet so I had to run back home. It took me almost an hour to come back and they still had my sandwich and they didn't mind it at all.
