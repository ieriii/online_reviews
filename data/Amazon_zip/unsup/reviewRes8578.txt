There is nothing special about this place. Nella Grassano is sorely missed. Nella used to bake eggplants and not frie them. I was shocked to hear that there was no way to get them baked as they were pre made. What kind of an authentic italian restaurant is that? The prosciutto served with the rucola salad was as thick as a shoe sole. Being Italian I think this place is a victim of its own success. Well, Spacca Napoli, milk that as much as you can because I won't be back and I will tell everyone I know to not go.
