This is one spot where I keep coming back, even if the service can be bad sometimes. My last visit was a Saturday evening for my birthday, even with 7:30 reservations, we weren't seated until 20 minutes later. Our server kept us waiting, but once we were able to order, the food and drinks were worth it! We started out with a liter of Sangria to go with the baked goat cheese, and then I had my "usual" pork chop w/sweet potatoes. I'll admit it, I was a member of the clean plate club. This place is great, as long as you get a good server who doesn't make you wait forever and then screws up orders.
