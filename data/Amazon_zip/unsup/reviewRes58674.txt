I have been a long time fan of Mia and have now created this yelp account just to let people know exactly how horrible the management is at this place. I have been going to Mia regularly for almost 3 years now and will NEVER go back ever again. This really hurts since I enjoy the food there. I had called in and was told there was no wait. I showed up 20-30 minutes later and was told the wait was over an hour. I then asked to be put on the waiting list and was told I was the only one on the list. I tried to figure out who I talked to on the phone and the two women at the front made me feel like I was some sort of idiot....and had never been there before. Quite the opposite. I then waited for a bit and there were 2 open tables up front (we were a party of two). The two tables sat empty for about 15 minutes before I walked up and asked what was going on. I was told it would be another 45 minutes still. I honestly felt like I was at a club and some jerkoff door guy was telling me I couldn't get in. I have always loved the food here but customers should not be treated like this under any circumstance. I will NEVER go back to this god awful place and If this yelp causes even one person to not go to this place It will have been worthwhile. DO NOT SUPPORT PLACES LIKE THIS.
