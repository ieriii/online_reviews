I went here on a weeknight to check it out. pretty cozy atmosphere and friendly service. but the food was so-so, nothing to write home about. however their beer selection is superb. I will keep it on my list of places to return to and try again, especially if I'm with someone who is a big beer aficionado, but will not be rushing back there for the food anytime soon.
