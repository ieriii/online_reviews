All I can say is WOW! This place is amazing it really hold true to its name CARNIVALE! I recommend you take out of town guests here or business associates that you want to make an impression on. From the color splashed on every wall and ceiling to the wonderful bubbly service to the mouth watering food. This place is a definite stop and eat in! Make sure to make a reservation because it is packed any day of the week. I recommend the Guacamole, Meat and Cheese of Spain, Halibut, and as side orders you must get the fried sweet plantains, fried yuca with garlic mojo, braised greens with smoked bacon and the mac and cheese which is to die for and the flavors of each dish can not be matched by any other restaurant. This restaurant has it all and more. It is impressive on so many levels and definitely entertains and wow's your guests! It is a great staple in the Chicago Land community!!The only con to this place is the music is a little too loud. If they ease it just a little it would be a 6 star! =)
