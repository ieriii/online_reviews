Overall impression? We weren't impressed, but it "wasn't bad" Taste: 3 (I've had better elsewhere, but none of it was bad tasting. I wish the salmon burger has a real PIECE of salmon instead of a dry patty we were served) Plating: 3 (messy, but pretty much what you'd expect at a fast food joint) Originality: 3 (no surprises here on the menu) Value: 2 (you could find better deals for sure!!!!!!!!!) Ambiance: 3 (loud and casual dining here)
