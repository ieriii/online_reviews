Mmm...drool. Thank you, Chef Rick Bayless. That was probably the most delicious lunch I've had in ages. We went with a friend on Saturday. The wait was about 30-35 minutes. Not too terrible, and definitely worth it. I have to admit that I was surprised by how tiny the place is, though. A bigger location wouldn't hurt them any, but I understand the appeal of where they are at. We could have gotten served much more quickly if we'd taken our food to go, but 30 minutes wasn't the end of the world. I ordered the chips and guac, Chicken Tinga Torta, and shared an order of the churros with chocolate dipping sauce with my husband. DELICIOUS. All of it was DELICIOUS. I will definitely be back.
