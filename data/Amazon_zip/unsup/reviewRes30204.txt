We had a delightful little lunch here on a recent Friday. My party tried 3 different sandwiches, all tasty: a turkey/brie, a club and a grilled veggie. I also had a cup of the gazpacho which was the soup of the day - JJ sez dy-no-mite! Finally, I had a very tasty sidecar, my first of (I hope) many to come. Service was attentive and everything arrived at our table quickly. The atmosphere was pleasant, with a great album playing, nice natural light coming in from the street, and a quaint location in the near north area.
