Ate here the first time with some friends. The waitress recommended the white(olive oil, garlic and parm), with mashed potato and bacon. DELICIOUS. The other ones we ordered in red (sauce, cheese..) were good but the toppings all slid off and it was hard to eat. It was a bit noisy and not really that ideal for a large group... but the waitress was nice and everything was good.
