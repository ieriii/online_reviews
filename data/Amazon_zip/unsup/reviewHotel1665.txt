My second Kimpton - the first being the Hotel Monaco a few blocks away earlier this year. Both times, we've loved the room, the wine reception, and many other nice touches that keep us comfy and happy in Chicago. We haven't had such luck with the services promised for people with pets. At the Hotel Monaco (April 2011) we checked in late, but not before grilling the phone operator about having pet sitting available for the next day (and booking it). We mentioned it again at check-in and were reassured that all we needed to do was check in with the concierge in the morning. Lo and behold, the concierge gave us one of those looks that the Maitre D' gives Ferris Bueller - raised eyebrow, corners of mouth turned down....Snooty? Snotty! He had no idea. Nothing was booked, and nothing could be on short notice. I love the pet friendly vibe of the Allegro - but we ended up boarding our dog at a nearby place for the night. The pet-sitting service the concierge put us in touch with (Puppy Love) were helpful and accomodating in booking the times we required, but at a price of $360! 2 x 4 hour blocks for $360. So, Rover's down the road at the Mutt Hutt for $35. They were cool too. No in room coffee which makes for a monstrous morning, but all in all I like these hotels. I just hope they can raise their own bar when it comes to people travelling with dogs.
