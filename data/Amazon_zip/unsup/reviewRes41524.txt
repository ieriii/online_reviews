This may be my favorite steakhouse... I suppose it is a little unfair to compare Ruth's Chris to other classic steakhouses, I mean, they put a stick of butter on every piece of protein that leaves their kitchen, so how could it not taste great! Anyway, the steaks are great, always perfectly cooked and they sizzle till your last bite. Classic appetizers and sides, all of which are perfectly prepared. Great wine list and bar menu. Very nice steakhouse atmosphere, dark colors and low lighting. Fairly priced, for a Chicago steakhouse at least. My personal preference may be for Gibson's, but that may just be the Chicago in me... I'll definitely be back to Ruth's Chris though and I'd recommend it to anyone.
