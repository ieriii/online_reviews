I am not a huge fan of pizza by nature. I got tired of eating a lot of it when my dad and I used to order in all the time (since it was at a point in my life where I wasn't quite a cook and, well, neither was he if it wasn't on a grill). But this! This I will keep coming back for. It's the only place I reccomend when people want a good deep dish pizza when they're in the city. The caramelized cheese on the edges is something you either love or hate, it seems, but for me it's on the "to die for" side of pizza-lovin'. They're extremely generous with their toppings (their sausage is massive, the pepperoni and black olive are plentiful, don't skimp on the fresh garlic) and their staff is as courteous as the rather large crowds can allow. They seem to be recovering rather well from the (extremely unfortunate) fire they suffered a while back. The new downstairs is more modern and silghtly less cramped; the new bar is pretty nice too. I haven't had a chance to check out the upstairs since the fire - I wonder if creepy Gandalf is still painted, watching you pee (eerie). It can get noisy and crowded, but such is life at a good pizza place / bar. Delivery can take a little while, but that's probably because I always order deep dish, which invariably takes longer to cook. Easily worth my wait, though. Besides, I can have cider with my pizza here. Yum. If I were a songwriter, I would write an ode about Pequod's.
