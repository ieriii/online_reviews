I went today for some tacos to take home. I got carne asada, lengua, al pastor and ground beef. Maybe the rest of their menu is awesome but their tacos are so-so at best. The Asada was ok but I've had much better at other places. The al pastor was less flavorful than others too. The ground beef was down right no good. The lengua was also kind of bland.  I'll go again to see if any of their other dishes will get me to give them a higher score.
