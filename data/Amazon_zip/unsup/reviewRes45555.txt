Went here last weekend with a friend. I was starving just getting off of work and told her i want a bar thats quick with their food and it was right by her place.  It wasn't too packed at around 11:30pm. We walked to the back and found a table near the fireplace. It was nice and cozy. The decor was nice and the people seemed very friendly. It was fun to people watch in this place.  On to the food. I had wilde burger which was damn good. I haven't had a great burger like this since I went to RAM in schaumburg. I asked for a medium rare burger and I received my medium rare burger perfectly cooked. The bun was nicely toasted. It also came with fries, coleslaw, and half a pickle?!? I also grabbed an amstel light. She got a margarita with their Guinness Chocolate cake. A sweet drink and chocolate cake didnt go well together so I drank the margarita and had some of the cake as my dessert. Cake wasn't too special, I couldn't tell if there was guinness in the cake or not. Nevertheless it was a nice cozy place.  Would I go there again? No, once is enough for me.
