Easily the best authentic Italian food in Chicago. Delicate dishes, great flavors, huge Italian wine list. Pasta is exceptional, so are their desserts. It all starts with their Balsamico (smooth as silk). The Burrata is so light as if from heaven, the risotto is rich, the spagetti neri have a great rustic flavor. Finish with a Panacotta ... but always pay attention to the specials. Only food that was a bit lackluster was the antipasti platter.
