Went with my hubby on Saturday night and had a great time. Being a former Floridian this place really makes me feel like I'm back in Miami. I had the ropa veija which was good, but not quite as good as what I've had at the other location. It seems like the flavors weren't quite as deep as normal. The sides were black beans and rice (good) and sweet plantains (yummy!). Ever since I moved here I miss having plantains sooo much. My husband had the bistec steak which was awesome, the sauce or salsa that is came with was truly delightful. For dessert we had the vanilla flan which I would highly recommend. My husband hates flan and he even thought it was delicious. I will definitely go back, and I totally love the vibe but the seating is a little weird in some places. Definitely a go to spot if you're in the mood for Cuban food.
