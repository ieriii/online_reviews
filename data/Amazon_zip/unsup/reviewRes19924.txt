Best sushi in Bucktown no contest. They have a great menu, and I prefer BYOB, as it's so much cheaper to buy a bottle at Binny's than to buy by the glass at a restaurant. I definitely recommend the potstickers as an app, but make sure you always ask fir the specials. I have had pretty great crab cake app before, but you have to catch it at the right time. Many of the sushi rolls come with roe, so if you're not a fan of fish eggs make sure you order without, no problem. No dirty looks like you might get elsewhere. If you're not in the mood for sushi, they have some great fish entrees, and once again keep an eye out for their specials. When it's time for dessert, try the mochi. It might sound weird, and it might even look weird, but it's delicious. I have tried all the varieties, and while I'm partial to tiramisu, they are all delicious. They keep half the restaurant open for walkins and take reservations for the other half. I live close, so i swing by and put my name in and give them my number, and they call when your table is ready. Much better than waiting in their waiting area, which is a little cramped. Pus then you get to walk in past all the people waiting and feel like a celebrity getting seated right away. But don't consider driving, unless you want to do valet or drive around Bucktown looking for a space.
