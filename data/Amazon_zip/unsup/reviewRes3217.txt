Had the original bad boy buddha last night with organic brown rice and tofu w/o the egg...DELISH! The veggies were yummy and the seoul sassy sauce (what you get if you dont want spicy) was perfect!!!  If you want the regular spicy sauce, it comes in the yellow "mustard" plastic container on every table. I also kind of like the communal seating area (wooden park benches/tables). This might be my fave bibimbab place yet! Do know that I have a pretty healthy appetite and the original bad boy buddha was a good amount! If you're REALLY hungry, then get the bigger one. :)
