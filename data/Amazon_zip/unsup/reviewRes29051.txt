YUMMM.... OK I absolutely love this Thai Place. I dream about the food from here. Here is how much I love it... I have trouble ever finishing a meal, lets just say I'm not part of the clean plate club, and most likely never will be. But at Opart, I pretty much lick the plate clean to get all the goodness I can get. No Joke. Seriously, the people I'm eating with get a little embarrassed.  The only downside to eating here, is that I eat everything so I never have any leftovers. :(
