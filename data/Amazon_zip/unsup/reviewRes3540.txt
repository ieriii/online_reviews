I expected more of this place. And believe me, I really wanted to love this place - but it was a mere lust at first sight. I was literally drooling as I'm reading the reviews of Crisp. And drooled some more when I checked out their on-line menu. So I decided to go ahead and jumped on the L on a rainy Saturday morning (by morning I mean 11:30). The place was quite full, but we still managed to find a couple of seats. Seating layout is definitely something we were not too crazy, either. I'm fully aware of the 'street vendors' seating in most Asian countries - but this is a restaurant, so I'd rather not facing a total stranger while I'm sucking on the tip of the chicken wings.  We ordered half-order of chicken wings with Seoul Sassy sauce, and two orders of Seoul Steak Bowls (bulgogi over rice). They are good - but not super good that would make me want to go back next weekend. The Seoul Sassy sauce is the typical Asian sweet & spicy sauce - so I found nothing (too) special about it. I have actually had better bulgogi else where. Next time maybe I should try their bibimbap. Their serving is pretty huge (off of the regular menu, not the lunch special) - so for you with small tummy capacity, you might want to share.
