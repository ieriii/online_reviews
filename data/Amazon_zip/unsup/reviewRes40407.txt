My first experience at L&E was unbelievable. I had brunch on a Thursday morning by myself. Everyone was extremely friendly and gracious. I had great conversations with Tony, Jennifer and Elizabeth. I got a tour of the dining room and got the behind the scenes story of the interior design. I ordered the PBR Breakfast, minus the PBR. It was phenomenal, such a great experience. I appreciate the great food and the outstanding service.
