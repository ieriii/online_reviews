I have a secret PBS crush on Rick Bayless . . . so of course we had to try his food.  Definitely the highlight of our trip. Showed up around 11:30 and stood in line a good 30 minutes. At least while standing in line you can watch the kitchen do their thing. You can peek inside the oven and watch the torta makers put on toppings. You order at the counter, take a number and they bring your food to you. I normally dislike this type of service especially when it's crowded. People end up saving tables and there is wasted chairs and space. But the hostess makes things much more pleasant. She controls the seating and doesn't hand you a number to order unless there is a space for you to sit. Once we figured out that is what was going on, we relaxed and didn't stress about getting a table. We ordered the mushroom torta (the ONLY vegetarian option - disappointed in that!), the Saturday special torta, guac and chips, a churro, and an Aztec hot chocolate. Everything was amazing. It tasted different but better than any Torta ( in comparison to San Diego style) then I've ever had. I didn't know you could oven roast them! The toppings besides the meat were a bit on the skimpy side. The meat was really the star of the sandwich. Even though they hand you a number and bring you your food, they provided the extra nice touch of waiting to bring dessert and the hot chocolate till we asked for it to be brought out. No rushing, no awkward plates, no churros going cold. I also LOVE FREE SPARKLING water (and still) on tap! Lots of people were drinking it while waiting in line. It helped to subside the hunger pains. Thanks for using biodegradable cups too!!!! I really wish we could go back after 3 PM and try to soups! I plans on visiting this place anytime we are in Chicago or recommending it for people who are going to Chicago!
