Go for breakfast or brunch, but be prepared to wait in line. Menu is hit or miss... spinach salad is delicious and eggs/omelets are good too. They have some bacon-fat fried potato thing that is just disgusting. And for whatever reason, the service is just as inconsistent... either awesome or atrocious. But for a neighborhood, public house atmosphere, this place is great... The sort of spot you can bring a newspaper, chat with an old friend or treat your grandma. If you're dressed to the nines and looking for a trendy nightspot, this isn't it.
