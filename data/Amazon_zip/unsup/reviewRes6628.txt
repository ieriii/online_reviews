Last night was my second time there. My first time was magical - it was 8pm on a Friday night, the place was back-to-back packed, candlelight brought in an air of mystery, and my party of 8 ordered nearly everything on the menu. So I was extremely excited to go back. This time we ordered the bbq flight as an appetizer, the house salad, half slab of ribs, and the mac & cheese. But before I delve into the foods we ordered, I first have to comment on the free chips and pickles. I never liked pickles. Until I had these pickles. I couldn't have enough. The chips are also fantastic and seasoned so well. The bbq flight is nice, as you get to try all the different types of meat. The house salad was also delicious - I was impressed by the attention to detail - the subtlety of the dressing, the smoking of the grape tomatoes, the seasoning of the salad. But my favorite dish all night was the mac & cheese. I am a big fan. The breaded, caramelized goodness caused me to eat over my stomach's capacity, but I enjoyed every bite. I'd highly recommend this place, with its reasonable prices and tasty food.
