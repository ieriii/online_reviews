We dined on 01/07/12 ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT !!! Took my wife here for her birthday, and fell in love with this place. The food was remarkable. In fact, the Parsnip & Truffle Agnolotti might be the best thing I have ever eaten.. EVER !!!! My wife said her Gnocchi were like silken pillows, and I had the salt baked branzino which was spectacular. Service was superb ! We had 8:30 reservations, arrived at 8:27 and were seated immediately. Server was very knowledgeable, and she gets extra kudos for saving me the cheeks off of my branzino !!!! I only rated it four stars because we were seated a little too close to the kitchen... it was quite hot in the dining area being that close. I shouldn't feel like I'm actually on the line !! But I'm a gastronome, and I LOVED seeing the guys in action !! (I almost paid more attention to them then I did to my date.... almost!) And lastly we were seated in a very small bistro style table up against a wall, in a very uncomfortable chair. Other than these two small infractions Piccolo Sogno did not disappoint !! Food and service were 5 star !!!! We will be back ... hopefully for truffle season !!!!!
