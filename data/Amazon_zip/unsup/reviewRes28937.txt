This is among about six Thai restaurants within a two block radius, so it doesn't necessarily stand out (especially due to the lack of friendly signage). However, when someone told me they pride themselves on BYOB Thai joints and that this is their favorite...it definitely peeked my interest. We went on a Saturday night and had zero problems getting a table. I was surprised by the decor and ambiance of the place. I was expecting somewhat of a dive, but it was really cute and kind of hip (as in I wanted to ask them what paint color was on the walls because I wanted to use it for my apartment).  The food was delicious, which is really what's going to keep me coming back. We started with the spring rolls with the peanut dipping sauce (i.e. thinner/sweeter peanut butter) that was devoured in two minutes. We split two entrees: panang curry beef (it was great and not too spicy) and the chicken pad thai (yummy and not too greasy or sweet). I think the entire bill (including the beer we purchased at the corner shop) was $30...not bad for a Saturday night date.
