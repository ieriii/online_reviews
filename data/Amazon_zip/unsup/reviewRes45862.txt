Stopped here for lunch with a couple of friends and it was pretty busy, which is a good sign to me. They said the wait would be 15 minutes, but it was closer to 30. :-(  Our server was Mallory. She was GREAT and very knowledgeable. Our glasses were never empty (which some people may not consider important, but to me, it's the sign of a great server). I ordered the Grand Lux Burger Melt, which is their take on the patty melt. It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The dressing is what "made" the sandwich. One friend ordered the Lemon Chicken Piccata and she said it was delicious. My other friend ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, but was told they were out of it and wouldn't have any more for an hour. While disappointed, it is also a sign that everything is made fresh. He ordered the Santa Barbara Chicken sandwich and was NOT disappointed in that choice. We also ordered the Roasted Pineapple Upside-Down Cake (picture) and the Banana Vanilla Wafer Pudding (picture) which comes with a frozen dipped banana covered in chocolate and peanuts. Both were phenomenal! I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK! Tips: Valet is $14 for the first 3 hours. If you are ordering dessert from the "Baked to Order" section of the menu, order when you order your entree because they only make those desserts when someone orders it.
