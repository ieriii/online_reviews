I have live in the Chicago suburbs for 12 years. I dont get downtown as often as I like, but when I do its usually for great food! I found this place on Yelp searching for organic food in Chicago. The 40 year old seasoned pans and caramelized crust was all I needed to read to know this is where I wanted to go to get pizza! We had to wait about 40 minutes tio get a table at about 7:30pm on a Friday. The service was great! The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The aroma of the crust was heavy through out the entire restaurant and was making my mouth water! We ordered sausage, pepperoni and onion on a medium pan pizza. OMG!!! This is by far the best pizza I have had since I moved out here! I will be back as often as possible! When we left at about 9pm, there was still a 40 minute line outside! Seems to be a well kept secret! YUMM!
