I like that this place can accomodate big groups so it's one of the default venues for birthday get togethers. It is a bit loud but I can't complain when my group tends to be the loud one too. I prefer ribeye but quickly learned their skirt steak is their best cut. And that cuban onion/cilantro they serve! Every time I wish I could take a bucket home with me. Grilled octopus or squid! They make it just right - enough crunch and...grill. They serve sangria. Once upon a time, I remember they served free sangria to their customers. Maybe it's just for certain nights... Parking is not difficult. People are constantly going in and out of Lincoln Ave. Service is alright. Some times you can't blame the waitors when you have a huge group. They didn't have change for our cash though, which was extremely strange.  Heard their cuban coffee is excellent but I don't do coffee after dinner. Seeing I've been back 4+ times, las tablas is a yes-go.
