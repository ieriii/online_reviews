This could be my new favorite place to hang out for a game--any game, as I am more interested in the guys watching than the "actual" game! The chicken nachos are to die for...soooo good. The mention of the place makes me instantly crave this dish--not your typical nachos order either...but more of a casserole type thing with cheese melted to perfection topped with tons of lettuce, tomatoes and Delicious guac and sour cream. The gym guilt comes right after. But so worth that extra mile. Delicious!!!!
