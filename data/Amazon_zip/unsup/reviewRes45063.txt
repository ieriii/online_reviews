Hopefully the style of Italian cooking at Anteprima is the beginning of a trend. A trend where the pasta is handmade and not drowning in red sauce or oil. Where a wide selection of interesting dishes are presented (no Chicken Parm or baked manicotti here!). Where portion sizes are just-right and you don't go home with a 5 lb bag of leftovers. Where the wine selection is well thought-out and well-priced. This is not bastardized "Italian" cooking popularized in the 70's. This is what Italian food should be like and you shouldn't have to pony up Spiaggia-type prices. A girl can dream! The 4-stars instead of 5 is because after all it's not perfect...service was somewhat spotty (although nice) and one of the pastas was slightly overcooked (very easy to do when using fresh pasta which cooks in seconds), but I liked this place so much I hate to even bring up anything negative. I came to this restaurant twice in one week....and that says it all.
