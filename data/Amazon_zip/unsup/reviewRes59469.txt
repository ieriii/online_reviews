Wow...can't say enough great things about La Villa! We have been patrons for several years now. I know for us, what keeps us coming back is the service, the atmosphere and most importantly the food! We have used their banquet halls for two large events and both were very well organized and unforgettable. This week they are celebrating their 40th year in business and they pulled out everything to celebrate. They rolled back the prices on selected items and have amazing entertainment all week long (we were lucky to see the talented Tim Fett this past Tuesday). The portions are VERY generous too, so go hungry. The ribs are so tender they fall off the bone, the Chicken Francese is very delicious and the New York Strip steak is heavenly. Chris and Sam go out of their way to make sure you have an great dining experience not to mention Teresa, the hostess who is truly a gem!
