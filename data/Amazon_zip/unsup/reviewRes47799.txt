Went here for a celebratory night out and didn't know what to expect.  Pleasantly surprised! The entire staff from the hostess to servers to gauchos to the ZED car driver were all friendly and helpful.  The cocktails were fresh and unique. The harvest bar was delicious (and had a nice selection for my vegetarian friend). The meat.... oh the meat... my inner carnivore had been released. I couldn't say no. The skewers kept coming and I kept eating... To top it off, the bill was very reasonable considering all that we ate.
