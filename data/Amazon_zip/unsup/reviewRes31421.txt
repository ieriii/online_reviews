Each time I've sat in the dining room, dinner has been terrific. The food was great and the execution...flawless. The lounge is another matter from a service perspective. BTW, when management says that the high-tops in the lounge are "first-come-first-serve", don't believe them. Their team of "hosts and hostesses" routinely hold bar toppers back for "reservations" I've seen this happen several times. Cut out the BS in the bar and I'll admit it gets closer to Pima and Canon. The Chicago branch is still on its Honeymoon - better pay attention guys.
