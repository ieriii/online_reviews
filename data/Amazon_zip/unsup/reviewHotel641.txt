Great hotel. Stayed there three nights and enjoyed my time in Chicago. -Clean rooms -Great location (close to Michigan Ave, John Hancock, Navy Pier, Gino's East) -Great price w/ expedia (80/night for two queens, non-smoking) -Free internet if you plug your laptop into the network downstairs at their business center. -Cookie at check-in -Only reason i won't give them five stars is because of the thin walls. We were able to hear music coming through from next door. But it really wasn't a problem.
