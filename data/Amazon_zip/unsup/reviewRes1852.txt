If you're going to gripe about waiting in line, take your business elsewhere. Aside from whining, all you're accomplishing is getting between loyal regular customers (or soon-to-be regular customers) and a darn good hot dog. Doug is a master of meats (encased, to be exact), and he dresses up his gourmet dogs with everything from brie to homemade salsa to foie gras. And ever unpretentious, you can still get a regular hot dog, Chicago-style, with all the fixin's for $1.50. Here's a long-time regular's secret: come at 10:30 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. on weekdays if you're in a hurry. Otherwise, call ahead for carry out, because long-line wait times can run upwards of 30 minutes. Doug takes every order himself, amicably chatting with his customers new and old. Coming here is an experience, not a rushed lunch, so grab a spot in line, enjoy it, and don't miss the duck fat fries!
