The place is great for lunch. $18 for the Catalan Express (includes a fountain drink/iced tea, an appetizer and an entree). The place was a bit confusing to get to, we went to two doors (one in the front and one inside), apparently, you need to go to the lobby then walk up one stair. I ordered the Mixto Croquetas (it was good), then scallop for entree. The scallop tasted just ok, it was very fresh, but it did come with six pieces (medium size). Overall the quality of the food was decent. Nothing exceptional, but the amount of food you get for the price is unbeatable. Recommend anyone who wants to grab a quick bite during lunch hour. If you want quality food, this might be an ideal place.
