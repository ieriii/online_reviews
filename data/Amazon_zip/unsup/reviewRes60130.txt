Hella Yelpers,{In the spirit of full disclosure Pambo was tripping on four hits of Purple Microdot which was purchased earier that day somewhere near the corner of Spaulding and Albany Streets}Wandering around the Argyle St. area for hours can make a man mighty thirsty. We stopped inside Tank Noodle which was packed to the gills and blasting Techno Music. I listened for what seemed to be days on end and was amazed that Pambo had found the first Asian restaurant in the Universe that was NOT playing Lite FM. We were seated directly at ear level with a speaker at a corner table. While I love all good music Tank needs to invest in a much better sound system, for Christsakes they are busy enough. Not being very hungery we ordered Bubble Tea in a cool watermelon flavor and color, it was cooly delish. The benchmark for any Vietnamese restaurant is of course the Spring Roll and the Bun. Here at Tank they do both well. The two star rating comes from the way we were treated. A lady friend had ordered a chicken soup and was freaked out because of a small feather that was still attached to the chicken skin. She was tripping balls and the feather sent her someplace not so happy. Pambo understand things like this happen and it's nobodys fault. Pambo can tell you true stories that would make anyone think twice about ever eating out anywhere ever again. The "M. Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner" story comes to mind, but I return to our regularly scheduled program. Anyway the manager/owner? refused to take the soup off the bill! This woman looked like an Asian Female version of Scottie Pippin and only after serious discussion was the item removed from our bill.......what a bummer.
