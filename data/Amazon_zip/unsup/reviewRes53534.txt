My husband and I go to Doug's more or less weekly, now. We generally get whatever is on special and something else. We go at the off hours and haven't waited for more than 20ish minutes yet.But we have not gotten to try the duck fat fries. We don't go when they're on, as we know it'll be a madhouse. Someday.
