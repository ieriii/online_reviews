take 2 happened on a sunny day in June of '10. I had to come back and I must stress the importance of having brunch here when in chicago. it is not acceptable to leave chicago without having some pancakes here. Definitely worth the 25 min ride again...and it was just as amazing the second time around !!! THANK YOU BONGO ROOM! I plan to make this my stop after the marathon in 2011...There is nowhere id rather have my carb overload than at you quaint little place!
