I LOVE Fogo 2 Go! I live right across the street and this is where we always order our pizza--never think about any other place.You can either walk in and order a HUGE pre-made slice, or you can order one of their 60 different options. The 6-cheese is DIVINE! Also, they'll pretty much make anything you want. You can swap in the toppings that you prefer...and they're always more than happy to do it.Go! You will not regret it.
