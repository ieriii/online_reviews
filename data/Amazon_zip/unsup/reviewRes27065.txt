I have to admit I am not a huge fan of deep dish, and as a native Chicagoan this is kind of a sin. My redemption came with Pequod's. I love the carmelized crust on their pizza so much that I will eat the crusts off the leftovers before I eat the guts. I always order some of their fried zuccini with ranch dressing which is good because everything is good with ranch dressing, but still. I always used to give myself some extra time to eat at Pequod's prior to a movie at Webster Place, but now.... They deliver to Ukranian Village!!!
