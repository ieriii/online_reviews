Despite the long list of fancy burger combos, I now think the genius order here is the standard Bad Apple burger med rare on a pretzel bun. It's such an awesome burger you don't want the fancy crap smothering it. Pass up the truffle fries (which *sound like* the best choice) and order the garlic fries. They are the bomb.
