Me and my girlfriend went to this place for the first time today. The shakes are amazing and so is the food, however the 4 star rating comes in the fact that it costs a small fortune to eat at this place. The hot dog's from what I know are custom made solely for this location, which is definetly cool. I would go back again, this time prepare to spend 5.50 for a hot dog and friends.
