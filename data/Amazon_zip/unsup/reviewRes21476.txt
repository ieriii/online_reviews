Jeepers when did hot dogs get so damn expensive!!!! We used to come here during high school 1998 or 1999 i believe with our 50% off coupons ripped from the school newspaper. Those were the times that it was even close to being reasonably priced. Are you kidding me 6 or 7 bucks for hot dog and fries? Chicago classic my ass theres nothing special about this hot dog. Its good for tourists and thats about it. If you are a true Chicagoan you'll take your fat ass over to Portillos where they do things right. I cant believe this place is opening in Wheeling.
