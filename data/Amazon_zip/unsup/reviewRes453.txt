I had dinner at Alinea about two months ago. As a young chef, I've been a fan of chef Achatz for a while and was very excited to finally get to try his food. The evening was perfect. The food, the atmosphere, the staff, etc... Truly one of the best meals I've ever had. The flavors that lingered on my palate balanced the following dish perfectly. There was a squab course I wasn't the biggest fan of but if I only had one complaint out of 20+ courses, I'm okay with that. The price was high as is expected of any 3 Micheline star restaurant but I'd gladly do it again and look forward to the next visit!
