I stayed there over a weekend while visiting Chicago. I waited till the last minute to book the room, so it wasn't particularly cheap (around $200 a night), but I wouldn't be surprised if you could get a cheaper rate by making plans in advance. Nevertheless I really enjoyed the place. The hotel is pretty small (and it looks like an old apartment building), but the rooms are nice: we had a standard room with a queen-size bed, and it was relatively large and very clean. The staff at the front desk was also very friendly and helpful, always saluting us when we came in or out, and always helping us with our questions. Not to forget: the location is top-notch if you want to hang out in Boystown: it's just one block from Halsted St where most of the gay bars are located... very convenient. They have free continental breakfast, but I didn't get a chance to try it, and they have an agreement with the parking garage next door, where you can park for $20 a day with in-and-out privileges. Nice little hotel... I'd definitely consider staying there again next time I'm in town if I can get a cheaper rate.
