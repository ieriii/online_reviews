I have been to The Bongo Room a few times and have enjoyed my breakfast every time. I adore oatmeal for breakfast but it is not on the menu here, so had to find something else to order. The selection of savory items was small. Ended up ordering a basic egg item which was OK. Luckily my sister had the great idea of sharing the red velvet pancakes. They were delicious!! If I were to ever order these again would ask for the sauce on the side. The pancakes were wonderful plain. I enjoy the atmosphere here, the service is always friendly and they serve a good cup of tea, key ingredient for me.
