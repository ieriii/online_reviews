Yes, the ambience was sexy, romantic. The minute you walk in, you certaintly don't feel like you are in Chicago, but some exotic location.  Now, the taste. We did get the monkfish appetizer, which was really good. I love the taste of all the mix of spices with the fish. The entree. I'm not a huge fish fan, so I ordered the filet and shrimp. There is no way that piece of steak was a filet. I'm guessing it was a strip steak at best. The shrimp was waaaay overdone and chewy. Others at the table who did get fish dishes seemed to enjoy more than me.  Really enjoyed the sangria, I could've drank those all night.
