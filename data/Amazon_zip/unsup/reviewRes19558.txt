We decided to go here on a Thursday night around 6:30pm. This was our first time trying out the restaurant, so we were pretty excited. As we entered the restaurant, we could see that it was moderately busy. There were no signs to direct you anywhere. I saw people waiting in line to order food and patrons sitting in the dining area. Seeing how busy it was, we decided to grab seats while we wait for one more in our party. After sitting for more than 10 minutes, we were rudely ask to leave the sitting area. The host told us we had to order first then he would seat us. We have never been to the restaurant so how were we suppose to know? Also, while we were sitting there, there were many employees that walked by us and didn't even say a word. We stood near the front while waiting for our friend. After 10 minutes, the same host rudely asked if we were ever going to order. We explained that we still had to wait for our friend. There were others that were waiting so I don't understand why he singled us out.  Eventually, we ordered our food and sat down to eat our meal. I ordered the Thursday special which was the mole poblano. It was just OK. The other two in our party ordered different tortas. They enjoyed their sandwiches. We had the chrurros for dessert. They were really tasty. Overall, our dining experience was just OK. It's unfortunate that the host was rude to us. I'm sure not all the employees are rude like him. They should explain their system of ordering and seating. This way it doesn't make newbies coming to the restaurant feel embarrassed from being scolded by the host for sitting in the dining area when we were not suppose to.
