i do like the hopleaf - but i wish they had a few more folks tending... (is that a common theme in my bar-reviews? :P) overall a good experience and i've heard the food there is good. its kind of a hike for me (from lakeview) so i've only made it up there if someone's in from out of town or its someone's bday (after a long haitus of meetings).
