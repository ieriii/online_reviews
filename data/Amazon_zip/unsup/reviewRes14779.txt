This is getting an average rating from me. Here is why... it is a "brewery" not a resturant, so I will review from two different standpoints. Brewery: The beers were lackluster. I tried Golden Cross and AntiHero IPA.  AntiHero IPA- This is not an IPA. The hop content was that of a Pale Ale (which apparently is the big seller because they were out Goldern Cross- Golden Cross tated very similar to Miller Lite with a little more flavor. With the taste of corn adjunt in it, definitly not worth the tag price. Resturant aspect: They put millions of dollars into restoring this building from ground up and it definitly shows. I was trying to think of something that could be changed but the ambiance is fantastic minus the neighborhood. Bottom Line: A fantastic place to hang out, however, this is not Goose Island. JS
