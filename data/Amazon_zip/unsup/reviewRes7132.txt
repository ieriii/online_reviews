So back in the day if I wanted BBQ the only good option was Fat Willy's Rib Shack... suddenly Chicago has been on a major BBQ binge. I can't even name all the places that have popped up around Chicago, but until tonight Smoque was my favorite. To complete my #FatKidSunday of Del Seoul tacos, Molly's Cupcakes and finally Chicago Q's. First of all the staff, the atmosphere, the building... top notch! Now to the good stuff... to start off we tried a BBQ flight. A trio of pulled chicken, pulled pork and kobe brisket with their trio of BBQ sauces. So the good part is it's simply amazing... the bad part is it'll make you even more indecisive on what to order for your main course. All the meats are soooo damn good, but ultimately the smoked pulled chicken is just out of this world good. I'm pretty sure those chickens were smoking while they were alive... PETA might not like that. Ultimately decided to go with the smoked half chicken with cole slaw and a side of mac and cheese. The half chicken is a chicken like no other... cover it up with BBQ sauce and tell me it isn't the best BBQ chicken you've ever had. Even the cole slaw was damn good, all like 20lbs of it that they put on your plate. The mac & cheese deserves it's own paragraph... it deserves it's own review entry actually. Holy crap did I think Art Smith's mac & cheese at Table 52 was the best ever... well here comes Chicago Q taking the throne on that one. Hands down my favorite BBQ place in Chicago now. I can't wait to go back and try some ribs next time. I liked it so much I'm thinking of getting a smoked whole turkey from them for Thanksgiving!
