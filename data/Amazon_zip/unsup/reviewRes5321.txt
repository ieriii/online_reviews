The Purple Pig is really good overall, and any restaurant with an entire section of a menu devoted to fried things gets my approval. Everything on the menu is shared, so order tons of stuff and dig in with your friends. The octopus, jamon serrano, and truffle cheese--all terrific, all keepers for sure--were the highlights when I went. Pork-fried almonds are OK, not as good as I had hoped. Just felt/tasted like oily almonds, really. The cured meats we ordered weren't anything special--somewhat flavorless/characterless, not interesting flavors at all. The milk-braised pork shoulder is really tender, but nothing to write home about in the way of flavor or character or spice. (It's possible that I was spoiled by a recent visit to Salumi, in Seattle, which has the best cured meats I've ever had.) One of the servers accidentally brought us a plate of tasty fried olives, and instead of correcting him, our waitress let us have them on the house. A nice gesture! I will definitely be back when I'm downtown again, as the menu is large and changing, and very interesting.
