The most wonderful bar to go to, whether with friends, bfs, family or whoever else you might enjoy some fantastically delicious beers with. I have NEVER had a less than wonderful experience at the Hopleaf. Whether you're going there just to enjoy some beers, or for a full dinner, the service and quality is top notch. My boyfriend and I once had dinner there on a Friday night and sat there for probably 2-3 hours. Our server knew the exact right time to come over and take more beer orders, but never bothered us when we didn't need her. One of my biggest pet peeves are hoovering servers. You'd think at such a crowded place like the Hopleaf, your server might go MIA sometimes, but they are always there, whenever you need them! I can't get over how intuitive they are! Also, if you go to the hopleaf to eat, you HAVE to get the belgium mussels. For 2 people, it's only $20 bucks-comes with fries and an amazing aoili-and a BUCKET full of mussels. It's probably the best mussel deal in town! The sauce is soo delicious and you can dip it in the bread that also comes with the appetizer.  My mouth is watering now just thinking about it!
