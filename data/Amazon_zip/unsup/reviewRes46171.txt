I LOVE GRAND LUX CAFE!!! There's always a wait when you go there, no matter the time of the day...and to me that says really good food. I actually think it's way better than Cheesecake Factory. Try to get a table in the rotanda...right by Michigan ave. Big portions, huge menu...tons of things to choose from. The desserts are awesome....you must must order the apple pie with your meal just cause it takes 30 minutes to be made, and you will not regret it. Good service.
