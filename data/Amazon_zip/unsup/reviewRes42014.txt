I went in today for a slice, and decided on the stuffed sausage. I thought it was a pretty good deal for under $4.00. By the time I got home and dug into it, it wasn't very hot anymore, but it was very good. The sauce very tasty, and I really liked the crust. Not too buttery, but just right. Overall, I can definitely recommend Art of Pizza! Obviously the fresher, the better, but even after my 20 minute car-ride home, it was a very tasty lunch.
