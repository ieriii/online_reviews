Atmosphere: Flawless. The French/Algerian music makes for a perfect soundtrack when the place is otherwise quiet. The tables and booths are comfortable. The aesthetic of the food presentation offer a treat, too. Food: Order a crepe. They offer two distinct types of this dish. If you want something sweet, try anything with fruit. For a meal, get the goat cheese/salmon crepe. With a pot of mint tea to go with the meal, I couldn't ask for a better brunch. Location: Corner of Foster and Clark. This is the heart of Andersonville. Staff: The staff runs this place very well. Go in expecting to enjoy yourself. They take care of the rest.
