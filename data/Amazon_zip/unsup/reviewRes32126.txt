I went to Sunda on a Friday evening afterwork. I was so hyped to go because I had perused the menu before arriving. The menu is pretty vast and interesting. I met my sister there who was also excited to try it. we were over an hour late for our reservation and the hostess was very gracious and seated us after about 10 minutes. The place was pretty hoppin. We sat at a communal table which is not a big deal to me. I had the pork belly as an appetizer. It was quite flavorful but I didn't really care for the bao bread that came with it. the bread was too thick for that amount of meat. We also had Ox Tail Pot stickers which were also delicious. Very flavorful! For dinner we did Sushi. We had Sunda's Yellowtail Jalapeno, the Firecracker and the No You Didn't Ultimate hand roll. All very delicious. I really enjoyed my experience at Sunda and will definitely be back!
