Service was very good, glasses and no corkage for the Sapporo we picked up cold at CVS across the street. (nb: CVS has a few japanese beers cold but no sake) The rolls were fresh, but a little too saucy for my taste. I prefer a higher fish to topping ratio. Also the spicy rolls are SPICY, just something to note. A little put off by the environment. Not a huge fan of house music or an overabundance of feet and ass photography while dining...just not my thing. Also, as other reviews have noted, it's very small. We were planning on ordering another roll or two, but the folk waiting for tables were all up on us and the music was a pounding and the feet were all around and I just needed to go.
