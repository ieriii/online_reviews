I finally made it to Frontera! Late Saturday night we walked in and they said the wait was only an hour and a half. It ended up only being an hour! Not bad at all when you're sipping a margarita. Go with the gold one, that's quite tasty. The Champagne one was disgusting. However, the best drink I had that evening was the Mexican Mojito. Fantastic! As for food, we got the chips and guac which was very good. Plenty to go around and tasted quite fresh. I got the chicken in the verde sauce which was nice and spicy but also had a very large range of flavors to pick out. The mashed potatoes that came with were also top notch. My one issue with the chicken is that I'm pretty sure it's the same they use in the caldos at Xoco so I was like...hmmm...I know this seasoning! My friend got the duck in mole and holy cow, I had a little entree envy. The duck was super tender and the mole wasn't super heavy like some places give you. Great experience, great food, and not too bad of a wait!
