We were very torn between coming here or going to Manna, but in the end, I think all the reviews speaking to the "hipster" vibe at the latter restaurant scared us away and into the dining room of the Chicago Diner. We could not be happier with our decision. The atmosphere was inviting, and the service was excellent - prompt, friendly, and attentive without being overbearing. We had no wait at 6:30p on a Thursday evening, but by the time we left a little over an hour later, there was a small crowd huddled outside. The timing of each part of the meal was perfect - we never had to scramble to make room on the table, nor did we have to wait more than a couple of minutes between courses. It's a tiny place, but it was abundantly staffed, and they all worked together to make it an excellent experience. That said, I would have tolerated abysmal service just to have more of the food! We started with the buffalo "wings," which were absolutely amazing (also, I don't remember ranch ever tasting so nomnom before I went veg*n!). I had the pumpkin raviolis, The Boy had the bacon (vegan-)cheddar burger, and we finished it off with the chocolate mousse cake. Every part was absolutely perfect - unique, extremely flavorful, and well worth the very reasonable prices. We travel to Chicago several times each year for concerts and other events, and we've always made a point to to visit Karyn's Cooked each and every time. Well, now Chicago Diner will be on the mandatory food visit each time - it was just incredible all-around. Cannot recommend it highly enough.
