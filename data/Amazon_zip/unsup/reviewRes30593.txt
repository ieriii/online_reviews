I LOVE THIS PLACE. We arrived and were treated like gold. The staff is over the top accomodating, and the ambience of the place impressed us from the moment we walked in. We were there on a Thursday night and weren't surprised to find the place was packed! While we were waiting for our table we had a glass of wine in the bar and sat at the piano which was so much fun. Nothing like a little live music to get the night started! When we were brought to our table upstairs we were greeted by our server who was excellent. She was very kind, very helpful, and took great care of us. All of the food, down to the bread, was amazing. The stuffed mushrooms to start were great, and by the time we ordered and finished salads we weren't even sure if we could eat dinner!! HAH- who were we trying to fool. Of course we ate dinner. We each had a bone-in filet, and shared the truffle crab gnocchi and lobster mashed potatoes. Holy cow was it good. They practically had to roll us out of the place. The food was impeccable. If you are looking to spend a couple extra dollars, this is the place to do it. Thanks Mastro's!!
