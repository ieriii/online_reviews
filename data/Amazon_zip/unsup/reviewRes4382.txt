One thing I love about this place is its ability to create a weekend vibe, smack dab in the middle of the week. I personally stick to the off nights to save some money and avoid the crowds, although on Saturdays after midnight, the free swing band can be fun. It also helps to have good cheap surrounding entertainment, such as the annoyance theatre (for cheap comedy) and uptown lounge (for cheaper drinks).
