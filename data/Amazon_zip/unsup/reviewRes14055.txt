This place is huge already so I can't wait to see what happens when the upstairs finely opens. The decor is comfortable and airy. The beer is delicious. The mussels are just as good as hopleaf's and the burgers are great despite the fact that every time I go I ask for my burger to be medium well and they always do medium rare. Not sure what the problem is there but I hope the cooks have gotten better at judging when the food is done. Not sure if they still have the chedder soup but it was more like cheese dip. Not thin enough to be considered soup and it was very rich. It tends to be pretty crowded but when you put your name down they also take down your phone number so you can go down the street to the whistler and have a cocktail while you wait. Haven't tried the brunch yet but I look forward to it.
