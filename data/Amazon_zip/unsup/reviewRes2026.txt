What can I say...I love encased meats like most Americans out there! I have to say that this is probably the most unique take on a hot dog EVER! Of course, you have your original style but for the more adventurous people out there, I would recommend you trying their specialty dogs. I have to admit that I have tried all of them and haven't had a bad thing to say about any of them! My top four dogs here are the Antelope Sausage with 4 Cheese Dijonnaise & Roasted Yellow Peppers, Cognac-Infused Pheasant Sausage with Chive-Dijon Goat's Butter & Duck Rillettes,Three-Chili Wild Boar Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mayonnaise, Raw Milk-Garlic Cheddar Spread and Crispy Fried Onions, and of course..Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel (by far the best Dog I ever had but it's not for everyone). Also, if you come on Friday or Saturday, you can get Duck Fat Fries that are incredible! The ambiance is very laid back and casual. You will have to wait in a long line to get inside but it is SO worth the wait! Cash only! -Papa Bear
