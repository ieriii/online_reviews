I came to this place because it has the word PURPLE in it's name, and I love me all things purple. That and because it was the only place I could find along Michigan Avenue besides all the retail stores and chain food spots. I was not disappointed! I opted for cocktails, though their wine list is extensive. I managed to sample several dishes (courtesy of the nice ladies sitting next to me at the bar), including: the olive oil pouched tuna and greek lima beans, the housemade greek sausage with rapini and grapes, and the eggplant capanota with goat cheese. All very delicious! Also had some pretty yummy cheeses, but I can't tell you which ones they were. All in all, I'd recommend this spot. It could get pricey though, depending on much wine and how many dishes you order. But very tasty/ worth it.
