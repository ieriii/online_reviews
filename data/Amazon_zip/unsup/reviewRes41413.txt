The food was amazing. The chef even got "bored" and sent us an awesome duck confit dish he was experimenting with just for fun. When you show up they really just start bringing food because for the most part you can't choose what you have, and since it actually took about 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us when we arrived I'd say the service was slightly sub-par at times, but overall this place is well worth the expense.
