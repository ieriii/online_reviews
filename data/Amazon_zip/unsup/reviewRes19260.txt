I went here for my friend's birthday the other night and had a GREAT time sitting in the bar area with our big group. I was a bit hungry after ice skating so I got the butternut squash soup, which was the soup du jour. It was phenomenal. Had just the right hint of curry, some chicken, and a bunch of other teeny additions on the top which kicked it up a notch! I also had a pour of the Yamazaki 12 year Japanese whiskey for the first time. Now I know it will be hard for me to order any other type. The bartender chatted with me for a bit about the whiskey and he said it was his favorite drink in the entire bar. I have to agree with him. The service was super attentive so we stayed for like 3 hours. I can't wait to go back to the Gage when I am near Millennium Park. It was such a treat!
