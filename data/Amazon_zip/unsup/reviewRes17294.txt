Carnivale... fairly 3 stars The food is Ok, however the portions are a bit small. I tried the ceviche...ohhh noooo!!!! I don't know what was that!, definitely not ceviche.... maybe the chef was not inspired that day. The best of this place is the ambiance. Parking might be a problem. Overall, this place is just OK.
