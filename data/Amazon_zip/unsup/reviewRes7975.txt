meh. this was ok. we started with fried zucchini and capresse salad for appy's - the zucchini was too sweet for my taste and the capresse was really good. Then came two pizzas, a white with truffles oil and mushrooms and a red with buffalo cheese and basil. Eh. It was good. In my opinion, good, but not outstanding. Plus it all tended to slide off the crust before it got to your mouth, which was just sort of an annoyance. I guess we were comparing to another Napoli pizza place we frequented near a class we were taking and that just blew me away. This left me a little sad that I hadn't decided to return there instead of try a new place. The tiramisu, however, was quite tasty. And the service was quite good too. I just can't give it more stars because the pizza itself was underwhelming, to me, but I'm far from an expert on Napoli pizza.
