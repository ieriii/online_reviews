i could have sworn i loved ethiopian food. until, i ate at this flop. The place is located on the coprener of my work street, yet they still called back to ask how to spell the street name. an hour and a half we waited and when the food arrived i was super disapointed. small portain bland food and over priced. heed, my warning skip this spot.
