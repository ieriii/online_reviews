What an experience! We decided to go here for our anniversary this week and I was blown away by the service and the food. Our server was friendly and showed us how the restaurant works. She was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the meal. The meat served...that was perhaps the best filet mignon and pork ribs I had ever been served. The other meat and sides were excellent. I would highly recommend this place, especially if you have a taste for finely cooked meats of all kinds!!
