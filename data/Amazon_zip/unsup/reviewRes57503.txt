This is a lovely restaurant. My boyfriend took me here for a first date a few months ago. It was quite crowded, and a friday night, so I think my experience would have been better if we'd come at another time, or when it wasn't so busy. The food was good, but the portions were very small. It was also VERY loud. We couldn't hear each other speak across the table. They also informed us they had no booths available, so we were sitting at a tiny table, by a major thoroughfare, and everyone kept bumping into us. It also went from chilly to hot and back again a lot. Maybe I was sitting under a vent?Honestly, I'd rather do fondue at home, than deal with the stress of this place again.
