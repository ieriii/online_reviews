Had dinner at Alinea last night and man, what a very memorable experience. I won't go into detail over every cource, but the highlights for me were the short rib, the hot/cold potato, and the Black Truffle Explosion. The wine pairings were very good as well, and combined with the exceptional food, service, and presentation made for an amazing dining experience. It is very expensive, but worth it!!  Still thinking about those three courses, I wish I could have had seconds or third servings...
