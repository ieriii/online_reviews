It's good. The rice is spectacular, the meat is good and filling...the people are nice -this place is a neighborhood treasure. Broiled tomatoes and getting half dill and half regular rice with some ribeye and chicken, yum! Never had a bad meal there and they deliver to my crib in like 15 minutes. The chicken saffron soup is awesome! The free feta and radishes are tasty. Reza's meat may be a hair more ethereal, I'd put this between a Pita Inn and a Reza's...but for service and all out bang for buck...you will never beat Noon O ...especially when the owner greets you and genuinely appreciates your business. It's awesome.
