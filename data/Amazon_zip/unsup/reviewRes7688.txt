I went here with three of my galpals on a Wednesday night for a nice evening out. I made reservations ahead of time, but in the future I don't think I'll bother.  The atmosphere was classy and intimate, and our waiter was engaging without being overbearing.  I ordered lasagna, which came in a huge portion and was excellent! My girlfriends all enjoyed their entrees as well. I would definitely go back. Great for an intimate small group setting or for a date.
