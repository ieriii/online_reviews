The Beer Bistro is for RedEye'd zombies. Hop Leaf for one (and Quenchers & Map Room for three), also have massive beer menus without having to make their bars some sort of Novelty Act. The beer list (11"x17", two-sided) is formidable. Fire at random... why would they have a BAD beer on tap?  Or, talk to the bartenders -- absolutely no pretense here, they'll tell you what you might like, and if you're a Tabula Rasa type-drinker, they'll tell you what you WILL like. They have a great selection, and they focus on Belgian wheat beers with an all-encompassing regional sampling. If you're currently ordering Blue Moon, 312, Oberon and the like, come to Hopleaf and order something with an umlaut on it -- you'll thank me for it.  The deal is, each Belgian town makes their own village beer, and each beer has a special mug with which that particular beer tastes the best in. Yeah, they have all those mugs too. Gotta love it. Very nice dark wood bar and "newly" renovated/expanded inteior has created a lot more sitting & dining space. They do serve WAY beyond typical bar fare here. People are low key Andersonville types and the bar volume (if that matters to anyone but me) is ideal, a rumbling of conversation that doesn't have you screaming into your pal's ear.
