If you can afford it, have your wedding here. Plates are very expensive upwards of over $120-160 per plate. The minimums are also quite high. If you can't afford the ballroom, they also have another venue space that can house up to about 120 guests, but it is in their restaurant space on the 2nd(?) floor. Didn't end up having my wedding here because I didn't want the reception in a dingy looking restaurant. Also no where to have the ceremony except for the ballroom.  If you can afford the $15,000 - $20,000 minimum and want an AWESOME location, this might be a good bet for you.
