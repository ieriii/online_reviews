Welcome to my favorite Chicago restaurant. I'm lobbying to get on Check, Please! with them. I'm in at least once a month which is saying something considering I try to only eat out once a week and given the amount of new restaurants in Chicago. I love the atmosphere here- they did really well on the dcor (walls look like a Snow &Graham card). I usually make a weekend reservation around Tuesday and have found it to be both a great spot for a date and just a girl's night out. Also, because it's BYOB, it's easy to split edamame, salads, two rounds of Maki and mochi and still come out having had an awesome dinner for $30-40 a person.  My favorite rolls have to be the White Dragon, Ikura and occasionally they do a great Angry Salmon special. Coast crab is great as well and don't miss the classics or sashimi- everything is very fresh.
