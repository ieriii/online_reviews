Met up with friends at Crisp tonight. I've read about this place on Yahoo and also saw it featured in a show. We ordered the Seoul Sassy and the Mild Buffalo wings. I'm not a fan of spicy wings so the Seoul Sassy was PERFECT for me. It was sooo good and the portion was BIG! Also ordered the Seoul Steak Bowl...loved it! I have to go back for the Baby Buddha Bowl. The place was very casual and small. Ideal for take out. If you do dine in, there will be a line of people waiting for you to leave.
