I really wanted to like this restaurant... we went for Lunch, and ordered the chef's selection of tapas , offered for $35 a person. We got about 8 different dishes altogether, but it seemed like a lot of vegetables and not so much meat ( and no cheeses).  Although everything tasted fine, I found the dishes a bit on the skimpy side, and all of us left still hungry. Our waiter was very slow and disappeared for 20 minutes at a time, although the service staff ( water, bringing out dishes, etc) was very good. At the end , we had to wait about 15 minutes more just to get our check ... after sitting there for 2 hours, we were ready to go ! SO ... not a lot of food for the money, poor service, honestly, there are a lot of better tapas places in Chicago.
