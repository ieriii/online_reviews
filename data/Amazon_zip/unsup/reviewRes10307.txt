I recently went to dinner here for my birthday, so let me start by raving about the AMAZING patio. This was the single reason my boyfriend picked this restaurant. Needless to say we were not disappointed with their beautiful outdoor patio, nor the amazing landscaping.  As far as the food went, I was impressed with some of it and just so so with others. For the appetizers we got the prosciutto with figs. and the grilled seafood appetizer. I was blown away with the portion size. There is no need to serve me the entire pig, but hey, if you want to waste it, i'll take the rest to go.  As for our main courses we got the ravioli and the pasta triangles with truffle oil and mushrooms. I really wasn't impressed with either. First if you are going to tease me with a description of food that includes truffle oil, at least make sure that I can taste it. Also being an Italian restaurant, I would appreciate the pasta actually being cooked. I do like al dente but the raviolis were still a little crispy. I will admit that I am slightly judgmental, as I love Terragusto; so take anything I say with a grain of salt. The simple fact after this long winded review is that Terragusto does it way better and for less money.
