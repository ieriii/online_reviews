I love this place. I took my fiance here for her birthday and they treated us very well the entire time. This place is really trendy and makes you feel like you're cool. I love how all of the staff wears the classic Converse Chuck Taylor kicks, even though this place is actually kind of upscale. The food is outstanding (order anything you want, it will be great), and the ambiance is even better. It's a little loud at times, and kind of an awkward bar area, but overall this is definitely a great spot for a date or group of friends to get together after work. The only thing that I'm pissed about is the fact that I didn't run into Billy Deck or David Schwimmer... oh well. Maybe next time. (Ok, I'm kidding... but also kind of serious.)
