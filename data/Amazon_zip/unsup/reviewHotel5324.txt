Nice hotel-extremely clean and good size rooms and great decor (primary color in room was red). Great location. Starbucks right next to check in desk inside the hotel. Vidalia-has a good breakfast but not included. Get a high floor-heard sirens 5 times throughout the night-we were on the 15th floor. If you receive Marriott specials via email-don't automatically delete them! I booked a double bed for SIXTY NINE DOLLARS A NIGHT! Unheard of for downtown. It was such a good deal, I booked 2 rooms for our family and requested they be connected to create a family suite!
