YUM YUM YUM! I went to visit a friend in Chicago and she said we had to try this place out. We were going on a Saturday and we were prepared for a long line, but since it was snowy and cold we thought the line wouldn't be terrible. WRONG. We waited in line for at least 40 min in the freezing cold. We made some friends in the process which made it much more bearable. We wanted to try a little bit of everything so we got the Foie Gras, The Mountain Man, and the Pork and Duck Confit Sausage. And of course we got an order of the duck fat fries. Everything was really really good. I was afraid the blackberry mustard on the Mountain Man would make it too sweet but it was perfect. The Foie Gras was amazing and creamy. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the duck fat fries and regular fries...but those were also good. I was impressed by the seating system they had. They ask you to not sit down until you've actually ordered which works out well because with all the people there everyone is always able to find a table. The staff was really nice and I'm sure they have a sweet job, I saw a sign saying they were closed from Feb14-Mar 2 so business must be good! If you're in Chicago, you need to check this place out but be prepared to wait in line for at least 45 min. And I think you have to be in line by around 3:30 to be guaranteed service. In any case, GO GO GO
