Let me start off by saying the bolognese sauce was very good paired with their home made rigotoni made it just short of an A rating. The pasta was a bit too al dente. The camprese was also very good. However, the bread was obviously sitting uncovered for awhile and it was not soft as in, sat out. The big problem I had was a lack of personal touch here. Their was not a connection to the ownership or a manager welcome at all. The staff was (it appeared) all Mexican which is fine. And even if the owner is Mexican, I'm fine with that but no one from management or owner visited our table. If it's Italian and it's cozy as this restaurant was, make me feel connected to the food, chef/owner or region it comes from. The music wasn't themed to the restaurant which again is fine but it was too loud. When I requested a reduction of the volume "just slightly", he could not honor that. Huh? "We have no way to adjust it. but let me check with the manager". Nothing changed, nor did a manager visit us. It's a byob but when we were looking for our cork, they threw it out. We felt rushed at the end especially when they asked to take our plates 3 times. NO ALREADY. If I was giving you a look, then yes but NO. Overall, it was nice but nice doesn't cut it in Chicago. This city is a culinary mecca with endless choices. You need to do a little bit better and make me fell welcomed and connected with more of a personal touch.
