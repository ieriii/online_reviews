I was really excited to come here since I'm a big lover of Italian food and sharing is even better. I had also heard only great things and so I went with family. Each of us already had something in mind that we wanted to try before going in since people had raved about the place. The restaurant itself is great, perfect atmosphere with an extensive wine list. I really can't complain about anything except for the service. Our server was more than a little opionated and when we went to order she flat us told us not to get things. For example, my friend really wanted to try the risotto and the waitress said absolutley not, it's gummy and the worse thing on the menu. We thought it was strange since many people had suggested it so we said, OK, how about the raviolo. She said the same thing, that she wouldn't recommend it because it wasn't done well there were better things such as the octopus. I don't even like Octopus and that was what we felt like we had to order so we did. The whole experience was a bit tainted because what we really wanted to try we didn't get to and what we got we didn't love not because of the quality but because it wasn't our particular taste. I've worked in many restaurants and know that making recommendations is a great way to be a good server but flat out saying you think something in the restaurant in "bad" and "not done well" is not the way to bring people back. I'll go again because the food that we liked, we loved but warning to anyone who gets this server, still get what you want even if she tells you not to!
