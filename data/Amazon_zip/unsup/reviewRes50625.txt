So I went here tonight to take a friend out for her birthday--seemed like a good choice: great neighborhood, beautiful website, fun menu. We arrived and were seated immediately (we did have reservations). But then the "I'm too good for you" waiter showed up, read off some specials then left us to ourselves for the next 15 or so minutes.  We ordered the potato croquettes and the pulled pork grits thing for appetizers. potato croquettes were fine, but not great. The pulled pork things were tangy and tasty but the execution on the grits was just so-so. I asked what a "Pilau" was and the waiter said--"It just means Pilaf"...which I take to mean American fried rice or Rice-a-Roni. What actually showed up was something more like shrimp and oyster (2--I counted) tomato soup with rice on the side. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good--it was something I'd make at home if I were trying to figure out how to clean out my fridge and I had too many tomatoes, some shrimp, and some oysters. My friend had the Fried Green Tomato BLT which looked impressive, but she ended up eating around the bread which was kind of sweet and voluminous, so she basically ended up with bacon and fried green tomatoes for dinner. And they DO take your plates and silverware super quickly! After all of this, we didn't have the nerve to try the red velvet cake--which looked the wrong color on the table next to ours anyway, so we decided to go down the street to "Taste of Heaven" and share a lovely piece of banana boston creme cake. Big Jones = Big disappointment.
