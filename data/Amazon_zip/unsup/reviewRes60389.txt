The best sushi in Chicago, period. You can try to beat it, and I hesitate to say "for the price" because it seems to convey there are better if you pay a lot more, but I don't think there are. First, a sushi restaurant should be busy to be good, fish spoils, it makes sense. Wakamono always has good traffic and thew sushi is always superb. The take out and dine in are both great. This restaurant and ping pong across the street (same owner) are awesome!
