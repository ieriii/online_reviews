They just got a new manager (same owners) and he is great! The wait staff checks in more and you're seated right away - the cozy environment is now being carried through with the staff:) The food is really good too. I love Indian food and Ethiopian food is close to it with all of its spices and even the serving style. I would recommend also trying their home made honey wine - deeeelish!
