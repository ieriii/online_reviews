My favorite local restaurant. One thing thats great is that they have SOY!!!! I can always get soy shakes and coffee, and in the process support a local business. Sometimes it has been hard for me to find soy around non chain businesses! Staff, ALWAYS ALWAYS the BEST. They are so friendly... that .. even if I WAS in a crap mood, they are just. Like sunshine. And genuine sunshine, not fake customer servicey smiley. They will only make your day happier. The owner always says hello and will pause and have a chat. The two vegetarian sandwiches are delicious; tofu and veggie. Soooo good. Yall just eventually need to get the fish sandwich at this location! :)
