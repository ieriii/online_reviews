Consistent. Delicious. Excellent service. Prices are a little high, but the quality of the food is, too. If it were reinventing crab legs and sushi, I'd give it a 5. It doesn't, but I'd still highly recommend it to anyone for any occasion - business dinner, casual drinks, romantic date, etc. Even though my bf and I were on the way younger side (we are 20s-30s), it was easy to get lost in our own little world in the big cozy booths.
