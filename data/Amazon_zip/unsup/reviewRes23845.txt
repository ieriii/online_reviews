The food was sooo good here. The wait staff very helpful and knowledgeable. Always a good thing to see Asian people coming in to an Asian food place. Prices were reasonable. It was definitely some of the best Chinese food Ive ever tasted. Ambiance could be more, but its all about the food. Definitely worth all of the stars its getting.
