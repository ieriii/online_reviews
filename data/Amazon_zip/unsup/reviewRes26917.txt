This restaurant is a must try if you are visiting Chicago. I was a little surprised to see lots of patrons here that were way under dressed, saw quite a few people with flip flops and t-shirts. I guess its a casual kinda place. We opted for the 5 course tasting menu and since I don't eat red meat and my bf hates fish they were nice enough to replace some of the courses with other items on their menu. Things I enjoyed most from the tasting menu.. Deconstructed Caesar salad seared Alaskan halibut I definitely enjoyed the food here more than Sprout!
