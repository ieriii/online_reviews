The food was 4 stars but this was overshadowed by the wait and service after ordering. Waited for over an hour (longer than we were told). Then the desserts took over 30 minutes (3 churros and a couple of coffees) to arrive. I would only go here again at a completely off peak time when there is no line outside. If you have 3 hours for lunch then this is your place. Otherwise, look elsewhere
