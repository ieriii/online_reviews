Going to Fogo de Chao is at least a 2 hour experience at the dinner table. The phenominal salad bar is enough to keep me going back. Unfortunately, I had to leave room for the meat. Brazilian style (Churrascaria) fire roasted meat, with the amazing seasonings is incredible. Whether I was eating the chicken, sausages, or steak, it was all so good it would be hard to choose which one was best. The cool thing is the way dinner works, get your salads, cheeses, fruits at the salad bar but when you want the main course you will get a family style size bowl of fried bananas and a bowl of potatoes. You get a round card that is red on one side and green on the other. Green side up will bring servers carrying what looks like a sword skewered with meat. Each server has a different meat. And they keep coming until you flip that darn thing over to red. It's a great restaurant with wonderful food and great service. The wines with dinner were as good as the food. We can't wait to go back.
