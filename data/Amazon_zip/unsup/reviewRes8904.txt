Finally tried after hearing so much about it. I liked the pizza a ton, especially the one without the sauce. I would say appetizer selection wasn't my favorite but the salad worked. I felt the price was a bit high as well for what we had. I would say our service was ok nothing above average. Next time take out would be better.
