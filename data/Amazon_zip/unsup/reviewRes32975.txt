This was the first time that we had Ethiopian food and it was a very unique eating experience. I love bread and injera (used to scoop up the food) was no exception. It has a sponge "crepe" feel and tastes mildly sour. We ordered demera massob which allows you to select 3 vegetable and 3 meat samples. There's plenty of food...more than we could finish. We ordered a mix of spicy and mild, that included ye-shimbra assa (spicy chickpeas), kik alicha (mild split yellow peas), ye-beg kikill fitfit (mild lamb), and ye-doro tibs (lemony and hot chicken, although you can order mild too). The waitress was from Ethiopia (at least that's what she implied), very helpful, and provided great service. The visual ambiance appears to be simply authentic to ethnic roots. The jazz musician (who was very good by the way) threw in a bit of an ironic twist. All and all a great evening. I would definitely go back when I have a craving for Ethiopian food!
