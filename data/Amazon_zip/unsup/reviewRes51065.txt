I've been there 5 times this year and it has alwasy been a great experience with great food. We live in Lincoln Park so its out of the way to go here, but its worth it.  If they have fried artichokes, make sure you get those, otherwise go for the Fried green tomtaoes. The porkchop is awesome with with some kind of bacon sauce. I'd say the shrimp and grits is average and the gumbo is above average. I'm not all that into food with andouille spice or whatever it is. Our server is usually kind of odd, but more of an entertaining oddness. Overall, worth working into restaurant rotation for Monday thru Thursday dinner. Just avoid getting too many friend things.
