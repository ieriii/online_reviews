I've had a lot of stuffed pizzas since I've been here and I never liked any of them, I was starting to wonder what the big deal was about Chicago deep dish... In fact when I hear Chicago deep dish it gets on my nerves. I ordered a stuffed pizza w/ italian sausage from here and I must say it made me a huge fan. I wouldn't go as far to say that this is the best pizza place in Chicago, but I certainly like it. Everyone has their own opinions on what great pizza is - this worked for me in particular. The only shitty part of the experience was the 1 hr 15 minute wait and I called to complain and I was rewarded with a free liter of Mountain Dew but I don't drink soft drinks so that was a bust.
