Who can complain about steak on a plate of butter. Yum. Wifey set up a dinner yesterday for our Anniversary...we were hoping we would get 5 star treatment, just like the last time we were there, but I guess with the economy, shops are holding back on freebies. But regardless, the special summer menu definitely hit the spot. It came with a 11 oz filet, Salad or Soup, Side Dish, and Dessert...quite satisfying...and the best part is...it was only $49. The flavor on the steak was excellent...not too much...not too little. Highly recommend it. Plus parking was not an issue on a TH night. Good times.
