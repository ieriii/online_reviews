I've been to Yolk twice so far, and really enjoyed myself. Both times were on weekday mornings (once around 9:00, once on a Friday around 10:00), and we were able to get a table immediately. So it's definitely possible to avoid the long lines and wait. The first time I went, I was a little overwhelmed by the menu. It's not huge (like the novel that is the Cheesecake Factory menu), but everything sounded great and I'm indecisive. The menu is online, so I had a gameplan by the time I walked through the door the second time to avoid getting yelled at by my friends for taking too long to decide. I was impressed with the full-sized sides. One trip I ordered an omelette that included a side of fruit and of pancakes. It was a lot of food, especially for under 10 bucks. Everyone at my table ended up taking at least half of their meal home because we just couldn't eat that much! The food was delivered quickly, and the staff was extremely friendly. This is a good place to take out-of-towners when wandering around downtown. There's a lot of great food to choose from, and is trendy looking enough to impress them without spending too much.
