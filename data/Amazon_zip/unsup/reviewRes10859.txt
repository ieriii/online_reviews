three words: red velvet pancakes This place is a really awesome brunch place that has a different varieties of brunch food. Man this place is delicious and I am still thinking about those red velvet pancakes! They had a not too sweet cream cheese "syrup" on top with crushed pecans that will make you droollll (as i am right now). Anyway, we also got an omelet and the raspberry french toast with chocolate toppings (which was also amazing but a little too sweet). This place iis different, fun and delicious so come check it out!!
