Okay, this place is probably the best thing in the world. Okay, fine. That's hyperbole. This is how good it is, though. My girlfriend and I went to Hot Doug's on a Thursday. The line was about an hour and a half long. We got up to Doug at the counter, and we ordered up five dogs. If I recall correctly, we ordered the famous Foie Gras Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse, and Fleur de Sel; a quarter-pound veal and pork knockwurst; a lamb and pork Loukaniko with olives and goat cheese; a classic Chicago dog; and a sausage made from smoked crayfish and pork. It was glorious. It was so glorious that we went back the next day for more.  The line on the next day was two and a half hours. That Friday, we were able to get the duck-fat fries, which are only available on Fridays and Saturdays. At Doug's suggestion we got his truffle aioli as a sauce for our fries. That time we got two of the foie dogs, a Chicago dog, a corn dog, and IIRC a bratwurst. It was worth it, for sure. There was a British visitor, a sailor, who was in the queue with us the second day. He was incredulous that we would wait in that line two days in a row. We told him to keep the faith, that it was really that good. He came up to me and thanked me for encouraging him to wait. He loved it too! Doug is a great guy too. He even has told his competitors where to get the same sausages he has. He has freely shared this knowledge, and it's out there on the internet. I like that sharing spirit. I think that's what make him share such great food with his customers.
