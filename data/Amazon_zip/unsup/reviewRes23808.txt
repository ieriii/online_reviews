wow, i like it...i'm in pain.  thank you very much finally some real tasting chinese food and jeezus could you make this any spicier? i went here and we had a big group but we got a big table quick luckily and then everyone began to have a line out the door. i didn't look at the menu because someone else ordered. i also didn't pay for anything because someone else paid. but i still put the food in my mouth and i mostly liked it, although it had an underlying colour theme of orange, thank you very much hot chili oil. some people at the other table had hot pot. yum, that looked so good! and a lot less spicy, as it was not orange. next time i'll go and write some better stuff. meanwhile i need to find a bandaid for my tongue.
