My boyfriend and I went for our 4 year anniversary last year (see Open Table review Aug 2010) and loved it so much we went back when we just wanted to have a romantic date night the weekend before Valentine's Day (we don't celebrate Valentine's Day, it just happened to be the same weekend as our tickets to a play). We live in the suburbs and we were running 15 minutes behind for our reservation due to traffic. I called and when we got their they had held our table for us, which is amazing for a "holiday" weekend. The food and service was again amazing! My boyfriend got the Lasagna Di Antonio which was great and I got the Pennette Cardinale which was amazing and ginormous, definitely a plate you could share! If going on a weekend, make a reservation a week out to get your time choice, at least 2 days ahead to get a decent reservation. This place fills up quickly, which is a testament to how good it is. We will of course be going back soon, maybe my birthday next month :)
