Food= 4.5 stars Service= 2 stars Atmosphere=4 stars Long story short, our waitress sucked. The food was excellent- starts off with crispy chips and butter pickles, which were great. The BBQ flight, Shrimp and Lemon Infused-Grits (wow) and ribs- all great. The waitress took our order and didn't reappear until midway through the entrees. Not personable or remotely friendly. You at least get a 'thanks' when the bill gets dropped off at any crappy diner, but not from our server at q. Thankfully the bussers were attentive and friendly.
