First off, I need to note that I have only ordered take-out from Irazu. I've never dined-in. Hopefully dining-in offers a better food experience. I first ordered take-out from here about 8 months ago. I don't even remember what everyone had but I do remember everything being good. I'm writing this review today because of the terrible food I had last night. I don't remember the name of the dish. It was a very flat piece of skirt steak, breaded and fried, covered in two slices of half melted cheese. Rice and beans on the side. The steak was so tough, I literally couldn't get my teeth through most of it. I needed a saw, not a knife to get through that sucker. This is the kind of meat people end up choking on because they can't chew it properly. Beef jerky, anyone? And I really think the presentation of a meal is better with a nice layer of shredded cheese and not two squares lopped off the block and awkwardly arranged on top and half melted. Just my opinion though. The beans were bland but the rice was good.  I'm giving two stars and not one because, as I said, I do remember my first experience being much better.
