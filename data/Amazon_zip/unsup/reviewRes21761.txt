I pretty much go to Superdawg for their fries. They are really simple. There's honestly nothing special about them that I can detect, other than the fact that I love them. They are greasy and some are crunchy and have very little (if any) seasoning. They're great. The hot dogs themselves aren't very impressive. Sure they're jumbo sized and taste good but I think they're a little too salty. Still, I have no issue driving over when I'm in the mood for a late night hot dog and great fries.
