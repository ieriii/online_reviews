Excellent, top of the line authentic Chinese. There is nothing glamorous or glitzy about it, simply exceptional food. Started with egg rolls and pot stickers. The egg rolls were solid, pot stickers were fantastic, the pork was very tasty. The Mongolian beef was amazing; I definitely would double up on this next time.  We also had Tony's three way chicken which was crispy, garlicky and delicious. Veggie fried rice was very good.  The only dish that we really didn't enjoy was the moo shoo chicken, something about the flavor just wasn't appealing. The table next to us was plowing through an order of it though so that might have just been personal preference.  I know many of the negative reviews are for poor service but that was not my experience at all. We sat down right away, attentive servers and we were served quickly. If your looking for authentic Chinese, definitely hit up Lao Sze Chaun.
