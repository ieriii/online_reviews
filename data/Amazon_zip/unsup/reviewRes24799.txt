I love Irazu. Who doesn't love Irazu? Sweet plantain, spicy peppers and avocado are a few key players in their meals and I couldn't be happier to see them on my plate. There are tons of vegetarian options. Try them all before choosing your favorite. Irazu is going to be on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives next week. I'm happy for them but I sure hope this publicity won't change the awesome food and service that i have been enjoying for the last 3 years. LONG LIVE IRAZU!
