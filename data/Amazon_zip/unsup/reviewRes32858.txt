BEST FAUX RUBEN EVER!!!!!! My boyfriend (who is not a vegetarian or vegan) took me, the vegetarian here for my birthday last year. Let me tell you, we were both pleasantly surprised how amazing the food was! You couldn't even tell that what you were eating wasn't real meat! They have mastered the setan! We will be coming back! :)
