A good friend just took me here to celebrate my birthday. I hadn't been since it closed and reopened but wasn't disappointed. The food is still innovative and playful and the atmosphere is still casual but attentive. Food: My favorite dish was the aged risotto flavored with beet and garnished with beet slices and escargot caviar (a new luxury item, the chefs informed us). My least favorite was the single spear of white asparagus (overcooked) served with black garlic and caviar pastes. A good holdover from the pre-closing days was the quail egg ravioli which paired really nicely with vintage champagne.  Service: The chefs are busy but take the time to make you feel welcome. I would have loved to have a menu so I could better remember the components (they kind of blow through the descriptions) but, hey, it keeps you wanting to come back. Otherwise, nothing was ever in want of a refill and after we had finished our meal (and two bottles of champagne) they plied us with red wine from the kitchen until we were afraid to overstay our welcome. One of the chefs even gave his coat and another, his smokes, to a customer sitting across from us. How's that for service. A few tips: Keep trying to get a reservation - I had luck calling on a Tuesday afternoon. As for wine, definitely err on the side of going lighter. The two bottles of champagne worked perfectly with every dish. This is not a place where you want to bring one bottle of cab.
