Once again, my mouth is watering as I'm typing. I dine here about once a month with my co-workers for the lunch buffet and we never leave unsatisfied. I always opt for the lunch buffet as it is very reasonable. The buffet comes with naan (flat bread - perfect for dipping into the sauces/lentils) and a sizzling skillet of chicken tandoori. The buffet has a variety of dishes - I normally fill my plate with: - palak paneer - butter chicken - chicken tikka masala - basmati rice - saffron rice - chicken tandoori - naan Check out the menu for details...http://www.indiahousechicago.com/pdf/Downtown%20Chicago.pdf They also have a salad buffet as well as two dessert items to choose from or try both! I always end the experience with the mango ice cream. The perfect ending to the entire meal.
