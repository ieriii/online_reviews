so, so lovely. It's really that simple. Perfect for dates, small groups of people you really like.  The ambiance is enchanting, almost southern romantic. Grand and comfortable. Elegant. Wonderful service. I liked everyone's style. (The gentleman at the door rocked a white sports coat, and I tip my hat to him. The server was comfortable in her presentation and in conversation.) The drinks are so good, you'll hum as you sip. I dream of the Gilded Cages. (Pardon if that seems a touch scandalous.) The drink snobs of my group seemed to melt into their giant chairs. Relief and happiness overtaking them. Finally, they found a place where they didn't feel the need share critiques.
