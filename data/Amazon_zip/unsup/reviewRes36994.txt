To me all alcohol taste the same. I mean I get there are small differences, but gin, tequila, and vodka all burn in the same way to me. Similarly, all beers taste the same too. My friend wanted to change that, so we came here so that I could try a fancy one. I tried the Delirium, which was delicious and also the strongest beer that I've ever had. The rest of our group tried a few other types, but mine was the best, and now I finally understand what it means for a beer to have "hops."
