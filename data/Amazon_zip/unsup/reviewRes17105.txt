Yes, you do have to wait in line for a spot. This not your typical bar scene. I like the fact it's not overcrowded and smoky. It's more about atmosphere, music, and a great drink. Don't expect it to be a hook up place. In fact, bring your favorite person to talk to, listen to music, and relax in huge blue chairs.
