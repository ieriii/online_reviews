Wow. Great atmosphere, casual yet nice! The prices were reasonable. The service was BEYOND good. Now for the part you have been waiting for: How was the food? Woa. Out -of- this-world fresh and delicious! I highly recommend the appetizer of calamari and octopus. My husband could not stop salivating and talking about how great their pizza bread was. (Not cool when you are low-carbin' it.) Coming back is not a question. Will they get sick of seeing us?  Now that is the REAL question. ****Update**** I started having calamari withdrawls, so we made reservations for Valentine's day. They actually had a table ready for us on time! Whooo whooo! And, the fresh rose from Phillips was a nice unexpected touch.  We are SO going to set up camp and move into the Calo.
