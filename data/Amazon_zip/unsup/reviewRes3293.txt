Hyeah. Like Harold left his Chicken Shack # 23 and took 2 weeks vacay in Korea to see what Asian BBQ is all about. He then came back with KBQFC - Korean B'Cue Fried Chicken. Some smart U of C student on the south side (probably Asian...probably Korean) visits and steals recipe after one night of drinking (probably not a whole lot, cuz he's Asian) and visit to Harold's #23. Years pass. U of C student gets his degree, he's smart, opens restaurant in Lincoln Park. There's no Harold's in Lincoln Park. But wait, there's no fried chicken in Lincoln Park either. Idea - Crisp. Korean fried chicken. K...F...C - we just bit on your name dog, and make way better fried chicken. Now what. Plus they got a plasma. Smart idea - also give the peeps Bi Bim Bap and other Korean dishes. Now you have something special on Broadway - albeit a little too close to Flub a Dub Chubs. Tough call. The Buddha Bowl rocks, the chicken rocks (all 3 flavors). My man who stole from Harold - you rock too.  No rest for the Asian weary.
