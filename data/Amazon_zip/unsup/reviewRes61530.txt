We were surprised to have been eagerly roped into a pop trivia game upon walking in. Despite our team loosing badly, the food was good. Far better food than you'd expect from the neighborhood, but also smaller portions than you'd expect for the price. It's a non pretentious bar with video games and two tvs. That's all I've got to say about that.
