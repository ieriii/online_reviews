Easy to get into if you're early (I don't like lines so we got there before it opens...) My fianc had the chocolate & banana pancakes... I don't remember what I got. I just know I should have got that (or split it with him). It's all I ate anyways... Gimmicky breakfast but it was amazing. I will be back to order those pancakes all for myself.
