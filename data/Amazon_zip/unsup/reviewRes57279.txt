Bad Apple has a HUGE beer menu with lots of craft beers you dont find anywhere else, and many are very reasonable - $5 but they have some serious specialty beers too. Our server knew a lot about the beers, which was helpful as the beer list is really almost overwhelming! The burgers get all the press here, but I am addicted to their ham sandwiches - this is ham like mom makes at Easter - off the bone! no deli meat for Bad Apple. Delish fries too. The front room has a nice casual atmosphere, the back room is more casual and has a shuffle board and board games.
