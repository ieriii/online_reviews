This is going to sound funny but I loved the salad bar here! I actually went back twice. They have a great selection of high quality foods. The meats are good too and the plantains were scrumptious. I can't see myself going back again as I am not a big steak lover but it was a good experience overall. I didn't really like the ambience very much though...too much of a cafeteria look.
