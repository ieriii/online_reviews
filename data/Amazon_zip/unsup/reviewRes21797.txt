I've lived in Chicago all my life and I've eaten EVERY hot dog between Big Al's in Glencoe to Hindsdale's Shell station on Ogden.    None of them compares to Superdawg.    Their hot dog is simply the best.   It's tasty, consistent and always satisfying. The meat used is really great and doesn't need the embellishment of the stereotypical Chicago garnish. When you order, just ask for mustard, onion and relish.    Simple.    And don't ask for ketchup. Save that for airport dogs. Or New York.   What about the Supercheesies and other offerings?    I never tried them. I never felt the need. The Superdawg, and the accompanying fries are so good, I never wanted anything else on the menu apart from a strawberry milkshake ( which is really good too ).   What's the best hot dog in Chicago? Portillo's? Wolfy's? Mustard's Last Stand? Hot Doug's?   Superdawg.
