I went here and had the 14 course tasting menu. Overall I ate some of the best food I've ever had. There were maybe two courses, that while good, were a bit of a letdown compared to the other courses. There were also two courses that were absolute perfection. The Caesar salad course ruined all other Caesar salads for the rest of my life and the steak and eggs course was amazing. And I don't usually like eggs. Overall, it was an excellent dining experience with an unusual and unique style to the food.
