So I would have given this place 4 stars but some of the prices are just too high. I have been coming here off and on for a few years now because I live close by. Don't get me wrong, I really like the food here, its delicious, but as this place has climbed in popularity, so have the prices. Some of the menu items are not worth the price. My favorite entree comes with white rice, beans, and three plantain wedges...and the price has increase by $2. Yes, I know that isn't a lot of money, however, now my single entree is an easy $20 when you calculate the tax and tip. My friend noticed a price increase in her entree as well. Maybe they could come up with some weekday deals? I will REALLY have to be craving 90 miles for me to come back here...
