My friend Andrew visited me from Virginia last week. He wanted to have a great meal here in Chicago. The girlfriend pressured me to take him to some fancy downtown restaurant, as that's what tourists expect, but thankfully I decided to go with bonsoiree instead. We had 13 courses of perfection. Since we were having the 13 course meal, the chef, Shin, was our server for the evening. We asked Chris (our waiter from last time) if he could help us with our wine pairings for the meal. He went above and beyond our expectations. We had brought 5 bottles of wine from Cellar Rat (recommended on bonsoiree's website), and he paired each of them perfectly with the dishes. We took up a lot of his time with our questions and praises, during which he was always appropriately attentive and professional. The taste, presentation, and wine-pairing (pinot noir) of the smoked baby octopus was spot-on; I'd have to say it was my favorite of the night. Our meal clocked in at about 4.5 - 5 hours, but it didn't feel like it was that long at all.
