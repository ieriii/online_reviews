50% of the stars earned is due to (surprisingly?) reasonable prices at the bar here, and the other 50% is for the late night menu. An amaretto sour was only $5. (A blueberry vodka/sprite was $8, which was priced more like I was expecting, but that's okay because I somehow got an extra $5 in change with my first drink. Haha.) The sweet potato fries on the 11pm-1am menu were tasty and served up with bbq sauce. It took a while for them to arrive, but they were served piping hot. On the downside, parking is next to impossible in this area. You might just consider parking on one of those residential streets that require a permit and hope you don't get ticketed. Also, when the upper and downstairs levels get packed, it gets super loud. And alas, the staff is flighty. Good luck snagging their attention if you need something.
