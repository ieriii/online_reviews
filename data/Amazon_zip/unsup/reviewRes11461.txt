We went here a couple of weeks ago. I ordered eggs benedict which was the standard benedict. It was good and the hollandaise sauce was better than most. We all split the caramel cream pancakes (I think) which were stuffed with pretzel crumbs. It's a pretty interesting idea and that was more of a dish to be shared as a dessert. The coffee was way too strong. Restaurants should always stick with a medium blend and not french roast on crack. The service was good and unrushed perhaps because they were not in need of additional tables. The thing that bugs me is the high prices. Charging $13 for eggs benedict is too high. I would expect to pay that in a nice hotel not in a neighborhood spot. Coffee is $2.75 a cup and because of its strength you really avoid getting a refill. If you do, just one. Great racket guys! Paying $62 for brunch for 4 people without champagne or a bloody mary is not my thing so I probably would not go back. At least if I have to pay the bill again. I'm unsure if M-F breakfast is the same price as brunch. 3.5 stars for food 1 star for high prices 3 stars for decent service.
