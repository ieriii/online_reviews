My girlfriend and I have been here a few times now and have had a great experience everytime. The food has been delicious, the service satisfactory if not great and the ambience quaint and friendly. The menu is filled with delicious twists on some familiar dishes. The salads are fresh and delicious and the pastas are always cooked perfectly al dente with very flavorful sauces. The onion tarte amuse bouche that comes complimentary after use sit down is also a fantastic bonus.If you are looking for a great dining experience Anteprima will not disappoint.
