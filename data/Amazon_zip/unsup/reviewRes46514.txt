Walked down to RJ Grunts planning to get take-out, when I arrived the hostess directed me to the bartender. After waiting for 15-20 minutes or so to get the bartenders attention (the bar was busy but not packed), I inquired about the fish tacos that are their menu online but not in the store. Nastily she informed me they are on longer on the menu, I then looked over the menu thinking I would order something different. After a few more snotty remarks from the bartender when I asked about other items, she then disappeared. I then decided just to leave without any take-out, and having waited a good amount time just trying to place my order. RJ Grunts should not advertise doing take-out, if they don't want to do it. I am not sure if the staff is supposed to be rude, but it was a very disappointing experience. I will not be returning.
