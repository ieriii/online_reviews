This is the most amazing place in the world!! As an out-of-towner, it was difficult to find...even with the tips from other reviewers. It's definitely hidden, but I think it adds to the feeling of being there. It's a great way to escape anything and everything else going on in your life. The minute you walk through the huge velvet curtains separating the relaxing atmosphere from the line of impatient people waiting to get in, all of your worries float away. Sit at the bar if possible, which is only likely if you go really early in the evening. The mixologists behind the bar are incredibly knowledgeable and willing to help you make your decisions. The bartender the night we were there made us feel really special, and like we were the only people in the whole place. Watching them grind ingredients, break the ice, and mix up the concoction is just as much fun as the drink itself. We came in a group of four, but there were only two bar seats available. The two of us at the bar kept watching for people to leave so the rest of our party could join us. The host staff went above and beyond my expectations to grant our wishes. They were incredibly patient and helpful! The decor and drinks were truly phenomenal, but it was really the staff that made my experience at Violet Hour one to remember.
