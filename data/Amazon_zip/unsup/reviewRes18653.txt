Greats beers and burgers on par with Kuma Korner? These were reviews were too pass on, so the wife and I walked down Lincoln to the Bad Apple on a Friday night. That may of been our first mistake. While the hostess was attentive to sitting people at tables, we didn't want to share meal with strangers at the "community tables". We opted to wait for the bar. We were able to get a seat for about twenty minutes- we found the wait for the bar a bit disorganized- people who had arrived after us were jumping into available seats that were closer to where they had been waiting. The menu told the rest of the story- amazing beer list! Dortmunder gold on tap? YES. The rest of the beers were also very painstakingly chosen. I had several, and they were all delicious. The food? Totally underwhelming. The menu was completely uninspiring. I was hoping for toppings that transcended the usual choices of blue cheese and sauteed mushrooms. I forged ahead and relied on the quality of the meat (rumored to be mixed by some fancy-ass butcher). I ordered it as rare as they could possibly serve it, and it came out super well-done. Not to be daunted, I sent it back, to get a second, super-greasy, medium-well burger. Oh well. Soooo.... Go for a beer, probably on a week night, but if you want amazing burger, you're still gonna have to brave the lines at Kuma... or better yet, cut across the street to Jury's.
