Usually my husband and I will get carry out salt chicken and BBQ pork from the front counter for the past two years. Two days ago we decided to eat in with two friends. We got the multi-course Peking duck special (daikon radish appetizer, Peking duck, duck soup, fried rice and mango/raspberry sorbets), a plate of garlic water spinach, and two fried soft shell crabs. The food was excellent and there was enough food for some leftovers.
