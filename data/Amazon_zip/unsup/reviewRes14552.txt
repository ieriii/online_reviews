eh. not sure why this place is getting such great reviews - you have to wait forever to get a table (it's crowded even at the bar area) - we went at 8 PM on a Friday night and probably got seated around 9:30, the beer is so-so (if they even have the beer that you want to try when you get there - they happened to be completely out of a couple of their beers), and it was soooooo hot. It was one of the first "nice" nights of the spring/summer so they had the windows facing the street open, and it was unbelievably stuffy towards the back of the place. It's not pleasant when you're trying to have a good time and all you can smell is the body odor of somebody sweating nearby. No thanks.  Tried the bacon fat popcorn since it was all the rage on yelp (and I love all things bacon) - and maybe it was all the hype, but i was a little disappointed. It's basically popcorn with bacon and parmesan cheese on top. Sure the popcorn has a faint hint of bacon flavor to it, but it just wasn't as good as I had expected it to be.  Maybe if I lived in the area I would come back - the burgers looked pretty good and I do want to try their pizzas, but it's not worth the drive for me. At least parking was easy enough to find on Milwaukee (only need to pay till 9 PM)
