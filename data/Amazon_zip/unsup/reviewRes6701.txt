As the Depeche Mode song goes, I just can't get enough. Came back to Chicago Q for a dinner with a few co-workers. They were as blown away by this place as I was the first time I came here. I love that Chicago Q is very consistent with its great service and amazing food. I cannot stop thinking about the poblano corn bread. oh my goodness, just...why can't I eat it every day? I had a chance to try the Southern Belle drink this time around, and it was dangerously good. Woo boy. I could just keep going on and on about how much I love this place. Get the bruleed mac and cheese! Why are you still reading this and not stuffing your face with bbq?!
