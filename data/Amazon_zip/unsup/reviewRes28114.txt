The food was so freaking unbelievable that I give GE 5 stars despite a few flaws! We had the 5-course tasting menu and it was really a great experience. The Pros: The service! Really spectacular. Perfectly accommodating to food allergies. The white tuna sashimi The Garlic Marshmellow in the corn soup The smoked eggplant on the halibut The Balsamic Sorbet The Root beer BBQ sauce The Delectable wine pairings with every course Birthday candle for my friend's birthday The cons: Cold soup Tacky T-shirts that the waiter's wear Food courses moved a little too fast I'll definitely be back again and again. Almost perfection!
