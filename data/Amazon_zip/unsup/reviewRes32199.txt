I have heard amazing things about the Chicago Diner but last night was finally my first time eating there. I love huge selection of fun Veggie and Vegan dishes. I had the "Chickin" ranch sandwich on toasted marble rye..yummy. And my boyfriend who is a major meat eater loved the saitan Rubin. We will be back for sure to try the carrot cake and to try some more funky healthy food.
