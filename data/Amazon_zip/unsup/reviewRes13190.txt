I visited soon after returning from the West coast, so.. you might like to move onto a review from someone else in Chicago, my review won't be gleaming. As far as Clam chowder goes, it was potato soup to me. Not enough pieces of clam or anything from the Sea to make me believe it was anything but potato soup. Very hearty, tons of cream and lots of potato chunks. Wanted to try their Cioppino but opted for the Seafood pot pie instead. Shared with another, we both stopped in to satisfy a craving for a place we'd both heard so much about. Both leaving with completely different views. The pot pie ($20) looked fantastic, everyone I show the photo to always compliments and wonders about its taste. It was a step better than the clam chowder is all I can think of. A few more bits of seafood though still not anything different. Alike the chowder it had a ton of cream and many chunks of potato. A person sensitive to lactose should not choose any of these dishes, I regret to say I did not inquire with our waiter. It affected me greatly, in a bad way, I left running home quickly. (LoL, I laugh now, but it wasn't funny that day) We stopped in on a late weekday afternoon, during the lazy which occurs just before the dinner rush. Waitstaff was there for the order taking and first course but after that, very hard to locate. It wasn't busy, we were one of three tables. While I wasn't impressed with the food, I wonder what their other dishes could be like. Specifically some fried fish or baked seafood, so, I think I might go back.  The atmosphere is of a neighborhood diner. Menu is expansive trying to satiate the tastes of any that enter their doors. So while your company might be lookin to satisfy their fishy cravings, you can get your eat on something else like a hamburger, sandwich or maybe some cereal.
