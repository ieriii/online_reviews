The name of this restaurant says it all. The menu and pizza is inspired by the city of Naples. I would like to go back and try the Margarita Pizza because I am a vegetarian. My people I was with enjoy eating meat, so we ordered the Italian Sausage Pizza that had spinach and broccoli on it. They could do a bit of a better job shredding the spinach and cutting the broccoli before it is topped on the pizza; it was a little tough to bite or cut through. However, the taste was delicious. Don't expect that all fried food is hot. The fried eggplant appetizer came out almost completely opposite of what I had imagined. It was a cold pile of sloppy "eggplant mush" accompanied by a plate of four slices of bread that were drizzled with a small amount of olive oil. I wouldn't order that again. Spacca Napoli has a nice dessert menu. The tirmasu and tartufano are delicious. I ordered both of them and give them each a five star rating! If you are very hungry and looking to cure a massive hunger pain, then do not go to Spacca Napoli. If you have a taste for some Sicilian pizza and a nice glass of wine and some delicious dessert then this is definitely the place you're looking for!
