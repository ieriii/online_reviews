We went here on a weekend evening and were delighted by the innovative, almost-whimsical cooking. Our experience began by quickly finding a parking space on the street (some of the reviews indicate that street parking is difficult, but we didn't find that to be an issue). Unless we missed it, the restaurant entrance doesn't have signage, but we walked in anyway. The restaurant is tiny (I've seen college dorm rooms that might be bigger), but we were seated in the back garden/patio area which was, compared to the indoor dining area, spacious. Our server was helpful, efficient and friendly. The restaurant is BYOB and on the evening that we went we had arranged for one of the wine stores that is mentioned on Bonsoiree's web page for delivery of a couple of bottles. The bottles were waiting for us at the restaurant, the bottle of white was chilling and we were ready to go. On the evening that we went, there wasn't a menu, but, rather a 6-course tasting. Individual tasting portions are small, but, they add up and we we were stuffed when we walked out. Three of the six courses were served on "plates" shaped like hollowed-out logs and married a protein with both a starch and a vegetable (a couple of which I had never heard of). Combinations were unusual, but attractively presented and well thought out. We enjoyed the scallop opener and the fourth course, a braised short rib, a lot. We would definitely go back.
