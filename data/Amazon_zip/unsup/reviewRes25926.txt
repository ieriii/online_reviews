My husband and I visited Geja's for the first time tonight in celebration of our one year wedding anniversary. Luckily we has a coupon for $25 of because whoo boy was it expensive! I imagine a lot of what you are paying for is the ambiance -- which is very romantic with dim lighting and beautifully artistic surroundings. We had planned to bring a bottle of our wedding wine to share over dinner, but decided against it when told of the $15 "corkage fee" and got a couple of glasses of red sangria for about the same price and saved the wine for later. The sangria was solid and fruity. If we were to go back I think we would stick to the cheese & chocolate dinner (which were definitely the highlights of the evening) and skip the "premium" with the meat. While the meat wasn't bad at all, it wasn't needed. If you are hungry for more, though, the vegetables were delicious (especially the broccoli strangely enough). Overall it was a lovely romantic evening with delicious food and quiet ambiance, and we certainly paid for it.
