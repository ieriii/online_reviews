I came here for lunch because I work in the area after seeing it on Yelp. Tried the Chicken and Dumplings. The dish was broth based versus the traditionally creamy dish I'm accustomed to. It was pretty decent. A little heavy on the pepper in my opinion. The portion was "just enough" but overvalued for the $13/14 I paid for the dish. The corn bread muffins were delish. I was raised in a house with a chef from the south so I know what corn bread is supposed to taste like. This def wasn't it but was pretty tasty nevertheless. I was kind of surprised I was expected to pay $3 for for the additional muffins I requested after I finished the 2 that my server brought out for free but whatever. I was disappointed that the fried chicken took 20 minutes else I would have gotten that so I could try more from this place with the brunch special. Would I come here again? Maybe. I'm a HUGE southern food fan but this just wasn't making me feel like I was eating what I'd call southern but some northern imitation of my Alabama roots. I'm not a huge fan but maybe I needed to have a drink. That reminds me, I don't even remember seeing sweet tea on their menu!
