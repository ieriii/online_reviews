-"Who's Zed" -"Zed's dead, lemon pie... Zed's dead" Well not the Zed I know on Clark street. Zed is very much alive in Chicago! I'll keep this short, just like my visit to Zed451. I went for a networking event that I didn't know was a networking event, so you can imagine how out of my comfort zone I could have felt... but I didn't. One Yelper described Zed451 as rustic with a modern flare.... right on! A Zed451 blogger, who I am assuming is one of their staff members, describes it as warm and comfortable with a highly stylized edge. Well Jamie the blogger, you didn't overdose on giner soy reduction when you wrote your blog. Also right on! I particularly liked the vanilla glazed apricots and the pears... and no I wouldn't normally describe myself as fruity. The event I was at featured mostly light fare so I didn't get to dabble in some of the meatier selections Zed is known for, but I'll definately be back.  My friend had their white peach sangria and said it was delish, although light on the alcohol. They have beer too so no worries. So Zed, if i decide to show up with a blow torch and a pair of plyers do you think you'll be able to handle me? I hope so, cuz theres a 5th star in it for you if you do!
