I have gone for brunch a few times at Big Jones. It is the perfect brunch place. First, the space is bright and cheery and spacious. The tables are spaced so that you are not to packed in with your neighbor but there still is a cozy buzz to the place. Second, they serve you biegnets like they do bread and olive oil in an Italian restaurant -- Free! Finally, the menu is exhaustive and covers everything from french toast to fried green tomatoes. I had a fried egg sandwich the first time, coconut pancakes the second time, and a fried green tomato BLT the third time.  There is literally something for everyone on this menu. I highly recommend anything that has bacon. They do bacon right!
