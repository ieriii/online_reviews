I don't need to tell you how awesome Hot Doug's is, because you already know. Even if you have never been there, you already know. The place has been reviewed over 1500 times, and I really don't think I need to throw my two-cents in. So... details that are good to know: I went on a Wednesday in March, and only waited in line for about 15 minutes. You can ONLY get duck fat fries on Friday and Saturday. Cash only, of course. That's it. Just go, go and enjoy.
