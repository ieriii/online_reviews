The atmosphere is great. This may be the only place that I have been to where the atmosphere could have offset bad food. Fortunately, the food was also really good. The margaritas and mojitas were especially tasty. I got the churrasco which was very good especially with the sauces it had but I wish it was a little bigger. Our waiter was also very helpful and kind. Overall, it was a very good experience. I plan on returning.
