We went there with good friends at 6pm on a Saturday night. There was an open table and we were told that they were keeping it open in case a larger party showed up. We waited and watched. The table stayed empty for the entire time we waited for a smaller table. The host and and the manager were two of the most obnoxious people EVER. Arrogant and rude doesn't cut it in the restaurant business.AWFUL. AWFUL. AWFUL.
