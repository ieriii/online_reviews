I wish I could re-do all of my previous restaurant reviews, since everything pales in comparison to Shaw's now. I had Lobster Thermador, which is delicious yet very rich... (My server said it came with a side of Lipitor!) My husband had the Tuna Steak, also exemplary, and the seafood gumbo was amazing. I recommend passing on the calamari in favor of the soup.
