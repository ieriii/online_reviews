Went in here to grab a late night dinner on a Sunday around 10pm and it felt like I walked into a circus. The entire staff was shitfaced - everyone was screaming, singing, and doing shots. I felt like I was in bizarro world. I don't know why we waited around but we eventually (after 15 minutes of the weirdest people watching I've ever seen) ordered food to go. We waited 25 minutes for our burgers and got the hell out of there.
