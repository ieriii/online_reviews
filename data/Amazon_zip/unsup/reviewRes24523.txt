I understand why people would like this place, I do. But for me it was too rich and salty. The richness of the food is obviously Mercat's tapas style, lots of bold flavors, lots of butter, lots of oil, lots of cheese- lots of saturated fat. It's fairly creative, slightly above average execution and technique- however nothing earth shattering. My gripe is that they dress the food up so much you can't actually taste the food- you mostly taste sauces, my tongue was saturated with salt. Okay enough about the salt, if you're into heavier, richer flavors with small plates, you'll probably enjoy it. Plus the libations were great, the mixologist behind the bar was an ace. I thought it was good enough, I probably won't go back.
