I ate Nemo's friends and I liked it. This place has always been one of my go to restaurants. Generally, I like to hang my hat in the oyster bar. I like that old lounge vibe they've got going. The oysters here are really good but even more surprising is the sushi. Nice selection, very fresh and tasty and they don't rely on a lot of the heavy mayo based sauces that a lot of other places do. I also have to recommend the cold sampler (two types of crab, oysters and huge shrimp). Why make up your mind when you can have it all? My last time here I had the horseradish encrusted halibut. How they put those two things together successfully, I'll never know. Kudos Shaw's. My only real disappointment here was the Peach martini. Usually, I really like their martinis but this one was overly sweet and lacking of the 'bite' a good martini should have. That martini is either deadly or basically non-alcoholic. I'm guessing the latter. That's ok, I like champagne w/ my shellfish anyway.  Price can be a little prohibitive here. For 3 people we dropped A LOT of money. How much? Well lets just say it starts with 5 and ends with 00. Granted that included 3 courses, sushi and pre and post dinner martini. Less splurge-tastic diners could do up Shaw's for much less.
