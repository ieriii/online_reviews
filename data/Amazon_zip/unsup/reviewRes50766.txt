Big Jones is a true neighborhood gem. The food is amazing and the staff is so warm and inviting. I always feel at home in at Big Jones. I have hosted birthdays, Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, Easter and anniversaries here and have NEVER been disappointed. Definitely a great spot for brunch and dinner. A Chicago must.
