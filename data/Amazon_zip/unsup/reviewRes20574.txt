Been here twice now. Once for a sit down meal and once for an after dinner dessert. Both times, still pretty impressed with the food! First time was for dinner. Even though there was a wait, it was totally worth it. The ordering/seating experience isn't exactly the normal get-to-the-restaurant-and-put-your-name-on-the-list. Instead, you get in line and make your way to the counter to order. But before they let you order, they have to make sure there is a table for you. So you wait in line to order before you get to sit down. So in our case, we waited in line for about an hour before we got to order/sit down. But totally worth it! I ended up getting the Short-Rib Chile Soup. Which was pretty damn good. The meat was succulent (don't get to use that word all that often) and everything was exquisitely spiced, maybe even a little too much so. I did think it was a little too salty but that can be easily fixed by order a side to go with it next time. The other people in my group had tortas and were raving about them. We also had the churros and the homemade vanilla ice cream for dessert. Yummy! And their hot chocolate is made with real drinking chocolate. Also delicious! I ended up going back a couple of weeks later when a couple of friends from out of town were in town. We'd already had dinner and needed some after dinner dessert and coffee so churros and ice cream sounded good. And it was! This place is great for a full blown meal (even if you have to wait) or just for an after dinner dessert stop. I'll definitely be back!
