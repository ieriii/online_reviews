Good burger, crispy fries (apparently they read the reviews). Great beer collection. Got in without much of a wait. Really friendly waiter.  Don't know of I'd make a special trip there or go back, as there are a number of other places that have great burgers and beer. Would stop in if I were in the area, but wouldn't make it a destination, if you know what I mean.
