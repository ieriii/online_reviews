I've been coming here for a few years now when in town (now live here) and the crepes have become much much smaller and the same price. I remember when I had to split a crepe, but now one crepe doesn't fill one up. A crepe there is the equivalent to a pita wrap across the street at Taste of Lebenon! However the crepe will set you back about $12! Food is still good, just overpriced and not worth it at all.
