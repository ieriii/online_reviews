This place is as good as everyone says but, I have also used their catering services so, I'm going to review that. We ordered a variety of food for a brunch the day after a wedding I corrdinated. The food was wonderful and still inexpensive. The services was prompt and the guys even stayed to make sure we got the hang of assembling pitas. Would recommend to anyone looking for a fun, cheap way to cater a party.
