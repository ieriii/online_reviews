Hubby and I walked here while in Chicago for a night last week. We knew we had to try it, as we've heard the hype from friends and family. First impression--woah!--there was a long line of patrons waiting outside to be seated! However, we were able to bypass much of the wait by speaking up as the bartender walked through the line, telling us there were two open seats at the bar...yes! We split a side house salad and small pepperoni pizza. I would definitely recommend ordering ASAP as the bartender advised (especially if you're hungry!) since the pizza takes 45-55 minutes. It was definitely worth the wait...hot & gooey! The crust was nice and buttery; I was a little hesitant seeing the amount of sauce slathered on top of our pie (since I'm not much of a red-sauce fan), but I was impressed was fresh, chunky, and had great flavor! Definitely worth the trip!
