I was totally disappointed! I think all of the hype about this place led to some crazy expectations about how I would be blown away by the wine/cheese/food... Ordered the Syrah flight - could really only stomach 1 of them (couldn't even really tell you which one it was) and the rest tasted...leathery. I think they actually use the word leathery in the description for one of the wines. Oh well, it just wasn't what I thought it would be. Tried the cheddar cheese flight and it was good? But I also could do without - actually I think I've hit my cheese quota for the month after eating there. I think the most disappointing thing was their teensy entree menu. Nothing looked that appealing since there weren't too many options to choose from. This place is good for a quick happy hour type of thing, but for a real meal I'd much rather go somewhere else. Btw, if you valet park be prepared to wait FOREVER because these guys also valet for the House of Blues.
