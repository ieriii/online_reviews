wow, had an incredible dinner here this past weekend. compared to capital grille, morton's, lawry's (which doesn't quite count), and N9NE, Mastro's really shines. the service is on point, with a somewhat laid back vibe, albeit in a very classy atmosphere. timing of the food very good, but we had a 930p reservation, so many of the guests had already received their food. our table all had the bone-in filet, which was perfectly cooked. we split amongst the table the lobster mashed potatoes, roasted brussel sprouts, and black truffle gnocchi. a little overboard on the carbs, but the flavors were well worth it. the maitre'd was kind enough to allow us to set up some special props as a surprise for the birthday girl (which i know they weren't too happy about haha), so extra points on the service there, as our birthday girl was very happy. all in all, the great food coupled with the cozy atmosphere and live piano band summed up to a wonderful night out.
