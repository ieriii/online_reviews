This place is the perfect Saturday lunch spot. I have been here a three or four times and all were great experiences! The first time I stopped in, there was a 5 minute wait. While we were waiting for our table, the host poured us a glass of champaigne to drink while we waiting--and it was the good stuff! I felt like such a Very Important Person! Props to Spacca for making me feel like VIP :) The pizza was very good, though I kind of felt as though they could have thrown a few more ingredients on the pies. Their anti-pasta dishes and appetizers are really yummy, but perhaps a little overpriced. Overall, this place has great charm--the decor is simple and clean, the atmosphere is relaxing, and I love that it is filled with natural sunlight.
