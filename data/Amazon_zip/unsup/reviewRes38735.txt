good stuff, but maybe i shouldn't be eating all that cheese the day before an airplane flight? oh, did i tell you i was lactose intolerant? nevertheless, the crust was very tasty...i could even eat the crust, and leave the rest of the pizza for you non-lactose intolerant people. but just tell me why, if the place is darn near empty, you choose to seat me right by the busboy area? what's the point of that? nothing against these guys, but really? how about some peace and quiet? having to stare at these guys, and the other lone diner a table away, polishing off a whole pizza, while having a conversation with himself? it just started making me wonder if that was gonna be me in about 15 years....muy depressing.....
