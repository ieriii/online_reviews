My cousin and I were thirsty and it was a Friday night. This is one of her go-to places, so we walked down a few blocks from her house to Wilde. Super cozy interior. From reading other reviews it sounds like the food was actually quite good (we didn't order any), so we will have to come here again for dinner. I was immediately impressed that they had Half Acre Daisycutter on tap, and had Delirium Noctournm and Tremens on their beer list. Be still, my heart! I opted for the Daisycutter that night, because I'm a cheap bastard, but I will definitely make a mental note to come back here for the Delirium. We stayed til midnight and had a good time. I will definitely be back here for more beer and more food!
