I wish I could comment on the food, because man, I am dying to get in here. However, I've been having nothing but trouble.  My original reservation was back in July and was canceled two hours before. Not a huge deal, because I knew that Schwa has been known to cancel, and I was able to reschedule and make other plans. Fast forward to reservation number two. I'm on my way to Schwa, about the exit the highway (45 minutes before dinner),and I get a call that my reservation has been cancelled for the same reasons as before (which, originally, were due to the heat. Who knows what the reason was this time). I was told to call and reschedule, but of course, it's impossible to get through. And so, I'm faced with the conundrum of still wanting to go but also not wanting to go through the process again. I guess fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice...
