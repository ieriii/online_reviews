We stayed here for a few days during a recent staycation. The room we had was fantastic. There was a river view with an actual "river view" ( Marina City and Trump Tower were my neighbors, sort of speak). There was a spacious bathroom, a very comfortable King size bed and a small couch. There was a huge executive style desk in there as well with wifi.Very well maintained, and the staff was efficient and courteous. The cleaning staff always asked if we needed anything before leaving for the day. Location is perfect for checking out museums ( CTA # 10 and #146 right across the street) and the Mag Mile. A Corner Bakery is just steps from the hotel and a great option to go for breakfast al fresco during the summer. I will definitely return.
