I wish there were more stars because I would give them all to Sushi X. By far my favorite place in the city. The only place that I recommend to people looking for great sushi. It is a small place but if you want some delicious rolls and you want to BYOB this is the spot! Must haves Honey Red Dragon Maui Wowi
