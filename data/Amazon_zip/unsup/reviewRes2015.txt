Hot Doug's is the BOMB! In a city known for its sausage, Hot Doug's is definitely the KING! They take the hot dog to another level - and you can have yours steamed, grilled, deep fried - I like choices, and they definitely offer you choices.... So many unique options for different types of sausage available, all garnished with the perfect condiments - DELICIOUS! Go on a weekday at an off-time, and you are sure to get in with less of a line... Doug himself is a cool guy - Kudos to him!! BEST IN THE CITY!!! Highly recommended!
