It's simple, this place is great! I discovered it after an article in the Red Eye and have been going back ever since. I've never had a thing there that hasn't been excellent....and I've tasted probably half the menu if not more by now. The green bean salad is very tasty and a good app if you want something light. The pizza bread is well, just that, pizza bread. But good if you are starving and need something more filling. My fav app though is the bruschetta, and make sure to get it with the whole mozzarella on top. It's some of the best I've had. As for entrees, I think the two I've enjoyed most are the gnocchi with asiago & pesto in a creamy tomato sauce and then the porcini mushroom pasta dish. If you like mushrooms that dish is amazing. The service is above par by my standards. The servers are very familiar with the menu and always willing to offer suggestions or help you figure out a dish that will suite what you are in the mood for. And really, the cherry on top is that it's a BYOB. So bring an extra bottle because chances are, you'll end up sitting there longer then planned! It's just an overall enjoyable experience.
