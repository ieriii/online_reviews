A few years back, fusion restaurants were opening like crazy and were all the rage - Indie Cafe was the best of its genre and is still around because of this. The mix of Thai and Japanese food is excellent. The sushi is stellar and the thai food elegantly and deliciously prepared. Also, for anyone that likes squash curry - this is the only place in town that has it. It's a little light on the squash, but is uber tasty. The atmosphere is cozy and stylish.
