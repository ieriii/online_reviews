I came here for lunch/brunch last weekend at exactly noon We were seated immediately. The decor is very cute. The coffee cups were huge, and they had real sugar cubes which I loved. The tea service my niece had was impressive as well. We were given free beignets, which were great.  Food was awesome: pancakes and eggs
