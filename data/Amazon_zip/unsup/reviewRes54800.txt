A hophead living in Chicago for over five years, I finally decided to take a group of friends to Hopleaf for the very first time. The four of us walked in at 6:30 and were seated immediately, which was a pleasant surprise. The draft beer list was good, but certainly not the best I've ever seen. I had a Bell's Two Hearted and my wife, an Allagash White.We skipped appetizers as nothing looked particularly appealing and moved directly to two orders of Mussels for two. Mussels are my latest obsession and these did not disappoint. I will say, however, that the mussels offered at Logan Square's Revolution Brewing we far more fresh and the sauce much more nuanced in flavor. Nonetheless, I ate to my hearts content.By the end of the meal I could sense that the restaurant was getting busy. During a trip to the restroom I caught word of a purported two hour wait. By the time I returned, our service had completely stopped. Our server was within earshot as we all discussed which beer we'd like next but we were never offered a second pour. The message from the wait staff was loud and clear: we'd like you out of here. I can understand that given that kind of wait they want to turn the tables over as quickly as possible, but we were willing to keep ordering and build up the check - what gives? We passed on getting a second drink (I had already tried everything on the draft menu anyway) but decided to get desert - they had some fantastic-sounding options. I had the apple cake and our guests had the mousse. The apple cake was completely unacceptable. Dry layers of bland cake stacked between globs of sour delicata squash and marshmallow-esque cream cheese filling with burnt brittle served on the side. If they weren't so busy, I may have sent it back.Overall: a good experience, good ambiance, but please: if your wait time is any longer than 30 minutes, it's time you leave the north side and find a better less-hyped restaurant.
