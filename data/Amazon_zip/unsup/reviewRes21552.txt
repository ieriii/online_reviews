I had never been to Mayan Palace all my years in Chicago until a few weeks ago on a whim. I had the vegetarian burrito (and am not even a vegetarian), and it blew my mind. Seriously, it was perfection. The loaded nachos were incredible. Our waiter was very nice. The margaritas were strong. I will return.  Salud!
