Ever since I moved back up north, Tank Noodle has been our #1 take-out spot. My husband loves to order the Pho Tai, which is very tasty and my fav is the Chicken Congee. They serve more than a filling's worth and can have it ready in little time. The smoothies are delicious as well. Oh, and the desserts w/ the coconut milk are yumm! Being that this place is sooooooo good, I don't understand why there are so many Pho restaurants w/in a block's range. Do they think they can compete w/ Tank Noodle? MmmmmMmmmMMm! I wish they delivered!
