This place is awesome! On my quest to try every restaurant in Bridgeport this year, my boyfriend and I went to Nana for brunch on Sunday. We were very pleased with our choice. I had the chicken sandwich with the fresh corn salad. Omg, the corn salad is to die for. Super fresh and flavorful. And the guacamole on the sandwich is perfect. My boyfriend had the Homestyle Skillet and sausage patties. He was thrilled with both. He tried to order a diet Pepsi, gag me, but they told him they only carry the pure cane sugar Coke. It being a local, sustainable, organic, natural restaurant and all:) Our waiter was a trip and the whole staff was super attentive. We already planned our next trip back there. So if you live in the area or you're just there for a Sox game, I highly recommend Nana.
