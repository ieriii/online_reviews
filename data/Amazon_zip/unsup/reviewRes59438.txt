My family went here looking for some good Chicago deep dish pizza. This was the best deep dish pizza I have ever had..!!! We went on a week night and the service was excellent. Very friendly staff. It does take a little longer because the pizza takes about 35 minutes to cook. It was well worth the wait.. Will be returning on are next trip to Chicago.
