What is the deal with Chicago aka deep dish pizza? Am I the only Chicagoan who typically eats it *only* when (1) her office orders it in or (2) someone visits and *has* to have it? I can't be the only one who feels this way. The stuff is good, but it's something I order for myself once in a blue moon. When that blue moon does come around and I have hankering for some deep dish AoP is the place I call. OK end rant. So tonight, on a night which makes the arctic circle look like a tropical paradise, I decided to get me some pizza; not deep dish, but the regular stuff. I rang up AoP; ordered my 'za finally remembering to request the kind of soda I like for my free 1L; and settled in to eagerly await my piping hot pizza on a cold, cold night. The pizza did not disappoint. The pizza was hot, the sauce tasty with the right amount of zip, the crust done perfectly and the ingredients fresh. AoP is pizza done right, whether it's deep dish or thin, it consistently hits the spot. The only thing that would make this place more perfect is a website, one complete with online ordering. In the meantime I'll just have to settle for pulling it up on Chicago Menupages. Bottom line: The next time your visitors ask 'where can I go to get some good Chicago-style pizza' consider tossing out AoP, I don't think you'll be sorry. Rumor has it that if you eat in you can get the Chicago-style by the slice.
