This wonderful restaurant makes me wish I lived in Chicago. The food and service is excellent. The naan appetizer is served right out of the oven with a touch of garlic. The sizzling lamb kebabs are perfectly seasoned and cooked. The Chicken Tikka Masala is another ymmy favorite! The ambiance is nice, the service attentive. I could go on and on. If you love Indian food as much as I do, don't miss this gem. You'll see me there on my next trip to Chicago!
