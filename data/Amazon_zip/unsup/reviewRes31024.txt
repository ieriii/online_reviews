I had an amazing and indulgent meal here that was out of this world.. truly a memorable dining experience. The atmosphere is dark, sexy and classy. My group was seated in the large booths along the wall and were well attended to all night by numerous servers. We started with a ceaser salad and shrimp for appetizer which were fantastic. For entrees we got the bone in filet which was cooked to perfection, quite possibly the best steak that I have ever had. If its possible, the side dishes were just as tempting, Alaskan King Crab black truffle gnocci and lobster mashed potatoes. I still dream of this melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Stuffed to the brim and about to burst, my friend insisted we get dessert.. the signature butter cake which was to good to miss. The meal was amazing and I am so glad that I got the opportunity to dine here on a recent trip. Mastro's offers quality food and great service, perfect for a special occasion.
