If you know Chicago you would know that places with the physical characteristics of La Pasadita are a dime a dozen. It seems that on every single street corner there is an authentic looking Mexican Restaurant. Out of all of the, Pasadita is the best. From tortas to burritos to just plain tacos, you can't lose. Plus they know how to serve a real steak taco with Cilantro and Onion only! Only downfall is the place always just feels dirty and the bathroom is just plain scary.
