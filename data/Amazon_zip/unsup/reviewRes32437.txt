The place is already a hipster joint, and apparently reservations are preferred which knocks it down the ladder for me to begin with. Our food took far too long and the waitress was not very friendly or personable. My main gripe was the food. I've had plenty of Ethiopian and this was nothing like I'd had before. The food was served on the Njera (spelling) bread on plates. That in itself was wrong, but the chicken has tomatoes in it, the potatoe & carrot dish was oily, and the zil zil tibs (beef strips) was served fajita style on a hot plate and was horribly overcooked. Not an enjoyable experience at all whatsoever, I'm sticking with Ethiopian Diamond further north.
