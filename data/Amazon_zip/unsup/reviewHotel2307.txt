We stayed at the Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile while in Chicago on a business trip. The staff was wonderfully friendly and helpful, and the hotel is centrally located ~ step outside the doors and you're right on Chicago's Magnificent Mile. We stayed at the hotel right before the holidays and the lobby was resplendent it it's holiday finery. The tree at the center was absolutely gorgeous! Our room was tastefully done and comfortable and had all the business amenities one might need. The staff was helpful and quick to respond. I would highly recommend this hotel to others.
