This is prob my favorite steakhouse so far. The woodfire ovens give this downtown establishment a cozy feel. The Black Peppercorn New York Strip and Porterhouse are my recommendations and go well with wild rice, red skin mash or cheddar double stuffed potatoes. I also highly recommend the baked french onoin soup, stuffed mushroom caps, and lumped crab cakes.
