I've lived most of my life in Chicago and missed Chicago pizza when I moved out of state. I LOVE Giordano's pizza. HOWEVER, while visiting the Mag Mile I tried to order a pizza without tomato sauce for my child who has a food sensitivity. The manager of the 730 N. Rush street location (Robert) refused to accommodate my 10 year old's disability and was horribly rude in the process including hanging up on my wife. All we asked was for a small thin crust pizza with butter instead of tomato sauce. Not exactly an excessive demand. He could have at least been friendly about the refusal. Gino's East here I come!
