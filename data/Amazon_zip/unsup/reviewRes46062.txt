The first time I went to Grand Lux, I thought, "Hey, this is just like Cheesecake Factory!" And it really is, but the more expensive and higher end version of it! The atmosphere is pretty much the same and they do offer Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes. There's a varied selection of food, but my personal favorite would have to be the chopped salad! The portion is just right, it's filling and the price is just right! But what really sets apart Grand Lux are it's ready made desserts! I love Molten Chocolate Cakes and Grand Lux's is on the top of my list! Other good options include the New Orleans Beignets, Fresh Strawberry Shortcake and Red Velvet Cake. The portions are huge, so definitely be prepared to share! I wouldn't regularly choose to go here for a meal, but it's a great restaurant if you have friends in town and are already shopping on Michigan Ave!
