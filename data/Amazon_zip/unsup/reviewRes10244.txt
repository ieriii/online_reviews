I don't often go out to Italian restaurants since this is one cuisine that I can prepare at home to generally good results. But I'd read only positive things about Piccolo Sogno, so I was excited when Rick picked this place for an impromptu date night. For starters, the service is top notch. Our server was polite, easily made recommendations, wasn't pushy at all, and was uber-prompt but not rushed. I also dug the ambiance. Romantic but still good for groups. Even though it was chilly, they had the patio open and it looked like a little garden of Eden. We opted to sit inside, but were next to the open patio doors so got a little of both worlds. We got the bread soup for an appetizer. Our server warned us that this is more like stuffing and not really soup. We were still sold on it, and I'm glad we got it because it was delicious and not something I had ever seen before. Soup-flavored stuffing is the only way to describe it, but trust me, it's better than it sounds. I opted for the house ravioli and loved it. Stuffed with four cheeses and covered in what had to be primarily butter. The pasta had that perfect al dente chewiness that I can never replicate at home. I can't promise that this is the best thing on the menu since I only tried a few things, but I can promise that you won't regret ordering it. I begrudgingly traded plates with Rick halfway through the meal because I felt bad that his gnocchi wasn't as awesome as the ravioli. It was perfectly passable, but the pillows were a bit too starchy and didn't absorb the other flavors very well. The gnocchi sauce was also heavy on the butter but just wasn't as delicious as the ravioli sauce.  Yummy bread basket. We each got our own plates for pouring the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I like it when places let you DIY on this. There is a sweetness to the house BV that makes it unusually flavorful. It was so good that I wanted to ask if we could by a bottle to take home, but alas, forgot.
