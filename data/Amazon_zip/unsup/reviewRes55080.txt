I love a good steakhouse. Although this one is a chain restaurant, it is done well and it is done right. I like the atmosphere, the decor, and I have to admit that the food is spectacular. I also like the fact that it is reasonably priced, you won't leave broke or hungry, and there are absolutely no airs. It's set up like an old fashioned supper club, and you can dress up or down.We have been to Wildfire quite a few times....admittedly we once went twice in a week. They have great wine tasting dinners. Hands down, I would recommend one to anyone who is interested in learning the art of wine pairings. It is really great fun. Our first time, my boyfriend I felt like were were on a couples blind date. You are paired with 2 or 3 other couples at your table, and the wine and courses are never-ending.I also like that they offer drink trios as well as their steak trios. It's a great way to taste and experience new foods and drinks. I love their chopped salad...it is by far different from any other chopped salad that I have ever had because it contains tortilla chips, corn, and a citrus lime vinaigerette. The only salad that I have had there that I did not enjoy was their tomato salad. It was way too mushy and flavorless. We've enjoyed all of their appetizers, and have tried steaks, pastas, and their duck. Their desserts are also very tasty and highly recommended. I highly recommend Wildfire for a unpretentious steak dinner. Dinner for 4 including alcoholic drinks and tip will cost around $200.
