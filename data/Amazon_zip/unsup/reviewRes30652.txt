I feel compelled to ask - WHY is this place popular? It's great that Chicago Diner is vegeterian friendly. But a poorly-lit overcrowded room with poor service isn't worth paying for. I didn't love my dish, and that's ok because I am your regular carnivore. I mostly disliked the experience because of the bad service and dirty cups you're forced to drink your one serving of water out of. Yuck.
