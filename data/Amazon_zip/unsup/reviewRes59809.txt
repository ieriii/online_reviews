Best pizza in Chicago for me .I had Chicken wings BBQ flavor only.Side Salad could of been better.I had a mix of the meat and the special recipe deep dish. The best pizza in Chicago. If you dont want to wait 30 minutes for a personal pie then you can order from what they have in their warmer that are ready.
