Definitely order the pan pizza. The thin crust was just average. We ordered sausage, mushroom, and spinach, and it was delish. The wait time nearly killed me, over an hour to bring out our pizzas, but I was starving. I think I actually prefer Giordanos because it has the extra sauce and the layers, but this was also phenomenal. Chicago deep dish delish.
