I was here on Saturday, and I really enjoyed the place. It's definitely off the beaten path, but once inside it has a great atmosphere. My only complaint would be that there is no seating unless you're doing bottle service. The staff was friendly, as were the patrons, and it was one of the more attractive crowds I've seen out. Drinks were good, as was the food - I was pleasantly surprised by their sushi, which apparently has won awards (?). The DJ was good too. I'd definitely go back.
