Cuban food is a recent discovery of mine, so I haven't been to enough Cuban restaurants to really give a good comparison; however, this place has excellent food.  The meat here is so tender that you can cut it with a fork, and their sauces are rich and flavorful. The way they have the restaurant set-up is also cute and cozy. The inside is a little cramped, but the outside is the place to be. Their outdoor patio is decorated wih such a cute flair (a lot of plants, nice iron casted chairs, nice outdoor lighting all the way around the patio. Definately doesn't make you feel like you are in the states.
