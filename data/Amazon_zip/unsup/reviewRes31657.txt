Another great recommendations from yelpers when looking for a cool lunch spot near the Mart. We had to walk in the rain a bit, but it was worth it to get fresh air. I was able to make a reservation on-line which I love and the restaurant called me the day before to confirm. The interior is appealing to the eye and we were seating near the back past the sushi bar and were able to see everything leaving the kitchen and it all looked good. The steamed buns with duck are a must. We each could've eaten the plate of 4 solo. I got the spicy steak salad (take a look at my picture) and it was very tasty. I don't do spicy a lot, so I had to pick off some of the pepper flakes since my mouth was on fire. Over all experience was pleasant, but it got very loud. I can't imagine eating here at night and trying to talk to anyone.
