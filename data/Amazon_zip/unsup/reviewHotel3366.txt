You can't beat the price, especially since it included a day at the Field Museum! Though I agree that the garage parking is a little bit of a hassle, the hotel is centered in a place where you can walk to a variety of interesting places (Shedd Aquarium, House of Blues, etc) in a short amount of time. The lobby and bar are straight out of the 60's - gaudy and kitschy and just plain great. The staff was extremely helpful and nice - we had some crazy drunk trying to get in our room at 2:00 in the morning (he was in 440, we were in 1440) and the front desk and security responded immediately to the call we made. My complaints about the Essex are that the walls are extremely thin and the beds are way too short. I'm 5'2" and my feet hung off the end. No huge deal, though. I'd stay there again.
