Don't judge. I know Rick Bayless and Charlie Trotter have restaurants in the city, but not everyone has the luxury of leaving the Magnificent Mile area to go eat. I was told this is a Cheesecake Factory-owned restaurant, so I was expecting mediocre, edible food and lots of choices. What I ordered (and what I hope to never eat again): Cucumber martini - did I order cucumber mint syrup? Cucumber martinis are supposed to be light and refreshing, not full of simple syrup! I took a few obligatory sips and left the drink alone. Shaking beef - salty, and the beef wasn't very good. Miso Salmon - nothing like the Cheesecake Factory version, which I actually like. This one should have been called "soy sauce salmon"--it had a salty brown-sauced top. Banana Cream Pie - this is served as an individual tart. It was actually pretty good for a Cheesecake Factory dessert, which I usually find to be too sweet. It was barely sweet! Half of the filling was whipped cream, so when we scraped that all off, we ended up with lots of banana and a bit of custard. The graham crust was crunchy and just sweet enough (although a little too crunchy to bite in some areas). If you ever find yourself deciding between Grand Lux Cafe and Cheesecake Factory, go with Cheesecake Factory. The view from the Grand Lux Cafe is NOT worth eating a terrible meal for.
