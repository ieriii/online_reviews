I came here about a month ago and I ordered the pepito. It was alright. It wasn't anything outstanding. Rather, quite disappointing because I got two pieces of meat for the entire sandwich. Also, there was a strange after taste. I was really looking forward to XOCO because of Bayless prestige. The music was loud where I couldn't hear the person in front of me speak. The service was good, but they seated us right next to the back doors that kept on swinging back and forth.
