My friends and I were really really looking forward to eating here last night, Friday March 2, 2012...but when we walked in we were not greeted by the host and once we were seated we waited for almost 15 minutes with no recognition from the staff that we were their, so we decided to leave. Before we did though we asked a passing by server if we could be served and she replied with, "I can see what I can do for you"... exact words. On the plus side we were given water to drink when on their menu they only give you water if you request it and we had not. I would recommend it because the menu items looked and sounded GREAT but be prepared to wait a long time to be served.
