I never write reviews, but I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Uncommon Ground, and when I saw a really nasty review written by Robert H., I felt (as an former waitress) obligated to stick up for my favorite restaurant.It actually IS a violation of health code standards to bring outside food into a restaurant. I worked in restaurants for years, and MOST chefs forbid it! When restaurants do let you bring in your own cake, it is done STRICTLY as a courtesy. It is your responsibility as a diner to call ahead and ask what their house policies are on bringing in an outside cake. And if they do allow it, you should leave extra gratuity to the server who has A. lost out on dessert sales due to your cake, and B. has to cut, plate, and serve your cake. I mean, really? Would you bring in your own steak??? Use your brain!I also noticed that you said you had to wait for brunch. Most everyone has to wait for brunch, unless you are one of the people that walk in right when the restaurant is opening! We are talking about a busy restaurant that also takes reservations. If you had to wait 40 minutes for a table with empty tables in the restaurant, it was probably because they were being held for a reservation.Next time, make a reservation! While you have staff member on the phone, ask if you can bring in a cake. It's not that difficult!The silliest thing about this review is that this guy felt like they were being spied on. Hostesses have to look around dining rooms constantly to see how far along tables are, which tables are about to get up, etc. This keeps the flow going, and cuts down on wait times. The very same wait times that you are complaining about. You sound paranoid, buddy.
