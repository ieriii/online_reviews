I'm an omnivore. I eat everything (with a few exceptions, of course). A friend suggested that I try this restaurant out. It was a good recommendation. I've tried many vegetarian restaurants in SF (my dad's a vegetarian), and some were not so great. The Chicago Diner is definitely in the more awesome category. :)
