Of all the places I have been before I can't believe I forgot to review Alinea. What really is there to say though that others haven't? Yes, it was hands down the most incredible, memorable, "once in a life time" food experience I have ever had. They were very accomodating to my poultry only/vegetarianism ways. The restaurant is gorgeous, the staff bend over backwards for you ( except the sommelier... he's an obnoxious as*, but from my experiences most are) and there seems to be a surprise at every course. My advice... go in with an open mind and think of it as you're going to the theater, relax and enjoy. Am I running back? No, but not because it wasn't fantastic, but because I'll give it a few years for the chef to come up with some new tricks. It wouldn't be as fun with out the element of surprise. If you haven't been don't let your friends ruin it for you by telling you what to expect ahead of time.
