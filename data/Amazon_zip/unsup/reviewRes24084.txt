What a little gem this is. We swung by a few weeks ago for a late brunch. The feel of the place is very close, very coffee-house-ish, but I loved the decor. I loved our waiter who offered no apologies for the somewhat slow service, only an explanation that Turkish coffee must be brewed to absolute perfection and takes time and care. I loved it. The food was fantastic--there's something here for everyone. I opted for the Marrakech and loved every bite. The soup was so savory I almost licked my cup. And for my first try at Turkish coffee, I was not disappointed. Strong, rich and wonderful. I'll definitely be back!
