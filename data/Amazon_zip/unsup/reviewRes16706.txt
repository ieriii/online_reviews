I received an invite for a tasting party here a couple of days ago and boy am I glad I did. I didn't have to wait in any line like others are saying. I just went straight in but the thing is that it's very easy to miss this place. The door seems almost hidden, there is NO address written, nor a name of the establishment. Once you're inside its like a maze of pure, sultry ambiance. Very low light, great service and excellent drinks. This was my first time going to Violet Hour so I was not prepared for how good the drinks would be. I'll just say that they are the best cocktails I've had in Chicago. Normally the drinks are 11-12 dollars each. I consider that pretty pricey but I will also say that they're worth it.
