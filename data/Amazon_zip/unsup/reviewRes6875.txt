Brought my boss and another sales rep-we wanted fun and great food (it IS Chicago after all). Our waitperson (very energetic, nice and articulate woman) explained the different choices, that the portions were huge and kept us well hydrated in cocktails.  We ordered 2 entrees and still had tons to bring home to my grateful husband. I'm a KC native, so love that bbq-and this was very good. Great space, server, and just the right amount of "attentive without intrusive". Will bring hubby back to pick his own leftovers next time.
