Wildfire is exactly the classy kind of place you'd take someone you were seeking to impress or if you were celebrating a major achievement.  The steaks are always tender and cooked exactly to order. I highly recommend getting a New York strip with a crust (they have 6 to choose from). If you can't pick one crust, they have a medallion platter where you'll receive three medallions with different crusts. Excellent way to sample the goods.  The sides are all excellent and cooked with care. I'm a particular fan of the sweet potato and garlic mashed potatoes. The salads are crisp and my friend's wife (whom I've eaten there with several times) has always enjoyed the fish, so I would also recommend that.  Aside from the food, the martinis from the Wildfire bar are excellently made and if you don't feel like waiting for a whole dinner, sitting in the upper bar area can be a nice alternative. While everything at Wildfire is delicious, there are a couple downsides. First, it's pricey. Seriously. Second, it's located in a touristy area...so keep that in mind. The biggest (in my mind) drawback is the waitstaff can occasionally be less than friendly, but I don't hold that against Wildfire as that has really only happened once and the excellence of the food makes up for it.
