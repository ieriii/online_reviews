Yeah it's good sushi and I like coast - the reason I'm giving it one star is that they serve bluefin tuna. I'm not a huge treehugger type but the truth is that this fish will only be around a few more years until it's extinct. I'm using my rating as sending a message to Coast to not serve this fish anymore.
