Can't get enough of the green onion oil sauce!! Ordered the same reliable steak entree with plantains, yucca, and potato. BYO wine, too! Just thinking about it has my mouth watering yet again. I've now brought two friends to Las Tablas and they're always pleasantly surprised (we usually frequent Chicago Q, Cafe Ba Ba Reba, Zocalo, and other classy joints). Not to mention the atmosphere is always more chill and the street parking less difficult up here on Lincoln Ave, with no wait line yet in my experience and always a quiet, relaxing atmosphere. It's a hidden gem, I tell you. Whoever else is in love with the green onion oil sauce, contact me because I need a partner in crime to obtain that recipe!
