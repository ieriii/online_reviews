We came here one time a year ago for dinner with friends and I didn't really love the food. However, we came here again this weekend and I really enjoyed the food so maybe we ordered wrong the first time. This weekend we got the bacon fat popcorn, smokehouse pizza, harvest pizza, the mussels steamed in beer, and a charcuterie platter. This was enough food for 4 people to share and it was really tasty. The harvest pizza is especially tasty with the cauliflower and the molasses reduction. The charcuterie platter was also wonderful. The headcheese and bologna were great. The beers were also tasty. We will be back!
