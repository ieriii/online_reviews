THE RAINBOW TROUT CHANGED MY LIFE. Delicata squach, pickled onions, and a sage butter sauce!? I love you. No, I love YOU more. No, YOU. I may or may not have had this conversation with a perfectly cooked animal at a communal table. I may or may not have friends anymore. The Publican's got a great number of things down to a science. Their standing area is genius and delicious. Beers, oysters, and cheese plates while we wait. Magic. The grape, burrata, and almond salad unleashed my gitty school girl like summer just started. The grapes were inexplicably flavorful, and every bite just sung in my mouth. And Pavlova was on the dessert menu. This tugged on my nostalgia chords, as my mother (who collects cookbooks to look at, and never to utilize) used to actually make this for me and my brother. Not something you typically see on menus, and I'm not sure why. It was perfect, and better than my mothers. Yes, I told her that. HOWEVER, the Honey Pudding stole the dessert show. So creative and ballsy. Bourbon peach, almond streusel and honey black pepper ice cream? Unicorn tears were no doubt the secret ingredient in this little ditty. Great beer selection, amazing service, tons of seafood, and great company! My only complaint is that it's loud as hell, but the Publican can't help it's so popular!
