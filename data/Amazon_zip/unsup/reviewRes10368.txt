The outside patio is the best in the city. The service was great - we were a party of 15 and they handled everything smoothly. The arugula pizza was delicious and the ravioli was the best I have had in a long time.  We tried the air cured beef pizza, I was not a fan and saw several other people pull the meat off.  Valet is only $6 - cheaper than the meter parking on the street if you are going to be there for more than 2 hours.  If you are looking to eat outside during the warm months this is the place to go. It was great for a big group but is also be a romantic date spot. The food is really good, there are comparable places if you are just looking for food. However, I will be back many times to sit outside and enjoy that back patio.
