I tried India House for the first time last weekend. I went on a Sunday afternoon for their brunch buffet. Having had Indian food only one time prior to this (we'll just say I had a bad experience), I was nervous that it would be the same. Boy was I wrong! The buffet food was awesome. They had a wide variety from vegetarian to chicken to seafood. I tried almost everything on the buffet, and it was all EXTREMELY good. They even brought out sizzling chicken tandoori that was DELICIOUS. I tried to go back up for a second plate, but I was so full after the first that I went to the dessert bar instead. The rice pudding, dough balls (not sure what they are actually called) and mango ice cream were wonderful. I also enjoyed Kingfisher beer with my meal and that made it perfect. For 2 buffets and 2 LARGE bottles of beer, it was $56. Some would think this is a little pricey for brunch ($16/pp for the buffet, $8 per beer..and then tax), but for good Indian food at a nice restaurant, it wasn't horrible. Just go hungry because there is a lot of food! I will be going back, that's for sure!
