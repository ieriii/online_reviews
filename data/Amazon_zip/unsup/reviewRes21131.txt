Come here for their margaritas. My friend took me here right before she moved to NYC and it was her go-to place every Thursday. It felt like the intro to "Cheers" because everyone knew her, so of course service was impeccable for us. Their portions are generous, so I'd say get an appetizer and a entree for party of 2. We had a steak salad and nachoes and it was the perfect amount of food.
