The food is wonderful, but authentic. I say 'but' because some might not anticipate getting an entire chicken leg in their soup. You might. It's delicious, by the way. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because it's small, cramped, always crowded (expect a line - be pleasantly surprised if there isn't one), there are usually families with kids, if you don't get a booth you end up at a long communal table, and some booths are near the door (which is always open because of the line which might make for chilly eating). I'm by no means a people person, but I'll brave the Chicago winter weather, the line AND hoards of screaming children to eat here.
