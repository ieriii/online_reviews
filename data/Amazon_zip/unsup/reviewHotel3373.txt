We stayed here a night in January. We came via the red line which is only a few blocks away and nice to be able to take public transportation to. We booked the King Suite, which meant we were on the top floor (15th). The room is not huge but we did not feel cramped either. The rooms have recently been remolded which is really nice. We had a fantastic view of Grant Park, museums and the lake. I would get this room again for the view! It doesn't happen much in Chicago that you get an unobstructed view and it was nice to have one. The bathrooms, as others have posted are tiny. It is an older hotel and you just work around it but yes, very, very small. The heat is controlled for the building so in the winter it is heat and you can't control it for your room, you can turn the fan on though and we found that this was enough to keep us plenty warm. The walls are not the thickest and we heard other guests getting off the elevator all night. All-in-all, a nicely appointed room with a few quirks, but we would stay here again for the view and location and price.
