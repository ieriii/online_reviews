I'm giving it 5 stars in spite of the fact that my husband made reservations for my birthday about 3 months in advance and they called us 1-2 hours before to cancel (they weren't opening the restaurant that night). Which left us wanting to go somewhere nice in an hour with no reservations. :( Schwa ended up getting us in a few weekends later and it was well worth the wait. I thought the food was some of the more unique/creative dishes I have ever had. However, I didn't think every dish was amazing tasting (cool but maybe not the best food ever). For example there was a "campfire" shortrib dish which was served over a glass with campfire smelling smoke trapped inside. It was cool to release the smoke and the shortrib had toasted marshmellow (definitely left me feeling/smelling like I was sitting at a campfire), however it wasn't the best braised short ribs I have had (too sweet with the marshmallow). Anyways, overall we loved the experience (chefs bring out your dishes) and the overall creativity. It wasn't the best restaurant we have ever been to, but for the price, overall value (byob) and amazing creativity I would HIGHLY recommend and return. Oh, and don't expect 4 star/white table cloth setting or service. Not necessary here.
