Sadly disappointed. Just had their fall menu last night. The first course was a duck sushi roll. The duck was dry and the rice was horrible - gummy, chewy, like paste. Absolutely horrible. They also assaulted a shitake mushroom with so much salt, I didn't eat it and we told our server about it. It was like someone dunked it in salt. Finally, one of the waiters (red hair and red beard) reeked of smoke so badly that when he delivered our food and I tried to smell it to take it in, all I smelled was ashtray. Save your money. These folks don't even seem to taste their own food. I would have only given 1 star, but I gave an extra star for BYOB.
