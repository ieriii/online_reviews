Had Christmas eve dinner here- as it was one of the few places we found that were open. The place was packed but we only had to wait a few minutes for our table. The waitress was great- very friendly and stopped by often. We were in the main dining room which is quite "tight", and my husband kept having to lean forward so she could serve the couple in the corner near us. But we did recieve a free dessert ( our choice) for the inconvience...though we never complained and laughed it off. when she kept apologizing. The food was great, we had Lobster bisque-Yummmy Clam chowder Stone crab claw- Good but expensive IMO ($7.50 for 4 small bites) Ecuadorian Mahi- fresh but needed a tad more sauce Blue crab stuffed flounder-mmmmm!!!! Many glasses of wine... The only thing that sucked was the $9.00 potatoes au gratin, which were horrible...I was surprised because I don't think i have ever had bad au gratin, it's potatoes and cheese- not very difficult. But potatoes, runny cream and a ton of not to tasty cheese, was just bad!!!! I would have prefered "box" au gratin, .....Stay away... The wine list was so-so but there were some decent options and many were reasonably priced. At least they have nice wine glasses, as I hate those chintzy little "filled to the rim" glasses many places use. All in all it was a good meal and very fresh fish. That combined with the excellent service made this a place I may visit again. Though i will probably sit at the bar and skip the sides.
