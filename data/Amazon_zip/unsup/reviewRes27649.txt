I'm a rough one to get five stars out of when we're talking about good food - but this place really is something great. This place is totally a relaxed feel, and they still pulled a Michelin star - that takes great food and awesome staff - and GE has it. I have no desire to go back to Alinea - but GE is going to get plenty of repeat business from me. Its just good. Do yourself a favor - be smarter than me - and order the foie gras lollipop with pop rocks the first time you go. It gets things off in the right direction. It sounds odd, but it is all good.
