I'm in love w/ Sabatinos. My husband and I ate there a few weeks ago for the first time, and we left with huge smiles on our faces. It was one of those experiences where you feel like you couldn't be any more satisfied. It's not a modern or trendy place to eat. The atmosphere is dark and dated, but his place is chalk full of old italian class. It's nostalgic, warm and inviting. We felt so at home we joked we could've taken a nap in our giant wrap around booth. The food was spectacular (try the two cream based pasta dishes - we ordered the one w/ the peas and mushrooms) and they feed you crazy amounts of food. My filet was tender and perfectly cooked. The minestrone soup tasted like my grandmas - even the complimentary cheese bread they give you at the beginning is FAB. They also bring you a giant loaf of crusty warm bread you can soak up w/ the olive oil and parm cheese on your table. If you haven't been here, go NOW. There aren't many places like this anymore, and if you appreciate classic places, you'll love Sabatinos. We went on a weekday and had no trouble getting seated; however, i've heard the weekends are packed. p.s. FREE valet parking. wow.
