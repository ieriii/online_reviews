Good but not really impressed. Strolled up to the bar at 7:30 on Saturday night and snagged to seats. Bartender was awesome and made some great recommendations. Had a nice bottle of red. Beet salad good but how can you F that up. Fried deviled egg was decent but again, how can you F up anything deep fried. Foie Gras was awesome. And the pig jowl was decent. Onto dessert which was a real kicker for me. I didn't realize the Nutella panini was in fact bread with bananas, Nutella, and marshmallows. Really. I could have made 12 of these at home for $8!! And the Verdi chili stout was in fact gross or their beer lines are really dirty.
