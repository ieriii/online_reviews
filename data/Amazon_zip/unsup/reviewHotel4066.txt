5 Stars for the courtesy sample size lotion they give you in the bathroom. Citrus Lavender. Of course I took it with me and I always get complements on its smell...then I have to break the news that I 'stole' it from the Hyatt downtown. All in all, the bedrooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel is in a good Central location, and they have a flipping club on the main level. I'm not a clubbin' girl normally, but Hard drive is pretty fun if you're in the mood to spend a lot of cash.
