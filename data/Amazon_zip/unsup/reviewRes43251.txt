Yum, Yum and Yum! Very friendly place with a perfect outdoor seating (in door available if you prefer). Sandwichs tasted good. I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because they screwed up my order. Although the wrong sandwich was made and given to me, it was nevertheless great tasting. I would have given it a 5 Star if my order was done correctly.
