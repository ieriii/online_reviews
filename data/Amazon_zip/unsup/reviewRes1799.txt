Definitely an experience... everything from standing in line for an hour, to trying to choose a hot dog, to talking with doug, to eating in their interestingly decorated space. I got the Spicy Italian Sausage, which was one of the specials. it had pesto, roma tomatoes, and feta on it. It was very tasty and a good size. Big enough but not huge. My husband ordered fries (not the duck fat ones) and they were ok, but not as good as I thought they would be. The melted American cheese on the top actually grossed me out a little. Doug, the owner was super, super friendly, though. Even though the line was out the door he genuinely seemed to care about each and every customer and didn't push us through the line. I was also surprised about the amount of seating their was. You would think that a place with 1+ hour lines would have no room to sit, but it wasn't the case. I'll definitely be back with my guy to sample some other dogs!
