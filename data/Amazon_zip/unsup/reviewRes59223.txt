Fantastic food, low prices, prompt service, super cheap takeout, new decor.The new place opened in October 2009, and it's now brighter, quieter, more fashionable and much bigger than before. If you want food that's incredibly tasty and so cheap you'll be sure someone made a mistake, get the takeout from the counter near the door. A seafood combo with rice (mention "with rice") is just $6.10 for a mountain of top-quality food. The barbecue combo with rice (again mention "with rice") is a bit less and gives you pork, chicken and duck. If you choose to eat inside, it's a bit less cheap, but still great value. The guys at the takeout counter speak English but not a lot. If you forget to say "with rice" they might give you a double order of meat for double the price, so be sure to use those magic two words.The specialties are barbecue, seafood, Sichuan pickle soup. This includes about 2 dozen excellent items. Go for these. The lo mein is of above average quality. Some of the Sichuan meat items aren't so good.
