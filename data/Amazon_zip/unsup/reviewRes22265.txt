Greek Islands is by far the best of the Greektown restaurants. When you arrive at Greek Islands, you will be met with free valet. It's kind of amazing. The restaurant is HUGE, I've never waited for a table. The service is excellent, all the servers are happy to make suggestions and/or give you a tutorial on how to pronounce greek words. The saganaki is excellent, but come on.... it's cheese. Of course it's good. The grilled octopus appetizer is shockingly delicious. Charred but tender, make sure you hit it with a squeeze of lemon. My FAVORITE thing about Greek Islands is the combination plate option........ you can get 2 half portions of basically all the good stuff on the menu. Spanikopita + Keftedes Combo.... I could literally eat that for dinner 3+ times a week. The Keftedes (beef and lamb meatballs) are the best meatballs I've ever had in my life (sorry, Grandma). The spanikopita is good, I think they've started using a different type of phyllo dough b/c I swear it used to stay more light and crisp. It's still delicious spinach pie, but the phyllo has been a touch soggy the last few times I've dined. I'm clearly not too broken up about it if you can't tell by this rave review. In other news, the gyros are also very good. You basically can't go wrong at this place. If you're heading to Greektown, Greek Islands is where you want to be!!!
