You can survive here if you don't eat meat, but for the love of god I hope you eat meat cause this is one of the best dinner experiences you will ever have. Get yer tastiness on! Only reason I won't give 5 stars is because I used to eat at their previous location across the street and I really preferred the more intimate atmosphere there. That said, this is a great place, no question. I just wiped some drool off of my keyboard ;)
