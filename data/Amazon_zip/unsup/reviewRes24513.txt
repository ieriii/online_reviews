I feel I should give out 5s sparingly, but I couldn't click 4 and live with myself. The first experience I had here was during restaurant week in which we did a prix fixe menu and got a wine flight. The service was good, at times a bit slow but again, it was restaurant week at dinner time. The server was great though in ensuring we got what we wanted. the BF doesn't like seafood and they were accommodating to that. One wine really stood out and after asking about it he wrote it down so we could get it ourselves (as we did...on they walk home). I was most impressed with the prosciutto ham fig salad wrap and continue to get it every time I go. Don't miss it! Brunch with the parents was the next time we went and it remains the best brunch out there. We have been to NoMi and while it's good, this stood out as better and at a fraction of the cost to boot. It was a rainy Sunday and we sat there for 3 hours enjoying $8 bottomless sangria and the courses just kept coming. Each one you get a small portion but if they gave you anymore you wouldn't be able to enjoy all they bring. Then there's the roasted suckling pig you can get as you please and they put sea salt on and you will realize you don't care that you are looking into it's hallow eyes as you eat it. It's that good. We went for a friends birthday and had another amazing meal but tried the s'mores dessert. I will not even attempt to describe this. Just get it.
