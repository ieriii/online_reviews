wow, what a dinner, so many delicious items. The lobster mac and cheese was incredible as was the truffle gnocchi. The bone-in steaks which are their signature was also extremely well done. The chocolate sin cake was also one of the best desserts I have had in a while. This combined with a very strong wine selection makes for a very very nice dinner out. Only downside that I could really mention was that the piano singer from the bar area could be heard throughout the main dining room and he really should not have been singing at all. A great dining experience and although a little pricey, the quality of everything makes it extremely worth it.
