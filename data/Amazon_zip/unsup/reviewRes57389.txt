Last night was the first time I have been to coast and I loved it!Hamachi carpaccio was awesome, nice and light..good for an appetizer. My favorite of the rolls was definitely the spicy tuna, might have been the best I have ever had and the sweet potato tempura was also amaaaazzzzing. Of the specialty rolls I really enjoyed sunrise and the rainbow roll. Will definitely be back to Coast sometime soon...
