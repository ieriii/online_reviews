Last time I was in the bartender (can't remember name, but was tall black guy with scruffy face, has worked a lot of places) was out of this world nice and helpful. He knew the beer/wine list, made great conversation and even bought me a round as a fellow hospitality manager in the neighborhood. I have always loved this place for its food and drinks, but this is the first awesome service experience I have had at this place, and it was over the top good.
