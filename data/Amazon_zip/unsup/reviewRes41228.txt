** This review is part of an ongoing series, "Cuz I'm a Pretend Foodie." Check out the rest on our list! Cost for 7 Course Tasting: $85 per person OK, I'm the first to admit that I'm not going to do this review justice because although we went in May I'm finally getting to this review in August (I'm a teacher and school was ending -- my brain wasn't functioning). It's a shame, because while I won't be able to go into detail about the menu itself, there are a lot of positive things about Bonsoiree. The pros: 1) BYOB. BYOB. Oh, and BYOB 2) Tasting menu only. You can either go for the four, seven or thirteen (!) courses.  3) Small, extremely intimate feel. I think they can only serve 25 - 30 people at a time.  4) Innovative presentation and flavors 5) Constantly rotating menu Cons: 1) It's a guaranteed $50 a person to walk through the door, if you go with the four course menu. But I would never want to go to this restaurant **too** frequently because I wouldn't want to take away the magic of the experience. Overall opinion: When the chef advertises Bonsoiree as a revolution in BYOB, he's not kidding. But it's a revolution I want to experience again! If I ever win the lotto, my first stop is Bonsoiree's thirteen course menu. Check back in August 2009 for our next adventure: Graham Elliot!
