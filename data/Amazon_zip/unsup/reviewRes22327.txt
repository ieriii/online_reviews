the food was delicious .... My husband took me here for lunch on my birthday and i simply loved the place and food .we ordered the hot pot ,it was very spicy but was so delicious, we could not sop eating it ... we also got the Mongolian beef , it was so delicious ... the staff was friends but a little slow . I am surely going back to this place .
