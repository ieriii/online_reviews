This hotel is a solid 3 star SOUTH of everywhere you want to be in Chicago. That being said, be prepared for transportation needs. We took our bikes which was way fun and not too far from everywhere in Chicago that you DO want to be. Service was quite friendly. No check-ins before 3 pm. But FREE parking! Can't beat that downtown. Rooms were large. Satellite TV spotty due to weather. Awesome deep, big bath tub, comfy for two, adding potential to the romantic flare. Hotel lobby had orange flavored water as a nice touch. Beds were comfortable.
