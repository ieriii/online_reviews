I went for dinner last night for a post-birthday celebration and was definitely impressed. We were seated immediately, the staff was super friendly and attentive (shout-out to our waiter, Ryan), and best of all, it's BYOB. My friends and I split 3 rolls--the PoBoy, Spicy Crunchy Tuna, and the Alaska, and all were delicious. We also tried an appetizer that was a special--I forgot the name but it had crab inside a fried dumpling of some sort and was served on a stick, atop a bed of mango and crunchy noodles. All of the rolls were fantastic, though some of the pieces were so huge, they proved a bit difficult to eat with chopsticks, so I did feel a little tacky eating with my hands. I would recommend Coast to anyone who likes sushi, and I'll definitely be going back!
