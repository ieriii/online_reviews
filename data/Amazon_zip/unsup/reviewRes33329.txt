I really expected more on my visit here. Perhaps after reading other reviews on Yelp, that is why my dining experience did not live up to my expectations. Very dark inside and I prefer to have some ample lighting in order to view exactly what I am eating. My reservation was for 8pm, but my order was not taken until 8:30pm. It appeared to be short of staff that night. You had one woman waiting on 10 or more tables. The bartender had to come from behind the bar area to take our drink order. It was 9pm by the time our food arrived. To make matters worse, we had some jerk sitting at the table next to us complaining the entire evening, not only about the staff but also the owner. He simply would not shut up. Then he had the audacity to make sexual comments toward the only young lady waiting on tables. All the while, I just kept feeling sorry for his wife sitting at the same table with him. I think the owner should have asked him to leave. The food did take long but one dish may have been worth the wait. It was the strip/skirt steak. Perhaps about 16oz. garnished with baby potatoes and one piece of broccoli. If they added more of the sides, it would have been perfect. Another dish they should have garnished with more sides was the sausage wrapped in chicken. Tasty as it was, it lay on a thin bed of mashed potato. You can hardly tell it was there, it looked more like an appetizer than entree. I wanted to enjoy this place but perhaps I just came on a bad night. Unfortunately, there was nothing on the menu that was "To Die For" so I don't see myself going out of the way to make it back anytime soon.
