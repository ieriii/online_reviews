Absolute best vegan / vegetarian restaurant I have ever been to, and I've been to a lot.  Every time I go I think that I have just had the best meal ever. Usually I can make most food that I eat at vegan restaurants, but this place pays attention to detail. The corned beef in the reuban is pink. The chicken fried steak and gravy look real. The vegetables are fresh and in pesto. I am going again. Tonight, and I am writing this before the meal. Staff is great and you get taken care of. Value is extraordinary. I have been to SO MANY vegan places and this is by far the best. Do not miss.
