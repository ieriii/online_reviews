Garcia's is one of my fallback restaurants. It's in a great location on Lincoln Ave in the heart of Lincoln Square. The food is decently priced and pretty good. The atmosphere is open and fun. It's a place to take parents when they're visiting. Pretty safe and one of my fave restaurants in the downtown Lincoln Square area (mostly because it's not over priced and pretentious and has decent food)
