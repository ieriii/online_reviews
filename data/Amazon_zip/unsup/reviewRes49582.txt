Still a great deal for the money. Kind of like my affection, which is on sale right now for three easy payments of $29.99, but you have to call in the next ten minutes. They sell sangria and wine here now. Not sure if it's still BYOB or que es el dealio. Oh, and lessons learned over various visits: stick to the beef. I haven't waited in that sucker's line at Tango Sur since 2002. Las Tablas is almost as good meatwise, and has great yucca and decent plantains.
