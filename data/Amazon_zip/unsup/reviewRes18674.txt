For a place that touts it's burgers, they're pretty flavorless. After a few bites, my wife and I looked at each other and simultaneously asked, "Is this lean beef?" We couldn't taste the meat at all. I think the whole we-get-our-meat-from-a-fancy-NYC-butcher thing is plain stupid. I had ordered my burger medium-rare and it came out medium-well. The toppings combinations were good. I had the Slow Burn, which wasn't spicy at all, but the toppings saved the burger from being bad. My wife had a burger with arugula and Danish bleu that saved that burger, as well. The fries were the saltiest, greasiest, and crispiest fries that I ever had. I loved the first 10 that I ate, but the oozing grease--once you break the crispy shell--just got to be too much. The cheese curds were fantastic. Beer-battered. Just like you'd get them at a Wisconsin supper club. The bar is superb. Amazing selection of beer, house-infused liquors, as well as locally distilled artisanal liquors. Good service. Prices were better than expected! I would go again and order drinks and apps.
