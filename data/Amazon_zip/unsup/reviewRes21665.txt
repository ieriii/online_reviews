A Chicago institution!!! Probably not exceptionally better than any other of the historic Hot Dog stands in Chicago. It's hard to go wrong with the best Dawgs in the World. I ordered the Whoopskidawg which is described as "char-broiled version of a Romanian, Hungarian, Polish sausage; basted in our special sauce..." The fries are also amazing and my wife loved her chicken sandwich. The car hop is fun and brings you back many decades. The service is amazing and accommodating. I can't wait to go back.
