Favorite breakfast/brunch place in town!! Went here today and got my pancake fix with a helping of Banana Oreo Hotcakes. I'm pretty sure a 6 old helped fix up this concoction (what lil' kid wouldn't want this for breakfast!) and they're absolutely amazing. Bananas compliment the Oreo and the vanilla bean cream sauce and chocolate drizzled all over...its mouthwatering just writing about. I've been here several times and I've never been disappointed. I usually go during the weekdays so I can skip the wait. Other great items: veggie sandwich, salads, omelette, OJ. Its all delicious!
