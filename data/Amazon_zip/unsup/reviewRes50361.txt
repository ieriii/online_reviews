Fifty/50 has some of the best bar food in Chicago. Went there on a Monday night and their special was $1 bottles. Yeah you read correct, $1 brews. I felt like I was reliving my college days, only in the city. Comfort food best describes the menu at Fifty/50. Cheese fries, the 50 burger, chicken pot pie, and bacon wrapped meatloaf were all delicious. I wanted to just stay there all night, stay out of the cold, and keep warm with lotsa dollar bottles.
