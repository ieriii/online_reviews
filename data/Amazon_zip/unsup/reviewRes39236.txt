OMG OMG OMG OMG * I DIE *. Can I just move next to this place, seriously? Too bad I live really far away. My friend casually invited me to have brunch at this place. Without knowing anything about the restaurant, I casually thought, must be some generic American place. No, no no. The service first off was AMAZING. I can't remember the name of our waitress anymore but she remembered my friend from the previous night, was super friendly, smiling all the time, and very good at explaining the menu to us. I had a hard time deciding between fried chicken waffles, or tete the cochon, or smoked pork rillettes. I haven't gotten this excited over a meal just by reading a menu, and the prices can't be beat! I ended up with the over-the-top fried chicken & waffles, which made for two meals. I got to try my friend's tete the cochon, which was excellent as I'd expected as well. I would completely, totally come back here.
