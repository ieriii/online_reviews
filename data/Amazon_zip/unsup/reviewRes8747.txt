I came to Spacca Napoli because it's a friend's favorite pizza restaurant in the city, but was slightly disappointed. We went in the dead of winter on a Saturday night around prime dinner time, which I would have avoided if I had realized we were a group of 6 instead of my anticipated group of 3. There was a long wait, which was obviously to be expected, but there was nowhere to go during that wait. We were always in someone's way, and even when we finally got to sit by the door to wait, we froze each time the door opened. Our wait kept getting extended, and after about an hour and 45 minutes I was ready to eat my own arm. I do love that the owner comes around with appetizers while you wait, but I actually watched him throw a piece of pizza away while I stood there salivating. Food itself was really good, and once we were finally seated we were pleasantly surprised by the quick service. I'll give it another shot this summer when they have outdoor seating, but I'll probably go on a weeknight to avoid the long wait.
