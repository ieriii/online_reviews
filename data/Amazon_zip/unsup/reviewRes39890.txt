After hearing about this place for months while it was being built and setup from a friend of mine that worked at Empty Bottle, it took me way... way.... WAY too long to finally go. Last night I took my girlfriend out for a date to check this place out. Very unassuming from the outside and very comforting from the inside. Not a ton of decorative flair, but enough to keep up the ambiance. The outdoor area looked great, but it being Chicago and Chicago summers having humidity in the range of eleventy billion, we decided to adjourn to the air conditioned indoors. Opening up a monstrous beer, whiskey and scotch list, we ordered our drinks and perused their fantastic menu. From what I'd kept hearing from people, this was nothing but a meat smorgasbord. This couldn't have been any further from the truth. Granted, there were their fair share of carnivorous items on the menu, but they were peppered in beautifully with other seafood and vegetarian dishes as well as small, shareable dishes that looked to be almost tapas-style. We were told that the soft shell crab dish they normally had on the menu was available that evening but using sea bass instead of the soft shell crab. My dinner consisted of beer battered sea bass with a smoked tomato fondue, soy caramel and a pea shoot radish salad. My girlfriend ordered the pork belly porchetta with the corn-bacon risotto, summer squash, chanterelle mushrooms and black garlic emulsion. This worked out perfectly as these were the things that both of us were trying to decide between. The sea bass was beautifully prepared with the skin crisping up perfectly and her pork belly just melted in your mouth. I could see a place like this getting pretty busy on the weekends or that outdoor seating area getting slammed in the summer, but for a date night on a wednesday night it was great. I'll have another Glenfiddich on the rocks please.
