This is my favorite sushi restaurant on the north side. WE order all the time because they deliver fairly fast (within the hour) and have delicious makis. It is also the best Thai restaurant on the north side. Definitely our favorite delivery/take-out place. We've dined in a few times, and the atmosphere there is pretty nice too.
