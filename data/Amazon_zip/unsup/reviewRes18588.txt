Sat at the bar on a busy Friday night. Got there by about 6 and it was already packed! Fun to watch the bar tenders pouring all kinds of interesting brews and cocktails. What an incredible beer selection and bar menu! On par with (if not better than) some of the other awesome watering holes up in the Ravenswood/Andersonville/LSquare hoods. Food was phenomenal (if you're in a bar-food kind of mood). Amazing truffle fries. Amazing homemade veggie burger. Will be back for sure!
