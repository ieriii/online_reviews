Un. Believable.  This place deserves all the positive praise it receives... and more.  We had an incredible meal here tonight. Our server was perfectly professional + personable.... the sommelier made a great recommendation, and Chef Dirk Flannigan and his team produces some of the best food that I have ever had! Must haves: "gage" fondue, Mussels vindaloo, pork belly, halibut with horseradish, goat cheese tart with escargot, doughnut with coffee + banana semifredo with banana cake.... where do I stop? Go here. Have fun. Enjoy the Gage!
