I had a goal to make it to a new rooftop spot this summer and I accomplished that on the last day of the season. I attended a private event on their rooftop. So this is not intended to address the regular menu or service. What I can say from the experience is that the rooftop environs are pretty luxurious. What is nice is you are only a few floors up, so the surrounding buildings provided a kind of concrete and steel forest around you. Not the same as a big view from may stories up, but still very pleasant, with night lights and sampling of Chicago architecture. And the layout, the furnishings, the outdoor fireplace made for easy mingling on a cool night. The staff who served us were really gracious and polite. The food items I got to sample were appetizers, flatbreads and desserts. The appetizers were fine. Nothing to write home about. But the flatbreads were really flavorful with the cheeses, mushrooms and veggies they used. The desserts (served in little tall chunks in the shape of the Aon building) were phenomenal little bursts of sweetness and intense flavors. Try the samore concoction sometime. I could have devoured the entire tray. I did poke my head into the bar and dining areas and was impressed with the size and decor. I was expecting something narrower and smaller, perhaps because of its tiny name. But this would be a great spot to meet friends or colleagues for drinks and "snibbles", or to bring out-of-towners to impress. On this occasion, it was free; so natch, a good value. I hope to return sometime for a meal.
