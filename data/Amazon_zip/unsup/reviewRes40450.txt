Tank Noodle was pretty good. I live in Cleveland now and we came to Tank Noodle because it has "the most amazing pho." Personally, i thought there were ones in Cleveland that i was just as happy with. What I do really like about Tank though is the quantity and the price. I love that they give a good amount of food and selections on their menu. And the price is definitely affordable. Also, this place does get really packed!
