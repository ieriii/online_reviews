Start with one huge white bowl, add noodles, chicken broth, shrimp, onions, bean sprouts, pork, quail eggs, basil, lime, chicken, squid, fish cake and some greens. Then...drizzle in some fish sauce and chili sauce. Finish with one smooth and creamy avacado bubble tea with extra tapioca. Thats what Tank calls #55 Pho(with a bubble tea), and what I call a fast, easy, cheap and good meal. They also have a great selection of bubble teas and from what my ex says, the Vietnamese coffee is quite delicious. I'm a huge fan of the Pho and regularly dine at Tank. It tends to get pretty crowded and if you are looking for great service, you won't find it here. The staff is very nice...just not too attentive. You get seated, order, get your food, then pay at the counter...thats it...no service in between. It doesn't bother me much because I wouldn't expect it in a place like Tank anyway, so I'm ok with it. oh yeah, make sure not to come on Wednesdays because they are closed...I learned that...twice. Funny Story: A while back when I had gone to Tank, I had some Pho with some strange looking tofu in it. It was a dark reddish brown and my ex and I joked about it being chocolate tofu. I ate it...it wasn't chocolate :)...and didn't taste like much at all. So, a few months later, I was watching Bizzare Foods and saw Andrew in Vietnam. He was eating pho with coagulated blood cakes which looked like a brownish/reddish tofu. Could this have been the chocolate tofu that I had dined on earlier...you bet it was. Had I been armed with this knowledge at the time of consumption, I certainly would have not eaten the blood cake. I guess there is no turning back now.
