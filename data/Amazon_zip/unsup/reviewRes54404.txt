I've been going to Chicago Diner ever since I moved to Chicago. Over the years I have seen the service and quality of the food decline. My last visit was the final nail in the coffin for me. After standing in the rain for our names to be called for a table we were seated in their covered patio area. My friends and I were there for brunch and wanted to start our meal with a Mimosa, but we were told alcoholic drinks couldn't be ordered on the patio. After waiting for nearly 40 minutes for our food, we were given sub-par food that was flavorless and cold. Our waitress, Amanda, was too busy gabbing with her co-worker to check-in with us. At one point she asked if I needed coffee but never returned with my refill. I guess it was too hard for her to break away from her conversation to do her job. Instead of opening a second location, Chicago Diner should really work on improving this location first.
