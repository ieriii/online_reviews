I'm updating this based on the customer service experience we've had since last staying at the hotel. We're back in Chicago this weekend, and I was thrilled that we were able to book at the Hyatt Regency again! I feel like this hotel really has social marketing down - follow them on Twitter or "like" them on Facebook and it opens up a new world of communication. They're responsive, offer specials on parking and free wi-fi, even drink specials at the bar. It kind of made my day when I "checked in" on Yelp and got a welcome message back through Twitter!  I'm looking forward to our stay this weekend, and the Hyatt Regency is quickly becoming my hotel of choice when I'm in the Windy City.
