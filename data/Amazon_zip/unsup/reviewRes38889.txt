After coming here a half a dozen times for dinner and a handful of times for brunch (it's in the neighborhood) I am averaging this place as just so-so. If you haven't been here before it's definitely worth trying but I've really found that the service for dinner is really hit or miss (although bartenders are always great) and the food is pretty good but some items are better than others.  One of my biggest complaints lately is waiting 2 hours for dinner on a Saturday and then getting rushed though when finally getting seated at 10:30pm. The last two times I went we were waited on by the same person (Spencer? Preston?) and received instructions twice that the chef INSISTS we order all at once - I get it, it's a small kitchen...ordering all at once is fine...but don't hover over us and give us cold and pretentious service if we've waited for two hours. The most this guy paid attention to us was to make sure we knew that we needed to order all at once...and he took our plates before we were finished. With the small plates there is not much food to begin with so please let us finish it. Also, the burger that our guests ordered the last two times was way undercooked...like cold...kind-of disappointing. Anyway, right now I'm just annoyed with our service last night -- I'm sure we'll be back...hey, it's in the neighborhood so what the hell.
