Awesome for groups, awesome for dates, just awesome in general. Conveniently located right off the Western stop on the Brown Line, Opart offers quality Thai food at reasonable prices. Favorites: Peanut Sauce Spring Rolls, Peanut Sauce Lover, Massaman Curry, Woon Sen Pad Thai, Pad See-Iew, Sticky Rice, Thai Iced Tea. In the summer, they usually offer Mango Sticky Rice for dessert which is AMAZING. If you're looking for a dessert place, go to Opart. Get the mango sticky rice. And you will never be the same. I wish this wasn't a seasonal item, but I'll go back year-round anyway.
