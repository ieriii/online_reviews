If I lived in "Sex in the City" this would be my weekend brunch spot. Yolk serves up some really creative yet traditional brunch items, all the while keep the tastes up to par. I love their eggs benedict and although I go for their breakfast, their burgers and sandwiches are pretty decent too. The BEST thing about their dishes though is the fact that they serve up fresh (and I mean FRESH) fruit as a side. Everything is clean and well plated, and it's just so relaxing to be chilling here on a sunday morning/afternoon. The only downside to Yolk is the WAIT. If you're not coming here on a weekday, there always seems to be long, and everytime I go back, the line just seems to get longer and longer. But it's worth the wait, especially if you need to decide between here and Bongo Room (ugh!)
