You know that saying "There's always room for dessert"? Well that's how I feel about everything on the menu at Purple Pig. You'll find room. So, in one sitting I found room for all this: Marinated Olives Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans White Bait "French Fries of the Sea" with Lemon Aioli Whipped Feta with Cucumbers Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese Panino con Nutella- A Sweet Sandwich filled with a Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Marshmallow Cream & Bananas Sicilian Iris- Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche Okay, I did have some help... but my help also had room for: Chorizo Stuffed Olives Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs Oh, and there were a few drinks along the way. Some red wine (naturally) and then a lil Italian stout with a bit of chili pepper in it to go with dessert. So yeah, we defo fulfilled the piggy part of our dining experience. My boyfriend considers this the end all be all of all his dining experiences. I'll say that it's defo up there in the top 10 for me. We were lucky enough to sit 'Chef's Side' at the end of the bar, facing/connected to the kitchen area. We saw how every dish was prepared and got to see what the rest of the restaurant was ordering- and that kept us ordering more. It's amazing to see what they can do in such a tiny kitchen area and how all the chef's (who are all insanely smokin' gorg... seriously- they so hot, they don't even need an oven up in this piece) work together to make everything come together. Of the 9 different plates I had, I remember saying "this is the best thing I've ever eaten" after 8 of them, with the only exception being the Sea Fries- which weren't bad but I'd say they were like a 'Black Cat' when the rest of the plates were full blown fireworks on the friggin' 4th of July. Will we be back? Well, I'll put it this way: Does the Pope sh*t in the woods? See you soon, PP!
