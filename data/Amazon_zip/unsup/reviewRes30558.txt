Planned a birthday dinner for my best friend here. A group of 15 of us went and it started off good. The waiter was not friendly at all. He did not look happy serving us.  My boyfriend and my friend ordered the steak and the waiter brought out everyone else's food but theirs. We thought it was going to take a while for it to cook, but 20 minutes passed and we asked the waiter when the food was going to come out, and he said he forgot. My boyfriend did not want the steak anymore and he was upset that the waiter forgot his order because he was the first one to order. The waiter was rude when he served a plate of sushi unto our table. He accidentally knocked over the soy sauce all over the table and did not bother cleaning it up or offering to. No apology either!. The food was not worth it and the service sucked! It was a horrible experience! I don't think I'll ever come here again!
