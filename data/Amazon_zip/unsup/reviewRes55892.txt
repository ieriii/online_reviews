Loved the food again, will keep coming. Loved the ambience and the waitress was great. I've read the reviews and didn't realize that they had live music and hope to come when they do. This is my 4th time there and won't be my last, but am slightly disappointed that the past two times I was there the very cordial owner wasn't there nor was his very pretty girlfriend. It was nice to see them enjoying the restaurant and schmoozing the customers. Oh well, I'll keep coming whether they are there or not.
