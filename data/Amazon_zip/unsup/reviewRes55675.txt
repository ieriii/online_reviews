It's amazing that the best fish I've had in the city is in this location. Fresh fish prepared in really unique ways. Great service. Good crowd. Laid-back atmosphere complete with cereal boxes behind the bar and a chalkboard menu.If you go, don't even think about anything on the printed menu - go straight for the chalkboard (brunch or dinner). Pretzelled walleye is amazing, as is the arctic char with spicy shrimp sauce. Jumbo bloody mary is presented with enormous shrimp and other tasty garnishes. If you're heading to Glenn's though, do understand that it's not your typical diner - make a reservation or be prepared to wait, even on weeknights when they run specials.
