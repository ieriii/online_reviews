I went to Fifty/50 for happy hour with a company that usually doesn't venture to these neck of the woods. It was nice to see that they were expanding their horizons. That is, until I stepped foot in this joint. I'm of the same sentiment as most people -- if I wanted to go to a Lincoln Park bar -- I would've taken a cab there. Ooo I really wanted to give this place 1 star!! But alas, the food was really good. The portions were huge. Loved the sweet potato fries. We were even given free sliders but I was too stuffed to eat it. Sigh, they know the way to my heart -- through my stomach.
