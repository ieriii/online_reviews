Gooey, heavy and stinkin delicious. Yes the wait was about 45 minutes at 4pm on a weekday but I think it was totally worth it. My friend and I split a 10in pizza with 3 toppings and we both barely finished 2 slices each. I was really surprised by the crust, it seemed more like a crumbly pastry to me but I really really liked it. A little too much cheese for my taste but eh, how often will I really eat authentic Chicago deep dish pizza? There was a large group of us (14) and we were accommodated well and in good time. After we all finished we walked [very] leisurely back to the hotel and passed out in our own individual food comas. We all had leftovers but those brave enough to eat theirs were still satisfied with the taste though the crust had lost a bit of its magic. All in all, I'd say the trip to Giordano's was worth it and I'd go back.... after losing all this cheese weight I gained.
