I went with two vegetarian friends last night to the Chicago Diner. I've heard good things from some of my friends, but I wasn't exactly excited to go. I will admit that I am a meat eater and as bad as it is for me, I will eat the most processed, salty, terrible foods if I think it tastes good. I got the "chicken" c-zar sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. The first bite of my sandwich was pretty good. The sauce was a little on the salty side. I assume that's because the "chicken" patty didn't have much flavor. Halfway through my sandwich, I didn't enjoy the taste as much. The salty c-zar sauce was getting to be too much, and the gravy from the mashed potatoes was getting to me too. I ended up eating about three spoonfuls of the mashed potatoes and half my sandwich, and I usually finish my meals. I think initially, the place exceeded my expectations, but I'm not vegan/vegetarian so I can't appreciate the complexity/rarity of the meal. I did try some of my friend's sweet potato fries, and they were VERY good.
