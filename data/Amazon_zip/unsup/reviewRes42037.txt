I think Art of Pizza is a lot better than we experienced tonight. Seems like a lot of Yelpers just order for carryout, which is totally fine. We dined in tonight and it was decent. Anyway, we came to AoP tonight around 7pm and there were plenty of tables available. Somebody else best described the dining room as something out of a high school cafeteria. Very casual, almost makes you feel like you could bring your own food. One bit of advice - if you dine in when it's cold out, it'll likely be cold in the dining room as well. AoP doesn't go out of their way to keep their dining room warm. (Their door isn't blocked off, so everytime it opens, a nice cool breeze comes in.) The stuffed pizza takes roughly 45 minutes and they do accept call aheads, so if you want to dine in, you could call ahead and save some time. Due to time constraints, we had to get the thin crust pizza. It wasn't bad at all - but probably not the best of AoP.  We'll return - most likely we'll do carry out and have a lot different experience.
