My favorite thing about La Pasadita is that they confuse the hell out of you by having a few locations right next to/across the street from one another. It always makes me laugh. I usually go to the location farthest North on the West side of Ashland. I love this place. They do things the way it was intended to be done. I ordered 2 steak tacos and they come with onions and cilantro. Simple and delicious. I'm a big tomato fan and had them throw some tomatoes on since I was feeling frisky this afternoon. The reason I recommend this place is that I never get those big fatty chunks of meat in my steak. There's nothing worse than digging a fat chunk out of your mouth mid-chew and leaving it on your plate for others to stare at while finishing your dinner. Besides that, the steak is incredibly tasty. Not sure what cut/marinade they use but I really love the flavor. They also have big squirt bottles of green salsa sitting out on the counter for you to grab as you sit down for a little extra kick. La Pasadita can't be beat. It's not just cheap food, it's authentic, great tasting Mexican food that you must try. Stop in anytime and give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.
