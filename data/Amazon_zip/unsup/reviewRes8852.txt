First, the pizza is fantastic! Perfect crust, and toppings are fresh. Cheeses and ingredients are flown in from Italy, so you're getting authentic taste and preparation. Second, there is a wonderful sense of community that owner Jonathan Goldsmith creates, from the moment you walk in, to the moment you leave. He shares appetizers with those waiting for a table, and hands out cannolis as his guests leave. Jonathan takes time to get to know his customers, and reaches out in ways that most busy restaurant owners can't seem to find time to. You will definitely feel at home in his restaurant! We have been dining at Spacca Napoli for some time, and will continue to do so, knowing we'll have a delicious meal, served by friendly staff and a generous owner.
