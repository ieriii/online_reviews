To this day...even after moving from Chicago almost 3 years ago I still consider this my favorite brunch place. The lines are long especially on Saturday or Sunday afternoons but it's worth the wait especially if it's a nice day outside. I still crave the egg benedict to this day. make sure you share your plates so someone in your group can order the specialty pancakes. Make sure you get the coffee as well...I know it's just coffee but for some reason my gf at the time and I loved it...
