Wow, what to say that hasn't been said in other 490 reviews to date?! Ok, how about this...Sunda isn't easy to get into. YEAH...I said it! Now deal with it...Make your rezzy in advance, but I'll tell ya...it's well worth it! No celebrity sightings for me...but you know what?! Who gives...I went for the tasty food! I may have drank a little too much and definitely ate a little too much, but left a happy camper and am looking forward to our next visit to wash, rinse and repeat all over again. Yay Sunda!
