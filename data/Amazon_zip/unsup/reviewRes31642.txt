My friend and I went to Nana yesterday and the food and service was great. I had a nanadict, which was a huge portion of delicioso. My friend had the El Gallo Negro, which she enjoyed. Some people were complaining about the portion size but I thought it was more than enough food. I am willing to pay a little more for quality ingredients as well--which Nana had. There was only one glitch while we were there, the power went out and we had to go to an ATM for cash. That is why 5 stars became 4.
