Cute brunch gem in Bridgeport! I took my family here one Saturday, and my suburbanite parents absolutely loved it! (I think they were also excited because they saw it on the Food Network). It's a sunny, warm space with personality. The standout dishes include the banana granola pancakes (my dad is so cute; he kept saying how he's never had pancakes that good before!) and the huevos rancheros. They also have some creative brunch drinks past the standard bloody mary-- would like to try these next time!
