They have an extensive wine & cheese menu which is AWESOME! Be prepared to drop some money for some small portions.  My husband and I came here on a cold rainy night, finding ourselves waiting for 45 minutes. After such a long wait we were hoping to at least get an intimate table together.. but only bar seating was available. There's a huge bar high table in the middle of the room shared by plenty others! It was a neat experience, but I was cold/wet and just want to sit and unwind. I couldn't find any hooks to place my purse anywhere or my coat so that already put me off to a bad start (if they had some underneath the table that'd be perfect! The bone marrow was a little messy to eat, and sadly it was just OK.. I think if it were cut in half we would've enjoyed it more. the purple 'pig' says it all - i didn't find very many (if none at all) - veggie options. if you're a meat/pork eater & feel like dropping money for small portions, this is the perfect place for you!
