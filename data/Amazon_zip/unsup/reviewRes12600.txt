OK, I feel like I need to start going to some crappy restaurants because the vast majority of my reviews are positive. This one is no different. My wife and I went to Cafe 28 last night and brought her brother with us since he was visiting from New Orleans. We had a Groupon so that helped motivate us to finally go. The appearance from the outside does not do it justice inside. Not to mention, looking in through the windows it is not obvious how nice and modern the interior is and the good vibe that you get once inside. Though we did not sit in the bar, it had ample room if you were looking to get a drink while waiting for a table. They have many spanish/cuban focused drinks on the menu which is nice. When we sat down, the waiter was prompt and timely with asking us for our drink choices as well as waiting for us to finish our appetizer before delivering our dinners. Having worked in a country club dining environment, well timed entree delivery is a big bonus. We all ordered meals that consisted of large meat portions. My Cuban Roast Pork was very good even though it was a little more dry than I was anticipating. I still enjoyed it immensely. I don't recall what my wife and her brother had specifically, but I know that they both loved their dishes as well. Within a few bites of receiving our dishes, we were sharing bites with each other (always a good sign). Even without the Groupon our bill was reasonable for the three of us. I have no hesitation about returning here next time and would gladly take visiting guests again.
