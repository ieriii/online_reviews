Yes! I've been waiting forever to eat brunch here. Finally we all broke down and went. Whiskey bloody mary? Excuse me, but did you just make all of my fantasies come true. Give me this sweet nectar of the gods in my mouth now! Delicious. I had the pinky toe crab benedict and it was so good. Not overly lemon-y. Perfect! My friends had the tuna and the burger and both were really happy.
