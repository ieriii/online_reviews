I think this is the BEST deep dish pizza in Chicago. Granted, I am a tourist and not a Chicago-native, but this pizza beats Giordano, Unos, and Gino's East. I love how the crust is thin and crispy..a deep dish pizza without all the bread. Also, the pizza sauce is just plain tasty. How can you go wrong with a pizzeria with a mascot that boasts a Whale wearing a Thong on its head? =) I dream about this pizza...seriously...it was that good.
