So, so tasty. I am a big fan of tapas, and had never tried Catalonian-inspired tapas -- I was definitely inspired myself!  I met a friend for a drink at the downstairs bar, where the service was friendly and the Spanish wine options delicious. I enjoy a temprenillo or granache, and they had many varieties (and varietals) of each. Even though we got there at 7pm, they didn't mind that we just wanted to hang at the bar for a bit past our reservation, and kept our table ready. The food -- what can I say? You just can't go wrong with a meat and cheese plate. Period. The jamon serrano and chorizo plates were HUGE (probably could've gone with one or the other) and the goat and cow cheese were a delightful pairing. I've never seen nutella involved in a cheese plate, but I am officially converted. Bring on the chocolate AND cheese! We then shared the squash dumplings with lamb ragout and bacon, which was a titch salty but still quite tasty. The gambas ajilo were nicely sized, as sometimes you get the little baby-looking tidbit shrimp -- these were nice and meaty. Then the shortrib flatbread, which was a heavenly end to the meal. I couldn't possibly fit any more food or wine in my body by the end, so I'll have to go back for dessert!
