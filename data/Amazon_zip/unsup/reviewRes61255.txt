Sad to say, it's gone downhill big time since they remodeled. I don't get it...did they hire all new cooks? is it different management that just doesn't care? I used to love their burritos and tortas here so so much. Garcia's was an institution. me and my girlfriend both loved the place, were regulars. However, We've been there twice in the last few months since they re-opened and our dinners were just awful. On both occasions the meat was burnt and unedible in our dishes. On the last occasion my Al Pastor Torta was so burnt, there was no flavor beyond the burnt meat itself. Charred to a charcoal back, all the meat. How could they serve that? the first time we were disappointed, but we wanted to give them another chance, but when that happens twice in a row, something's wrong. We won't be coming back, and were loyal customers for years. what HAPPENED?
