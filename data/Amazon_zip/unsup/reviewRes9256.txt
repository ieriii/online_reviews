I love when my old boss wants to catch up over lunch. Since he's a food and wine snob it means that I get to go somewhere yummy, typically a place I wouldn't (read: shouldn't) be able to afford on my law student budget. Since I am a picky eater I scoped out the menu ahead of time to get an idea of what I wanted. Service was pretty attentive. It was a touch slow when we were ready to order and again when we were ready to pay. I think it was because they didn't want to interrupt us while we talked. I ordered an iced tea, which I will warn you usually comes with a shot of orange juice in it, since I hate sweet tea of any persuasion I asked them to leave the juice out. I ordered #23 and my old boss #29 with the #12 soup to start.** He said the soup was fantastic and I'll guess by his clean plate that he enjoyed his main dish too. My dish was so good; the asparagus was fresh, they were generous with the shrimp and it had the perfect amount of spice. We were so into our dishes that we didn't think to share with each other like we usually do. My only complaint about this place is the cramped quarters. They could stand to get rid of one or two tables and create a little more breathing space in the restaurant. Bottom line: Solid food, solid service, if my budget can swing it or someone else is buying I'd definitely come back. ** Kudos, Le Colonial for numbering the items on your menu so I don't look and sound like a total n00b painfully butchering the the names of the dishes on your menu.
