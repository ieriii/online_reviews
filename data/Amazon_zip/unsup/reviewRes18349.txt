The burger I tried here at The Bad Apple had an impressive concept--thoughtful and unique ingredients--but it was a little underwhelming. I ordered the Edmund Fig-Gerald- a burger topped with goat cheese, smoked onion, and fig & bacon relish. Sounds promising but the flavors of the added ingredients were so subtle I might as well have just ordered a plain burger. I also asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare which was ignored or forgotten. The decor here is more unrefined sports bar than sleek gastropub. Cheap and tacky halloween decorations were displayed all over which was an eyesore.  The beer list here is pretty ample. Holler.
