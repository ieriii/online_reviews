Just had a really annoying experience here. And this is based solely on customer service, since I didn't get a chance to try their food. Since I've seen this place packed with a line out the door many times before, I expected service that was used to the Friday night dinner rush, but they just seemed unprepared and chaotic.I came with one other person to meet someone who was already there (I decided to go last minute). Went to go find her ourselves. since the host said they don't seat incomplete parties, but yes, she was sitting in the back waiting at a 2-top (which makes sense since they were originally a party of 2).They said that they couldn't add another chair, so we asked to wait for a table to open up that we could fit at. But they said no, they can't do that (which is kind of weird, right? Even if there is a waiting list!). So, obviously, we decided to go somewhere else. I stood there while my friend waited to get her check for her drink from her server, but not for long--as I was very rudely asked to not stand by the table (and yes, I understand being busy and stressed out, but no need to be rude to customers). Needless to say, I hurried out of there feeling very unwelcomed and slightly confused at why a restaurant wouldn't at least try and accommodate.
