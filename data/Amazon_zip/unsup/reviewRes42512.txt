We ordered two medium pizzas for delivery last night and I have to say, I was a little underwhelmed. The pizza was good, but nothing spectacular. It was a little expensive, and all of the pizzas sounded really good, but when they came, they were smaller than I expected and nothing to rave about. With all the delicious pizza places in the area, I have to say, I think I'll be passing on Fogo 2 Go next time. It's good, but not good enough for the price.
