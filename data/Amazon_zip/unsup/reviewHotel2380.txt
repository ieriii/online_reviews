The interior in this place expired two decades ago. Peeling paint on my bathroom ceiling. The ice bucket is right out of 1980's as all the decor. Charges for everything. Internet @ $15 dollars a day. Seriously, I get much more modern accomodations with everything included at a Red Roof Inn.... The Red Roof would even have a Fridge and microwave. This place just has an empty cabinet where the must have one been a fridge... It is clean even if used up. However, it is 3 times the price of equal or better accomodations around. The TV's are at least modern... If the convention I am attending wasn't being held here I would seek better accomodations for less money. Pathetic compared to what someone would expect fron a Hilton....
