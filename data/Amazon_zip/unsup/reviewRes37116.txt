My meal last night at the Hopleaf has upped the stars to five! A great beer and food menu along with consistently great service has made this a go-to place for a meal I know will not disappoint. Each of the following are excellent: - Sausage appetizer with beans - Poached pear salad with stilton blue cheese - Bread pudding - Mussels - Brisket - Steak frite You just can't go wrong here with anything on the menu. Enjoy!
