Staff was GREAT! This makes the dinner experience so much better. Food was good. I could not decide between the Leg of Lamb and the Moussaka (Eggplant Casserole). Then my friend pointed out that they have combo dinners! I choose the two and we all shared the Appetizer Spread Combo (Feta & Chili, Eggplant and some Roe spread). I thought all the flavors were very mild but like the Roe Spread the best. We also got the flaming cheese and it WAS GREAT. Best described as salty Cheez-it, very good. I tried some Orange Greek Sausage from a friend, and thought it had very good flavor.
