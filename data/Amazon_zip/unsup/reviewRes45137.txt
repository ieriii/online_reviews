Having spent some time here in its previous incarnation, I always get a smile when going into Anteprima.  That smile generally stays. The space is pretty. The service is always professional and knowledgeable. The menu is large and wide-ranging. The pastas are fresh and delicious. And it doesn't cost a fortune. Big fan.
