Nana's is a wonderful place. I may be just a little bias because I love little family owned joints with that "at home" feeling, but this place has great food and awesome cocktails. I found out about Nana's from a friend who traveled from Orland to the city after seeing the restaurant on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. I had to check it out once she spoke so highly about the Oyster Po-Boy sandwich. Let me tell you people that this place is not for just brunch. This sandwich is one of the best po-boys I have ever had. I am a fish fanatic and I will slap anything swimming on some bread with some sauce ....with the exception of sardines. I love a place I can sit and relax. I don't like to be rushed when I'm eating. So with that being said start out with a cocktail (CREOLE MANHATTAN) from the bar. Actually start with two of those. Get a nice salad....have a nice conversation.....get another cocktail.....eat the po-boy.....get another creole manhattan. If you are looking for quick on the go food go to McDonald's. Nana's is a organic restaurant. Hint: The experience should be organic.   Never had brunch at Nana's but dinner is a 4 thumbs up (I count my guys thumbs also). Sent friends from Evanston and Westchester here for that sandwich and we all agree. Nana's is good stuff.
