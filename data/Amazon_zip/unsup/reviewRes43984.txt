I've been here 3 times, each time ordering something different, and every time it has been delicious. The prices are very reasonable too. The only drawback would be crowdedness, but if you can stand waiting for a table, then its ok. Or,...take it to go. I don't like being surrounded by toddlers and babies, so if you're like me, try to get a table away from them or...take your food to go like I said before :) I've tried the pancakes of the day....big portion, fresh tasting. I've had the smoked salmon plate which I think is the best bang for your buck. It comes with chive cream cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, capers, onions, and a warm toasty bagel! The hot chocolate is rich and frothy, and I think it was February when it arrived with a pink heart marshmallow and chocolate sauce drizzle on top. The a la carte chicken sausage is flavorful....kinda sweet tasting. I haven't tried any baked goods there but they look nice in the bakery case. What else? I had a chicken sandwich there....nice crusty bread,...the chicken didn't taste like the grill, and it came with chips. I will be back a fourth time. And more.
