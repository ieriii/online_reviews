Let's be candid and quick about this. The atmosphere at Geja's is hands-down the most romantic of any restaurant I've been to outside of Europe. It's glorious! Reserve a booth if you're smart. That way you don't have servers brushing against your back, which is only mildly bothersome, but distracting nonetheless. Here is my opinion about fondue: stick with the cheese and chocolate. That goes for all fondue (What's special about plain meat in oil? and it's way too pricey. You know what fondue is supposed to be made out of? Leftovers. The fanciness is a uniquely American thing.) The cheese and chocolate combo with a bottle of wine won't make your wallet cry like the oil-boiled meat dishes will. The guitarists add to the atmosphere, and I enjoy them more than I do at most restaurants. They keep it classy. If you live in Chicago, like bread, cheese, and chocolate, and enjoy dimly lit basement restaurants with curtained booths, you simply have to go at least once. And my final piece of advice is this: Do not wait until Valentine's Day.
