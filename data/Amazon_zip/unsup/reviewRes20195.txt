Hello fabulous.  Been going since the place since it opened and I have to say this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Their cocktails are marvelous, the servers are knowledgeable and just a bit flamboyant (it's hard to describe a carrot puree with pizazz, but they pull it off), and an ever changing menu of dishes that sometimes sound odd but are always brilliant. Their fondue is my go-to appetizer, their duck is perfection and always has some interesting fruit reduction to accompany it, and don't miss out on their life-changing dessert menu. Feels classy and casual at the same time, one of the best places downtown for brunch. Best. Corned Beef Hash. Ever. Go there this weekend for brunch and order it. Great with their Gage bloody mary.  Unfortunately gets a bit noisy at their peak hours but the back sections are usually quieter and have better ambiance.  The owner, Billy, is very friendly and always stops by our table to say a few words and if you're lucky he may even tell you a dirty joke.
