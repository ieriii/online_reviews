I have been coming here for the last several years, it's a great deal for lunch, a personalized pan pizza and a drink for 4.95. I know that it takes at least 20 mins to prepare a pizza, especially at lunch, so I call my order in ahead of time, knowing what I want. After years of eating the pan pizza here, I wanted to try the thin crust pizza, so I ordered a thin 12" sausage (also knowing there would be leftovers) and my wife ordered her usual lunch special, the pan, spinach pizza. We arrive within 15 mins, the food does not get to our table for another 20 mins, first time this has ever happened ..(was my order put in when I called? I don't think so.) My wife's Pizza was it's usual fine self, good crust and all that as you can see from other reviews, this time not enough caramelized crust though in my opinion. What they pass off as thin crust pizza is not thin crust at all. They should just call it their regular pizza, lots of dough, too much for me to be called thin crust, it was OK, not what I expected though. The server, who I have seen there on many visits was busy. She got some help from some of the male staff that were just looking for something to do. Part of my wife's deal was a drink with her pizza, but the charge for refills was not explained, might have been on the menu, but we ordered on the phone), OK I guess, but the waitress asked my wife if she wanted some more diet coke, the glass was 1/4 full grabbed the glass refilled it and charged us 2.50 for that!  The manager took the 2.50 off the tab, which was about the tip for the meal anyway...(little less)  Bottom line: They need more staff for lunch service, explain charges, make a thin crust pizza, rename what you now call thin crust to regular pizza. It really reminded me of Chucky Cheese, which is sad. I will come back, but it is going to be at least 6 months or more for me.I need to give this place a rest.
