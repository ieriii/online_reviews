This place was not worth anything... The ambiance was nice and everything... kind of cool that the waitresses come to your little parking spot... but the food... was HORRIBLE... I paid 7 dollars for a Polish and fries... an extra fry that happened to be cold and hard the size of mcdonalds happy meal cost me another 3 dollars... and I ordered a side of disgusting cheese for my fries that costed me 2 dollars... the total came out to about 12-13 dollars for a polish and some cheese fries... Not only was it a rip off... but I was not happy with my meal...will not reccomend to anybody
