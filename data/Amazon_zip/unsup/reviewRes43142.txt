Gilt Bar was good - my husband and I went for our anniversary. The ONLY reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because there are just so many amazing restaurants in Chicago, and Gilt Bar doesn't quite live up to the best ones. It was very good food, a couple of items a bit too salty, but a fun atmosphere and cool space. If this place were located in a different city with a less amazing food scene, it would probably stand out more. Decent meal though - we enjoyed ourselves.
