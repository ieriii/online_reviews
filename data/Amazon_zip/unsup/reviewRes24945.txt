I adore this place! Super-friendly staff, great European ambiance, and the BEST food in Greektown! When I lived in Chicago, I'd order the Chicken Caesar Salad and Lemon Rice Soup almost nightly. I always loved how they'd send me off with some toasty-hot bread and butter in my "to go" bag, to boot -- so nice! Expect a charming, European cafe/bar vibe if you plan to eat-in...and fresh, made-on-the-spot food if you're in the mood for take-out. Artopolis is always my first food-stop whenever I'm back in town...take advantage of it while you live nearby!
