Wow! Just had dinner there the for the first time recently. I'm not usually a big pork or ham person, but theirs is insanely good! It practically melts in your mouth. Also, the duck fat fries are unbelievable. Their beer is also good. Expect a community style open atmosphere. Brunch also won't disappoint. Highly recommend this place.
