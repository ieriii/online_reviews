Best sushi in Chicago! Freshest, best tasting and super high quality fish. Their soups are excellent too. It is BYOB and so avoid this place like the plaque on Friday and Sat nites when you will be standing with pre late nite clubbers in their gear and their six packs waiting to pound their budweisers. For the best experience, go early during the week when you can relax with normal humanity and enjoy this most wonderful sushi.... two words...white dragon! YUM!
