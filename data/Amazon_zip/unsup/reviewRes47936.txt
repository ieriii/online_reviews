On a long weekend to Chicago, with a late Sunday flight home, were looking for a good place for brunch/lunch that would see us through the day. This was it ! It's similar to a Brazilian steakhouse with food served directly at the table and a salad bar ( Harvest Tables) that you can visit as much as you like. Personally I found the Harvest Table fare a little disappointing as many items were too sweet, but this was brunch so that was to be expected. The table service food, however was excellent. Rib roast, turkey breast, ham, linguisa and salmon (though I don't usually eat farmed salmon) were all perfectly cooked and served freshly cooked from the kitchen. There were also more brunch-like egg based dishes - a poached egg on spinach and a frittata-like dish with corned beef. The servers will keep coming until you throw in the towel - or rock in this case. We definitely ate enough not to be hungry the rest of the day. $24 per person was a very reasonable price for the food offered, though we spent double that as we had a bottle of wine in addition to a sangria and a flight of wine ( 3 x 2oz for $12). Actually the wine selection was reasonably priced in comparison to some of the other Chicago menus I had seen.  All the staff were friendly and very attentive - we arrived at 1pm, there were only a few tables occupied, so I don't know if that applies during busier times. Unfortunately, I probably won't get back to Chicago for years, so I won't be able to check out the dinner at this place.
