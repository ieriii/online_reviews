Sultan's used to be one of my fave middle eastern eats in the hood but after having a chicken shwarma pita, my opinion has changed dramatically. The falafel is good but skip the chicken shwarma, it is a lot of dark meat and very fatty and I bit into a few bones during the eating, not cool. I would stick to their vegetarian options here and go to Taza and Oasis downtown for some really good shwarma!!
