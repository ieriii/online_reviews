I need to do my part to get Sultan's 5 stars. It's confusing that this restaurant would be anything less. This is the freshest, most delicious falafel I've ever had. Their lamb schwarma, lentil soup, and hummus are great. I have been eating at Sultan's for years and years, and never gotten sick of it. Yes, you have to brave the Wicker Park scenesters to get here, but it's tasty and cheap and the staff is friendly so go for it!
