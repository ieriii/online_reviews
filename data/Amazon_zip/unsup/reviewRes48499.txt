I like this place!! I stopped in before a Bulls game with a friend and had some really tasty beer and yummy food. The place is set up super cool, with an awesome decor. We walked in and didn't have to wait at all, which was awesome because it was super busy. The Publican is based around an impressive beer list. I can't remember what I had, but it was yummy. I let my friend order because he had been here quite a few times, and to be honest, I found the menu a little intimidating. I wasn't sure what I would like. We ended up with scallops and a ham dish. Both dishes were gone very quickly and were very tasty. The server was very helpful picking out drinks and food to share.  I'd like to try this place again because we were in a bit of a hurry and not able to take in the place for an extended period of time. Hopefully I'll be able to update this review soon!!
