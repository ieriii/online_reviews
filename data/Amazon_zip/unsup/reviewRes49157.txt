I think I like the weay Heather H described the place. 5 stars for bubbly, cheese and service. 3.575 stars for overall ambiance. I walked in and thought, I love the openess, the attentiveness of the waitress, the soft music piping throughout the restaurant. I visited because of other business, but I decided to experience the flight and cheese experience. I sat down at the bar and was instantly greeted by J & J, the best bartenders I've encountered since I've been in Chicago. You'll know this duo if you ever visit. They asked what I wanted, explained the menu to me, offered up suggestions. They were not impatient or pushy, but realll chill.. what more could a gal ask for. I had a champagne flight that was fab and the cheese is heavenly. A deadly, deadly combination. Considering what I got and where, it was fairly priced. Will I come every day, no, but could I come at least once a month, I believeth so. Did I mention the cheese being awesome??? Whew. I didn't even scratch the surface. Now I had to downgrade the rating because of ambiance. I think it is a great date spot or maybe an outing for girlfriends. However, if you are single at the bar, you bestabe (-- yes I wrote that) comfortable with yourself and ability to have a good time solely on your own (and with the bartenders).
