i dont know why i am writing this. there are already hundreds of reviews. buuut i had a great time! i was a groupon customer but had been planning on going there anyway so it just sort of worked out. wonderrrrful ambiance! i know lots of people have said its a date place. yes, yes it is. but i was there with the family + boyfriend and it wasnt awkward or anything. i think itd be fine with a group of girlfriends or something too. it's just super cute in there. and i now get why they dont let little kids in there... itd be sorta weird. we only had dessert and drinks so i cant vouch for the meat and cheese fondues. the chocolate was wonderful- flamed with orange, and it really did give it a distinctive taste. tons of fresh fruit and marshmallows to dip in it. they were very generous with the fruit and even brought us extra just because. it was different than normal chocolate fondue because of the orange so id say it doesnt quite compare to melting pot. the drinks were also great. i had their white sangria, which was really refreshing and crisp. my co-diners had a mix of champagne, wine, and spiked coffee, and all were happy. i will definitely be back. that cheese fondue is calling to me. this is more of a "sometimes" restaurant than a "Every week" restaurant, so i think they could always use some new clientele.
