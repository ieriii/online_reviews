Mastro's bar area is lively and a good place for drinks and a few appetizers. The seafood tower is creative and interesting....good shrimp, crab legs, and lobster tail. If you're ordering oysters, I'd recommend the East Coast oysters. The West Coast ones taste fishy and leave an aftertaste. For drinks, I had a delicious pink fruity martini and had a taste of the Skinny Diablo (with jalapeno and red pepper)--also pretty good and not too spicy. Service was attentive. Crowd was a bit Viagra Triangle. Viagra Triangle is creeping into River North, yikes! A pianist plays live music, but you can barely hear him over the noise.
