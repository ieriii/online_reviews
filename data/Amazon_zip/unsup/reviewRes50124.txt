I'm a big fan of their food, but like their name, I'm split Fifty/50 when it comes to their drinks: Drinks are too pricy for a so-called sports bar and the wine is definitely poured on the stingy side. However, I loved their "beer-cocktails", which are margaritas or fruity drunks that are actually beer-based so it's cuts the sweetness a bit.  Food on the other hand is not like "bar food" and is much more reasonably priced. Plus their kitchen stays open until 1am everyday! I recommend the Sliders, Chicken BLT salad, custom Mac-n-Cheese, and my all time favorite... their SWEET POTATO FRIES. Fifty/50 earned an extra star from me tonight since I'm craving them now as I type this :) Final Note: I think they are a little confused with their Sports-Bar persona (even thought they sell 40-ouncers in brown paper bags). I would never go there to watch a game - totally wrong atmosphere. Heading to Fifty/50 with friends for some great comfort-food however is recommended.
