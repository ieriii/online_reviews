This place is an ok brew-pub disguised as a pizza joint. The former place of "employment" of those pesky Real-Worlders, is located downtown Wicker Park and offers a large enough space for a decent size group to enjoy some pizza. The white is my personal favorite type. I have been here on nights for Kareoke. Maybe it was just when I was there, but people weren't really into it. I wouldn't stay out of it, but I don't know if I will be running back here anytime soon
