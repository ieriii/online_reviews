I could eat JUST chifrijo for dinner and I'd be completely satisfied! But since I'm me and I require lots of food, I ordered tons of food! Bf and I split the pepito sandwich (which someone mentioned tasted just like a philly cheese steak) tasty, but not special. We also shared the steak tico which was very good and HUGE with a good amount of rib eye steak. My only complaint was that the steak came with a lot of fat. Since we were a party of 7, I got to try lots of stuff! Happiness all around! The tilapia was super moist, chicken was well herbed, the guacamole delicious and good texture and the liver..well it was livery. Even with the hour wait, I'd say the meal still lived up to the hype and I'd definitely go again. While we were waiting, the host offered to open our wine and let us drink and wait. My suggestion: DEFINITELY take him up on the offer. It gets super busy on the weekends and you never know how long the wait will be. Drink your wine so you can fight the urge to crash through the windows and steal bites off of another customer's plate! The delicious aromas wafting through the air can be very enticing!
