Dill ... It's all about the Dill here. When has dill failed you? Dill Pickles? Never, they rock the casbah! Just ask Jovny, The Vlasic Stork. What about Katie Dill? She would never let you down!! I suggest seeking her out and becoming her friend! Anyway, the Point is ... Dill ... This place gives you an option with your dishes, regular rice... or DILL RICE! First off who doesnt love options? Regular people, thats who! The rice was a perfect compliment to my dish! It wasnt over powering, and to be honest, rice is amazing in general I ordered the Lamb shank and Koubidah which I would highly recommend! It was rich in flavors, cooked perfect (As my granmother would say "The meats like butter, it just melts in your mouht) and the koubidah .... well it was pretty much the Kooouuulest pressed meat ive ever had. (though it resembles a mcrib , which probably doesnt sound remotely appealing ... but alas, looks can be deceiving) The service was top notch, and the waiter was on his A game, and the pita, feta and onion they give you to nosh on before dinner is an added bonus. Now, I wouldnt recommend the pomegranate portabellas, unless you really like super sweet things. they were like candy, and I cant say I like mushroom candy. its just not me. But, since its just a matter of taste I wont let it take away from the fact I still think this place deserves all 5 stars.
