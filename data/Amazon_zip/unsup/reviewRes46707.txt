Think twice before you enter into what I would deem a "Hell on Earth". While the food is OK, this place is swamped on the weekends with Lincoln Park couples and their kids. I have a two year old that goes out with us everywhere so I understand what it is like to eat with kids, but it seems as though all the parents just ignore their kids once they enter the door. Service was fine and the food came quite quickly, but there are better places to get a sandwich in the city where you do not have to fight through what looks like a 24/7 elementary school field trip. Also make ensure that you make a reservation or you will be waiting for a table.
