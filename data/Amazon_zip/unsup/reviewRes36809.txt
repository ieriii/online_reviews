Love this place! There is usually a wait after 9 am on the weekend, but they move things along quickly, and you can stand outside since they give you a buzzer when you check in. I have had their orange juice and coffee, both are delicious. Friends have tried their smoothies and said very positive things about them...I tend to save myself for the savory though. I have had both breakfast and lunch food here. I absolutely adore the tenderloin skillet. In fact, it is difficult to order anything else because it is that good. I have ventured off the breakfast menu and tried a panini. The paninis are also quiet good, but I still play favorites with their skillets. Not the least expensive place for brunch, but it is always a nice treat and a great place to bring friends and family visiting Chicago!
