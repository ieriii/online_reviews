Chicago Diner is a good veggie staple. The food here can be variable. I've ordered some really amazing dishes and I've also ordered some disgusting dishes too. Sometimes I think they might have some bad cooks because I've ordered food that I've had in the past and it tastes different & bad. The sandwiches are usually great. My husband and I love the veggie gyros. Only once did I order it and it didn't taste as good.  They also offer a good brunch. They have biscuits and gravy that I really enjoy. The prices are good. Very fair for what you're getting. The overall vibe of the restaurant is nice and relaxed.
