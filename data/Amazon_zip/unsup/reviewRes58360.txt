I don't know if everyone else is crazy or if we went on an off night but of the 8 courses we experienced, we walked away not liking any of them! I was devastated to pay 200dollars(tip included) and not enjoy the meal at all. With small portions and the high price, every taste should have been amazing. Dishes were over salted and the focus is not the actual flavors. To spend that amount on a meal I would have expected some atmosphere. The place is in a U shape so the majority of tables are in a hallway and my boyfriend looked cramped sitting in between two walls. I loved the concept of a meal spread out with little dishes. We saved the visit for our anniversary. When I asked my partner why he was eating a dish when we both thought it tasted bad he replied cause I'm starving. I wanted to love this restaurant so much but now I just feel ripped off. Ripped off of my money, ripped off of a nice meal and a good date. SKIP THIS PLACE
