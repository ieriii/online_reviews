Yum! Good service, good location, and really good food. We went on a Friday and had no problem getting seated - it's so much bigger inside than it looks from the outside. I had the steak salad and my bf had th rueben. Both were awesome. Lots of beers on tap. I definitely want to go back for the brunch.
