This was my favorite Colombian Steakhouse. I have been coming her for some time, before the move across the street. I took some out of town guest for what turned out to be a so so dinner and very poor service. I could not believe this was happening. Waiter was very slow and out of tune with our party. Once we finally ordered we watched our food sit in staging area getting cold till a porter went and got him. Just about everyone complained of very salty steaks. Took forever to get our plates cleared away and we were never asked if we wanted dessert. That did not matter because we just wanted to get out of there by that point. Very sad because this was a really good place. Not even sure I will ever go back at this point.
