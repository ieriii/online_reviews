This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I've been to Geja's dozens of times - both for special dinners for two and with family/friends. The first time there, Mary was our server and now my husband and I always ask for her.  We were a bit intimidated by the menu and the whole fondue-thing at first, but Mary explained everything and makes it so comfortable. I always order the connoisseur dinner which is steak, lobster and shrimp. Perfect sampling. If you're worried about feeling oily or greasy after cooking your food, get over it. The food and atmosphere is worth it. If you try it and think you'll go back, be sure you sign up to be on their mailing list. They send lots of coupons and special offers throughout the year, as well as for your birthday and anniversary.
