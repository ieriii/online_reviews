Wow. All I can say is *yawn*. Not terrible, but certainly not good. I left the restaurant sooo disappointed, and all I could think about was how it was "Simply shIt". (yes, lame I know). I would rather make the trek up to Tank Noodle and get a real Vietnamese meal.  I waste no more time on this one. I just will say, do not eat here if there are other options...like Subway or a Lean Cuisine.
