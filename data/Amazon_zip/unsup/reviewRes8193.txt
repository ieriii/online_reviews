There are now TWO places to get authentic Italian pizza in Chicago! The second, Nella Napolitana, opened recently in Lincoln Park. Nella's owner is the former teacher of Spacca's owner, and you can really tell. Their menus and wine lists aim for the exact same culinary niche and achieve it equally well. The pizza is identical. Deciding where to eat hinges on two things, both of which are strictly matters of personal preference: the specific items on each menu at a given time, and atmosphere. Nella aims for an "Italian sports bar" atmosphere, while Spacca's theme is "classy, casual European restaurant". Both Spacca and Nella feel distinctly American, not Italian, precisely because they try so hard to seem European. I see nothing wrong with the Americans' "thematic" take on restaurant interiors. It's just cute that they ended up with such a similar feel despite Nella's obvious attempt at a different aesthetic.
