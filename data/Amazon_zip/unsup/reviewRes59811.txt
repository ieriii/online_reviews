Great Pizza and even better selection. This is the only place in town that you can get any slice, any style (stuffed, pan or thin) at any time of the day. If they don't have selection that you want ready and hot when you are up to order you must just not like pizza. I subtracted one star because the dining room is usually dirty and delivery time is slow. Maybe they are just understaffed and can't keep up with the Lakeview demand?
