The most delicious beer menu paired with the most inventive panini sandwiches you have ever had. Fig in a sandwich? Check. A beer menu that would make a wine snob cry? Check. A place to go visit, You betcha. No seriously the food is good, and not good for a bar good, GOOD and if you had 3 different beers every time you came here, it would take you close to 20 visits to complete the list.
