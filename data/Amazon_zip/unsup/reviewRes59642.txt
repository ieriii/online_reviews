My friends and I were whooping up Wicker Park and, Joe, who lives around there, insisted that we stop in for a 1am taco. Now, if you know me, and you probably don't, you know that I am generally averse to trashy late night food, especially late night mexican food. I don't know if its the grease, or the shady characters, or the pain on the following day, but late night isn't usually my thing.That said, la Pasadita put my fears to rest as soon as I took a bite of the most delicious steak taco I have ever tasted. There's nothing trashy about this late night food. The quality of the steak is a lot higher than a lot of other Mexican joints of this size, and the salsa they give you on the side is perfect: just spicy enough.Next time your in WP, definitely stop by Pasadita.
