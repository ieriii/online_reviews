This was a completely random find for us, and what a great find. Absolutely delicious! The cornbread was fabulous. I love cornbread that comes out in its own little skillet, and this did not disappoint. The barbeque itself was excellent. There were several different sauces and the spicy one was the best! The mac and cheese was pretty much everything you'd ever want in mac and cheese, too. Factor in awesome patio seating and great service and you've got a winner. There are too many awesome restaurants in Chicago to say I'll come back next time I'm here, but it'll certainly be on the list!
