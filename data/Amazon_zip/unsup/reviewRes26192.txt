This place was very comfy and cozy. The staff was extremely attentive and was always ready whenever we needed anything. We ordered the Bo Luc Lac, a Saigon Crepe, Beef Pho, and steamed Chicken Dumplings. The saigon crepe came out first. The menu said to allow 20 minutes to cook but it was out with in 10. The waitress (and I assume owner?) Explained that it only says that in case numerous are ordered at a time. She stood right @ our table and cut it for us and also instructed how you eat it. (Which my husband found helpful since he had never had it before but for me it was a little much since I have before). The crepe was delicious and there was plenty of cold sides to wrap with it. The dumplings were good, standard but good. The Pho was good as well. The Bo Luc Lac was the most delicious of all. It was very tender and a perfect combination of salty and sweet.  My only reason for giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because I lived next door to my vietnamese best friend growing up and her mother cooked amazing vietnamese all the time. I'm still searching for cooking like hers. This place was very tasty and delicious but still had the "restaurant" taste to it... I need to find some cauliflower, pork, and boiled eggs over steamed rice and THEN ill give 5 stars! :)
