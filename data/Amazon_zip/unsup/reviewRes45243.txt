I was excited about trying this place because we kept hearing great things about it. My husband and I went a few Saturday's ago and we will not be going back. Our server was not the best and acted like we didn't exist. I get it that she was busy and she had a lot of tables, but she wouldn't even look at us when she came to our table. The food was EXTREMELY disappointing. I was expecting so much better and was just disappointed with the flavors. The only thing we both truly enjoyed was the ravioli with the wild mushrooms.
