Already on guard to the pricey and crowded new bbq place in River North, wife and I ventured over for a Sunday 2:00 lunch. We were able to sit and enjoy a delicious meal in the very nice bar area. The dining room seats about 150 and there is an upstairs private room that seats 60 and a nice smaller one on right off the bar that may seat 15. But heck, you are reading this to get insight on food, service, prices and our experience. I ordered the pork shoulder sandwich about $11. Wife ordered the kobe beef brisket, about $14. We agreed, mine was very yummy, hers just okay.  Kobe beef is so lean that you don't enjoy the taste that only fat can bring out of beef. The three sauces offer a spicy, mild and vinegar options. I mixed up the spicy and mild on my pork shoulder sandwich and loved it. The cole slaw, for the cole slaw snobs out there, is one of the best I've tasted in Chicago. Finally, someone gets it! I even ordered a pint to go. The cornbread is moist and wonderful. Portions are generous on all items and sides. All told, the fare was about $35 before tip. Not too bad for some very tasty Q. We'll definitely be back, probably resisting the $35 'competition' ribs.
