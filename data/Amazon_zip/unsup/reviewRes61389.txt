I LOVE this place. It's so much fun. When you first go to this resturant you can't imagine the treat you are headed for. Food is awesome, the atmosphere is fun, staff is wonderful.We had this wonderful pork thing that was marinated and deep fried...at first you think EWW but it was absolutely delightful. The cafe con leche was delicious and reminded me of my time in Florida A definate place to visit if you would like to get away from the city but don't have the time.
