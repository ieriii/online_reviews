This is probably the place I ate at most when I lived in Chicago. Convenient location, decent prices, and tasty food. I highly recommend the egg and cheese fettia sandwich with baba ghanouj substituted for hummus. Their baba is KILLER, and when the egg and cheese bread is fresh, and there are enough red onions on it, the sandwich is just possibly the most transcendently tasty food you can buy at that price.
