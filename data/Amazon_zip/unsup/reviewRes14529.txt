Kid-friendly, Vegan-friendly and excellent beer? Be still my heart! I came here for brunch and a tour and had an excellent experience. Much to the dislike to some other reviewers, Revolution is very friendly to children - at least for brunch, and it seems like other times as well. As someone that has never been bothered by the presence of children in a brewpub, I brought my 6 month old. He was treated to the upside-down high chair and there was a huge table next to us with what looked like a kid's birthday party - very cool. The menu was above average in terms of care and quality and I was pleasantly surprised that it was so vegan-friendly. Tofu scrambles can be boring but this one was uniquely flavorful and delicious. My husband had the tempeh reuben and loved it. The beer. Dear heavens, that beer. It was excellent. We did a sampler of all the beers on tap and each one seemed better than the last. I really couldn't believe how much I enjoyed them. The tour was really great (and free!). We signed up for it before brunch, enjoyed our meal and then went on the tour. I've been on a lot of brewery tours and this one was above average. The brewer/guide was super friendly and took time to answer questions, explain the process in an interesting and laid back way. They took us to the second level where a future event space was under construction and it seemed like it will turn out to be very, very nice. I almost forgot the decor - beautiful, modern, industrial. There seemed like there was an interesting story behind every design choice. All in all, I can't wait to go back.
