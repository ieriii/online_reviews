I hate to do this to an institution in my 'hood, and I just might be back several more times, but I just am not feeling Calo any more. I have had take-out, delivery, and dined in a few times each. The service is always great and the place packed. But, I am almost never wowed by the pretty starndard, often bland food. In a city full of Italian restaurants, you have to really knock my socks off to get me back. I think sometimes that Calo offers too many choices. Stick to the few things you do really well. Pastas are always good, but clearly not freshly made like across the street at Anteprima. If you want basic standard Italian, this is for you. If you want a memorable meal at someplace hip and fun and innovative, this isn't.
