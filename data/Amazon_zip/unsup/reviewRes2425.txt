The best dog on the planet!! Doug's attention to flavors is what sets apart this establish from any other in Chicago/World. He is a masterful chef creating encased meat symphonies daily. If you like dogs or like food that is well prepared with as minimum of three contrasting flavors ie. "french food, sushi", or you have an adventurous/delectable palate, Hot Dougs will completely satisfy every single taste bud you have !!
