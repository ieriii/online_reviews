I had dinner here on Thursday night with three other girl friends. This place is right out of an episode of SATC. I loved it. Definitely not the place to take your parents when they're visiting from Iowa, but a fabulous place for a social evening. I say that just b/c it can get REALLY loud. I did notice they had a few side rooms that might be a bit more on the quiet side.  We decided to do appetizers and dessert ... I recommend the ceviche flight (esp. the ahi tuna), the guacamole and the lobster/cod fritters. Ended the evening with the mango cheesecake. We were four stuffed ladies ... not to mention the rounds of "Carnivale Martinis" - wow, were those delicious. I will definitely be back. Four stars, not five, solely b/c it's not quite versatile enough for a 5 rating ... but it fits its niche and fits it well!
