My exposure to the world of Vietnamese food has been fairly limited (growing up in the uptight world of the NW burbs can do that to you), but my friend insisted that it would be cheap and tasty, ok I'm game. Cheap and tasty in the same sentence is bound to make me at least curious. First, let me get the drawbacks out of the way. Parking is not a strong point in this area so you might wanna start scanning for spaces when your getting within a few blocks. The inside of the place is nothing special and very utilitarian, you might even find yourself sharing a table with another group when its really busy like we did. Even the large salt water fish tank seemed to be lacking in the decor department, so many more things they can do with a tank that size. I didn't even venture to test the bathrooms and am fairly glad I didn't either. Now don't get me wrong, the place isn't dirty...just lacking. Now for the food. I got a sort of chicken noodle soup as my friend insisted that the soups were the main attraction here. My soup was pretty tasty and definetly ample, you will not leave here hungry, at least you shouldn't. We didn't get any appetizers and I was more than adquetly stuffed. My friend order one of their hot and spicey soups and while out definitions of spicey are vastly diffrent from each other, even I agreed that the soup was severely lacking in the spicey department, but nothing a heeping helping of hot sauce can't fix. Outside of the that it was still very good. All in all the food tasted very fresh and healthful, a nice change from all the processed crap you find (I've sworn off most places that serve frozen buger patties), and I left feeling full but not bloated. I'll definetly return as I'd like to sample the pho.
