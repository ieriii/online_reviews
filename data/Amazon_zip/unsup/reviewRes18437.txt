Went last Saturday with a group of friends and I was very impressed. The only reason I did not put 5 stars is because the lack of space. You are right on top of each other. As for the food I ordered the bruchesseta for an appetizer and it tasted tremendously fresh, the gnocchi special which had a pesto and cheese filling smothered in an orange marinara sauce. Sooo good. I will go back.
