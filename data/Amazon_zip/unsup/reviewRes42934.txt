I dined here last night with a friend hoping to score a table outdoors, but there was a 45 minute wait at 8pm. So we opted for a table inside. I had a glass of the Malbec, which was great! I'm a vegetarian and they had a separate menu for vegan and vegetarian, so bonus points! We split the beet and goat cheese salad, which was phenomenal. My friend had the pork meatballs, which he thought were great. I had the Paris mushroom and truffle pasta, which was tasty, but a bit on the dry side, I would recommend they add a tad more sauce to it. The portions were decent sized so we had to skip dessert. For a Wednesday night, most of the tables were taken, they were accomodating for larger parties and the bar area was packed. The service was good and I would highly recommend this spot for the food, drinks and ambience. But if you want a seat outdoors, arrive early.
