It's tradition to head to Greektown for family outings, but this one was a bit different. It's a new restaurant for me and during Greekfest 2009, I was a little worried of finding a place. I had the chicken riginati, which was delicious and simple. With the tzadziki on the table and a bottle of wine, it was a great dinner. And they're BYO. The place itself is a bit too loud for anything other than sitting next to the person with whom you wish to speak, but it's definitely great for a family gathering. Will definitely try again.
