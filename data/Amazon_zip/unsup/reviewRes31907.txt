Very chic place, great location for Westin guests. Service was excellent and food was excellent. Huge menu meant to be shared like small plates but not too small. Drink menu is outstanding. Try the pear drink (2nd down on list). "Ridiculous" dessert is fairly good but certainly not a highlight or unique. Talent level is very high. Hope Solo sat 2 tables from us. Me likey.
