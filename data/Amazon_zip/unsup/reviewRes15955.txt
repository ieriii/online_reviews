Carnivale is EXTREMELY hard to find, but despite that, I think it's an AMAZING place to go for dinner with a small party of people (4, 5, etc). Came here with 3 other people (rocked a double date), based on high reviews and feedback both from them, and the WONDERFUL PEOPLE/ OF YELP. This place is FANTASTIC in terms of decour -- bright. Red. Loud. Musical. It's absolutely terrific and a really fun place to go out and enjoy a nice, Latin-based dinner. The food was delicious -- we got the Ceviche 5-sampler of all of the Latin sushi, including Halibut (which was sensational). I had the Skirt Steak with sweet grilled onions, peppers, and a pesto seasoning, which was absolutely great. It melted in your mouth and was extremely tender. My girlfriend got the fish tacos, which she engulfed in about 3 minutes. The other couple we were with got the scallop meal, which they roared about as well. For dessert? CHURROS. WITH A DULCE DE LECCE SAUCE. Spectacular. My review is done now.
