If you're a meat lover or a big eater, and you got the 2 for 1 price dinner coupon either from mails or printed out online (you can always find them online), Brazzaz is the Brazilian BBQ place you definitely should try. I had couple times romantic dinner with my boy friend, it also pretty good for small groups like closer friends, relatives to visit together on special days like birthday day, holiday & weekend. They got a big dinning area, great cold food bar for start you meal, hot meat come to your table frequently but sometimes a little slow, waiting table service is a OK! Table setting & atmosphere quite elegant, your won't be disappointed & your stomic will sure be really happy after all~
