i love lettuce entertain you restaurants - but this was a little sub par in comparison to what i'm used to for them.  salad bar was good but nothing extraordinary. everything was fresh and good - just nothing that made me think "i HAVE to come back."  i also tried the nachos which were pretty tasty. my hubby liked his burger. service was good, parking was a nightmare. if i ever come back, i'm taking a bus.
