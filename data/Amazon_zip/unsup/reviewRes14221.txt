I found that 90 Miles is one great place to get some fast and tasty sandwich delivery. Not being all that well versed in Cuban cuisine, I have had a couple of Cuban sandwiches in my lifetime, and the ones that I ordered from this eatery are the best I've had so far... The Cubano Sandwich is the traditional sandwich standard, and it was fantastic. The meat was tasty, wasn't heavy on the cheese, the mustard was tangy and the pickles a nice surprise to be found during random bites. The Media Noche Sandwich was even better! Served on a sweet type of bread, with basically some slight modifications to the ham used on the Cubano, I found this sammy to be pure awesome on a bun. I highly recommend it. Also try the Mariquitas, which are fried plantain chips served with a garlic oil dip. Amazing.
