The food is great! I've had a number of different dishes and don't think it's possible to go wrong. I've been here a number of times, and am really impressed by their quality and consistency. It's like a machine. A well oiled machine. In fact, such a machine that they.. have a gift shop? People get out of their cars during the day in front of this restaurant and take pictures of eachother? Tour buses drop off and pick up their groups here daily? Bachelorettes love this place? Tourists love this place? Suburbanites love this place? Birthday parties love this place? What a trainwreck!!!!  It's like the exotic version of rainforest cafe or something. For the mess that it's become, they do a really amazing job of keeping on track and making great food, even though a visit here is just like going to the, um, carnival.
