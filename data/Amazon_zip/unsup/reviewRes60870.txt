Stay away from this place!Me and my girlfriend went to Zed and were quite excited about it! What a mistake that was. First, we get greeted by a pushy host (didn't get his name, but tall, glasses, african american) and wouldn't let us get a drink before our reservation. He "preferred that we sat at our reservation time". It was all down hill from there..Our server, Sean, did the bare minimum of what a server should do. He took about 5 minutes to actually come to our table to explain the whole process. We waned to try some of the cocktails we've been hearing about but he kept on trying to shove the wine list down our throats. We started the harvest table (best part of the night) and then the chefs came around. Most of the meat was undercooked or under/over seasoned. You can goto Gibsons and get a perfectly cut piece of meat and be more than happy! Stay away from Zed. If you want the same style of dining, goto Fogo/Brazzaz/Texas - they are ACTUALLY Brazilian steakhouses who call themselves Brazilian Steakhouses. Unlike Zed who is pretending to be something unique and never before seen. This place won't last long here.
