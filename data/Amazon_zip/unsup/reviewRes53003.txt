I visited 90 Mile Cuban the week it opened and while the food was decent, I was not super impressed. This past week I was up in the area to get my hair cut and decided to stop by for a quick lunch. The host led me out to the covered outdoor patio. I love the setup! If you come to eat at 90 Mile Cuban, I suggest you sit out there. I ordered the media noche (ham, pork, swiss cheese, mustard and pickles on sweet bread) and it was quite delicious. I also got an order of maduros but it was really too much food for one person. As I was eating, I noticed a table near me get some shakes. Based on the waiter's recommendation, I got a banana shake to take with me to the haircut. It was very refreshing! I was very pleased with my experience. The food and service have definitely improved since that first visit. When I went to my salon, one of the hairstylists and I got to talking and she claims that 90 Mile Cuban makes "THE BEST FRENCH FRIES EVAR." When she said that some of the other hairstylists chimed in and say they agreed. Okay! Next time I go, I'll be sure to get the french fries.
