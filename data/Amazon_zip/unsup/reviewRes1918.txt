A true Chicago original. There's a reason why people wait in like for 30 to 45 minutes to get this food. Well, several reason: #1, they make a mean Chicago style hot dog and have a revolving menu of specialty dogs and sausages; and #2, the hours are extremely limited. I guess that's the benefit of being crazy busy/popular: You don't have to work when you don't want to. It's well wroth the schlep from wherever you live -- because I guarantee wherever that is, it's gonna be schlep. (Unless you live in Avondale.) Bring a friend or three to keep you company. The wait is part of the ritual, almost a bonding experience. it'll pay off in delicious duck fat fries. I promise.
