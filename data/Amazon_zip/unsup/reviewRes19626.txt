SO AMAZING!!! We got the Pepito torta and the Carnitas caldos. Both were pretty spicy (especially the soup!), which we were more than happy about. The carnitas in the soup managed to stay crispy, even while sitting in the broth. We were able to make the experience a quick and easy one by getting in the take-out line and taking the food back to our hotel nearby. Based on the eat-in line, I'm pretty sure we saved about an hour doing it this way, so if you're in a rush, take note!
