Sunda is a very nice space, but the food is only so-so. With every dish we kept thinking of how we like it better at other places. It's best to make a reservation. We went twice before with no reservations, asked to sit at the sushi bar, and were given a hard time (with frowning!) even though it was early and empty. We walked out the second time it happened. The front of the house was all smiles this time.
