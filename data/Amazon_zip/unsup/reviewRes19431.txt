I'm tempted to dock a star because while dining here, I found out Rick Bayless is related to ESPN travesty Skip Bayless. But you can't really help who you're related to, can you? Came here for the churros. They were 3 for a $1.50. They were phenomenal. I mean, who doesn't love churros? You normally pay $3.50 for them at Disneyland or the State Fair, so I felt like I got a steal. The chocolate espresso was over the top. There was a pool of chocolate sitting at the bottom. Should have gone with the hot chocolate instead. Picked up the Milanesa torta. A little overpriced, but absolutely delicious. Tried a variety of salsas. One was super hot. Tried to wash it down with chocolate espresso. Didn't work. Tried the churro. Mmm...cinnamon heaven. Sit outside if it's a nice day.
