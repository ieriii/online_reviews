Our waiter disappeared after our orders were taken. All four of us ordered simple pasta dishes with no meat, yet two other tables were served considerably before us. Bread was very good and the house salads were OK. Pasta dishes were way overpriced. $18.00 for watery pasta and marinara? Two of us had the pumpkin stuffed pasta. The pasta was room temperature and so tough we had to use a knife to cut it. A knife necessary to cut pasta? That's al dente X 5. Overpriced and horrible parking.
