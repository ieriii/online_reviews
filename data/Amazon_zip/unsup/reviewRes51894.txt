The pizza crust was plain and crunchy and sans butter. The mozzarella was lacking. The toppings and sauce were plain. I don't remember it being like this the first time I tried it seven years ago. Sorry to say, but the best Chicago style pizza is now in Placentia, CA. Hoorah for Tony's Little Italy!
