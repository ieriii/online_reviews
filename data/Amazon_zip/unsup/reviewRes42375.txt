Overview: Came here with a bunch of friends from out of town - I was happy with the food, service, decor, everything! It was a great place to take friends to show them that Chicago can be chic and not just sports bars :) Food: The food was very inexpensive for the quality. Great menu, great drinks. Atmosphere: There is just a sexy vibe to the bar - the dim lighting is very flattering, the clientele were mostly our age (mid-20's), and the decor was very cool looking. Service: Not great, not bad. Pretty much what you would expect of a gastropub.
