I've been a vegetarian for a few years now, and while I love the health/emotional/spiritual benefits of being meat-free, sometimes a girl just wants a REUBEN. Thank you, Chicago Diner!! Whenever I have a craving for a not so veg-friendly meal, this is my go-to. Not only are the "meat" dishes delicious though-every option on the menu is top notch. The service is incredibly friendly, the place is laid-back and includes an awesome back patio. Oh, and did I mention the California Reuben? And the gyros? And the sweet potato fries? And the kale salad?  Every time I go to Chicago Diner, I leave a happy girl.
