Just had dinner here again after a one year lay off. Sprout remains fabulous and is clearly one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Why is it not on more top restaurant lists? I can only think of three reasons....location, location, location. What's not to like? Dashi accented with Jalapeno (which, let's face it, makes everything better. It's kind of like the bacon of the vegetable world) with clams, mussels, and crudo. Followed by duck fat poached lamb chops with anchovies and olives - salty, sensuous and super yummy. Dale Levitski comes up with some wacky stuff, but it is so good. My wife had zuchini, beet, coca nib cake with curry frosting for dessert. Holy cow, who comes up with this stuff but once again it was a homerun. Service remains stellar and the cocktail service outstanding. For you Manhattan drinkers out there, try the Amaro cocktai (Bourbon, Scoth, Bitters, Organge Flower Water) for a little change of pace. The bartender suggested it when I mentioned my Mahattan affectation and it really delivered. Well played, sir.
