Went here for breakfast because we were excited about the nice outdoor seating. The food was delicious!! I ordered the home skillet and husband ordered the breakfast burrito. Both were very fresh, non-greasy and will be new favorites. As a resident of the Bridgeport/Bronzeville area, I'm thrilled to see a restaurant like this in the neighborhood. Can't wait to try it for dinner. Keep up the good work.
