If your family is Italian and you have traveled through Italy you are going to be very picky about where you eat Italian food. So to discover a restaurant as authentic, fresh and consistent as this place you want to shout from the rooftops. The veal pasta is worth returning for as well as the fennel salad. Best to split a pasta dish so you room to try other dishes but you must try the pastas - after all you are eating Italian. And if you come in the summer try to get seating in the lovely patio.
