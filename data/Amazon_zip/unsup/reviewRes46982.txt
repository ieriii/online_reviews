I love going out for brunch: I get to sleep in on a weekend and then get up and have a great breakfast with friends. Here's my thoughts of this place: Positives: 1. Great environment -- it's cozy and warm, the wait staff are very friendly, the bathrooms are clean 2. Good coffees and teas available...even alcoholic breakfast drinks :) Negatives: 1. The price was a little much -- I got scrambled eggs, crispy potatoes, chicken sausage, and tea = price was $19 2. When the food came out my eggs were already a little cold -- nothing was really hot I left still feeling hungry, which is quite unusual when I leave brunch restaurants. I picked this restaurant just because it was in the middle of where my friend lives and where I live. Next time I think I'll invite her to my hood instead.
