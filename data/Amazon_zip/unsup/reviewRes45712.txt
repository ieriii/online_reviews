I can't say that I was impressed with Wilde's. The crabcake I had was very good but barely above room temperature. I had the Pot Pie which was a little heavy on the onion and the crust was so thin that the heat from the pot pie turned it to a nasty doughy mush. They were out of all of the desserts we had asked for to boot. I can't say that I would return. Just meh.
