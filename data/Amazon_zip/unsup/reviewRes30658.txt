The food was delicious. Our group of eight had a variety of entrees. All wonderful huge servings. Salads were shared and three sides were plenty for all of us. The butter cake is as good as everyone says and also big enough to share with several diners. Over all the experience was great. It is a little dark in the dinning rooms--more than needs to be for "atmospher" and expect a hefty bill. PS- Our reservation was accommodated on time.
