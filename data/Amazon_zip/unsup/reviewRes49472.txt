I came here for dinner with a large group on a Saturday night. They only had 9PM reservations left when we made the reservation, so we took it. They ended up seating us 45+ minutes late, which by then I was ready to pass out from hunger. I purposely didn't eat a lot during the day to prepare myself for a delicious steak dinner. If you are going to make people wait, at least prepare them for that when they make the reservation. I order the "Combonaciones" of pork and skirt steak (the highly recommended meat) on the menu. It came with a plain small half of a baked potato, half of a plantain and 2 small peices of fried yucca. Nothing was seasoned and you were supposed to put this cilantro garlic mixture on the table on your food. Therefore those items were mainly tasteless. The yucca tasted like the oil it was fried in. So there were 2 mixtures one with oil and one without. The non-oil mixture didn't add a lot of flavor to your food. The oil mixture was delish, but I just added 10,000 calories to my food to make it taste good. My gripe is that if I am going out to eat, at least season the food. The steak was pretty good and so was the pork. But if I'm going out for steak, Mastro's, Capital Grille, Fullton's, etc. have better cuts of meat. I personally don't think this place is worth the price ESPECIALLY since it's not even BYOB on the weekends (only M-Th). They have reasonably priced bottles of wine at $30 (think $7.5 per glass). Anyway, I'd rather not come back.
