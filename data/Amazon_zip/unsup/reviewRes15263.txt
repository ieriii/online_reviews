I realize when I visited Revolution it was only open for a few days at the time, so I can be forgiving while the kinks are worked out..however I give only two stars because of the plain awful service that my friend and I received. Sitting at the bar at 4:30 on a Friday should never require me to have to flag down one of 5 bartenders to a. order my first beer b. get a food menu c. get a refill on an empty beer (waited at least 5 min with empty glass), and d. receive utensils after food already was served. I did enjoy the golden cross brew and the wings/ popcorn were delicious. I will come back, only after the hype has died down and service actually serves.
