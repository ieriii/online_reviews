I went to Mercat with some friends on 10/11/08. My purse was stolen from the premises and the management was less than helpful. Unless you want to lose your wallet (and have thousands charged to your stolen credit cards) I don't suggest this place. Food was OK - but you can certainly get the same at other places in Chicago.
