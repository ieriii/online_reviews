So, I'm browsing through Yelp like anyone else who has nothing better to do at 9:30pm on a Wednesday evening. After writing soo many reviews of restaurants down the street from me and declaring that I love them because they are so close (yes, I am lazy), I have finally decided to write a review for one 800 miles away. And after reading a few of the reviews for Alinea, I have very little left to say. There are several reviews detailing each course down to a pretty molecular level, so I guess all's I'm going to say is that Alinea chef Grant Achatz is incredible. The food is extremely delicious and each course is like a party exploding in your mouth. I love expensive meals but that is only because I don't know how to properly budget my own money. This is one of the priciest meals that I have ever had (probably because we participated in the constantly-refilling-your-glass wine pairing as well), but well-worth it in my opinion.
