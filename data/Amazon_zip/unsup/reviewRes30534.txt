Oh my goodness, Nana's. Hear me now. I am a vegetarian. I am so much more critical of food than I once was and Nana's is still fantastic. Had the huevos rancheros (again) but now with soyrizo. Don't misunderstand me, I was infinitely disappointed when our lady of the morning, Trish, informed me that the pinto beans found in the huevos dish contain animal fat. But, I went with the black beans (as any good herbivore should) and I was not disappointed. It was unwaveringly delicious and supremely filling. Magic in my mouth. Thank you, Nana's.
