I don't know why there is so much buzz about this place. All, I ever heard about it is "OOOOOH, its great, owner won top chef masters." I got there or an early lunch and it was packed. Not that I was schocked or anything like that but it was a tuesday. It took about an hour 20 mintutes for me to get my food and the waiter we had was running all over the place and was a mad man. My food was nothing special I could get it at the south of the border chain restraunts.
