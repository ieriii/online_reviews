Okay, I have returned, with a group a friends on a Tuesday night thinking it might be an off night. It was packed. Glad we had an reservation. The quality of food has improved or maybe it's the new year and I've decided to be less snobby with sushi. Thus the rating has improved. We ordered rolls only. They introduced a pumpkin roll..... pumpkin is reference to the color of roll, actually filling is squash. It's really good, perfect blend of sweet salty savoriness.  I still recommend the place for a group of friends and not a date place. I mean, the decor and lighting is great for a date, but the tables are real close, no intimacy and everyone is loud due to the BYOB drinking factor. Also, make it a 5 top..... with the new 1 bottle per 2 people, bring 5 people and you get to bring 3 bottles. Though the waitress said the new policy is overlooked if the place isn't busy, but really, have you ever been when it wasn't busy? Make one of the bottle sake and you are golden.
