We were driving down Clybourn, with plans of catching lunch somewhere else, when I saw the sign. Remembering that 90 Miles received great reviews from my fellow Yelpers, we decided to give it a try. Tiny little cafe-esque place, with the biggest welcome. The staff was just soooooo nice and helpful. We asked quite a few questions and the woman behind the counter (owner? manager?) was extremely patient and sweet. We had a HUGE lunch for under $25.00 (including tax) We ordered and split the following... Media Noche Sandwich (Ham, Pork roast, Swiss cheese, pickles on sweet bread) ... Excellent, tasty and filling Guajirito Sandwich (Steak, Swiss, romaine, tomato, grilled onions, on plantains)... My favorite of the two Tostones (fried plantains)... A little too "dry" for my liking Papa Rellena (stuffed potato)....Never met a fried potato I didn't like, and some I like more than others, including this little fried ball o' love. Platano Shake...yum oh yum, banana-y and rich. All for $24.26. There are several items I want to go back and try. My fear..as Carolynne stated, this little Cuban Cafe is so small and will become so popular pleasing their customers they will soon have to expand or move.
