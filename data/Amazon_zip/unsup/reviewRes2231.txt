Hot Doug's has the perfect corn dog! I know. Who'd get a corn dog with everything else that they have? That's why I get the corn dog as a side dish. The hard part is deciding what to get as my "main". There is no doubt that the duck fat fries are tastier than the regular fries. It isn't a mind-blowing difference but it's enough to make you appreciate ducks (more). First timers, don't worry about seating. It magically works out so that you have a seat before your food is out. The staff does a good job of matching groups with appropriately sized tables.
