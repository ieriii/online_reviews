Graham Elliot is hands down the best chef in Chicago (sorry Rick Bayless)! This was probably the best dining experience I had in Chicago or a close second to Alinea. This is for three reasons: one, flawless execution of the meal (in taste and creativity of the menu); two, the service makes you feel like you're a friend of the chef, not a customer; three, it made me a believer about a type of cuisine (experimental) that usually underwhelms me. For those who are first timers, the menu is a bit confusing. Save yourself the trouble and order the tasting menu. If that's not your thing, make sure you order at least three to four dishes.  His menu changes frequently but the highlights of my meal were: - truffle oil popcorn (i think everyone gets this but if you don't, you should ask for it) - foi gras lollipops with pop rocks and seal salt - white tuna sashimi with an amazing avocodo mousse - corn soup with corn nuts and jalapeno - salmon on a potato pancake (my favorite) - bison with root beer bbq sauce - chocolate cake (i've had better but still delicious) This is my new favorite restaurant in Chicago.
