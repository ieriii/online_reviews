What can I say? I love this place. The atmosphere is probably the #1 selling point for me, with the classy choice in decor, the mood lighting, and the intimate spaces created by each grouping of two or four high-backed chairs facing each other. This is a fantastic date spot, for sure. Their beer menu is fairly decent, certainly better than I expected, though they didn't carry any of my personal favorites. The closest thing to my tastes was Dragon's Milk, a really hardcore strong dark ale. I didn't have any cocktails there (yet), though I'm pleased to know that they stock Tito's vodka. Finally, a bar that gets what quality vodka really is! I will absolutely be returning to Violet Hour. It helps, of course, that I live right down the street. Oh, and word to the wise: if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared for a line. Best days to go are Sunday through Wednesday, if you want a practically nonexistent wait and a little more quiet time with your company.
