I know there are a ton of reviews for this place and I don't need to regurgitate the solid info I've seen listed here. So I only want to quickly put in one helpful (I hope) piece of information. If you are downtown or in Streeterville specifically, you have two main choices for Indian lunch buffet: India House and Indian Garden. Here's the quick synopsis: India House is better quality and spicier for about $3 more per plate. Indian Garden is still pretty good but the $3 does make a noticeable difference.
