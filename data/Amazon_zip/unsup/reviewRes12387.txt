I went to Cafe 28 a couple weeks ago because I had a groupon deal. I had been meaning to go there for years anyway so this worked out really well. I knew that it was a popular place so I made reservations that week for a Friday night, got them no problem but was glad that we made one because it was pretty packed. I really liked the atmosphere right away, it was warm and lots of exposed bricks. The mojitos were really good. We ordered quite a bit. We started with the taste of Cuba and the plantains. For entrees I had the almond crusted halibut and my date had the Cuban roast pork. His was really good. Mine was good too, but the halibut was a bit dry and they used the same saffron sauce that was in the appetizer which I thought was kind of lame. Overall we had some great food and quite a few mojitos, will return.
