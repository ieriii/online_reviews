Coming in from the cold! From the moment I stepped in off of the Ashland Ave. this place was an oasis in the desert. Jay Z pumping into the dinning room, warm smiles and kind words right out of the gate. I can honestly say I have never had a more enjoyable dinning experience in Chicago then this. Worth every bit of the $$$
