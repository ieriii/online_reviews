I'm mixed. On the one hand, some of the food is great (hello mac and cheese), and the bar is legit, pouring Jameson rocks into a pint glass where it belongs and featuring some decidedly un-irish beers on tap (magic hat, at one point allagash). But it's all a little pricey, a little loud, and a little crowded for me. Looks like a fun place to come with a big group, but as a bar, it's a little unmanageable to hang out in (the bar is between the kitchen and restaurant). The idea of a reading room is cool, but it's so loud in there that it's really just mostly for show, I almost never see people sitting up there, reading or no. So, in summary, not bad, but not my kind of place. I guess if you don't mind paying a little more, the food is a bit better than the immediate competition.
