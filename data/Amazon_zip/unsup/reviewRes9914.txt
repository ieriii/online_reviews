I went to Piccolo Sogno when it first opened, and although I remember thinking it was wonderful, for some reason I never made it back until last night. Out of sight, out of mind perhaps? With a client in town to entertain, I realized that all of my favorite go-to's are shared plates...which can super awkward for a business dinner with folks you don't know very well. I felt like choosing a place where everyone could order their own entree was important, but damn did that limit my choices, especially on short notice and during restaurant week. Round of applause of Piccolo! Everybody was impressed with their food, and had a hard time choosing a plate based on endless amazing options. After sharing a beautiful antipasta plate, I had the tagliatelle with wild boar ragu. It was delicious, but rich -- an appetizer portion probably would have done the trick. The polenta bread was...eh...skip it, but that's my only complaint.  The restaurant was bustling, the wine pours were healthy, and our waiter was charming. I definitely will not wait so long before my next visit and can't wait to get into that perfect little patio this summer.
