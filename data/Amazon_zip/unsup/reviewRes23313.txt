Everything you read here is true... except for like the four crazy people who didn't like this place. We went here on Saturday night before a show at Gorilla Tango Theater. At about 6:30, we were quickly seated, but had we showed up 10 minutes later we would have been waiting in line. This is a teeny tiny restaurant -- really just 10 or so tables tossed in to a back room. I heart places like that, so I immediately felt comfortable at Irazu. Loved the atmosphere. My bf and I ordered the guacamole -- good, especially if you're a purist, I'm talking straight up smashed avocados. I had the vegetarian burrito, which is amazing. Just to be safe, I had them put the hot peppers on the side, but next time I will have them put on the burrito. Boyfriend got some meat dish -- he loved it and I ate his plantains, which were sweet and lovely. We ate every last bit of food they gave us it was so damn good. Unfortunately, I was totally looking forward to trying the oatmeal shake but we were way too full. Next time -- and oh yes, there will be a next time. Hopefully it will be like... tomorrow. Also worth mentioning, this place has a good amount of vegetarian, and dare I say, vegan options. And just for the record, my rating is really like 4.75. The only reason I left off one star is that the service is a bit spotty. We had some angst-ridden teenage bus boy who did not want to bring us our drinks. What was his prob?
