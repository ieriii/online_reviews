i went here for my birthday dinner. i would never just hop in if i was hungry but it was a nice place to be taken or to take someone for special occasions. the cocktail i had was pretty delicious, lychee sangria. it was creamy, frothy, floral, and a little spicy because of the cinnamon. my date had the cononial which contained too much ginger for my liking but he loves ginger... so if you like ginger, and gin, go for it. all of the food was good, nothing mind blowing. except for the beef salad. o  m  g  it was fantastic. extremely rare shaved beef on top of been sprouts, cucumbers, lettuce, and basil leafs. i would go back just for that. our waiter was ok. a little stiff. but that was expected. the upstairs is beautiful, btw. sit up there if you can.
