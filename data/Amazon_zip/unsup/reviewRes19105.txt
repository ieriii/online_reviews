The Gage is one of those great staple places...one where you know you can grab a solid pint, a delicious burger and some unexpected treats. Chef Dirk Flanigan makes standard gastropub fare beyond far from standard with inventive twists, complex flavors and unexpected textures. Overall - delicious. My favorite meal at The Gage is brunch. Faves include: -Irish breakfast -Smoked salmon -Cornbeef Hash But honestly, you can't go wrong. My advice: go early, drink lots and come back time and time again for the burger. Delish.
