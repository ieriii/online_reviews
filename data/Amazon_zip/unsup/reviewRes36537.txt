one of my favorite brunch/lunch places! there's always a wait but it isn't ridiculously long. restaurant is very cute and home-y! even though most of the waitresses do not speak fluent english, service is always great. i love their omelettes. it's either Spicy Flamenco or Spinach and Feta for me. i love their homemade, super fresh jellies! they have different flavors every day. their homemade honey butter is deeelish too! coffee isn't as robust as starbucks but it's good enough. meli is known for their juices and smoothies but i have yet to try them both. meals aren't expensive. i've never driven to meli but it looks like finding street parking is difficult. there is a parking lot around the area but it isn't free. if you love brunch, you HAVE to give meli a chance!
