Based on the name alone I wasn't sure about this place, but it is right down the street from me so I gave it a try. Well, hello home away from home...this place is awesome!!! Great food...just do yourself a favor and get the cheese curds...and awesome beer list...you will find beer on tap here that is hard to find anywhere else in the city. The atmosphere is very cool, the staff is very friendly and it has foosball and shuffleboard in the back room.
