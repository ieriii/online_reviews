Where do I begin?? After being turned on to this by some friends it has become my go-to spot. My favorite thing about this place (other than the food of course) is the sense of family you get from the minute you walk in the door. Uncle as the regulars know him as is usually the first to say hello and make sure you get a seat.  The food is unparalleled by any other asian place in the city. Everything is fresh and tasty. I am far from a vegetarian, but could find plenty to fill me up and make me leave happy. Everything on the menu is great, and i mean EVERYTHING!I order delivery from here a minimum of once a week. Needless to say, they know who I am. Everytime I call in, its like I'm calling family. They also offer a great deal if you aren't sure what to get, they have deals for parties of 2, 4, 6, and 8 for varying prices. If you haven't been here yet, make a point to tell Uncle that his little nephew sent you!
