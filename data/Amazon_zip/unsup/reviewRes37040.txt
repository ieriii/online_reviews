This was supposed to be one of the finest fish markets in the city. Now the fish market at F&O SMELLS horrible. One of the biggest no-no's for any fish market is that it should not smell like rotten fish. I was shocked at this place, the floor was falling apart, and the shelves were pretty barren. Has the management changed? The cafe area looked dirty, and we had to wait quite a while to get something. I am only giving them two stars for some hard to find items, but in all, F&O has seriously deteriorated through the years, and its a shame. I used to really enjoy that place.
