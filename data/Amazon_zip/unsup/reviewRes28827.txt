Yes, Pequod's you are awesome. No frills atmosphere, but the deep dish pizza with caramelized crust + giardiniera peppers is money, total F'ing money. To boot, they have a lunch deal that includes a personal sized pie + 1 beer or soda for $5 for dine in. Screw all the chains and their supposed best Chicago style deep dish. If you have not been here yet and call yourself a Chicagoan - I'd get here ASAP via your Cta Card/Igo/Car/Segway/Bicycle/Legs, now. Why are you still reading this - go.
