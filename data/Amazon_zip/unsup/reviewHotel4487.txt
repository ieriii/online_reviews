My friends and I attended the New Year's Eve party here yesterday. I had never been inside the place before then but had heard great things about it from friends. The lobby area is very ornate and elegant. It literally feels like you're walking into a gold mine or something. The rooms are a different story, however. It was very small, the beds were full size, which is something I had never seen in a [Hilton] hotel before. The bathroom has the be the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in my entire life. One person couldn't really be in there comfortably, forget about having two! Motel 6 has bigger bathrooms than this. The lighting is super poor and the view was terrible. What really turned me off was the staff at the hotel did not allow alcohol in the rooms. They made up some BS about licensing agreements and other legal mumbo jumbo, but really it was just an excuse for them to get more money out of people, because they said if they found alcohol in a room they were going to charge a "cork fee" of $60 per bottle. So, you're meaning to tell me that after already paying for a night in your hotel, plus paying to go to the party, you're going to charge me for having liquor that I PAID FOR MYSELF??? I don't think so! If I come back here, it won't be to stay. The event itself was very nice and the restaurants and lounges seemed posh, so I'd come back for those.
