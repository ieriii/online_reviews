One of the best burgers we've ever had so far - the bread an the (medium well) patty almost melt in your mouth. The hot buffalo chicken wings were also well made. The highlight of the lunch were the chocolate and orange shakes. One piece of advice is that the portions were large - with 2 shakes, chicken wings and 2 burgers between the two of us, we were stuffed!! (not to mention we had to take half the burgers to go)
