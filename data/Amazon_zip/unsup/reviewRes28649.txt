I love this place! My boyfriend and I have been loyal customers for the past three years and it never, ever disappoints! First off, the service is always wonderful! The host and all of the servers are always very nice and give great recommendations. Even the guys who deliver are great... and the food always gets to our apartment really fast. Because of one of those recommendations, I found my beloved Neu Num Tok beef salad. It is by far my favorite thing on the menu. It's charbroiled beef sliced really thinly over lettuce and onions with lime juice. SO GOOD. They ask how spicy you want it and I always go with "medium." I did "hot" once and even though it was tasty, I struggled through it. Other delicious options: for starters, I always get the crab meat rangoons. I dream about those things. I don't know what kind of sauce they give you to dip it in... but it's awesome! All of the curries are excellent... the Gaeng Panang being my favorite. We also get these little cucumber salads that only cost sixty cents and are a perfect little side dish. As expected, the pad thai is also great. Everything I've had there is good... and I try to pick out something different each time. Dessert and beverage wise? The Thai iced tea. Get it. It's delicious. It also really helps if you get something a little spicier than you expected. Also, the banana in warm coconut milk. I would eat/ drink that stuff by the gallons. All in all, don't believe any of the bad reviews about this place. Yes, "there are so many Thai places to choose from... blah blah blah..." but there is a reason why Opart has been around so long. It's because it's amazing.
