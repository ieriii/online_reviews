Overrated and Overpriced! Glen was not very nice to us as we pulled an extra chair to our table while sitting outside. The servers cringed while Glen was upset with us! The food is nothing special and pretty over priced for what you get. I didn't find anything special about their crab cakes which were highlighted on Check Please. I would recommend not wasting your time waiting for a table and passing on this place as there are many restaurants far better than Glen's.
