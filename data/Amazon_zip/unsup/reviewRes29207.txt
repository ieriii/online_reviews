BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN CHICAGO PERIOD..... The size of the toppings are very generous. We usually get green peppers and it comes with large slices of peppers. The best part of the pizza is the burnt cheese around the edges of the pizza. I wish there was a way to just get the crust and a sauce to dip in. Excellent. Only one issue in all the times I ordered and it was there was not enough sauce on the pie. If you like a lot of sauce I would suggest asking for extra sauce.
