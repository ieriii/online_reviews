This place really impressed me. We started off with brushcetta topped with fresh buffalo mozzarella. This was the best bruschetta I have ever had in my life!! They made this simple dish so well I can give them five stars just for that, but the rest of our meal was amazing also. The gnocchi were like soft pillows, the risotto was cooked perfectly, and everyone loved the chicken parmigiana. And I just love that they are byob with no corckage fee.
