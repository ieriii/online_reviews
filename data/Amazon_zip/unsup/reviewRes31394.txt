Brand new place - as far as I know, opened just today. Went there with my wife for her birthday. I let them know when they called to confirm the reservation that it was her birthday just to see if they'd remember and do something for her. The atmosphere is nice - about what you'd expect from an Asian fusion place. Smaller than I thought it would be, but it wasn't overcrowded or cramped. We got a table for two that was half booth, half chair. My wife sat in the booth and mentioned it was somewhat uncomfortable - maybe they're just not broken in yet. Just a head's up. Food was awesome! Service was great, too! Everyone was VERY attentive - clearing plates, filling water, asking if we needed anything. Superb. I ordered the Kobe steak which was unbelievably good. Came with mashed potatoes and beans. We also ordered a tempura hand roll - I think it was called 'no you didn't' or something like that. Also good. The bao bun appetizer was good, but not what I expected. I was thinking it was going to be the traditional bao, with the pork and 'soup' in the middle, self-contained. This was more like a small sandwich. With the food, of course we had to have drinks. I forget the cool names they had, but I tried the pear sake one while my wife tried the ginger one. Pear sake one was awesome, ginger one was okay. In the end, we were stuffed - and definitely could not handle a dessert. BUT, the staff came through with a free dessert with a candle for the birthday girl. It was called "Ridiculous" and it was awesome. Hard to explain, but it involved fried-ness and ice cream. All-in-all, a great experience. Will definitely go back. Recommended!
