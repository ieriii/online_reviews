I can't believe I haven't reviewed Piccolo yet! We spotted this gem over a year ago when we first moved into the neighborhood. When we first started going it was very easy to get a table but now you DEFINITELY have to make a reservation a few days in advance, even during the week. This is due to the praise they received over the last year, particularily for their outdoor dining space, which deserves all the praise it gets. Nothing beats sitting on the back patio at Piccolo on a warm summer's night. It's absolutely beautiful! The inside has a great interior/vibe as well. Onto the food - Unlike most restaurants, I honestly could eat Piccolo multiple times a week. It's such delicious light Italian fare. Usually we start with the Funghi Tartufati Pizza and Burrata Culatelo. The pizza is cooked perfectly and the pairing of the mushroom and truffle oil is to die for. The Burrata is incredibly fresh and the thinly sliced prosciutto compliments it so well. Additionally, the Piccolo Balsamic they put on the table with the fresh focaccia is amazing, but be sure not to fill up on it. As far as entrees go, I've never heard anyone complain about any of the dishes. My fianc usually gets the Ravioli "Piccolo Sogno" (a signature dish) while I opt for the Spaghetti Neri "Fruta di Mare". What is great about the entrees is that you can get appetizer portions of most of them.  This beautiful restaurant has quickly become a favorite and I am looking forward to my first Al Fresco dining experience of the season.
