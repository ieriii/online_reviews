EXCELLENT place to go to if you like Jazz/Blues music. On weekends they have a touring Jazz/Blues band play approx 8pm-12am...and then a regular band comes up on stage 12am-4/5am, and while they are playing invite other jazz musicians from the crowd to come up and do inprov with them (something I plan to do myself one of these days). The place is pretty small, and the crowd is usually full...so if you require seating i recommend getting there at least an hr early. There is never bad music being played here. The place is said to have been one of Al Capone's hideouts back in the '20s.
