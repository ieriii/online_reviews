Talk about a treat! I was in Chicago a couple of days for business and wanted to indulge in the real deal, Chicago style deep dish pizza. I asked around and was told to head to Gino's East. The restaurant is really cool. Old style, with an actual signed autograph of Barrack Obama. (it is Chicago, folks). The floors are wood, I bellied up to the bar since I was alone and ordered a cheese and sausage pizza. $17.71 for a small which is expensive but I thought what the heck. My option is either crumbled or patty. I have no clue what they are talking about so I do half and half. I finally get my pizza, it takes 45 mins to make and I finally understand. It's the sausage! Crumbled or in patty form. I think I actually like the patty style best. The cheese was ooyey gooyey yumminess and the crust, the crust! Loved, Loved, Loved IT!!!!
