Wow, just wow. It was really cool to go there in the afternoon and have tea. The service was amazing. One of the owners even came over to check on us and ask our opinion about the place. I ordered the Tallgrass Beef Burger. It was large, juicy, perfectly cooked, and tasty. The "a' plenty" that it came with was great as well. In fact, I enjoyed the food so much I went back two days later for dinner and was again floored with how great the service and the food were. If you are there for dinner and enjoy spicy food, you HAVE to try the Jalapeno Gator Sausage. I'll leave it at that. Now quit reading my review and go eat already!
