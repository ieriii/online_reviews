I'm of the mind that char-grilled meats and really awesome salsa make or break a mexican restaurant. These guys do it right. Best carne asada tacos in town that aren't Lencho's tacos at the Maxwell Street Market. The rich brown roasted jalepeno salsa and and green jalepeno/tomatillo salsas are fabulous. The mixed-grill plate will feed 3 happy people. Great service from really nice waitresses. Easy parking at all hours on the street or in their Pasadita communal lot next to the former Pizza Hut at Ashland and Division. The men's restroom is a little gross but it's worth it for the silly gang graffiti on the walls - just don't touch anything.
