This is a nice cozy spot to dine with your sweetie on a Friday night. It is candle lit through out the place. It is a bit loud since it packed on the weekend. I would recommend calling a few days ahead to set up your reservations because this place fills up fast. I called on Wednesday afternoon for a Friday reservation and there was only one slot left and that was because someone had just cancelled! Their oysters are amazing there! We asked for 1 order and we ended up ordering another because they were so good! They have a great appetizer list and I would also recommend the pot stickers. I am a huge fan of sushi and I would say that their sushi is sub par. The service is great and I would definitely come back.
