Oh how do I love this store. Even though they've made a pauper of me, I can't stop shopping here. Their breads are perfect, the cheese selection incredible, the staff knowledgeable. And they actually carry Neuskes bacon!! The produce is overpriced, so I usually run over to Dominicks when I need veggies.
