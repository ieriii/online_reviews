Ok, so I used to go here all of the time about 4 years ago when it first opened. I went back with some friends for some sushi and BYOB!  Sushi-4.5 stars....AMAZING, loved it and totally reasonable in price. Cant beat it. Service-2....OMG this place was barely busy, but we had to ask several times for our apps, more water, ice, etc, etc, etc....it was quite annoying. I could understand if it was packed but it wasnt. Also, we werent being excessively high maintenance. BYOB-4.5, its always good when you can bring your own booze, especially when you plan on drinking to forget! Overall, I would say 3.5 stars...however yelp doesnt believe in halves so I am being stingy today. If you can deal with the horrible service, this truly is a great sushi/thai restaurant.
