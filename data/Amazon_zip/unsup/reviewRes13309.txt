Went here for the first time on a Monday nite around 9. Didn't have a problem getting a table. Our server was friendly & attentive. We started off with the big pretzel which was delicious...came with 2 dipping sauces, a mustard & melted cheese. I don't eat mustard so didn't try it but the cheese was DELICIOUS. Beer of choice was Bottom Up Witt....no complaints there! Had the hombre burger which was AMAZING. It was a little undercooked for my preference but with all the toppings (chihuahua cheese, poblano peppers, avocado) I forgot all about the pink meat & enjoyed the burger. The fries were too salty for me and seemed a little overcooked. I can do without them next time. The burger was huge so I didn't have room for fries in my belly anyway! Overall very good experience. If you're a beer drinker def check it out...you won't be disappointed.
