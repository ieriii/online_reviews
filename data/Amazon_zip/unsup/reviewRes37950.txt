Everyone pretty much said everything I wanted to say already--so this is just going to be another endorsement. You need to go! Also, a few people took stars off for it being crowded--but you know what--i think they just don't want to admit that they like it that way. Everyone gets off on being seen man--and might I add that Hopleaf is a pretty darn good place for that!
