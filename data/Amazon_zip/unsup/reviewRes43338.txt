I came here thinking this was more of a brunch spot that would have a lot of breakfast-type options, but they actually have a much larger sandwich menu. Which is fine, just not exactly what I was expecting. However, the food is delicious and very reasonably priced and I like the set up a lot better than that of other city brunch spots where you fight through a crowd to get your name in, then hang on the sidewalk for an hour before you're seated. You actually go up to the counter, order, pay and get a number... then the food arrives soon after you're seated which is nice and you don't have to mess with the bill after the meal. We only waited maybe 15 minutes on a Saturday around 1... not too bad. So anyway, the food --- I ended up getting an egg/cheddar/tomato sandwich which was really good, but like I said, one of the few egg options on the menu. Also split the pancakes which were GREAT! All of the sandwiches I saw looked delectable too, but I'll have to go back to try those another time.
