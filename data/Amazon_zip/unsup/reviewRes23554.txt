When I went to this place first time and was given a Menu (long menu) I couldn't decide what to choose from a huge list so I asked the waiter for suggestion but!-The waiter hardly understood ENGLISH and we struggled to explain what we wanted to eat, we asked for some gravy dish and finally the waiter got us a completely dry dish-Very disappointed. The waiters in this restaurant don't know proper English and if u r to ask them for suggestions or have questions-then u r in big trouble!!! I finally called the manager who seems to understand lill English and explained him the problem and he got us red chili gravy. We didn't at all enjoy our dinner here. The manager should really work to train his waiters to speak/understand English!
