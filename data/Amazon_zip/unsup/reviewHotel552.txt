3.5 stars for this hotel. I'm rounding to 3. Let me start off by saying I am in love with decor in the lobby and surrounding areas. The all white gives a very clean appearance and looks fantastic with the black accents. If it weren't for that, I'd give the hotel 3 stars. Our hotel room mirrored that, but was a lot more basic (and I mean-A LOT). The bed was comfortable and we had no problems with the TV or air. Our bathtub would not drain which was no good but other than that, very satisfied with our stay.
