So, ok, I was really excited to go to this place and review it, after seeing all the reviews are so varied. People I've talked to seem to either LOVE it or HATE it with a passion. Well, to sum it up, there were things I LOVED and things I HATED. Waiting in line for 30+ minutes....HATED IT Delicious drinks like Amaretto fizz....LOVED IT Sexy bouncer...LOVED IT Rude waitress (see Nathan's post for further details)...HATED IT! Tall, blue, comfy chairs...LOVED IT People trying to cut us in line...HATED IT Music selection...LOVED IT $11 for drinks...well, surprisingly worth it, cause they were damn good. Can't say for sure if I will be returning, but I'm glad I went to check it out. I might have to go back to try the food cause that looked pretty tasty as well. I would suggest going on a weeknight.
