I used to say something like, "Yeah, I like Thai food, but I've never really thought to myself, 'OH MAN. THIS IS THE BEST THAI FOOD. IT IS BETTER THAN ALL OTHER THAI FOOD I HAVE TRIED!'" But then again, I also thought that dying my hair red was a really good idea. I used to be pretty stupid, is what I'm saying. When I go to, or order from Opart Thai, I actually DO say something like "OH MAN. THIS IS THE BEST THAI FOOD. IT IS BETTER THAN ALL OTHER THAI FOOD I HAVE TRIED!" And then I weep quietly with joy and stuff big fistfuls of rice into my mouth while taping it on youtube. Weirdly, my youtube channel has something like 5 million subscribers and I'd like to thank Opart Thai for that.
