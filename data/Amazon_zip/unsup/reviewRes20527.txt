AMAZING sushi! Not that I'm a contisseaur or anything but everything was good! The server was great at making suggestions. As said multiple times the white dragon roll is not to be missed, probably the best sushi roll i've ever had. We also tried the Po'boy which is similiar and very good. The rolls are large and we left with our stomachs full. Yay good sushi!
