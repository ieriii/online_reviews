I was a bit annoyed there was a groupon for this and we didn't buy it. My husband and I went here for our 5th year anniversary and LOVED it. It was probably the heaviest meal I've ever eaten but totally worth it! The idea of 'making' our own food was a bit annoying, but once we started it ended up being such a blast. Our waitress Trish was great, very professional and didn't do us wrong with her recommendations... Only cons: Worst coffee I've ever tasted and my eyes had a bit of sensitivity to the all the smoke/oil
