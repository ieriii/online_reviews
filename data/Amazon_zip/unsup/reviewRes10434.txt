I had dinner recently at Piccolo Sogno for the first time, and I'll definitely go back. We had a lovely evening. Although the experience was not without minor flaws, overall it was outstanding. Pros: 1) The huge outdoor patio (which appeared to be twice as large as the interior of the restaurant) is gorgeous. They have a number of very large umbrellas, which create almost a roof, leaving an almost cozy feel. There is a lot of vegetation and greenery (perhaps the most at any outdoor dining space I've experienced in Chicago). 2) The FOOD! I had the ravioli: four cheese ravioli, pine nuts, butter, Marsala glaze, and parmesan curls. It was nothing short of fantastic---perhaps one of the best pasta dishes I've had, ever. I literally wanted to lick the bowl! (I resisted.) My friends each also had pasta (the lasgna, the gnocchi, and a tortelli special), and all of those were also outstanding. (We like to share bites.) One of our two appetizers was very good---I highly recommend the cecina fritta--chick pea flour fries wth parmesan. They were unusual and delicious. The desserts were also good. Minor cons: 1) the service was friendly but slow---I think our waiter was quite overworked.  He certainly appeared to be working hard. Not a major deal, but noticable. 2) one of our appetizers (the crispy squash blossoms with fontina cheese) was quite bland, to the point that we all salted our portions. Again, not a major problem. 3) the patio is gorgeous, and I loved sitting there, but the tables are much too close together. It is almost impossible to sit at a table without your chair touching the chair of the person next to/behind you. All of the "cons" are minor---they merely kept me from giving five stars. I was very impressed with Piccolo Sogno, and can't wait to go back!
