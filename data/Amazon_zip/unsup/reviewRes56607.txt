If I could give a 4.5 I would.Food: One of, if not the best steak I've ever had. Went with the NY strip (chefs cut). The lobster potatoes were absolutely amazing as well, I would highly suggest ordering them. Finished off the meal with the buttercake, almost undescribably good.Our waitress was very attentive and sociable as well.The only reason I gave Mastros a 4, is b/c it was somewhat difficult to communicate with my date at our table for two. I think it was a combination of the table seperating us a little too far, other tables being too close, and the music being a bit loud, perhaps.Had some good drinks afterwords at the bar. Live music and good drinks.Would definitely go again.
