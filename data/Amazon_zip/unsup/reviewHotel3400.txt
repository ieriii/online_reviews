I'd probably give this place a 2.5. It initially has so much potential, but there were so many negatives I wouldn't recommend it. There was ZERO cell reception in my hotel room. Because of this, I couldn't effectively take work calls and had to use the hotel phone [which didn't work when I first arrived and engineering had to come in to fix.] My laptop operates via an aircard so wireless internet is always available, but because there was no cell reception - I had to purchase the hotel internet service for $9.95/day. AND, the actual hotel wireless was relatively slow! I spoke with a manager who said they'd waive the internet fee, but sure enough, when I received my bill under the door I'd been charged for internet. So had to wait in line at the front desk to get adjusted before leaving. I ordered room service the first night - an Asian chicken salad - and the chicken was so dry I had to push aside and just eat the lettuce. For $26, it was pretty gross and disappointing.  Finally, the maid service barely cleaned the room; the bed was made but that was about it. In fact, I'd left my curling iron on by accident and they didn't even turn it off, let alone unplug it, so when I got home that night it had burned through a bottle of lotion. I was surprised such little attention was paid to detail here. Despite the convenient location, I would not recommend this hotel nor would I choose to stay here again.
