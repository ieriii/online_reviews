I once ate here every week. It wasn't by design or pre-meditated or anything. It was a natural inclination that wasn't meant to be suppressed, so for a month last summer, I hung out on the al fresco porch every Friday evening waiting for a patio seating. Each time I brought different friends for some real-life Yelping it forward. Because I love to chew, the Napolitan dough fit my masticulative habits perfectly. Thin yet with enough substance for slow oral savouring, the topping of fresh ingredients was a complement to the crust, rather than an American-style barrage of slathered meats and sloppy cheese. Any of the appetisers is a great way to start the meal and go ahead, get a pizza per person. It's completely possible to polish it off on your own, and if the Italians stay skinny doing just this, so will you. The tiramisu and tartufo are the two desserts we always get, as well as the Moretti La Rossa bierra. Because the pizzas take just 90 seconds to be baked in the oven shipped in from the shores of Naples, carryout is an extremely speedy process (just make sure you're steady enough to clear a glass of prosecco that proprietor Jonathan Goldsmith serves while you wait). But you better get home fast -- the intricacy of the pizza demands that it be eaten while freshly hot, or it will wilt, literally.
