Boyfriend had some vacation time so we decided to head to the Windy City. My aunt, who lived in Chicago for a few years, suggested this place to us due to location. Right next to the Purple/Red/Brown lines at Belmont which was super convenient for us since we had some downtown/Loop business. There's tons of great shops, restaurants, and bars around. I'd recommend this place for any tourist. There's a Walgreens nearby as well as a liquor shop (since a lot of restaurants are BYOB). Tons of great stuff nearby! We got a standard queen which was real small. It was okay for us since we live together, but if you're looking for a little more room than just a bed, desk, and bathroom then get a suite. The bathrooms were updated and very nice, not to mention it was great to unwind in front of a flat screen after running around. Although the room smelled a little like hamster bedding for the first two nights. We didn't hear the El at all, but I did hear the elevator, people walking on the 4th floor, and the annoying, awful screeches of a child in the room next to ours. Quit beating your kid, you're on vacation! The staff was really friendly. I had an anxiety attack coming into Chicago and the boyfriend was kind of flustered with where he was at, so we called and John stayed on the line with us the whole time to make sure we got there ok. One of the guys working there could tell I was upset and he made sure to try and cheer me up which was nice. Free tea/coffee 24 hours, free breakfast (but Ann Sather's is a walk down the street... ;] ), and we always got buzzed in after 9pm since they remembered who we were. I'd definitely come back here again.
