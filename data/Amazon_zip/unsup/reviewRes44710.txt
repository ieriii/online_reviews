Ahhhh....This is my favorite pizza in the whole wide world. I go to a lot of Giordanos (including this one, Midway airport location and Franklin & Randolph) but have been to this one the most. The stuffed sausage is my favorite along with the stuffed Spinach also. Their thin crust pizza is pretty good as well. They have a bar if you are interested in having a drink.During lunch you can get a personal pizza to go which is always great if you are in a hurry, but you can't get it after 5PM. T This place always hits the spot and will always have the best pizza in Chicago! Mmmm Mmmm Good!
