I love Pequod's for a pre-movie (at the Webster theaters) dinner.  The thin crust is my personal favorite, partly because they leave the thicker crust around the edges so you have something to grab on to! They're also pretty generous with the toppings. We usually get pepperoni and green peppers and let me tell you, that thing is PACKED. The appetizers are standard, nothing especially outstanding, but my girlfriend seems to be a fan of the jalepeno poppers (I have no problem 'helping' her eat them).  Service is always pleasant and very helpful. I don't think I've ever had to ask anyone to refill any beverage, water, soda or beer or for anything else. That's the kind of service that makes me really want to go back. And we do (we also order a lot of delivery...go figure). The restaurant is a little on the small side, but the wait isn't too long usually because there's a pretty good turnover, especially on a weekend night. Two people can eat a nice dinner before a movie for less than $25 (which almost how much two movie tickets cost!!).
