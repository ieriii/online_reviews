This place is amazing. The staff is incredibly knowledgable, the ambience is great, wine menu is riduclous...For appetizers we had the chick pea fries with fresh grated parmasean and white bean stew with boar sausage. HOLY &*%$!!! For my entree, I had the beef tenderloin with black truffle reduction, roasted asparagus and potatoes. My girlfriend had wood roasted lemon chicken over spinach. For desert we shared a chocolate and hazelnut souffle, with hazelnut gelato and candied hazelnuts. oh my god. May have been the best meal I have ever had at a restaurant. I have already recommended it to everyone in my contact list via text message. If you're considering going there, stop considering and just go. Impossible that you'll be disappointed.
