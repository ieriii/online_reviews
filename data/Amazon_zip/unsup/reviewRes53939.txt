90 Miles Cafe is a small little joint that really gives you a feel for that Cuban Experience when you walk right in, Salsa Music is pounding and they have pictures of all these famous Cuban Americans. Staff is Great Service is Fast! Its about 7 dollars for the Cuban Sandwich which is so awesome. You can eat this sandwich at anytime during the it really really is good ! Def pick up the Cuban Sandwich This place gets two thumbs up from me!
