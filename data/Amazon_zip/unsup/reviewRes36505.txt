This is a great little brunch spot in Greek Town. When I'm feeling more 'breakfasty' I get the Meli Toast. It is served with the usual acoutrements but the whipped honey butter is the best.  Waiting is hit or miss. It could take 2 minutes or 20. Larger parties tend to wait longer because seating is layed out to accomodate parties up to 4 people.
