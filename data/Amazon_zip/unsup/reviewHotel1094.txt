This Fairmont certainly one-ups it here. Large clean rooms with actually tasteful decor. Marbled bathrooms with a huge shower n' bath. Plush robes. Miller Harris toiletries. NY times paper at your door. Free hotel valet during our stay and the most random phone near your toilet should need room service from there? Our package also included a $100 Saks card which was pure heaven for me aside from the fantastic hotel services. The valet service can be hit or miss some nights - having to track someone down can be a pill. The other amenities include (but we didn't use) a great spa that was open almost 24 hours daily. Pool n' work out room for $10 bucks all day pass. The hotel is also a little ways away from the shopping, so if you plan to hit the Mile then be prepared to do some walking. Overall no complaints, fantastic hotel and would stay again and again.
