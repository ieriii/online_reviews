Eh. We should probably start with the fact that I don't really like Ethiopian, partly because I don't really like their cold soda bread, but it's down the street so I hit it up anyway. The wait staff was really friendly and helpful; we got the sampler platter and our waitress took the time to tell us about each dish. Overall, Demera was a good experience, I just won't be back any time soon.
