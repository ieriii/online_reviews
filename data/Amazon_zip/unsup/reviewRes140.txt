Three months after dining here, I've finally been able to bring myself to review Alinea - and give it the same number of stars as the Michelin Guide, though on a different scale. Is the food delicious? Yes. Is it creative? Probably the most creative dining experience I'll ever have. How was the service? Impeccable. Was it worth the ridiculous price tag? Only because it somehow raises my credibility during conversation when I note that I've eaten there - and that's not my modus operandi. If you're a foodie with the budget that would allow you to indulge in a 3-star Michelin restaurant, then undoubtedly you will be extremely satisfied with your decision to dine at Alinea. But if you're a casual diner who enjoys great food and pleasurable dining experiences, you'll likely be be left wondering how you ever thought it would be okay to pay this much for 21 courses of food you probably won't be able to describe without a photo to back up your explanation of such things as a crisp of reconstituted pineapple juice dusted with bacon. One might say that casual diners lack the sophisticated palate of a true foodie, which may be true. But one might also say that you can have outstanding dining experiences for 1/6 of the cost; put another way, with the astounding number of excellent dining options in Chicago, you can indulge in six of them for the price of one unique night at Alinea.
