HOLY CRAP THAT'S GOOD I thought to myself as I took my first sip of my ngo nam won ton mein (beef stew egg noodle soup with won ton). I've eaten at a ton of noodle shops in my day and Sun Wah makes authentic Hong Kong style noodles with succulent beef, tasty won tons, fresh veggies, and most importantly an amazing soup broth infused with the essence of beef, star anise, and 5 spice.  I also got a side of the siu ji yuk (roast pork with crispy skin) which could easily contribute to me gaining 5 lbs this summer. The meat is luscious, juicy, with a burst of spice and salt and the skin...oh that skin...is a crackly, crispy bit of heaven.  (Tip: Mentally prepare yourself for the shabby interior (shabby but clean, mind you) and the flying juices as you walk past the butcher counter. This is a good thing! This means they're butchering the meat fresh instead of having it pre-cut. And be warned, they close on Thursday. I seem to make this mistake all the time. Eventually I'll get it.)
