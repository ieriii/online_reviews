It's always crowded because everyone knows Mia Francesca serves the best Italian food in the city. I was just here recently and ordered the chicken marsala for dinner. I loved it and would get it again except there are so many good dishes to try at this restaurant. I also had the chocolate souffle for dessert. Not many desserts can't compare to this!
