Went to BIN for a intro to Wine tasting class with Brian and had dinner afterward. The classes and overall wine offerings are upscale but user friendly and have varied price points. The food is a great balance of traditional and new. Prices are a little more than I like to spend on an average night out but its great for a special night or celebration. Great Success!
