Garcia's wins the game for a couple of important-to-me reasons - right off a train, open relatively late, cheap and tasty food. Now, with that out of the way, you get what you expect, pretty standard Mexican restaurant food. Their al pastor is pretty good, and my guy is a huge fan of the lengua. This would otherwise be a 3 star review, except for their horchata. SO. GOOD. It come in two sizes, standard glass size and ENORMOUS STYROFOAM CUP. Like, can't wrap a single hand around it. How much for all this tasty goodness? $3. Sold, my friend.
