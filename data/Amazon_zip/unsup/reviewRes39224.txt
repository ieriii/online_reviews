I'm vegetarian (Yes you can stop reading now, I won't be offended) but I quite enjoy downing chunks of tofu with large sips of Korean beer. And, I've never left San Soo Gab San hungry. My husband usually gets thin beef strips to BBQ at the table. And I help myself to almost all the side dishes. Special mentions go out to their veggie tempura and noodles. On a busy night, this place is bustling with energy and one feels momentarily teleported to Asia. Good fun and a welcome change from the uptight ambiance of some "Asian fusion" restaurants in the city. Yep, service is a bit off. But I'm willing to overlook that when I get such good value for money.
