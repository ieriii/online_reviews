I'm pretty picky about my Italian food, because I can make some pretty good stuff at home. Caro Mio did not disappoint in the slightest. I got a salmon dish with a spicy pasta sauce. The sauce was perfectly spicy for me, and like many others have said, the portions were ridiculously large. I did not partake in the BYOB part this time, but I'm sure I will in my many future visits. I ordered iced tea, and the waiter brought a full carafe of iced tea to the table. I thought that was great. He even noticed that our table seemed a bit wobbly, and fixed it for us. I didn't think it was that bad, so I wasn't even going to say anything. It's a bit on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for, and you're saving a ton of money by being able to bring your own alcohol anyway. I can't wait to go back.
