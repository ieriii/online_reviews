It's a great place to catch lunch, brunch, hang out in the midst of shopping on Michigan Avenue... It's a standard menu with awesome far.. it's a bit pricey..but not too bad... It's the stepchild of the Cheesecake Factory and is always crowded.. It hits the spot, then you move on..to more shopping!
