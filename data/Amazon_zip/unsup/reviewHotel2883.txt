Please AVOID this hotel at all costs. As indicated in other reviews here and on Expedia, and unless you're accustomed to a Motel 6 experience, this is a two/three star property at best, with outdated rooms, '70s style era Moen/Home Depot-cheap fixtures, cramped rooms, pathetic service (leading all the way up to the CEO of Starwood as I've found) and room service...that NEVER arrives. And like other reviewers here and elsewhere, I too was FRAUDULENTLY charged for items/services never ordered and never received. Now we're getting serious here as this is the stuff people go to jail for especially if it's part of a pattern of abuse and indeed directly or indirectly endorsed/encouraged by management. Stay tuned on a possible CLASS ACTION notification that will destroy this company. Like many of us, I've been in great/good/bad properties all over the world, I've NEVER had this treatment happen to me and this is only part of the story. PLEASE help put this dying dinasaur out of business. Pathetic.
