A place like this comes with a HUGE hype behind it. I have seen this show reviewed on TV before and it seems to be the talk of the town at times. We called the afternoon of a Saturday to try and get reservations for that evening. The host that answered the phone was playful and fun and said they were overbooked and can not take more reservations but she promised to have duck (which they are known for). She said she estimated a 30 minute wait time. We arrived to the restaurant about 7pm and it was packed, as expected, and we were told it would be a 1 hour wait for 11 people. After waiting a bit we decided to order from the to-go counter and take it back home with us. The restaurant is BYOB so we had some beers while we waited for our food. However, they charge $2/beer corkage fee and also a charge for wine. This seems pretty hefty for BYOB to me. The wait for our to-go food was about 20 minutes after ordering until we all received our food. We decided to try a variety of dishes and share them amongst us. I ordered the BBQ Combination in an effort to try different meats. It had good flavor but the real drawback was the small bone pieces of different sizes that I would bit into. This really turned me off and the great taste of the meat couldn't fully be showcased. We also tried a duck rice noodle dish that was fairly good but nothing I have to go back to try again. As I am a big fan of Thai food, I just feel that taste could not keep up and not much flavor was infused. Overall it was a decent meal and the meat was good. The bones just ruined it for me and I would be better off getting a nice Thai meal closer to my house. It's worth a one shot try and I would stick to the duck as that is their trademark item.
