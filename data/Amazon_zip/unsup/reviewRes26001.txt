The most delicious, caramelized crust deep dish has ever boasted! I am not a deep-dish kind of pizza gal, but Pequod's executes it perfectly. It is the perfect answer for a chilly, Chicago evening.  Try their pepperoni & basil pie (mushrooms are a good addition too). The fresh basil really compliments their nearly-perfect sauce.  Pequod's really has no competition in Lincoln Park for the perfect pie. It is in a class of its own. Hint: if you're ordering in, ask for them to NOT cut the pie prior to delivery/pick-up. It keeps all the coveted juices inside.
