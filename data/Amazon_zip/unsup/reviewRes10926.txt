This place was really a pleasant dining experience. We went for brunch on Sunday which is definitely one of the more crowded times. Wait time quoted was an hour, and it took just about 59 minutes to get a table (I can't drop them a star due to wait; if it's good, it's gonna be crowded). **UPDATE** So we've been again since I started this review. This time we arrived earlier; around 1030 am this time, vs. 1130 on our first visit. We were seated in less than 20 minutes. As previously, food was AMAZING (that's no exaggeration and I don't use that word often.. it's not in any of my previous reviews of any place). I won't tell you what to get, as everything we have had has been great. We have always had an entree choice each, then split an order of their delicious, gourmet pancakes. Go hungry!
