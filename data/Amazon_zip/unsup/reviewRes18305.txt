Mmmmm Italian food. I thought I could always use another italian restaurant just in case my favorite italian place (see other reviews) closes down or burns down. Unfortunately this isn't the place for me. It is BYOB which is nice but I think I could have cooked better gnocci at home. My girlfriend had the cheese ravioli which was good, but the bolognese sauce missed the target. We were there with a group of 10 and I don't think I heard one person rave about what they ate. The other good points to mention were easy street parking and it was a nicely decorated restaurant. I would definitely choose other Italian before I went back.
