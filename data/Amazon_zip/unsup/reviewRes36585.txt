Wow....I used to love this place! I have lunch at Meli at least 2 to 3 times a week and have brought all my clients, friends and family to experience the wonderful food and service. But today I brought my BEST client there to have a business meeting and the manager came over to our table and asked to to leave because they had people waiting for our table!  My Client wasn't even done with her food and I was very embarrassed. I will never do business at Meli again. I think they are rude and I can't believe that they would kick us out.....not only that but the manager was rude and gave us a dirty look as she was telling us to leave.  BS!!!!!
