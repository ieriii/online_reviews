One of my favorite restaurants to get breakfast in Chicago, and I've been been visiting it now for about five years on my trips to the windy city. They have a very contemporary menu, fantastic coffee (Intelligentsia, likely roasted at the intelligencia in Chicago), and reasonable prices. I generally get the omelette (as they have many toppings to offer) or the sweet french toast (it was topped with Ghirardelli last I was there). Their menu changes often, so when you go in there's always something new to surprise your taste buds. The environment is also very lively, awakening, and contemporary - much like their menu.  Highly recommended for an modern, upbeat breakfast.
