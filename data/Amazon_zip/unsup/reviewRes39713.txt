Must say I'm impressed. Apparently opened by the owners of the Empty Bottle, this place is much classier than I expected, which made me nervous when I walked in, but after pa-rousing their extensive and expensive drink menu, I was put to ease when I saw the $2 PBR. I indulged in two Pabst and a $3 shot of rye whiskey on the rocks, my wife a glass of wine. Also had a nice spread of house olives and the Kobe Beef meatballs. Our friends ate the beef tongue hash with duck egg, all of which was great. With tip, we spent $32 as a couple. Super worth it.  In all a nice step up in dinning for the area without letting go of that hipster neighborhood edge. I like it lots.
