*Disclaimer* I love Shaw's, but only eat in the lounge - so this review is about that experience. First - this place will remind you of a little New England seafood place (okay, no seafood place out in those parts would have sushi on the menu, but this is Chicago, and that is why we are that much cooler...). They have a a great menu that includes some great raw oysters (check out the daily half price special from 3-6, it's a real deal), lobster rolls, various fresh fish preparations, great clam chowder, fantastic sushi (especially the spicy shrimp and crab roll)and a KILLER Mai Tai...and trust me, since Trader Vic's has closed down, I am picky about a Mai Tai. The feel of this place is casual, which is great considering the incredible food you can get, plus you can order off of the dining room menu if you wish, and all of their desserts are made in house - especially mouth watering is the pecan pie, the raspberry pie, and the peppermint ice cream with fresh hot fudge. I have been going here for about 4 years, and I consistently see the same busboys and servers - and I think that says something good about the restaurant (hey, they must be nice people to work for) - this is a surefire win whenever people are visiting from out of town, something for all and a guaranteed great meal!
