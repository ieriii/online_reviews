disappointing and perhaps on the decline: + wide beer selection... + ...furthermore, particularly eclectic selection on draft - seller's market here--long-ish waits, rising prices, very crowded most nights - oftentimes irritatingly noisy - food quality remarkably inconsistent i distinctly remember enjoying the hopleaf exactly twice. thereafter i noticed that some of the dishes i regularly ordered were not being prepared to their usual standard, specifically the neuske ham sandwich, which i used to have no qualms about climbing mountains and robbing banks for. reports from my friends who have since frequented the bar notice the same thing i did, but also that on certain occasions, these dishes are executed by the night's chef with aplomb. at a certain point, i've become either too old or too impatient to gamble with the quality of a night's meal, and hopleaf simply exceeds my appetite for risk to seriously consider them as a dining option anymore. furthermore, while the beer selection is admirable, it's not as uncommon as it was a decade ago and we have more accessible--and perhaps less expensive--options to patronize. the good news is that i will remember the "old" hopleaf quite fondly. but that doesn't do anyone any good.
