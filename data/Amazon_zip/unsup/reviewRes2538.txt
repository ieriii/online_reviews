Every Thursday for the past two years. I wouldn't go if be wasn't the nicest and most helpful dude you'll ever meet. Quality dude, quality staff, quality meat. This is some last meal before you die type stuff. This is a true Chicago institution. The place is so good people get his logo tattooed on themselves. Know how i know? Because when i got mine i was told i was the tenth person. Get on board before Anthony Bourdain goes and makes this place world famous by putting it on his 'top 13 places you have to eat at before you die'... oh wait, too late.
