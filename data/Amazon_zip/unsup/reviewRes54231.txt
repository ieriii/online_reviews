Such a great place for a fresh food when you're on a budget. I'm glad they expanded their outdoor seating because it's almost always busy. But even when that's the case, staff and owners are friendly and the food comes out decently fast. Plus it's consistent - sandwiches are always good, as is the traditional meal plates. My favorites include the palm salad and the sweet plantains.
