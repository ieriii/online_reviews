More like 3.5 stars... Their food was good - we ordered the pho with rare beef and tripe (an all time heavy fav of mine) and it was perfect! Especially for the cold winters in Chicago - you really cannot go wrong. The downside - we called numerous times and no one ever picked up their phone. They seated the bf and I next to the door when there were plenty of other seats. It's COLD when people open that door...otherwise I fairly enjoyed my bowl of steaming noodle soup...mmmm.....
