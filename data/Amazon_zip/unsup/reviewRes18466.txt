I went based on the wonderful yelps and my love for BYOB and was a little disappointed. I was there at 8pm on a Saturday night with a party of four and was seated fairly quickly which was a nice surprise. I was thinking we might have a long wait. The service was decent but nothing special. The food was average I had the pollo arrabiata and was disappointed. The chicken wasn't good, it had way too much sauce and wasn't spicy. We had the eggplant ap which wasn't anything special. Because it's BYOB and conveniently located with lots of parking I may check it out again to see if the foods better but I don't have high hopes.
