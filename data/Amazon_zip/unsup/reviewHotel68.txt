i was skeptical staying at this hotel but I thought I should give it a shot... BIG.. no .. HUGE mistake.. the room was ok but the paint at the wall was peeling.. the bathroom has "curly" hair.. someone had used the bathroom b4 i checked in and forgot to flush.. I had to inspect the bed for bed bugs ... too expensive and definitely not worth it.. the management was very nice, accomodating and placed a wake up call for me.. nice people .. the place appeared to be nice but turned out to be a disappointment.
