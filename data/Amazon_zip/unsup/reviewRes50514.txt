We like that Big Jones goes out of its way to source ingredients from farms that use humane methods to raise their animals. The restaurant is transparent about the brands it uses--you can find many of the farms it buys from listed on the website and often on the menu as well. We also asked our waiter about the sourcing of some of menu items and he was very knowledgeable and forthcoming.  Big Jones sources its pork from either Gunthorp Farms or Niman Ranch and its beef from Niman or Tallgrass Beef. Tallgrass Beef is completely grass-fed and grass-finished, meaning that the cows are never fed grain. Milk and dairy ingredients come from Kilgus Farmstead, Organic Valley, Prairie Fruits Farm, Trader's Point Creamery and Hook's. Prairie Fruits and Trader's Point are completely grass-fed operations while the others emphasize grazing and pasture-based living for their cows when the weather is hospitable (spring through autumn). The eggs used are organic and come from New Century Farm . Laying hens that are raised organically are never raised in cages. Big Jones uses poultry that comes from Gunthorp Farms. The birds spend a lot of their lives outside as they are pastured at three weeks of age. The Home Smoked Turkey Breast sandwich we ordered was delicious. Big Jones takes it a step further by butchering some of their meat, so that they can be sure of its origin and how the animals were raised. In our opinion, Big Jones is a very humane choice for those who eat animal products. Room for improvement: Consider sourcing beef products that are completely grass-fed and grass-finished to protect cattle health. The Humane Choice is a project of Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT). This restaurant was reviewed by FACT staff members Larissa McKenna and Lisa Isenhart. FACT is a Chicago-based non-profit organization dedicated to improving the way animals are raised on farms.
