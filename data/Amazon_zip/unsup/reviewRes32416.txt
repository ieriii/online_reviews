Very fun atmosphere, the crunchy tuna sushi is so delicious, as are the oxtail pot stickers and the amazing amazing fried brussel sprout salad. Overall I've been really impressed w/the food. I've been here a few times, my only complaint is it gets INSANELY loud. Like you can't hear the person you're sitting 1/2 foot away from at the bar...If they fixed the acoustics I'd be a regular.
