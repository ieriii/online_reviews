4 stars for Cafe 28, technically it should have been 5, but I got elbowed in the back by a dude in a Cubs jersey at the table next to us, sitting so close by that I almost got the wind knocked out of me. I was about to turn around and say something but my tropical martini with crushed coconut chunks arrived just in time to save me from a brawl and getting arrested at Cafe 28. Doris's Recommendation: Green tamales for appetizers, pistachio crusted chicken with potato puree garnished with spinach, and the tres leches cake for dessert. Oh and ask for bread which comes with a garlicky-butter spread. Awesome. The only downfall of this place is the tables are close to each other that dudes can elbow you unexpectantly during your meal. No worries, you just elbow back.
