Ventured there recently with the dames who dine and we had a mighty fine time. Not one for swine, I kept it simple with the margarita pizza and it was delicious. Crust was well cooked, top to bottom (char marks to prove it) and the ingredients were top shelf. My only regret is that it wasn't piping hot when it arrived - just warm. Not sure if that's because I was with a group of 5 and they waited until all were out before serving to me, but yeah, wish it were hot like Don Johnson. We shared a nice bowl of olives. They are not on the menu, so you got to ask for them...but worth the request. Eggplant appy was really good, despite what it looked like on arrival (like dog vomit). Wine was great and so utterly reasonably priced. If you're with a few peeps who are seeking a casual outing and don't want to break the bank, and if you don't need mood-lighting and attentive service, go here.
