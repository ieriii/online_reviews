I'm a pizza snob.  I do not think all pizzas are made equal. This wasn't all that great, I mean, I obviously ate it, but I probably won't order this again.  We had the thin crust with sausage/mushroom/green peppers/onion. I didn't see a single mushroom on the pizza. Boooo. Maybe I'll try the stuffed next time. I wish Palmero's was closer. We ordered at 4:45pm on a Sunday, and it took 1:15 for delivery. We don't usually get anything delivered, but this seemed a little excessive (considering I only live 5 blocks away).
