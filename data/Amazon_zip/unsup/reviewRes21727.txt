Just went to Mayan Palace for the first time last night with friends and we had a great time! Tuesday's and Thursday's they have half-price margaritas's. We ordered this huge pitcher for only $18! What a deal! And if you order frozen margaritas vs frozen, you get a little more. We got mango and felt great by the time we left. The food was also really tasty. They give you free chips and salsa, and we ordered a salad, quesadilla, and enchiladas. The meals were well portioned and tasted great. I had the steak quesadilla and there was a lot of meat in it and definitely filled me up. The meal also came with beans and rice. I'd definitely recommend the Mayan Palace and will come back on another half-price margarita night!
