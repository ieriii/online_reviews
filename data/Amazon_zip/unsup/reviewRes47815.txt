One of the BEST BRUNCHES I have ever experienced!! We didn't make reservations and the tables were filling up when we arrived. The hostess suggested that we sit in the "kitchen" and said that we would see that it can be kind of fun to watch some of the action. The seat was actually at a bar overlooking the final stages of the food preparation and was the COZIEST spot. Every chef made a point to chat with us and tell us about what they were preparing and gave us the first dibs on everything. We ended up having a great conversation with the head chef who couldn't have been nicer. Our server was knowledgable and accomodating and as good as it gets. That is just the service...the food?? Oh my goodness, the food was amazing. There is a buffet (well 4 of them) with all kinds of wonderful meats, cheeses, vegetables prepared in different ways, fruits and ridiculous desserts... but after you've gathered these things, you sit back down and your server brings a frittata, corned beef hash, an absurd cinnamon bun, the most insane brown sugar/maple syrup bacon you've ever tasted and more. Then, on top of all of this, you're given an endless selection of any kind of meat you could possibly desire. What I have just described is all $24/person... WHAT!!! The bloody marys are only $5 a piece during brunch as well. We were literally giggling by the end of the meal that we just happened into the most wonderful brunch of our lives and couldn't have been more full and content. (To top it off, there was a woman that stopped by our table and gave us a gift card she couldn't use -- THANK YOU, that was so sweet!) As a River North resident, I have to comment ZED451 as being the BEST in River North! We'll be back again soon!!
