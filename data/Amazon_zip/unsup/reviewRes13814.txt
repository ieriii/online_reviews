I'm 20 miles away from this place and will be coming back all the time. Hell, I'll drive 90 miles just to score some of this stuff. They make the BEST cuban food I've ever had. Can I hire you guys to cook at my place? That would make my life a whole lot easier...And I'd save on gas.. just sayin.. but ill be back, and been spreading the word of this cuban-awesomeness cheers
