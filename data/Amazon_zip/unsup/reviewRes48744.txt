Really great atmosphere. Came in for dinner tonight for the first time and absolutely loved it. Only reason gave 4 stars is because they seemed to be short staffed on servers? Plenty of people running around filling waters and bringing out the food, but our waitress was fairly MIA to take drink and refill orders?  Started with pork rinds. From there we had the tasting of three hams. They were all delicious and it was a really nice way to start the meal. For the main course we had the pork belly and the cauliflower. Both were DELICIOUS. I could have had 2 orders of the pork belly. The cauliflower gratin was also really really good.  Finished the night off with dessert! The waffle and tart were both great. Can't wait to come back.
