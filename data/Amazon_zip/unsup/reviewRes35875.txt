I've been eating here for over 15 years. I ate here june sixth 2011, all staff looks like they want to jump off a bridge, we came to celebrate a family occasion. When they see my profile picture they will know exactly who I am. But I dont think they care enough to check their social network comments. If they do, they will recongnize me and they will know that I have not been there since June 6th, when their bad moods rubbed off on us one too many times. I would rather eat at a place that makes you feel you are not an inconveince. Like Pho888 (they are just around the corner on Argyle). This place has gone way to far on its old reputation. Sun Wah, in case you are reading this, my mother Fran, my sister Sarah, my niece Brianna, my girlfriend Christine, will never eat at your place again. YOU BLEW IT. IM SICK OF YOUR ATTITUDES. What is most disheartening is one of the owners daughters is their almost daily. That means she lets it happen. She is not respected even by her own staff. I would change careers if you cant make a difference even if your families own business. Best of luck, youre going to need it. All good things come to an end sooner or later. Remember that. Sincerely, Angelo
