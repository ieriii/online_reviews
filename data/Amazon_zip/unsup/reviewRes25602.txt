Went here for a romantic date with the husband and it lived up to our expectations. We had a cheese sample board to start and that was followed by the cheese fondue, vegetarian platter and finished off with chocolate fondue and coffee. They served the coffee with whipped cream which was heavenly rich and delicious. The ambience is dark and smoky. Yes, there are a lot of tables close together, but simply specify that you would like a booth with your reservation if that is something that bugs you. As for some of the complaints about the oil: it's fondue! What do you expect? We had fun fishing broccoli out of the pot with our little fondue forks. There was much laughing and squealing. I loved roasting marshmallows over the chocolate course. The dipping sauces are quite tasty as well. I found the service exceptional. The waiters even came by and folded my napkin when I went to the restroom! We ordered a bottle of wine and the server came around periodically to fill our glasses. It's definitely heavy and you'll feel very full when it's all said and done, but for an occasional indulgence you can't go wrong. I haven't been to the Melting Pot, but I would much rather support a locally operated restaurant than a chain.
