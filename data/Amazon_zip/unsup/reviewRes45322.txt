Best burger in Chicago! I get the blue on blue with a gluten free bun and curry dipping sauce for my fries, my boyfriend gets the bison burger. This is my favorite brunch spot in Chicago. Great outdoor seating in the summer and cozy fire place seating in the winter. Excellent drink menu and the service is outstanding. Well done Wilde, well done.
