Not the best of the best but I always find myself coming to this place anytime I go to Chicago because of the delicious Vietnamese dishes. The price is not bad either. The place is actually quite small but the glass wall around the restaurant make it look waaaay bigger than how it actually is. I love this feature because in Vietnam, we usually have Pho on the street, enjoying the scene of the city in a big crowd of other people who are also eating, and this restaurant does bring that nostalgic feeling to me. Pros: - Authenticity scores 8/10 - Food are fresh and delicious, - Quick service once you're seated, - Nice view of streets, helpful waiters, - Impressive name to recommend for friends. Cons: - If you go to peak dinner time, you might have to wait standing around for 30' - 1 hour to be seated, and there is no waiting area/chairs - The place looks big but actually quite small so you might have to share table with some strangers occasionally at a big long table. However we do this a lot in Vietnam so let's think about it as an authentic feature of Vietnamese cuisine. - Waiters are not the best, they're cool but might be rude sometimes during restaurant's mega-busy time. Anyway, the MUST-GO Vietnamese restaurant if you visit Chicago!
