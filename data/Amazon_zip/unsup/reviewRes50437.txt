Oh yes. Butter. Bacon. Mini beignets for a breakfast amuse bouche. I had the bacon and cheese omelet with cheese grits, CHEESE, baby! Just the perfect size that I didn't eat too much. Still enough to require a walk after breakfast to work off some calories. Those sexy, sexy calories! My romeo had the Eggs Romero, and lucky I retained my hand from continually snaking my fork onto his plate for jussssst. onnnnne. morrrrre. bite! What girl can resist pulled pork and eggies with delicious grits in some sort of pure-heaven, stick o' butter gravy I ask you? Not me! Need to go back for the $5 daquiri special, ohh yes, or some other decadent southernstyle delight on their small but perfect menu, yes, sweetiedarling! A very welcome addition to the neighborhood, Suh!
