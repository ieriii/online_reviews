Went here with a group of friends, one of whom is moving to South Korea to teach ESL and has never eaten Korean food at all. The atmosphere is nice and the food was really tasty.  We did the family style bbq. We got beef and pork and all the fixins. I really enjoyed it a lot. I have to say it was easy going with a person who did speak Korean, so communicating with the servers was a lot easier than it seems others have experienced.
