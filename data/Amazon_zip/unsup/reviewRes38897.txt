L&E can be pretty packed on Sunday afternoons. There isn't much standing room by the door and patrons will not be seated unless the whole party is there. Here's what we had for brunch: deconstructed clam chowder, croque madam, sunny side duck egg hash, and peeky toe crab benedict. The clam chowder had a pork belly centerpiece surrounded with scallions, wine-infused baby clams, bacon shreds, and potato pellets. I started from the outside and worked my way in. Everything was marvelous especially with the wine-popping clams until I swam to mid-ocean. I was drowned in salt water in the region circulating the pork belly. Had to sound the red alert and scramble ashore and chug a huge glass of water.  I managed to get a huge bite of the croque madam and peeky toe crab benedict. They were my favorites! The croquet madam was very well toasted with a generous portion of ham. The ham was layered with mornay sauce and the sandwich was topped with a sunnyside up egg. It can get messy but it's well worth it. It also sounds like a heavy lunch but it really wasn't especially with the sides of greens. The peeky toe crab benedict had shreds of crab and one hour eggs placed on an English muffin. Despite the portions appearing a bit small, this delicatessen can be filling. The duck egg hash was a little less memorable. I would've enjoyed it better if they didn't cut the duck confit and potatoes to tiny bits.
