I have to say this, even though it makes me look like a complete pretentious jerk with his head up his hoo-hah: If you've never been to Oaxaca, Xoco will seem amazing to you. Bayless gets his chocolate from a company there, Mayordomo, and it's UNAVOIDABLE there. It's admirable he sources his chocolate so well, but when you've had it every day for a tenth of the price, it's less impressive. Also: Churros are incredibly easy to make. They're definitely good here, but nothing you can't find on literally every corner in Mexico. The tortas are delicious. The Ahogado is AMAZING, and one of those dishes that makes me think about sandwiches differently. The panini aren't as impressive; I had their prosciutto panini with a fried egg, and while tasty, it was a complete mess, partially because they didn't cut all the way through the bread, and flipped it upside down, so the sandwich collapsed into the basket as soon as I lifted it up. For $13, the least they can do is cut all the way through. Definitely worth an occasional visit, but way way overblown.
