Holy crap! Just ate here for the first time today. I only tried their pho, but it was the best I've had. Perfect! And WOW, what a generous serving! At first I was like, "What? $6.95? Seriously?" But I'll be able to eat the other half for lunch tomorrow. That's always a plus. Definitely coming back, and soon. EDIT: Okay, went back a few days later (yeah, I know..don't laugh at me) and ordered the Pho Ga again. Perfect, again. This time I ordered dessert. I can't remember the exact name, but it's the last one on the dessert menu. It was a banana sweetie cake of some sort. WOW, it was SO GOOD. You have to try it.
