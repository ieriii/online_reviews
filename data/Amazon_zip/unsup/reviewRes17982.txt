one of my favorite bars in the city. it was phenomenal when no one knew about it 16 months ago, but i can't fault it for being popular. if a place does brisk business, it must be doing something right. before the VH, i hadn't really been exposed to many cocktails aside from the blank & tonic, so i can thank this lounge for opening my eyes to new drinks and rare liqueurs. i refuse to go unless i sit at the bar. watching the bartenders create their concoctions is 3/4s the experience, IMHO. i want to nominate michael for best bartender in the city. he shares a passion for booze that cannot be matched. he once gave me, my roomie, and fiancee a lesson on chartreuses. he also gave me a rum lesson. these personalized, hands-on experiences make me want to rate VH a 5. the wait is well worth it. i love bringing visitors here for a surprise. aside from being too popular and getting crowded, i've downgraded the place for its food. maybe i'm not a foodie or my palate is not refined but i think the fried pbj & bacon is overrated with flavors a bit too subtle for me. i don't think my palate sucks entirely. to note, michael says i picked his favorite rum in a blind taste test of 5 brands.
