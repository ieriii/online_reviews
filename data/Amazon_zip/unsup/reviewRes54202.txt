We went last weekend recommended by Guy Fieri (food network show). We had a large chifrijo and pepito sandwich that we shared. The service is excellent the food is great. The price is fair. We tried the Jamaica-lime tea very delicious. Will be returning! I gave it 3 stars because I have only been here once. Don't have other times to compare it with. Hope the second time is just as good.
