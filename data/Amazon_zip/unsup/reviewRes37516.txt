My dad has been wanting to come to Hopleaf for quite some time now, and last night we finally went. He's a beer afficionado, I'm not, but I do enjoy a good imported rare beer every now & again. Hopleaf has an enormous selection of unusual beer that isn't found everywhere. The beer menu took me about 10 minutes to read & make a selection, then when I get up to the bar, they're out of the kind that I wanted, so it took another few minutes to make a secondary selection. We ordered some of their frites to munch on & they were some of the better fries I've had in a while. They specialize in mussels, but I'm not a fan so we skipped those. If you enjoy a wide variety of imported beer and/or mussels, Hopleaf is for you
