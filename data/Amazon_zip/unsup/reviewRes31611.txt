This weekend I was very adventurous and tried two new restaurants. I was very excited about trying them because of the different concept they each offer. So, I tried Na Na in Bridgeport on Saturday and Caf Too in the north side on Sunday. Na Na was by far, the worst of the two. I was there on Saturday evening and the place had a 'private' bridal shower on that day. I figured the one getting married was either one of the owners or a family member. The whole experience was awful. All the wait staff was attending that event and our table had to literally wait forever for our waiter to come back to our table after he left the food. I also couldn't even get up to use the washroom because all the people from the party were standing on the way. The problem that I had with this party happening is that I would rather have found the place closed due to the event than to have to sit there while their guests invaded my dining experience. There was a point where the guests simply started to disperse through the whole area. I noticed the other dinners making awkward faces too, so I know they too, noticed the invasion not just me. Out of 5 starts I would give it 1 1/2 because of the food.
