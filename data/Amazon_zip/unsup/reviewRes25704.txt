Had my 24th birthday celebration here - and I am so glad that I picked Simply It! I usually have trouble finding BYOB places that can accommodate larger groups - and the restaurant set up a long table (and a smaller table behind) for our group of 28. The servers were on the quieter side, but very attentive. The owner is SO friendly and helpful, both during our dinner and when I was making reservations the week before. The food is super fresh and very well prepared. I ordered spring rolls and the ginger mahi mahi. The spring rolls were good, but my main entree was FANTASTIC. It was moist and perfectly cooked, with a delicious crust on the outside and an extremely flavorful sauce to accompany the fish. Everyone else really enjoyed their food as well - some highlights were the whole-baked snapper, salmon, vegetarian stir fry, and pho. The restaurant also didn't mind that we brought a LOT of alcohol (everything from wine to beer to tequila) - in fact the owner reminded me a couple times while I was placing the reservation that they were BYOB. Once everyone was pretty much done eating, the staff brought out a big plate of ice cream, fried bananas, and fresh fruit with candles for me. They also brought out several extra plates (with the same dessert items) for our large party which I thought was really nice of them. When it was ready to pay (which can be a nightmare with such a large group), Simply It had the perfect solution - they allowed everyone to go up to the front and pay for whatever they ordered. There was no squabbling over the bill or any problems with splitting it between lots of credit cards. I will definitely be going back to Simply It (with a smaller group, and probably less alcohol haha) to sample their other menu options.
