crisp was overly hyped that i wasn't super impressed with the food. we had seoul sassy chicken, crisp bbq chicken, seoul sensation burritos, fries, and the radish kimchee. the chicken was nicely fried, but the sauces were a bit too sweet and generic for my liking. the seoul sassy chicken had a spicy pork bulgogi marinade and the crisp bbq chicken had a bulgogi marinade. the burritos were stuffed with extremely fresh ingredients, but it tasted like bibimbop in a tortilla. the fries and radish kimchee were extremely good. overall, crisp has good and fresh food, but i don't think i'll proactively seek out or crave it. definitely a place worth trying!
