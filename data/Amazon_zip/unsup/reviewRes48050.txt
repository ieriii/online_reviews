I thought this place was cute, service was great, beer was good, and food was also good. I took away one star because I like veggies, and there were very limited options! But otherwise, we will definitely be back. Also, a nice place in the neighborhood. I work nearby, and it's a restaurant desert in the "fulton market' area.
