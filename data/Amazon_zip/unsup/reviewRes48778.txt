This restaurant came highly recommended; however, I was not that impressed. We had 7:30 reservations on a Tuesday. I was torn between the halibut and the sable fish. However, my decision was made for me because they were out of both items. My husband and I shared the goose breast salad. I did not like the goose breast at all. It was chewy and gamey. Then we had the fish stew, which was pretty good. However, the side of toasted bread served with it was hard as a rock and tasted burnt. We then shared the fried smelt. This was a very heavy dish- fried cheese curds, fried smelt, and fried lemon slices. It was served over some greens with a tartar type sauce. All the individual components were tasty, but when combined on one plate it made for a very heavy, greasy dish. The fried lemon slices were actually my favorite part of our entire meal. They were delicious. My husband had a short rib, which he said was good. For desert we shared the mascarpone ice cream, which was heavenly. But I wish we got more than two tablespoons of it, because that's about what the portion size looked like. As for service, it was hard to get our servers attention, and food items took a long time to get to the table. Overall there were some good aspects to our experience, and some misses. I was extremely disappointed that they were out of their two main fish options so early, and on a weeknight (I was not interested in the $41 fish option that was available). Service was average at best. And, for $7 we got two tablespoons of ice cream, and it didn't have any of the accompaniments it was supposed to have. I ended up with a terrible stomach ache after the meal, and felt ill for the rest of the evening.
