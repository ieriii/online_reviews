Yes, this place had great cuts of meat and an impressive salad bar. HOWEVER, I gave it only 3 stars for the sheer fact that I had such an awful experience when I went here because of the atmosphere. My boyfriend and I went to Fogo in hopes of a nice, romantic meal. We arrived at around 8 pm on a Thursday night and walked in to sheer chaos. I was so surprised to see that there was no sign of a dress code for this restaurant. All of the waitstaff are spruced up, but there were customers there in everything from nice evening-wear to torn off jeans and t-shirts! There were even 2 young (13ish) girls chasing each other around the salad bar wearing tank tops, sweatshorts, and flip flops! On top of this, the lights were blaringly bright and it was definitely not a romantic setting. Yes, it is a "buffet," but for over $50 a plate (NOT including drinks), there needs to be a better atmosphere. There is no way that I will be returning here again to blow my future paychecks. Now, let me also say that, despite what it sounds like, I am not a dining snob! It's just the fact that if I'm going to treat my man to a $160 meal, I'm not going to want to watch trashy tourists at every other table wiping their mouths on their Sears Tower t-shirts. On a further note, I recommend Brazzaz. There's a lot of hype around it right now cause of the giant advertising budget, but the atmosphere was great and I honestly think the food was better. So, if you like to dine with rowdy tourists, go here. Otherwise, go to Brazzaz!!
