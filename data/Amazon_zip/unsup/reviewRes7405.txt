Came here for a day trip when a friend and I went up to Chicago. We went on a Sunday night and met a couple people I knew that lived in Chicago that had never been before. It wasn't too busy, about 10 other people in there not including us. Everyone's dishes were fantastic, the server was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu, and the menu selection was pleasing to all of us. I would highly recommend Sapori Trattoria for a romantic date, a seating of four (like myself and company I was with), but probably not for a big group as I could see it could possibly get a little crowded with 15+ people. If you are looking for good Italian food in Chicago, Sapori Trattoria is an excellent choice.
