I'm giving this bar a hell of a lot of credit for their food and cocktails- brilliant. Albeit on the heavy/fatty side, Gilt bar's menu is suitable for almost anyone. Their selection is quite varied and they make sure you leave thinking of coming back, thinking about what you ate twice. One thing that me and a friend really enjoyed was their bone marrow. I know, it sounds slightly revolting but the way they have cooked it is for serious carnivores- the marrow is as good as beef butter... delicious and melts on a perfectly toasted italian bread without shame. I think I hallucinated after a taste of that seeing everyone stop and watch me sing my mmmmmms- simply divine! The cocktail bar was pro- I'll give them all credit for that although the wait staff din't understand what I felt like having, they surely corrected their mistakes. Atmosphere, check. Food and quality, check. Drinks, check. Creativity in food, decor of the place, check. Waitstaff- hmm, a little bit too friendly they might as well have just joined our table, haha! At least better than rude or arrogant!
