After 5 years of ordering either stuffed or thin crust pizza, we decided to order the pan pizza on a whim. We had the hawaiian, which was a weird order for us, but we were not disappointed. The cheese was hot and melty. The canadian bacon was thinner than I expected, which was a good thing. The pineapple was delicious and the green peppers were unexpected and delicious. It's honestly one of the best pizzas I've had.
