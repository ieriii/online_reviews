Not only is the staff friendly and efficient, but it's hands down the best deep dish pizza I've ever tried. It's addictive, so be careful. Also, very inexpensive as each slice (whether thin or deep) is $2.75. Fresh, crunchy-chewy crust with full-flavored, well-seasoned tomato sauce....AHHHHH. Remarkable.
