I am a huge Brazilian steakhouse fan and frequent to one of the main four (Chama, Texas, Brazzaz, Fogo) on a regular basis. When it comes to service and quality of the food, Fogo stands tall above its competitors. The menus in all of the steakhouses are very similar, but the taste is distinctly better at Fogo. It is slightly more expensive, but definitely worth the extra penny.
