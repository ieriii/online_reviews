This is my default place to eat. With a never-ending menu, I will always find something satisfying. Sometimes the receipts come with optional online surveys to receive $10 gift certificates- great for future visits! For breakfast, I enjoyed the vegetarian omelet. It had tons of mushrooms, spinach, green and red peppers, and onions. The Breakfast Sandwich was good and meaty but a bit salty. For dinner, I once had a calamari salad. Although the waitress said it was small, it was still big compared to other restaurants. Great salad.
