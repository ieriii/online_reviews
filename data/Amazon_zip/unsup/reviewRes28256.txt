Really loved this place. Always hard to get dinner reservations, but lunch is a bit easier. It's a lot of your typical mexican dishes, but made in a different way, with different flavors mixed in, and different meats/ingredients. The menu changes seasonally, we had an early-fall one with great ceviche, guac and enchiladas. Rick Bayless was there eating, brain-storming, and having a staff meeting. A lot of his products have become commercialized, so it's nice to see him in the restaurant still. Great time, great drinks (really liked this fruit beer they had, it wasn't overly sweet at all), and great food. Can't wait to come back.
