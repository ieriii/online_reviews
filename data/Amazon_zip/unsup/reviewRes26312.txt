Been here twice, enjoyed it fully both times. The room is comfortable, the owner (I assume) and servers are really friendly and efficient, and the food is always tasty. Quality is a cut above the kibble you get on Argyle Street, and while the prices are higher than the Uptown places, they are not THAT much higher. And, who doesn't love BYOB?  Weeknights are easy to get in; weekends not so.
