I love Wishbone. I work really nearby, and I often eat lunch there. I am addicted to the Wishbone Omelet, which has cheddar cheese, potatoes, and salsa inside. The cheese grits are scrumptious, the home fried (glorified potato bites), will make your stomach happy. The prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is warm and friendly, though a bit on the trendy side.
