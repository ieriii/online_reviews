The Calo is an Italian gem in the middle of Swedish town. The Carbonara there is probably the best I've ever had. And I consider myself a Carbonara connoisseur. If that's possible. It's so creamy and bacony, and together with the perfectly cooked noodles a regal bed is made for the fresh green peas. The chicken bow tie pasta is also excellent, and the portions of everything there are easily enough for two, if not three meals. It's enough to remember not to fill up on the wonderful bread on the next visit... but that's mostly because there needs to be room for the Tiramisu! The wait staff is very attentive here- servers, hosts, and busboys are all very friendly and appear often. As far as atmosphere, Calo is dimly lit and very romantic with candles and nice, comfortable decor. On one visit a light jazz pianist was providing some upbeat background music. My ears pricked up once I realized he was playing Pink Floyd's Shine On in it's entirety. Even the guitar solos flowed effortlessly from his fingertips as everyone enjoyed their fantasic meals.
