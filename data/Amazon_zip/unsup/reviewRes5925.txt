I think if there's one steakhouse in the Chicagoland area that has set a standard for a typical steakhouse, Wildfire is it. I've been here plenty of times, and the quality is what keeps me coming back. SOME (and I'll repeat) SOME Lettuce Entertain you restaurants can do that. Goat cheese for an appetizer is a must, and I always suggest the chopped salad, as it's one of the best I've ever had. This means it of course can't be too healthy, loaded with blue cheese, pasta, chicken, avocado, and don't forget the bacon. The Filet Trio is always on the menu no matter what. It's listed as a featured special but it's always on there. I'm not sure if Wildfire is the originator of the encrusted flavors on top of steaks, but they were the first I've seen to have them and I love them for it. Horseradish, Blue Cheese, Parmesean, Peppercorn, whatever your flavors are they have them, and if you get the Filet Trio, you get to choose three different crusts if you like. I go with the horseradish everytime now.
