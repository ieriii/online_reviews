Amazing! Best word to describe our meal. They seriously had me with the bread, and it just kept getting better! We started with one of the special appetizers, an artichoke dish, and it was unbelievable. For my main dish, I had another special on the menu, a butternut squash and pumpkin ravioli. Probably one of the best raviolis I've ever had. Ambiance was great, our server was knowledgeable and we just had an overall wonderful time. Can't wait to back!
