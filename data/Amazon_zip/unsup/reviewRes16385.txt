I have been here a couple times, most recently last night. This place has great cocktails. Hands down. They just taste great, and honestly, I'm not that put off by their $12 cost. I feel that it is pretty worth it. They use fresh ingredients, homemade syrups, bitters...etc. It's a quality drink. This place is great if you're looking for a very calm and intimate evening with a total of 2-4 people. It's very dark and relaxed in there. The seating is pretty neat. They have intimate tables and booths, but you can also sit at the bar, which I recommend if you are alone or with just one other person. It's pretty cool watching the bartenders make the drinks. I've taken a nibble or two of their food. Nothing special - a bit over priced. Go out to dinner before you come here - come here for your before bed cocktail or two. Or three. (If you can afford it, hah). They do not take reservations, and yes, you will have to wait in line. I was aware of this, so I was not too peeved about it. My friend and I ended up waiting about 20 minutes, which wasn't so bad. Though, I am confused as to why the host continuously kept going towards the end of the line to let people in ahead of everyone waiting. Maybe they were his friends? Interesting, considering how much they try to emphasize all of their rather pretentious rules of waiting in line, no reservations, etc. A total of at least 10 people got moved up ahead of me in line by staff, while I was waiting. I would have given this place 4 stars, but after that experience, I feel that I have to knock another off. Don't try to be pretentious and post lists of rules everywhere if you are not going to follow them to a tee. But yeah. Great cocktails. Seriously, the flavors are complex and amazing.
