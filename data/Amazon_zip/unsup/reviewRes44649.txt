I am definitely a fan of Giordano's so please don't let the 3 stars fool you. Three (3) stars does signify A-Ok and this place is "A -O-K" in my book. I like deep dish, and this place is by far - the best deep dish I have ever had, but not quite the best pizza I've ever had so, it gets 3 stars for good pizza, a great experience, and a good time with the crew. (Artist & Team during Lollapalooza) Pizza to me is an art, and the ingredients play a huge role in the masterpiece. I personally feel that each aspect of the masterpiece should be seen, felt, tasted, and touched, and although the deep dish was GREAT, it didn't create any earth shaking magic in my palate.  Now PLEASE don't attack me or hate me for my review, but I always refer back to a saying that I heard once: "How do you know, that you have tasted the best ice cream in the world, if you have NOT tasted every ice cream in the world??? Enjoy!
