Schwa is one of our favorite special-occasion places. Love that it's BYOB, and the quail-egg ravioli is probably one of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire life. The service and reservation "system" are definitely, um, different. This is not the place for you if you're looking to be wined and dined in a traditional, upscale dining sense. But this place should definitely be experienced. It's a pleasure to be cooked for by one of the country's most talented and creative chefs.
