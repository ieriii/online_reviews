Best deep dish in the city hands down. The place is a dive but don't let that be misleading... it also looks like they're about to expand so hopefully it won't be as cramped. $2.52 per slice is a great deal as well. The rest of their menu isn't the best, but they've got a ton of stuff and their daily specials are a steal. I've never left that place hungry or disappointed.
