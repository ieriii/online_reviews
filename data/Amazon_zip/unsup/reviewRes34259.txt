Yolk is pretty good. I would best describe it as an upscale diner. The menu is very extensive and actually quite tasty. There really is something for everyone here and they are happy to accomodate the customer's request. Nothing here is absolutely amazing, but it's definitely the place to go if you like your skillets and ham and cheese omelets. A pretty nice atmosphere overall, except the staff isn't quite up to par. (Except Rocio and Rick... ooh lala) Overall, definitely give this place a try if you like your breakfast your way!
