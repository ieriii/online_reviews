I have been going to Calo a long time (15 or 20 years) over the years the restaurant seems to be going more upscale." The food is still great and consistent however the service is really declining due to it's popularity, especially long waits to get a table and no parking in the lot (especially on weekends). Calo was always the old standby because they had a parking lot and you could always grab a table. On some recent visits wait times have been over a hour and there is nowhere to sit (or even stand) at the bar. The last three times I have been here the parking lot is full, the attendant tells you to park at a nearby bank, when you go to the bank all of the spots are taken. I don't know if you have tried to park on the streets in Andersonville recently but it is almost impossible on a Friday or Saturday night.  The food is consistent, always good, fresh, the portions are gigantic (I always have take home) and it is nice that your salad or soup is still included with the entrees. The coffee is great (I think it is LaVaza from Italy) and a nice martini menu / selection.  It looks like the restaurant may have to expand again to keep up with the crowds or they are going to loose some of their "old time" customers.
