Absolutely fantastic.. Amazing selection on the menu... Quirky, fun staff.. Fun location, too.. Every time I'm in the area, I demand to stop here. Only regret? They took off the wheatloaf sandwich. Kudos on the gyros though!!OH, and try the mashed potatoes!! You would never ever guess the gravy is vegan!
