The first time I went to Davanti, I was there for a party a month after they opened, the service was amazing, as was the food, the wine & the dessert to die for. I ate so much I had the worst stomach ache an hour after I got home. I knew I wanted to go back, and finally had a chance to last night. The menu was different; a winter menu. We started off with the Buschetta, we failed to do so, but ask what the topping of the day is as it is not your typical Buchetta topping. Loved the salad, Escarole, the apples & hazelnuts were a lovely touch. I had the Uovo in Raviolo, really good, but NOT a good value. All you get is 1 big ravioli sitting on sauce. Good thing we had the salad & buchetta to fill me. For dessert, we had the Torta Bacio (Chocolate Hazelnut mousse) with a side of vanilla gelati. That was perfect! I left there thinking I would go back to try their pizza because they looked good, BUT about an hour after I got home I had the worst stomach ache again. I think it's good food, but it just does not agree with me.
