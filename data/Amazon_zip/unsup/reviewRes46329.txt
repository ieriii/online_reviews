My friends love this place...I like it. Everything I don't like about the place (bad parking, crowded, busy, touristy, not intimate)...the food makes up for it. Delicious. We had a group of 12 and we passed plates around...I had nothing I disliked....odd. Let me try that again...yup, good and that...yup awesome. I can't say I would go here on my own, but when someone suggests it and raves about it...I don't complain.
