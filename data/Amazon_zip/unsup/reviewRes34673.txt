Hands down, my favorite sushi place so far, and bonus that they're BYOB. I've been to a number of other ones around the city, and Sushi X is consistently the best quality with a fantastic variety of rolls. I've had friends complain that they can't find good sushi in the city (how is that possible?) so I bring them here. One bite of the Maui Waui, and they're sold. I mean, come on - who doesn't love coconut and bacon? My only complaints are that they're not open for lunch, and service tends to be a little slow, but the quality MORE than makes up for those minor shortcomings.
