I went here to carb-load before the Chicago Triathlon last August, and apparently wasn't the only one who chose this place. The waits for this restaurant are notoriously long, but that's why reservations were invented. A long line also usually means the place is worth visiting at least once. While it's not overwhelmingly fantastic Italian food to write home to your Sicilian grandmother about, the meal I had was fantastic. I usually rate Italian restaurants by the bread and olive oil (or lack thereof) that they set at the table, and this place does not disappoint in the least. The menu is always changing, too, which makes it a place to come back again and again.
