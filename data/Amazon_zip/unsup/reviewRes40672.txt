Best steak tacos possible. The salsa is to die for, especially the darker burnt looking one. Try the chachos for added glutany. Eat the carne asada con todo tacos for the best tasting tacos possible. I am a true and loyal fan. Don't mind the clientele. It pulls from the area and there tends to be a lot of kids up way too late, like past 11:00 on Sat nights.
