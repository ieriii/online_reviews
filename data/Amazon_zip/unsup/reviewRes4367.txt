The Poetry Slam on Sundays can't be overrated. There can be not so great nites, but there will always be good times there. I recommend getting there before 7pm to get a good seat, otherwise you could be relegated to "standing room only". Afterwards, stick around for the great jazz music. There is a cover, under $10. but the drinks aren't expensive and you have all the Vietnamese restaurants just west of there(Pho Xe Tang aka Tank, Pho 777) around Argyle St. and a really good chinese seafood place across the street, Silver's Seafood. On any other nite, you can expect a great nite of jazz. Saturday's especially.
