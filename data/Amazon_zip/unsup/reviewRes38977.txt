The pizza at La Villa sets the bar! Perfect every time. I recommend ordering with fresh garlic and extra cheese for the best night-in-front-of-the-TV meal. Would you believe when moving earlier in the year staying in the delivery radius of La Villa was a real concern? We haven't ordered many other dishes off the menu. Most of our time spent in the restaurant has been with a drink at the bar while waiting for a pizza to-go (used to live within walking distance). It's a great neighborhood spot and we've never been disappointed.
