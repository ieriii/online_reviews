This place is great. I really like the interior and the ambiance. Busy but very friendly staff. Great service. Now on to the most important feature that we all care about. THE FOOD I just have one thing to say. SASSY SEOUL!!! I have had the sassy seoul chicken wings a few times. These are by far the best greasy most delicious fried chicken wings I have ever had hands down. I find myself with the desire to keep licking my fingers hoping to continue tasting the sassy seoul flavor. I mean come on, it is really that great! Trust me. Try it. I would recommend this to everyone!!! Bowls look nice too but I have never had one. Has to be good I am sure. But it's all about the Sassy Seoul Chicken Wings for me! Oh yeah!!!
