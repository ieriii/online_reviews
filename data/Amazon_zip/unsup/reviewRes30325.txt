I have no complaints! I had the Red Pepper Hummus plate and even as an appetizer, it filled me up! The also have a small but great selection of local beers :) I went there to meet up with a friend I haven't seen in a long time and it was a great spot and the wait staff are attentive but also give you time to chat up with the people at your table.
