My fiancee and I recently bought a condo around the corner from Wilde and went there when it first opened. We've been back several times now, and I'm glad to say that I have yet to leave unsatisfied! Their food is great - I'm a huge fan of their salmon, meatloaf, and their chopped salad. Drink selections are good as well. This is a restaurant that this area of Lakeview needed!
