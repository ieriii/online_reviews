so i went totally out of my way to find this place and from what i'd read it was gonna to a great experience.The menu looked great and so i ordered a budha bowl and some wings. The bowl was with beef which was way too sweet, sickly so and the wings were bearable. Sorry but this place is not a contender. go somewhere else and spend your bucks.
