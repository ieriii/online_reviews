I saw the chef on Top Chef Masters, and his preparation of three different types of ahi tuna - a favorite dish in my family - made me decide immediately to go to his restaurant. Several months later, my dad and I brought his parents there. The service was perfect; my water glass never reached half full, and our waiter was happy to answer any questions or meet any special requests we had. The food was amazing; I ended up taking on five courses to get a taste of everything. Overall, a great experience, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting some awesome food in a chill restaurant.
