Drove in for a daytrip in Chicago, found this place on yelp, and it was a great find. The Sal Tessio was good but the foie gras dog simply blew my mind. It makes me want to go hunt for duck liver. A must have. I tried the duck fat fries as well, which really just tasted like normal fries to me, fries are fries. Be prepared for a gigantic line and arctic like winds, but once you finally get to the end and doug himself greets you, it will all be worth it. p.s doug is ok, not that hot, no matter what my girlfriend says p.p.s ok doug i suppose you are a charmer
