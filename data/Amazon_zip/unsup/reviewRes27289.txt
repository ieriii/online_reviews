-Foillpops = as amazing as the rumors on campus! -GE Caeser Salad = where was the flavor? Mine was lacking heaping amounts of salt, even with anchoives! Tasty, yes. Also, my pieces of romaine were heavy with the core. The Broiche Twinkee was delightful! Beautiful plating, too. -The Strongoff. Oh yum. Cooked like...I dunno...perfect?! The noodle underneath were lacking. The creme fraiche was nice verses traditional sour cream. -My friend's Honey Lavender Chicken. Fried pickle rocked my cock. The potato salad reminded me of a grandma during Sunday Church Pot Luck. I never like chicken boob, didn't like this one either. Too dry. Everything else was amazing, though. Over all, it's a nice place. Kinda loud, kinda fun to get buzzed. (The Pomelo 2007 is frickin amazing) Will I be back? THells yeah. There's too much I want to try.
