They call this place a gastropub and let me tell you, it is more gastro than pub. It was a lot fancier than I expected with the nice table linens and set-up and the gourmet menu. So much of the menu looked delicious-really, more like an upscale restaurant selection. I opted for something simple and something pub-like: the fish and chips. It was a ton of fried food! 3 huge pieces of fish and a ton of fries! The fish was fresh and the fries were decent. My friend got the Gage burger which was HUGE and juicy! Really, the portions are large but when you are paying over $15 for "pub" food, you probably expect them to be. And, everything else on the menu was even more pricey. (Entrees more along the line of $20-$30) I would go back to try some of the more gourmet dishes once I have a little more $ to spare! The funny thing about this place is it is right across from Millennium Park so you get a lot of tourists coming in who are dressed very casually. (Good thing, b/c we were, too!) But really, I think it is trying to be more of an upscale place with their price points and with the chef really focusing on combining interesting dishes and flavors and using high-quality ingredients. Side note: This would make a great place for a Yelp event, as there is a nice private room downstairs!
