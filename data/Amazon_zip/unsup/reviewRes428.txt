Look, Anyone who doesnt give this place 5 stars is clearly influenced by the bill. I can totally understand as it was $700 for two of us to eat. Seeing as though I am not Jay-Z, that kind of bill was tough to stomach. That said, even the Jiggaman would give props to this place. The bottom line is I enjoyed every single part of this meal. I can fully say that I went into Alinea trying to hate the place and was pleasantly surprised at every aspect of the place. At first I thought I was entering the Matrix. Then, while eating, I knew I was in some kind of Matrix.  Please understand that at heart I am a dive bar kind of guy. I'm not really into a scene and I can easily say this place is so unique that it will never become a scene (that and the price is prohibitive). Nevertheless, I am happy I went there. The goose was phenominal, the potatoes were fantastic, and the dessert was incredible. I would go again for the first time but my pocket will need to recover before I go again. GO AND ENJOY!!
