Great Place!! The food...ALL the food is oh so good. The salad bar is stocked w/awesome salads and pastas. I recommend you eat something very light if you plan to have dinner here. heck or don't eat at all until you get here! The drinks are awesome and the service is really good too. They would get another 5 stars from me.
