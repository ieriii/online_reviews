I'm not sure what a gastropub is but The Gage seems like an Irish pub's rich older sister. Polished enough to enjoy brunch on a Sunday before spending the afternoon looking at art.  The bloody Mary was bloody good and a perfect lazy Sunday accompaniment to my chorizo, spinach, and swiss omelette with a side of Brie potatoes, buttered whole grain toast, and a watermelon slice.  More than I could finish! My friend had the eggs Benedict with a bellini, both of which she enjoyed. Table bread was crusty, rustic, and delightful. Atmosphere was lively, and service was awesome. Food came out very quickly. Would love to go back!
