I'm afraid that I've got to be the dissenting opinion here and say that I did not care for this restaurant or their pizza at all. If you like the type of pizza that they serve here, go to Pizza DOC instead. A couple of friends and I went there over the summer and we didn't have a very good experience which is what I am basing my review on and which is also why I will not go back. The first thing we didn't like was that they don't, or at least at that time, didn't take reservations so we ended up waiting an hour an half for the crappiest table in the joint. We ordered drinks while we were waiting and never got them and every time we asked, we got ignored. Finally, we got our crappy table and it took another half hour for anyone to come over to even ask us if we wanted anything to drink (which we still hadn't received)! Suffice it to say, we were already irritated so when our server came over and treated us like we were interrupting something important that he had been doing,,,,,,it was at that moment that we decided to never go back. And we hadn't even tasted the food yet. Which leads me my last disappointment. I l-o-v-e pizza and I thought perhaps that at least the pizza would cause this restaurant to redeem itself but how disappointed was I when I got a thin, soggy, cold gross.....I don't even want to insult other pizza and give it that name. I know this review seems a little harsh but as I said, it is based on one experience that was bad enough to make me never go back. And I'm a really hard person to piss off when it comes to restaurants and service because I worked as a server for a long time and I know how difficult that job can be.
