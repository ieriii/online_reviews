Awesome place! Awesome Food! I recommend the deep dish. This is all you should order. If you can finish it, you are a champ. The pizza will take some time to bake. I believe we waited 40 minutes for the pizza, but it was well worth the wait. Very neat environment. If you are visiting Chicago for a Chicago Style Pizza this is the place you want to visit. Real Authentic! I can't wait to visit again. Remember to bring your marker to sign your name on something.
