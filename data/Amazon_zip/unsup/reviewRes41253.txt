Tank SERIOUSLY need to update their website - so that cyber-menu-stalking Yelpers will seriously explore this amazing restaurant! Having been to Vietnam and tried the real thing, let's just say that I have a realistically HIGH expectation for my Pho.... so when my friends suggested to hit up Sat brunch Pho in Vietnamese town, I danced & hopped in awe the whole bus ride to Tank! Upon our entrance, the store was uber busy (brunch = 1pm... how is this place so crowded?!?). - Plenty of Asians dining at the restaurant to prove authenticity? Checked. - Ridiculously large menu (i.e. 200+ choices)? Checked. - Tropical beverages pleeease! Mm... fresh chilled coconut (imported from Thailand, at least it's SE Asian) + smoothie + bubble tea... CHECKED!! Alright, so maybe this place will meet my high expectation and I'd finally have a new Pho favorite in Chicago. Looking around, Tank's business just keep flowing and this appears to be the restaurant-of-choice for all the locals, ranging from demanding teenagers to lovey-dovey couples to 3-generational families! [15min after surfing through the menu] Ok, I am SOLD on Tank!! Let's get the Fresh Spring Roll w/ abundant cilantro, sprouts, shrimp & sliced pork, #40 Pho Combo that has every sort of beef, Oooo and the coconut on the side please!!  The spring rolls were refreshing & extra crunchy, served with a side of peanut paste. Now the Pho...... left me speechless. It took me a solid 1hr to finish my bowl, and I loved the rich & tasty broth WITHOUT the hoisin sauce! The beef tendons were chewy/not overly-fatty, beef sliced so thin they literally melt in your mouth, meat balls that's perfectly sized..... aaaaahhh!! I am in Pho heaven!! Will definitely be back for more; Tank adds sunshine to this snowy Chicago winter & brings me back to the bustling streets of Ho Chi Minh city.....
