Good beer, you gotta try the pale ales. Anti-Hero is my choice. I had the burger with pulled pork, it was one of the better burgers i've had in Chicago. I also thought the fries were above average. It's usually pretty crowded so expect to wait awhile for a table but feel free to grab some drinks and bacon fat popcorn while you wait.
