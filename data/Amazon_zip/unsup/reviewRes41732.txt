When I was in high school, a teacher had taken a small group of us to a place I never heard of. He waxed poetically about their methods of preparing steak.  I thank God for this teacher often; if it were not for him, I wouldn't know what steak was. I hated steak, actually, up until this point. It is something I was served on a plate at home, was told was expensive so I should enjoy it, and bite after bite would be deposited into a napkin. Then, I had the privilege of going to Ruth's Chris. The service is incredible, the bone in ribeye is to die for, as are their spicy stuffed mushrooms, the lobster bisque, really, any sides.  If Ruth's Chris steak does not alone set it apart from other steakhouse experiences, the sides should give it the edge. Easily my favorite steakhouse in Chicago and yes I've sampled them all.
