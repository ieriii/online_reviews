I love this place! But beware... certain times of summer it can get PACKED with tourists! The portions are ridiculously HUGE. Any time I go for breakfast, I have enough leftovers for lunch as well. I have become quite a fan of the "bacon quesadilla", which I have to put in quotes because it's really more of a breakfast wrap. It's eggs, bacon, cheese, and I pay extra for black beans in a multigrain wrap. YUM. And again, massive portions make for a nice lunch as well. The strawberry-orange juice is a nice complement. The coffee isn't great... I tend to like Metropolis but it must be how they make it here. It's been weak on occasion. They also don't do espresso drinks, which is a bummer for me. They have one of those latte/cappuccino machines like they have at 7-11 but that is just not acceptable for me. The one thing I DO like when it comes to the coffee? The little bowls on each table filled with a variety of individual cups of flavored creamer! White chocolate mocha and caramel macchiato? That helps the days when the coffee is sub-par.
