Great looking place. Airy and open feeling. Pretty good views of Grant Park. I would say it is a good date place. Menu is is pretty enticing, forward-thinking as well as traditional. It was also a little pricy and average.. However, the cheese board is very impressive. The service is very attentive. Great tourist-location... I probably will not make a trip back here unless I am with out-of-towners and we're hungry and on South Michigan Avenue.
