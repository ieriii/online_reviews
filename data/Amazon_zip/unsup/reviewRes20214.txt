We had a great time at Coast. Nothing better than BYOB sushi!  We got the tuna tartare appetizer and weren't too impressed with it, but the rolls were amazing. We got the white dragon roll (my favorite, soo good), the po boy roll, and the philly. They were all really fresh and definitely delicious. We went on a Friday night without a reservation and only waited about 15 minutes. Our server was great, the food came out quickly, and our water glasses were always full.  We'll definitely be back!
