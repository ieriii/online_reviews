I don't know that I can say anything others haven't. Freaking awesome. I've had practically everything on the menu (or at least it seems that way). Faves: pig's ear, bone marrow, jlt, and pig's tails. Communal tables are fun if you're cool with that kind of thing. Met some fun people and it made for an entertaining evening. I love that Chef is always there and stops by the table. Last time I went he made several suggestions I probably wouldn't have otherwise tried. Go. Eat. The End.
