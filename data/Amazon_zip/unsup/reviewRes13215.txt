Being a vegetarian, when my friend suggested we go to Revolution to have dinner, I was ready to say, "Ok, I'll eat beforehand and just have drinks with you." But then I took a look at the menu online, and I have to say I was impressed at their effort to incorporate meat-free meals that didn't include the term "Boca burger". There's nothing I appreciate more in a dining experience than a restaurant's realization that vegetarians don't always want to settle for taking the steak out of a $15 salad, or eating a side of steamed vegetables. Revolution really put effort into their vegetarian dishes to make them just as desirable as any of the other entrees. Add that to the unique wide selection of beers and you've got one happy Lala, I must say. Laid back atmosphere, patient and friendly wait staff. I'll definitely go back.
