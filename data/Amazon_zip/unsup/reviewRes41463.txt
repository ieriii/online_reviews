Innovative gourmet dinners wthout the obligation to plow for hours through bible-size menus with litanies of choices you'll have forgotten by the end of reading the first page.Food compositions so orginal, you didn't just "just make that at home last Tuesday." Portions just the right size to rise from your chair at 10 pm and walk out into the Saturday night air with a spring in your step- Aesthetic food presentation, but no two pieces of peppers on a plate calling themselves ceviche. Beautiful food without phalanxes of trendy host(esse)s,and other overblown rituals of "fine or trendy dining" spots . You don't have to shout to hear your friend and you don't have to bring a flashlight to find your food. Oh yeah, the food: I have had venison, mediterranean fish, with cous cous lamb shank with pureed root vegetables, pumpkin soup, flank steak, filet mignon ,ahi tuna ...all of best quality raw materials, made memorable through their preparation. Enjoy the personable service, the intimate atmosphere and let the chefs surprise you with a finely tuned program of taste sensations . An experience, not just a meal.
