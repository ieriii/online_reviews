driving by this spot is what made me realize its been too long since ive had pho...first time out here in the midwest. i was sick too, so i really wanted to come by. a friend coincidentally invited me here tonight, and it did me right. pho places are never glamorous, if anything they'll be decently clean. this place looks like the typical pho joint...spring rolls were good (kind of skinny). my all-time pho tai(rare steak/beef) did its thing too. the soup was pretty greasy, but it normally is when its good. usually pho is decent to good, and the determining factor on where to go for me has always been on how clean they are. this place passes, and the pho is good.
