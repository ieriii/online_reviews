This place has lot's of charm and it's very reasonable. I do carryout here but there is some seating as well if you want to dine in. I ALWAYS opt for the falafel sandwich (spicy) because it's the best EVER. I have never had it any better. They have a small salad bar w/ various middle eastern specialties and it's always fresh. Two other stand outs for me are the baklava which is crisp, light and filled with nuts and honey as well as the spinach pie. Keep in mind - cash only peeps.
