I don't know if I have no class or if this place is just bizarre but it was the worst meal that I have ever had. I have never had bruschetta made like that. The smell of it was so bad that I would not even eat it. My friend took a bite and spit it back out. Then we had a ravoli dish. Personally, I think meat and mint should not mix. The service was amazing but the food was just too much for me!
