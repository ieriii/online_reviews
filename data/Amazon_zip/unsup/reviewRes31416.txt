Shockingly disappointing. While it is a steakhouse, I ordered fish (my friends ordered steak.) My salmon arrived charred black ( I asked that it be well-done but not burned.) It was inedible. The other food was quite tasty - the steak, shoe string potatoes, salad, asparagus. However - while we absolutely have no problem paying handsomely for a spectacular meal - close to $300 for four people was utterly not worth it. We had two entrees (we would have had three entrees but the salmon was charred) - four drinks - three side dishes and two salads. Definitely not worth it.
