I remember when Piece first opened back in 2001 and I loved it for the novelty back then. Having gone back this week, I am happy to say I still love it and the quality is still as excellent as ever. Being able to get a pizza without loads of cheese on top in this City is a treasure - having that pizza be fresh and perfectly cooked is a bonus. I love their beer -and I am not a real beer drinker. The Baron Von Tastic 12 oz gets me through a meal and it is always fresh and light. We had 4 beers, chips and salsa and a small pizza all for under $40 - a bargain for the freshness and wonderful flavor! I just wish they would open one closer to the house - I would seriously order weekly.
