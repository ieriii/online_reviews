My girlfriend Chris and I went to Alinea in December. We did the tour and wine pairing. Our Sommelier Justin added some White Burgundy to our wines since it's my favorite. The experience was incredible and I was on an Alinea buzz for days after. The $840 check was worth it and I hope to do it again this spring or summer. My experience at Alinea far exceeded my experience at the French Laundry in California.
