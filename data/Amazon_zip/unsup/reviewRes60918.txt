What a classy place! I went there on a Tuesday night before seeing a show at the House of Blues. It was my first time there and I've been dying to go back. It's a classier place than I usually go and it's easy to get to from the CTA. The menu consists of glasses of wine, bottles, or wine flights. I did a wine flight for about $15.95 and it was well worth it. On Sundays, wine flights are $10, I recommend that! We also had a cheese flight which was really fun to try as well.
