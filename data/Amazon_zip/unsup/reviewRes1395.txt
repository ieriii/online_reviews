Oh, Hot Doug's. I'm always so excited at the prospect of visiting you, yet in the event that I can actually make it there during your limited hours of operation, the gi-normous line always makes me sad.. and a little angry.  But I can't stay mad at you. One bite of your delicious, unique, salty sausages and I'm yours. Until we meet again...
