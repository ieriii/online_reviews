I came into XOCO not having watched any season of Top Chef/Top Chef Masters and have yet to eat at Frontera Grill. XOCO was my first introduction to the famous Rick Bayless and I was pleasantly pleased with the man's dishes. I ordered the Ahodaga torta which was jock full of marinated carnitas, pickled onions and was dipped in a spicy chile sauce that had me chugging down water, but I loved every minute of it. My side order of guacamole and chips was pretty underwhelming, but the "Barcelona" hot chocolate tasted like a was drinking a liquified candy bar, I now know what imported cocoa beans from Spain can do for hot chocolate......it was the best part of my meal. I then finished my stay at XOCO with a churro that I felt was pretty mundane and lacked flavor compared to other churros I've had in my life, maybe "authentic" churros aren't as soft and filled with jelly, well then I guess prefer americanized churros. So basically my trip to XOCO was filled with some ups and downs and considering I paid a little over $20 for that whole meal I normally wouldn't say the food backed up the price. Yet, that torta and hot chocolate really taste like high quality items and if I came back and just ordered those two things, I'd be pretty content with the total money spent on the good food I'd get in return. Must Try: - Tortas either Woodburning Oven or Grilled (especially the Ahodaga if you don't mind spicy) - Hot Chocolate (the "Barcelona" is the best tasting one) Tips: - I didn't run into a line when I went, but I hear the place can get packed during lunch hours with the line heading out the door - Community seating when it gets busy, some people mind it, I don't
