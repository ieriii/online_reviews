So, I'm gonna be a hater because I do not like this place. I have never had a good experience here. The first time we were ignored for 1/2 an hour! We seriously sat around with a glass of water and menus for HALF A FRICKEN HOUR...so we left. The second time the service was erratic...again. And the last and final time I went, they didn't have anything. No cheese, no avocado, no diet pop, are you kidding? I was so over it by then. My date liked his food but said it wasn't anything to write home about. I'd rather go to some of the hole in the wall Columbian restaurants down Lincoln. They are cheaper and so much better. I say skip it altogether.
