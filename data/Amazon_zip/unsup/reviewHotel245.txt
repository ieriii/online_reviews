I want to check back in, and crawl right back into their bed sent from cozy heaven. Best night of sleep I've ever gotten in a hotel. The comforter is just heavy enough, the sheets smooth enough, and the pillows soft enough to sleep for 12 hours straight. (I wake up from anything) Our room was also in a weird corner nook, which may have had something to do with it being wonderfully quiet. Try to book in a _11 room. Unlike the Nashville Indigo, I think the hotel got the design better here. It feels much more peaceful, and the room layouts make more sense. As for the ammenties, the hotel has a gym and spa services. Indigo isn't stingy about towels either, which is a star in itself. I also liked that there were video games, and the tv remote was a Nintendo controller. The staff was nice, but the garage (owned by the city) is run by a real asshat, and it was 30 something a day for the PRIVILEGE, plus they demand you valet. BAH!
