This place looks a little "fancy", not overly so... Just not the dives I'm in love with on Austin. I was a little out of my element at first, but everyone was very friendly. They have fox cider which is awesome, good bloody marys, and what looks like an awesome membership deal. If I lived here I'd definitely sign up.
