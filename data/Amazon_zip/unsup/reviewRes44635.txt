My friend and I ordered calamari for starters then a10-inch pepperoni and sausage-stuffed deep dish cheese pizza at this spot. Both were presented in generous portions! The calamari was delectably crispy while the deep dish had extremely tasty and thick mozzarella. At first, a ten-inch diameter for a pizza seems just enough for two .. but with this chicago deep dish, it is definitely more than enough! There is a 30-min wait for the pizza to be served but with food this good, it is well worth the wait!
