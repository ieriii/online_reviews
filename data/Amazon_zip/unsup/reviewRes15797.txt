I had my engagement party here for 50+ people. We had a private room in the back of the restaurant and everything was perfect. The night went off without a hitch. I arrived about 15 minutes early to make sure everything was all set up. The room looks great and I was promptly great by Javier who was taking care of the party. Unfortunately, I had the flu for my own party. The servers took note of that and made sure I also had water. However, all of our other guests could not stop raving and the mojitos, sangria, and passed snacks. Our guests barely made it into the room before they were welcomed by a staff member with a drink. The night was a huge success!
