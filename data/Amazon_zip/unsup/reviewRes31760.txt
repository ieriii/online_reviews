I seriously love the Chicago Diner. I've been there a ton of times, and I've only been disappointed in my food once (the pork tacos that are currently on the menu: They were sweet. Plus, onions were included, but not listed on the menu. And I mean...a lot of onions. Ha!) Anyway, they have the best vegan cheesecake I've ever had. The raw cheesecake tends to be too sweet for me, but the regular is perfect. I also love the chicken fried steak. So good.
