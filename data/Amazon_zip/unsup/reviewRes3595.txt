Great wings. They are huge, meaning they come from an adult chicken with full grown wings, so 2-3 will make a meal. Tangy, crispy and chickeny. Good stuff. Also, I thought the people working there were very friendly and honest about the menu. He asked if we have been here before and explained how it worked and what he recommended getting without being overly aggressive or in your face. Thanks for that! Will be back.
