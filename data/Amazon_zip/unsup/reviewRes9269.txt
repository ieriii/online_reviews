Lovely and charming... definitely made it onto my short list! Da J. and I shared an intimate table on the second floor patio. It was a gorgeous Chicago spring evening (rarity!), and the ambiance at Le Colonial did a fantastic job of taking us away from the hustle bustle of the city... felt like an instant vacation (as cheesy as it sounds, it's true.) Especially when the sun began to set and our server brought out the candles. That plus the white tablecloths and palm trees... very romantical. I strongly recommend requesting to sit upstairs--way better than downstairs, I promise.  My lovely dining companion suggested that we share several appetizers for our meal, and it turned out to be a really fun way of surveying all the different flavors that Le Colonial has to offer. Standouts: monkfish and tuna tartare. But honestly, everything we tried was delicious. The service was impeccable, from the Maitre'D to our waitress to the busboy who would awkwardly strain his neck to see if our water glasses needed filling (we sat in the corner).. everything was wonderful and I can't wait to go back!
