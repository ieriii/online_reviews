***4.5 stars*** of the places i dined on my chicago trip, this was probably my favourite. i owe this to my hosts, who have lived in chicago several years and are certified foodies (at least, in my opinion). what we ordered: 1. sesame bread - complimentary with our meal. bread was crusted with sesame, just regular white bread on the inside which was average, dense and soft, but served room temp (not warmed up). 2. saganaki cheese - i missed the highlight of this dish since i was using the loo, but was told that our waiter brought this out, and set it on fire so that we could watch the cheese go up in flames. however, the finished product tasted great, maybe slightly salty, but i really enjoyed the cheese, especially with the sesame bread. 3. catch of the day:sea bass - this was filet and de-boned for me (upon request). the portion was big and very good, with good juices and herbs on the fish. it was slightly dry for my taste. 4. mixed veggies - side dish to compliment my entree. i loved this mix of veggies, which were sauteed/marinaded in tomato sauce and olive oil. 5. octopus - we saw the octopus sitting on a bed of ice in the main foyer, so of course, when we saw it on the menu, we figured this had to be good. we were not disappointed with this one, and the oils and herbs that complemented this dish were delicious (i even dipped some of the sesame bread in the oil). we thoroughly enjoyed our time here, as the food was solid and the service excellent. i also enjoyed the authentic decor that was very prominent throughout the restaurant. it was almost like i was back in athens.
