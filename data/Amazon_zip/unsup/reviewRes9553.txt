One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! An amazing decor that brings you to an exotic and romantic atmosphere. Very intimate setting. The food is delicious - a fusion of french and vietnamese cuisine. I haven't had a bad experience yet here!!! All the dishes are fantastic representation of vietnamese dishes - a little on the pricey side though but well worth it!
