I went to the opening of Big Jones a few months ago and wanted to visit it again before I reviewed. Although the food was good the first time, the poor service made the meal not so pleasant. After being seated after waiting 20 mins for a table despite plenty of open tables in view, the drinks took another 10 mins to arrive. Then throughout the dinner we were given food we didn't order but our neighbours did. We chalked the whole experience up to the restaurant having teething problems and promised to come back as the food was pretty tasty. Today my boyfriend and I went back for brunch and had a great time. Seating was very prompt and polite. Our waiter DID forget to bring us our menus, but that was the only bad bit of service we received. I got a passionfruit sweet tea which was delicious - not too sweet but with a definite passionfruit flavor - and the Eggs New Orleans. The eggs with lump crab cake were sooo good. Lots of crab and all very well seasoned. My boyfriend got a red tea which came with free refills of hot water and the Eggs Benedict. He said the dish was only lukewarm but decieded not to ask for it to be reheated cause we knew service might take a while, plus it still tasted good. The meal also came with a plate of mini beignets at the start and a small plate of fruit at the end.   Overall, we were very pleased with the meal today and would definitely recommend it to our friends. Yes, the food is a little pricey, but it makes up for it with tastiness. Also, the service has noticeably improved since they first opened, so don't let the earlier reviews of poor service put you off.
