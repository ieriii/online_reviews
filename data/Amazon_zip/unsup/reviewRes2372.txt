MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmm duck fat fries. My boyfriend and I went there on a Friday at prime-time lunch time, while it was raining..you know what that means..I waited outside in the rain, sweet! Well, luckily, the rain must have deterred some people, because we only waited about 30 minutes. While we got 3 hot dogs, 2 of the specials and the game of the day, and I really truly only fully enjoyed ONE of the 3, the experience in itself was worth 5 stars. the duck fat fries were amazing! i am DEFINITELY going back.
