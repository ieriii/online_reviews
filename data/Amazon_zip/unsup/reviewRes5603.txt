This food was much better than we expected. The atmosphere- not so much. It was very crowded and the music was way too loud. I think we were under a speaker. Most of the other patrons looked to be from the suburbs- 45+ age wise. The food was very good. It was in a similar vein to avec, but more down played for a broader mass appeal. The menu is very large. We look forward to going back to try more dishes. I recall that the fried sardines were terrific! Never had them before and would definitely try them again. The service was slow at first, but very attentive after ordering. It's good to have another place in that area to go to after shopping at Nordstroms.
