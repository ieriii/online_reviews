My second time around here was very similar to the first in terms of food quality. However, I was really annoyed by the service. About 30 minutes into the meal with a long line developing, the servers rudely came to our table 4 times and asked if we were done. Clearly, there was food on the table and we were still eating so we were not. Also, when ordering the Peking Duck, they never offered the option of making noodles. They defaulted to the rice. By the time when we tried to get them to make noodles, they said it was too late. They ought to ask up front if you want the rice or the noodles. Aside from that, it was a decent experience.
