I think the best description for this place was what my friend called it: Chucky Cheese for adults. The place was jam packed full of ex and future rush week pledge members, and other rude trendy idiots! The service was not bad but he kept forgetting we ordered a pizza and tried to get us to order three times (I think this speaks to how busy the place was). I might try to go back during the week when it is not so busy but I hate eating at places that are more known as a Walt Disney World themed tourist attraction (Owner the guitarist for Cheap Trick..or so I am told) than for their cuisine.  What really got me wound up is that I ordered a Martini with Kettle one and it cost $11 dollars...lol what a joke. The pizza was good but $40 for a large thin crust with three toppings is silly.
