One word- OVERRATED. Semiwarm bland pork shank for about $20. No thanks. Want to love you Longman, you are right across the street, but you are just okay. And I won't be eating your chef's concoctions again. I'll stick with your sister restaurant Bite, and pay half as much, for a delicious BYOB meal.
