Veggie burger and sweet potato fries are two of my favorite items. Vegan milkshakes are also delicious. This place can be a little loud when full, but it's not unbearable. Waitstaff is always friendly, but seem hesitant to make suggestions. Only complaint is that they rush you a bit when busy. Makes sense that they want to turn tables, but putting down an appetizer and then my meal 3-4 minutes apart is a bit extreme. I really like this place and will continue to return.
