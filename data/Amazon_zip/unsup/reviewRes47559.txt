First things first, take advantage of their complimentary shuttle service! I'm not sure how far out they go, but if you're in the city, it shouldn't be a problem. Table not quite ready yet? No worries, you can sip on a drink in the nice lounge while you wait...maybe even catch some of the Bulls or Hawks game. Beer drinkers, try the Left Hand, milk stout...excellent. The Chef's Counter. You an inquire for seating at the Chef's Counter when you make your reservation. The really good thing about it is you can pretty much tell the chef what you want and he'll get someone to pull it off the pit and bring it to you RIGHT AWAY. The really bad thing about it, in my opinion, the pit is right there! So it might get hot, especially after a few drinks haha. I'd rather be comfortable while I eat so probably no more Chef's Counter for me. I wasn't too impressed with the food at the "Harvest Table" but I didn't really go there for the little fillers as I'd call them. The place is much like other Brazilian steakhouses, but ZED has a much larger selection of meats (& other "meats"). You definitely, MUST MUST MUST had some bottom sirloin (they marinate it for 48 hrs!!!), pork belly & catfish (I was surprised by the catfish). As a matter of fact, if/when I return here, I'll probably take the Chef's advice and just tell them to bring me out a plate of each! hahaha! The other options are all good and if it's your first time here, you might as well try them out I supposed but the three I listed are the best in my opinion. Just remember, pace yourself! Against my suggestion, we had the creme brulee for dessert but it was good. The setting was a nice, really calm, music not too loud. The service was pretty good as well. They're always ready to answer your questions or make suggestions. It did kind of suck that the bathrooms were on the second floor though (unless we didn't know about ones on the first) because it's hard to climb stairs when you're stuffed! haha!
