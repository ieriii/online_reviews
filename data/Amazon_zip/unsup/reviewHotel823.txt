I've stayed at the Silversmith twice and am planning on a third stay this autumn. The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful each time I entered the hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are large and clean. Each time I've reserved a room, I've requested to be placed away from the El train and have been accommodated.They upgraded their internet service sometime between my stays there in 2010 and 2011, and I had no trouble at all with the wi-fi. The hotel is in a GREAT location for visiting downtown Chicago. CTA trains that circle the Loop have a stop right at the intersection where the hotel is located. Millenium Park is just down the block, and the Magnificent Mile is approximately ten blocks away. There is plenty to do and plenty of places to eat within walking distance of the hotel, and for venturing further out, trains and cabs are easily accessible. I've stayed, and plan to stay, at the Silversmith during the Chicago Marathon. I'm sure the price is higher during this weekend, but when compared to other hotels in the area, even those officially partnered with the Marathon, the Silversmith was the best price and in a better location than most. The only reason I didn't give five stars, and I'm sure this doesn't matter to most, is that I feel they need to upgrade their TV's. I know, it's a minor thing, but if you're looking to keep the kids entertained or, like me, your looking to spend time in the room preparing for or recovering from a REALLY long run, the TV thing is important. I highly recommend the Silversmith, and I plan to continue staying there each time I visit Chicago.
