Hit up Davanti Enoteca with friends, family, coworkers and people who can toss back bottles of vino until their Italian fluency surpasses even that of the natives. With the average bottle price in the mid to upper $20s, this makes wining and dining a very attractive option. Va bene. Like it's sibling, DiSotto Enoteca, Davanti's cicchetti style menu has some options which you wouldn't particularily find at most Italian Eateries. Look deeper than just their index of Salumi & Cheeses and move on to the Antipasti. White Anchovies paired with marinated celery, pecorino sardo and leccini olives completes a perfectly light and salty bite of the mediterranean. Wash it down with a refreshing glass of Muller-Thurgau, sit back, smile and nod. Davanti also offer's Italian style pizzas similar to those found at the Francesca's establishments. The pastas, like the Uovo in Ravioli, are thoughtfully portioned to allow your gut to handle the 9 other appealing sections of the menu. For those who are not into sharing, first of all shame on you, but yes, there is a section of plated entrees consisting of seafood, chicken, steak and a burger.
