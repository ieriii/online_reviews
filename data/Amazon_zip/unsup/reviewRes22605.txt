Went to the dawg last weekend for the first time since I was a kid and it is just as good as I remember it... Because I live in the west loop, I rarely get a chance to get up there (have a few friends that live in the neighborhood), but from now on I always plan on stopping. Be warned that the lot gets absolutely jammed if you are eating around lunch time on a weekend but the superdawg and fries are unreal. If you are in the neighborhood, definitely stop. This place is even worth going out of your way on occassion though for sure.
