Perfection. Seriously. I recommend getting there early (like, as close to 9am as possible) and in as small a group as possible. My friend and I showed up there around 10am on a Sunday, and we were told the wait could be up to 40 minutes but to check back in 20, and when we checked back, we were seated! Of course, the downside of getting there early is that many of the cute little shops and boutiques around the area are closed (a lot don't open until 11am or even noon). We ordered the vegetarian croissant sandwich and the brown sugar coated french toast with a vanilla sauce and blueberries. I wanted to order everything but splitting these two were immensely satisfying -- a little bit of sweet & salty. I can't wait to go back!
