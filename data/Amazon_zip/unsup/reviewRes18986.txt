This has to be one of my favorite Chicago restaurants. I love the concept of ordering at the counter, and then being seated. You get all the experience of a "sit-down" meal without the high prices. I'm always torn because everything looks so good on the menu, but the Cubana sandwich is so hard NOT to order. It's amazing! I like going with other people so I can still order the Cubana but try others' tortas. This last visit I also had the vanilla soft serve with bacon-struesel topping. It was AMAZING!
