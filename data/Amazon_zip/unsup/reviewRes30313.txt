Chicago Diner is one of those places I'm always trying to get my friends to go to. It's got healthy, whole food options (one of the few places in Chicago with quinoa on the menu), but it also has veg junk food like fake seitan "meats" and soy milkshakes. I love the outside patio in the summer months. They are good about accommodating food allergies (have a gluten free menu, offer the option of dairy or soy cheese for almost all dishes) and in the past year or so have started offering a couple of raw entrees and desserts, including a very good raw cheesecake. Last night I made the mistake of over-snacking beforehand so I came already full (lamentably...since Chicago Diner is one of a handful of places in Chicago I feel like I can really chow down) but thought the French Onion Soup sounded divine. Unfortunately they were out of it, and all soups in fact. :^(. So, I decided to just stick with juice, of the fresh squeezed, vegetable variety. It was good but *ludicrously* expensive ($9.00 for a 12 ounce green juice, with carrot swapped out for broccoli and ginger added.) I was disappointed that I couldn't taste the ginger so I brought it back up front to get some more added. The juice gal pleasantly accommodated this but I saw that she poured in some pre-juiced ginger that must either be diluted or not at peak freshness because even with the additional shot I couldn't taste it. Considering how costly the juices are, I really think they should juice the ginger fresh each time.  (SIDENOTE: Chicago really needs some vegetable juice bars!). Our server was friendly and overall I had a fun time. Really last night was more of a 3-star experience but I've been happy at Chicago Diner enough that I feel it deserves 4.
