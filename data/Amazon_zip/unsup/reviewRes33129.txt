It's cheap. That's the only plus. The falafel is old and always cold. The guys who chop it and stuff the sandwiches always do it in under 5 seconds - as if they're in a huge rush - even if there's no line. The "tahini" is tasteless and flavorless. Don't bother unless you're a senior citizen and taste doesn't matter to you.
