Brunch at Yolk? After three visits, I'm long overdue for a review... but since it's Friday, I'll keep it shorter than my usual details. Food Choices - Standard breakfast fare. The strawberry orange juice stands out as something different, and it's freshly made/squeezed/juiced for extra deliciousness. Food Quality - Excellent. Eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, french toast... it's all done to perfection. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Price Point - For a uber-trendy hip breakfast place to be, this price is respectable. You're not getting any great deals by any means, but it's acceptable. Food Quantity - Let me tell you, I always leave here stuffed. I tend to be an omelette eater (and they are big) followed with the side of pancakes it comes with (which are light and fluffy) and then I roll over, pay the check, and roll to my car.  Verdict: Excellent brunch place with standard American style choices with a few innovative twists thrown in (banana bread french toast with peanut butter? Talk about dessert for breakfast). The only drawback? There's always a massive line to wait to get in... alas, this is what happens when the quality is good and the place becomes uber-hip-trendy.
