Every time I come here I look around and try to picture young rebellious flappers tipsy on illegal liquor and the naughty gents chasing them around. I read that the name Green Mill was inspired from the Moulin Rouge in Paris. I guess Moulin means mill and Rouge means red -- however the "cleaner" Chicagoans didn't want to call it the Red Mill, because it would make people think of the "red light" district, so they called it the Green Mill instead. It's great to treat friends from out of town to this place once owned by Al Capone's boys. Jazz is great. Crowd, diverse and relaxed. Most of the decor is original from the 30's, except for a disco-ball-like, mirrored support beam behind the bar, that I was told was probably installed in the early 50's. I emphatically recommend the Green Mill.
