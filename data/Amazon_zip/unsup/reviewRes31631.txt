This is my third visit here and once again Nana aims to please. Three of us enjoyed tons of breakfast foods including fresh juice, latte, waffles, tofu scramble, and ricotta pancakes. Side biscuits and toast with homemade jam were great. Waffle was a bit overbaked and crunchy but everything else was excellent. Have to say however, that this is a pricey breakfast spot but worth the trip once in a while.
