Hot Doug's is the shiz. He makes a superior corn dog. I know, I know- corn dogs are awesome, but they're pretty uniformally awesome in that they are a hot dog and deep fried and on a stick. But somehow, I don't know how, he makes a corn dog that puts all others to shame. Super clean, super awesome, and super friendly and polite waitstaff.
