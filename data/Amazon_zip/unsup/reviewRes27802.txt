After wanting to come to GE since it opened last year, and being a fan of the top chef series, I recently saw Graham Elliot (the man) walking down the street. The GE spotting reminded me to make reservations. And in case you are curious, no, I did not say anything to him or embarass myself. It is weird how these cooking shows have made chefs into psuedo celebrities. So I came here with a friend on an early Friday evening. The atmosphere is really relaxed and the bar was vibrant. Started off with some cocktails; the tainted love and the london calling. Both were really good, not overly sweet, well balanced without being too boozy. Tried the tuna appetizer, salmon and scallops entrees, and strawberry shortcake dessert. Delicous! The scallops just melt in your mouth, and they were served with a pork hash. The shortcake dessert was quite tasty, albeit tiny. Don't plan on sharing dessert if you want more than a mouthful. Overall, graham elliot is a fantastic experience. Not someplace I'd come on a regular basis, but once in a while. Would definitely come back and sit at the bar for drinks. There is some good mixing going on over at the bar.
