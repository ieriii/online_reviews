Service: Super friendly Neighborhood/Scene: Love me some Boystown/Lakeview Food: Blerg I don't remember the exact name of what I ordered, but what came out was a giant plate of flavorless mush and my date's dinner didn't look or taste much better. I know this place is a neighborhood favorite but I don't get it.
