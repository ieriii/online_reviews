After returning from a recent business trip to Chicago, I've had a couple of days to reflect on "The Art of Pizza". While I am disappointed I did not make time for Chicago's art museums, I can't say I did not experience true art. Even though I never crave pizza, I thought I should partake of Chicago's own deep dish treasure. The Art of Pizza's deep dish special (Sausage, Onion, Mushroom, and green pepper) melted in my mouth and was pure pleasure. It was worth the cab ride for this slice of art.
