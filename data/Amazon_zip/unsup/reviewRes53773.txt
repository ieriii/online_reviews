Whenever I travel to Chicago, the Green Mill is one of my usual stops. There is a reason this place is legendary: a steady calendar of some of the very best jazz (of all different styles) that you are likely to find anywhere. And at reasonable prices, to boot, when compared to NY or DC.If you're there on a Wednesday night and jazz singer Kurt Elling is in town, you're in for a rare treat; this is his regular gig whenever he is back home. You'll be able to hear this multiple-award-winning jazz vocalist pretty up close and personal, for a fraction of what it would cost to catch him at venues in other cities, and in a setting where it's possible to chat with him between sets (and he's a charming, approachable guy).Whomever you catch there, be prepared to enjoy music among serious jazz afficianados, but also be prepared to be quiet. Talking during the performance is (blissfully) banned, and the staff usually enforces the ban firmly (and sometimes politely).It's worth it to get there early, because the place gets crowded quickly.
