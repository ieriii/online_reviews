If you are truly a fan of sushi steer clear of this place! Virtually all the rolls contain something fried or are drenched in mayonnaise-y sauces. Even the ginger dressing is made from mayo - hello calories! Sushi is supposed to be light and fresh fish - not grease and fat. Ick. Even the miso soup is off - there is tofu and seaweed there but the broth tastes like straight up sodium. No true flavor.The service was good... but the lacking quality of the food leaves me NEVER wanting to go back. There are too many other better places in the city that offer real sushi and PARKING.
