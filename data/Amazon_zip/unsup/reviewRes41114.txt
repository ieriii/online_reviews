I've been frequenting Pho Xe Tang (Tank Noodle) about once a week since I moved to Chicago two years ago. It's basically my home cooked meal away from home.  The menu is ridiculously large, but most things you'll find are really good. Everything is well priced, so each time you go, try something new. I suggest trying, just to name a few key goodies: - egg rolls - spring rolls - pho - bo nuong vi (seasoned beef that you roll in rice paper) - mi xau dong (crispy egg noodle stir fry) Pho Xe Tang is always packed with Vietnamese people who go there for a break from cooking at home...so you know it has to be great food. Avoid Saturday and Sunday lunches. Weekends are so busy, you're better off going in the afternoon or on a weekday evening. Be careful, before you make the trek to Argyle, know that Pho Xe Tang is closed on Wednesdays. Go to Tank for the authentic food. The decor is minimal and you sometimes sit next to strangers. Service is fast, but the staff is not the most conversational. They are there just to deliver your order quickly, and that they do! Also, don't be alarm if your group's orders arrives at different times. They bring the food out as soon as it's ready. So, if you don't want your entree coming out as fast as your app, be sure to put the app order in first and wait a few minutes before ordering your main course.
