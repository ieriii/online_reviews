I thought this place lived up to the hype. It was a good "Chicago dog" experience for this tourist and if I were local, I'd go here for a decent hot dog every now and then.  It was a total drive in experience. The food was fast, fried, and pretty delicious. The hot dog was everything I had hoped a Chicago dog would be. Soft bun, check! Neon green relish, check! Sport peppers, check! Celery salt, check! Onions, check! Mustard, check! The fries were extra crispy and seasoned well. The pickled tomato was an unexpected surprise! It's all boxed up for your car dining experience. P.S. As far as the "no ketchup on your hot dog" rule... They give you a bottle of ketchup with your fry order. From the security of your car, they can't tell you what to do. Just sayin...
