I live in the Bay Area and decided to send a long-distance cake gift. I did a little research and then called Alliance and told them I wanted a very special cake delivered for a very special record label (local in the area) - as they were about to put out one of our records. The clerk was familiar with the name and was super friendly. He said he knew just the cake and had the chef bake up this chocolate wonder and delivered it by afternoon of the next day. I got so many letters telling me how delicious it was that I almost tasted it in my own mouth. Thank you Alliance for your delicious cakes and friendly staff.
