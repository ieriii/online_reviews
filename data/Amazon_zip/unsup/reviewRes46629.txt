The service here is ridiculously rude. The host was a complete jerk, and even though the place was empty, they tried to stuff 5 chairs at the end of our large party's table (instead of adding another table to it). When we asked to add another 2-person table to the end of ours, they had to clear it by the owner, who simply removed all the chairs, didn't add a table, and walked away! Hahaha.  Did I mention the place was empty?!  Oh, and the brunch was way overpriced. Don't waste your time or money here unless you feel like being offended by rude staff and throwing money away.
