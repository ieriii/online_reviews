Vegetarian haven. Having only had veggie stuff here, I can say that my personal experiences with the eating there have been fantastic, but I have to slight the place a star because a date once had some fish rice combination that looked like someone had poured a can of tuna into some mexican (or rather, costa rican) rice. Fried yuca with garlic oil is not quite health food but wow is it good. Mamey/oatmeal shake, now available with soy milk, is worth the price of admission alone. The palmito salad is something special. Potato tacos seem to be everyone's favorite. Except mine. Yummy with hot sauce.  Fantastic place all in all, and one I visit often.
