As a cheapskate I love finding a good value. And that is what Tank Noodle is, one hell of a good deal. For between $7-10 you will get a bunch of food that tastes good. For that kind of money the quality is lacking in some respects, but it's a bowl full of spicy, salty treats so I don't really care what it is. Though I've traveled around the menu at Tank Noodle I always find myself drawn to one dish - the chicken curry noodle soup. When that bowl of glowing, yellow goodness is placed in front of me I almost pass out. This is a must have dish if you are congested, as it will quickly clear your head, and warm you from the inside. It's a busy place, but don't let that deter you. There is always a good number of Chicago's Vietnamese community in the restaurant, and that usually means its pretty good. So, if you can get over the crowds and noise then be prepared for one of the cheapest thrills on the northside.
