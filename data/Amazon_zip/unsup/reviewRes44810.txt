On a Black Friday, the wait time for a restaurant by Magnificent Mile is NOT PRETTY. Just a fair warning. Another warning, is that your Giordano's deep dish pizza will take nearly 60 minutes to cook. You may want to grab a beer on tap while you're waiting. ...A secret to those willing to wait - delicious is an understatement when it comes to Giordano's pizza. The atmosphere is classic, and very italian, which I enjoyed while waiting for my yummy food. You would think that a good pizza restaurant in Chicago would have prices through the ceiling, but the food was actually quite affordable! Last tip I have to offer... if you have a group of less than 5 hungry faces, DO NOT ORDER A LARGE PIZZA! After ordering some salad and calamari, we couldn't finish more than half of the pizza and the left overs were quite heavy. :)
