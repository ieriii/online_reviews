We had a wonderful dining experience at GE's place on the 26th of dec. The reception we received from our host and server was very warm but not overbearing. We went all in and did the full tasting menu and pairing menu. Every course was perfect - our server Jeff made sure we were never out while we waited for the next course. We never looked at our watch thinking this is taking too long as we did when we dined at Alinea. We will definitely be back - which we did not say the same after our Alinea experience - considered that a one time type of experience.
