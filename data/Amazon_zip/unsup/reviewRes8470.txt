A truly unique and wonderfully delicious dining experience. Don't pass on the salad bar; but too, don't make a chef's salad. Dress your plate with little nibbles of what might normally be salad toppers and put a little dressing on the side. When you get back to the table the real adventure begins and you'll forget all about that behemoth salad you just made.
