Yes. This place is a winner. I went here with a group of 5 for a low-key birthday party dinner and the family-style servings were perfect for us. The selection of food is fantastic, and the service was wonderful. (Thanks, Antonio! He hooked us up with a birthday candle in our dessert waffle, which I recommend along with the apple & rhubarb crumble.) We all agreed that we need to come back here for future special occasions. It's definitely better to come here with a group so you can try a little of everything on the menu, and partake in the communal atmosphere. So happy to have found this place!!
