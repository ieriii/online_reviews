First off, let me say that I've been here 8 times and each time was great!this weekend my husband and I decided to stay a nice quiet evening at home but one problem, we were HUNGRY!so after a quick phone call, it only takes about 2-3 minutes to order. We tried their special lobster for the weekend. It came promptly on time within the 45 minutes the person on the phone told us. I'm soo glad I tipped the driver well, because that lobster so to die for!!!!!it was because of this outstanding delivery that made me want to write a review. The lobster meat was so tender, the sauces were just right, not too salt, sweet, spicy or sour. BUT just right. I also ordered their new fish sandwich, also very delicious. To top this seafood combination off we ordered the spicy shrimp sate dish. All very good, as usual they gave us oranges, rice cookies and everything we needed for the perfect weekend dinner.
