This is my favorite day-to-day restaurant in Chicago. Sure, there are a couple uber-expensive places I like better on special occasions, but I get takeout from Indie about three times a week and often take friends or dates to eat here, hence day-to-day. I like the atmosphere (great downtempo chillout music, constantly pulling out my phone to identify songs and download them for myself), and there's so much variety in the food -- even though I usually do get one of two or three things! The only bad thing about the place is it can get very crowded and noisy during peak hours -- you almost have to come on off hours (i.e., not during regular dinner time) if you want to carry on a conversation. Love that these guys are savvy enough to have a Facebook page, though. They take credit cards under $10 unlike a lot of other affordable Thai places, too. The food is really cheap (except the sushi, which is mid-range as far as sushi restaurant prices go) but it's good and there are lots of healthy and vegetarian options. The decor and atmosphere are much classier and more hip than you expect from a cheap Thai place though.
