Don't mind the three-star review; this is a good place. If your in the mood for some Opa! with your olive oil, this is good digs. The saganaki is great, so is the moussaka. Server's are typically prompt and generous. Plus it's got free valet in a place that's not otherwise easy to find parking in. Good stuff out of the way ... I'm just not blown away. The prices can be overly steep, at least in terms of portion and quality of dish. And more often then not, I left a little disappointed. So, basically, I have no solid justification for giving GI three stars -- but i just can't give them four.
