Valet parking $6?!?!? love it.... Really cute little place, made us wait 20 minutes for our reservation though. Also, in the bar/dinning area it is very crowded -- actually the whole place was crowded, a lot of server butt to customer face time. Our server was pretty good, strong service, but not too strong on her food and wine knowledge. The bussers and runner were really good though. The food did remind me of the year I lived in Italy.... much more Italian than the american-italian food some many of us get used to eat. Unfortunately nothing really stood out. The grilled calamari was good, but over priced. We had a couple of the pastas -- good but not great. I had the short rib and it was decent, but ended up being disappointing because it had been so highly recommended. I'm looking forward to going back this summer when the outside back patio is open... I keep thinking it would be the perfect late afternoon long lunch. It's a great looking spot.... some meat, cheese, light bits and a couple bottles of wine..... I could easily pretend to be back in Italy here!
