When the weather was bad, my girlfriend and I sought shelter (and a place to eat) in the Andersonville area. The setting is very nice, and the dimly set lighting creates a very nice ambiance. The food was not only good, but it was also very hearty (I'm a big boy, and it filled me up very nicely). Overall, the service was great and the price was reasonable.
