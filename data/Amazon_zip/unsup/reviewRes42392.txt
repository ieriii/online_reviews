This restaurant is ALWAYS packed. And honestly, I don't think it's because the food is amazing (Having lived in Vietnam and visited California's Vietnamese enclaves, I'd say Tank is above average for the Midwest). The restaurant is in a prime location so commuters waiting at the light and pedestrians see the restaurant and think they MUST go in. The pho xe tank or pho xe lua - tank and train respectively - are classics. Only complaint is that their ducks need to be meatier.
