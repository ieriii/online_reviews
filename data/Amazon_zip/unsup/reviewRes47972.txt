Publican exceeded my expectations. I've been hesitating to dine here for a while since I'm not a huge fan of communal dining. My experience was definitely bolstered by the fact that we (group of 3) were seated at one of the booth-style tables along the wall. Our fantastic server, Rebekah, guided us through the menu and helped us make selections that hit all the right notes. This place is definitely known for their meat and they do it well. We thoroughly enjoyed the sucking pig, duck confit, and pork rillette. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of other items too, such as the chef's selection of oysters and desserts. Though we usually order wine when we eat out, we thoroughly enjoyed the beer selection and our server made excellent choices in recommending the pairings. Would definitely recommend!
