Love, love, love Wilde! The atmosphere is fun and the food is great! They have a lot of space and you are sitting on top of the table next to you. Try the brunch and you wont be disappointed! The French Toast may be the best I have ever had. They will even SPLIT CHECKS -- Yay! The burgers are great too! All around good place to eat!
