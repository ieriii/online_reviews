hot mama, i had brunch at longman & eagle a while back, and it was kick-my-pants off delicious! chicken and waffles. prawns and grits. southern comfort food, served with some vintage attitude.  a few small concerns: shrimp and grits were lukewarm. no problem, still delicious. next time, i expect to be back in the dead of winter, when i will need my food to be piping hot in order to defrost. second, perhaps a bit more attention to detail? the restaurant was busy, and my server let me know it. i had to request a coffee refill. we tracked the waiter down to order. i hid my prawn heads in my napkin (after sucking them clean) instead of having a designated place to put them.  minor details, but these are the types of things that differentiates food from an experience. i saw peeks of that definitive charm -- the namesake letter motif in the bathroom, for one. no questions, i'm definitely going to be back for the food, L&E -- but next time, i'm also looking to be a bit dazzled by the atmosphere, by the charm. i'm hopeful.
