Whoa, Babies everywhere at an Indian Restaurant? I didn't expect that. I guess it's the lunch buffet. Anyway, it was actually relatively quiet considering there were about three sets of babies, but that hasn't been my experience in most cases. I went for Lunch/Brunch and ordered the buffet. It had several dishes such as Salmon, Potatoes, and Chicken covered in a variety of sauces. Moreover, they even had a good sized desert buffet. The menu is huge and they seem to have several options (like the buffet) that are geared toward the more the casual Indian food connoisseur (with less spicy sauces). This is a great place to introduce someone to Indian food, as the food is tasty without being overwhelming. Service was good, but we did order a buffet, so there wasn't much to go on. Dishes aren't cheap, the buffet was $15 a person and the menu items were just under $20, but you can't really complain about $15 for all you can eat with a selection that size. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and will probably go back for the buffet at some point.
