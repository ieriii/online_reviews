We've been to Pequod's a few times and I am finally writing a review. This is Chicago pizza! Be prepared to wait, however, because everyone knows about this place. I recommend making a reservation. You will still wait, but at least there is hope! The pizza itself is a terrific deep-dish that comes out hot from the oven. The place is beyond packed, but they have a secret upstairs that I just found out about. Give it a try for great Chicago pizza!
