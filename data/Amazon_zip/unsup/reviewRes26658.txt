Unfortunately, I was expecting a superb birthday dinner. First, the bartender overpoured my husband's beer - okay, we're all human. Second, when the host carried our drinks from the bar to our table....some of the same overpoured beer was spilled on my lap. This was two strikes within the first 15minutes. We got the tasting menu and we looked past the beer issues to hopefully enjoy dinner - our first course was described at our table......"enjoy".....well, we have no utensils! After dining at a top restaurant in the City, I expect the staff and service to uphold to the price and atmosphere. I felt as though we received "D" list staff on our Wednesday night. Not to mention, we had close to no clue as to what we were eating since the servers had VERY heavy hispanic accents (we were tired of asking them to repeat it). Upon receiving our check, we were asked if we needed a cab called.......we responded yes, yet still had to walk 4 blocks to retrieve our own. Sadly, overall I wouldn't recommend.
