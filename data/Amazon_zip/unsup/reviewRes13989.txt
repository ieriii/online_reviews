Revolution Brewing has generated a lot of buzz, and I had the chance to try it out last night. I arrived at 5:30 and sat at the bar until my date arrived. The interior is impressive, lots of wood, a huge bar in the center of the restaurant, painted tin ceiling, and the brewery is in full view from the dining room. I ordered the Bottom Up Belgian Wit. It was good, but lacked something I can't describe. I was chewing gum before I came in, so Wrigley's Extra may be to blame. We were seated immediately once my date arrived, and ordered more beer (the Cross of Gold for me, the flight for her) and the hard cider and blue cheese mussels. The Cross of Gold was a tasty and clean, slightly hoppy ale. The cider and blue cheese mussels arrived and were... absolutely the best mussels I've ever tasted. A more perfect combination of flavors I cannot imagine... the mussels were plump and plentiful, and cider, blue cheese, leeks, and julienned Fuji apples formed the broth. I ordered the mushroom and goat cheese pizza, and I was impressed, again, although it's not difficult to impress me with mushrooms and goat cheese. The crust was thicker than a Neapolitan-style pizza, but so incredibly light, and held its shape well. They must have sauteed the mushrooms in crack. The pizza was just intoxicating. The service was excellent from both the host and our server. If I have any issues, one is the beer did not absolutely wow me. It was solid and tasty, but not overwhelming. I guess I expected a bit more. Also, the acoustics in the restaurant are horrible. Conversing across the table was nearly impossible. This complaint isn't unique to Revolution, but it certainly is disappointing. I don't think restaurants need to be this loud.
