The general rule is to avoid the specials when you eat out at restaurants. That's just a clever way for a chef to unload ingredients that are about to go bad. The rules do not apply at Meli! No holds barred! Anything goes! Yes, their "regular" menu is excellent, but sometimes you'll find some legitimate gems on that little piece of paper found on the inside cover of the menu. Last time I was there: crab and black truffle omelet. And yes, it was as amazing tasting as it sounds. Yeah, it can be a long wait, but it's never that painful and actual service when you get seated is quite snappy. Oh, and one time we saw the new mayor of Chicago come in for coffee! That has to say something about this place (well, him and the hundreds of other reviews here).
