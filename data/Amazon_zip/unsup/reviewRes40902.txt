Ok so yes, I went back AGAIN. Even with its new found popularity, thanks to Check Please!, word of mouth and probably Yelp (ah-hem, someone's ROtD!) I am happy to report that Bonsoiree still delivers amazing cuisine and a wonderful dining experience. They just introduced an end-of-winter menu that offers brand new flavors in their standard five, seven or thirteen course menus. This includes rabbit and gnocchi "shooters", spicy scallops on the half shell, house-cured bacon (with homemade marshmallows!) and more.  It is apparent that the great press has not gone to their heads. The boys in the kitchen were just as humble as ever; still passionate and excited to share their creations with us. Executive Chef/owner Shin Thompson was running the entire front of the house, down to folding napkins for people when they get up-no job it too small- I love it! I guess I'm a regular by now, especially since I am already planning my return visit!
