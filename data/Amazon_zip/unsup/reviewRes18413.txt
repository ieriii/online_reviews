I just can't figure this place out. I must admit, being raised on my mom's first generation southern Italian cooking, I'm very picky when it comes to Italian restaurants. The first time we went a couple years ago, the waiter claimed to be the son of the owner who just so happened to be from the Italian town of my mom and her cousins who were all at dinner with us. He scooped up our menus and decided we were definitely doing family style, to which we graciously obliged. The food was just OK. Large portions. Anything in marinara wasn't bad, but mushroom sauce tasted like reduced campbell's cream of mushroom soup. Now, we just went back over the weekend and asked about the owner or his son. This waiter (who claimed to have been working there for 8 years) said that the restaurant is/always has been owned by a Venezuelan with no children. Not that I really care (except that now I know a Venezuelan is behind the menu and that makes a little more sense), but what's going on with all the waiters having a different story!?  Food was exactly how I remembered it.  Average. I got some chicken dish stuffed with prociutto, served with 3 cheese ravioli and drowning a creamy alfredo-type sauce...not good. Entirely too rich and overdone with the cheese. Picked off my ma's plate, which was baked eggplant...and fantastic. Next time I guess I'll order that. I like the byob. Hate that there's nowhere to stand while waiting, except outside.
