The Best Pan Pizza in Chicago. Its not "Chicago" style - just pan with a really really really crispy crust. I'll take this over any pizza in Chicago when I'm not craving thin crust. Please - Everyone at least try this one. BTW - I've been told the crust gets a little soggy when you "carry out". You owe it to yourself to sit down and eat one of these pies straight from the pan!
