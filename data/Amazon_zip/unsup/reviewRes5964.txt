Had the privilege to visit Davanti over the weekend while I was visiting Chicago. You can tell the place had the right stuff going for it when there was a long wait to be seated and the bar was totally packed with people eagerly awaiting their tables. Once we sat down, we had already perused the menu at the bar (we had a bottle of wine at the bar) so we were ready to order. I entrusted the ordering to my sis and brother in law who were Davanti veterans.  The focaccia di Recco was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. And the Cacio e pepe spaghetti was amazing. Both dishes seemed very simple, but done very well. We also ordered a salami to try... I forgot which ones since I my mouth was stuffed and I was in food heaven. This place is definitely on my radar as a "must go" whenever I make it back to Chicago. My mouth is starting to water just thinking about the food.
