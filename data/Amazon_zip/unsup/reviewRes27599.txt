I love Nuevo Leon. They have a great variety of foods to order. I'm a vegetarian so I don't get to enjoy all that they offer but I love love love their veggie burrito (sans cheese) and their bean and avocado tacos. And the sweet tea...omg, you've never had better. I go there about once a week, I kid you not. I was there on Father's Day and the owner was walking around giving gifts to the Father's. I thought that was pretty rad. The prices are SUPER cheap (at least for veggie options). When my friends and I go we collect all the coins from our couches and cars and split the check usually paying about $7 each. Seriously. Just bring cash cause they don't take cards.
