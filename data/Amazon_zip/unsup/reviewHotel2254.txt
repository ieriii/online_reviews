This was a top contender for our wedding. The ballrooms are beautiful. The packages were definitely on the high end of our budget but they were not too outrageous as far as downtown hotel wedding package rates go... We worked with Chris and thought he was very good - friendly, responsive - a good salesman. The main reason we did not select this hotel for our wedding was that the room rates were too high for the dates we were looking at. At least half of our guests are coming in from out of town so we needed to find room rates that were a bit more affordable. Otherwise - a great spot!
