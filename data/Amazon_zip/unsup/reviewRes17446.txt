Absolutely delicious! My experience was a bit nostalgic since I haven't been to this place since 00' or 01' when it was called "the Drink" and my intentions were to dance my sock off (not literally). The ambiance was pleasant, modern, very bright and colorful, with extremely high ceilings (no way you'll claustrophobic in this place). I order braised short ribs, may I just say , the meat was so soft it fell apart with the softest touch of my fork. The mixture of potatoes, nuts, corn, and what ever other deliciousness they included was amazing and very impressive. I highly recommend this place for a tasty meal or an evening out with a large group (so long as ppl don't mind spending extra on a yummy meal).
