I love the Grand Lux! I take all my friends and family here when they visit. Dont be put off by the really long wait, its worth it. Plus if everyone's over 21, you can wait in the bar upstairs. The detail in the decorations is awsome. If you can, try to sit near a window. Especially in the circle area in the front. The view up and down Michigan is so pretty at night, and impressive to visitors. Use your wait time to figure out what you want, b/c the menu is extensive and everything looks good. I love thier salads. Whatever you order, you probably wont be able to finish (its owned by the Cheesecake Factory people). Drinks are good too.
