Argh... really, it's a 3.5, but I can't bring myself to give it a 4. This place is not exactly what I was expecting... It's more a "Pompei" chain type of experience, only Greek instead of Italian, and the service is better. I had a roasted chicken here that was good, and cheap. But it didn't knock my socks off. With so many other Greek joints to try in the neighborhood I'm not sure I'll be back here soon, but I'd probably at least give it another shot.
