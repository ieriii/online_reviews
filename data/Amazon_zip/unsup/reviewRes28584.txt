Yes, I'm lactose intolerant. And yes, I eat Pequod's, with cheese and all. The crust does make the pizza a whole lot better. If they could up the ante on the sauce (a la Art of Pizza), I'd be a regular. Ambience seems cool enough, have not had the pleasure of dining in. The people working there rock...very nice and make darn sure you get what you ordered.  Once I actually throw down money on a box of lactaid pills, I'll be back with a vengeance.
