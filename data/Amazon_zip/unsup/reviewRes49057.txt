this place lives up to all the hype. the great selection of beer makes it the perfect fit for chicago people. i have to start by saying ORDER THE WAFFLE DESSERT!! i can't even explain how delicious it was. it was the perfect crispy gooey tasting thing i've had in awhile. every thing we had was wonderful. we got the full chicken to share and i thought that was delicious as well but a little bit too salty. but the alioi dip with fries was great. the smelt with the fried green tomatoes was great too. they have communal tables - which i think makes it fun. i will for sure go here again with some friends.
