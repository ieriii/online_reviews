I don't even know how to review The Gage. I usually go with my sister and my friend, who have become Gage regulars. The funny thing is, while this usually leads to good conversation and a round of drinks, I'd love The Gage even if I wasn't with regulars. The staff is the best staff I've ever encountered - our servers always act like our BFFs, even when we don't know them, the bus boys engage in conversation rather than just take away empty glasses, and the hostess actually found me in the back of the bar during Lollapalooza weekend when I'd put my name in for a table and there was a 45 minute wait because it was packed. The prices are what you'd expect for a decent restaurant on Michigan Avenue ($14 for a Grey Goose dirty martini, $9 for a Romaine Salad). I know I'll be back many, many times.
