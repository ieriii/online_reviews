I went to the Purple Pig during their first week. I was very impressed by the food selection, ambiance and the efficient rhythm of their kitchen. You would have thought that they had been open for years. Tried several options including the House Cured Baccal Brandade which was unique, tasty and an item that I will specifically come back for. Bravo!
