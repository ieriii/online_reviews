It was hard to find parking and when you do find it, parking is expensive. Also, it was by the corner and the sun hit directly on there so all the curtains are usually closed. The drinks were a bit overpriced, in my opinion. When we asked for extra noodles, the amount seemed normal. However, the food portions are decent and the pho broth was a bit better than average.The best thing about it is the staff is extremely friendly though.
