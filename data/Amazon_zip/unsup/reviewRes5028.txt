I thought the Purple Pig was a pretty average restaurant. Aside from an interesting menu collection (so many meats), there was nothing really that stuck out about the establishment. I ended up trying the Salami Toscana. The waiter had told us that most of the dishes were relatively small and urged us to try multiple things. Unfortunately, the salesman ship was lacking based primarily on the fact that he took about 5 minutes to touch base with us initially. At least 10 minutes total before we could actually place an order. Food portions were good for lunch (friend had one of the salads) unless you're a regular super giant burrito fan. Then you may want a couple extra dishes. I will say that the salami portion was a bit of a disappointment (1 or 2 slices?) but overall the sandwich was solid. I would say above and beyond the redeeming thing about this place has to be the location/building itself. Decor is awesome and they already had seating outside with heaters running to make it no-jacket-friendly. There is little better than sitting outside in Chicago restaurants during spring-type weather.
