Great hotel at the center of Chicago. Easy access to many of the key sites in Chicago. So ideal location. The hotel is relatively inexpensive considering the location. The beds have varying sleep number dials so whatever is your preference in madras, you got it. The rooms are fairly roomy and many of them have good views. The internet is free :-) The breakfast is not included. You can get it at the next door Weber Grill. The breakfast is mediocre and maybe not the highlight of this venue. The hotel is modern and overall very efficient. My only complaint. We tried the valet parking ($49 / night - ouch) and the service is slow and not dependable. I would recommend parking in the parking structure next door. Cheaper and more reliable. Otherwise a really nice hotel.
