Went to Fogo De Chao last night with 9 people total. We were the first to arrive....even though we planned on being fashionably late. Lost that game didn't we? Anyway, we get our little bar coupon and go in the bar and wait. The service is quite good. The waiter was pulling the only open chairs out for us and the restaurant was packed to the gills. We ordered drinks, but the only problem is you don't know how much they are without expressly asking, because you don't get a bill. Instead the waiter writes down a code and it is added into your bill later. Our friends were so late that we had 2 drinks each, so that was $30 added on to our bill.  Not a big deal, I just would rather have paid at the time b/c it would have made splitting the bill easier for others. But I do understand it helps the flow so waiters aren't waiting for people to close up the bar tabs. More of an observation. However next time, we'll show just for desert and we'll end up being on time! The food and meat are terrific. I have been here before like 3 years ago when it first opened, but I think they have all the kinks out. The salad bar is terrific, and huge. Listen to your waiter when he says don't fill up on salad! One drawback I have is how crowded it gets. I just don't like the crowds and the noise. But that's just me searching for something wrong. It's $48.95 for each meal, but you get well more than you pay for, so be prepared to eat. Not a good date place in my opinion because you might not look too refined pigging out. Nice place for groups. The staff is quick and smart.
