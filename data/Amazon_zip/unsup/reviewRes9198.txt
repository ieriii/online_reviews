French-Vietnamese? Bring it on. Twas a stumbly/bumbly new years day in Chicago, and rather than starbuck it (which is what I really needed), we sort of fell into Le Colonial...per the previous dining experience of my buddy- it was supposed to be chock full of amazingness. I would have to agree..to some extent. Atmosphere is cool and inviting. Very intimate and palm tree-full. The darkness was more than ok with me. The Bo-Bia rolls were delicious, as was the Pho soup. I never had pho before-- i know?! what planet am I from, I call myself a foodie? It was quite possibly the best meal in itself I could ever have eaten. the beef was so tender I could have cut it with a spoon. I have found my new love interest in pho, it seems like one of those things that might never let me down. I ordered the Ga Xao Xa Ot for my entree. I was a little disappointed in it, as it was too salty for my taste, and it seemed a little too 'stir-fry/takeout' like. I should have been more adventurous with my palate that night, because everyone else's entrees around us looked superb. My buddy got the duck, and it was freakin' fantastic. I hope to get back again soon, to try something else!
