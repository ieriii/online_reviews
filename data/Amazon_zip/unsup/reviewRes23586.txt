I went to Costa Rica few years back and I was really excited to hear about this place. My first impression of the dishes was just okay... I had the Cheviche which i didn't really like and the fresh guacamole that i thought was complimentary with the chips but it's not (beware of the waiter asking you if you want guacamole with your chips, it's actually an appetizer). But then the real deal came, I had the Casado Tilapia dish which tasted just like a dish I had in Costa Rica and i had few bites of the Milanesa which I thought was really good as well. I'm also happy to know that I can find some Lizano Salsa in Chicago (I can now finish the bottle I bought 2 years ago). I had their Oatmeal shake for dessert and now I can easily pass out after posting this review.
