With 900+ reviews and a high rating, there isn't much to say probably. I just want to laud two things: 1. The moules frites are insane. There aren't a ton of places in Chicago where you can get them, but I'll venture there is no where better than Hopleaf. I can't think of better mussels that I've had, including anywhere in Europe. Big, sweet, without even the slightest alkaline taste in a single one. Ridiculous fries and aioli, assuming the fries are double-fried, the right way 2. For a beer and gastropub haven, they have some pretty amazing vegetarian options. So for all you beer-crazy vegetarians snubbed by the other gastropub meccas, head to Hopleaf
