I've heard a lot about the ZED experience - a 48 person plate with unlimited helpings of indulgences. However, being a vegetarian, I had kept myself at a distance thinking that it was just for the carnivore in all of us. But on a night with nothing to do, my SO suggested we go there to try the A La Carte Harvest Table experience.  I was blown away!  I started off with the artisan cheeses - a delicious goat gouda paired with an aged cheddar. I'm a sucker for cheese, so this really hit the spot. Then, I moved on over to the bread and spread table - delectable variety of breads, butters, and creams coated my stomach in preparation for the main "entrees" presented on the table. What followed next was a waterfall of flavor as we sampled heaping portions of different salads - a fuji apple salad with candied pecans, a fennel and artichoke salad with mandarin oranges, a burrata and tomato salad with sea salt and balsamic dressing... quite the lineup considering my daily lunch consists of iceberg and thousand island.  For the amount of gourmet food I ate, it made me even happier that it only came out to $25/person. It's ambiance is romantic enough for a date, trendy enough to go with a group of friends, and classy enough to bring business partners to impress. All in all, I would go there again in a heartbeat.
