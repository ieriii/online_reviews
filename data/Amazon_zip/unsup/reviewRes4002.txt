Yes, it is ALLOHDAT and more!!!! Unbelievable restaurant, unpretentious and yet chic in its own ways. After being cancelled on, oohhhh, twice we finally made it there last weekend. We couldn't be happier of course and it def exceeded our expectations. Note: must bring six-pack for the guys, they like it, they give you extra stuff, they are nice to you. The atmosphere is very casual and it's a very small place maybe with 9-10 tables. The music is blaring LOUD, very loud, but it is still possible to make conversation - they played Rap music when we were there. There is a small window to the kitchen, so you can see the culinary genius, Michael Carlson (looks like a biker) and the rest of the staff.  They change the menu seasonally I think. But overall it's just very creative, amazing combinations of flavors and just very well thought out. The quail egg ravioli thingy was the best, the Wendy's inspired soup was awesome, pretty much everything rocked...the dessert was the coolest part too...it involved dr.pepper which I haven't had since mmm high school i think. The service is nonexistent, but they're nice guys, really, just busy in the kitchen, etc. (no servers/wait staff, the cooks themselves serve you). This place is byob and they charge something like $2.50 per person corkage fee, which totally beats $12 cocktails at regular restaurants! I know, I know, you say, how do I actually GET a reservation there? Well, you gotta call at the right time. I called at 5:28 pm the first time, then I called at 11:22am the second time and both times they picked up obviously, but before this I had an alarm going on my phone to call Schwa every day around 5pm and around 1 am before they closed. So yes it can be tricky and yes you will most likely get canceled on but boooya, it's soooo worth it! Plenty of parking on the streets but if you choose to take the El all the better - 5 minute walk from the Blue line stop!
