What a fine fine establishment. Taken by the atmosphere and coddled by all the dishes, breads, meats, and sauces....we enjoyed everything about India House. The menu is like a chapter book, filled with countless options. LOVED IT!!! Variety is my vice. Tandoori Pesh-Kush $16.95:::an array of Tandoori Chicken, Tandoori Shrimp, Chicken Tikka, Shrimp Tikka, Chicken Reshmi kabob, and Lamb Boti kabob on a sizzing plate. Piled high--Wonderful presentation. If you dont like chicken breast, dont order this dish. Lachcha Paratha $4::::, Nothing astounding. I had better paratha at Straits....or in my own kitchen. Not as flaky as I yearned. Poori $4::: Hells to the Yess. Get this and dip it in the orange sauce they serve with the naan. You will devour it! Like a Vietnamese Banh Tieu but different. Saffron Rice $6::::: extraordinary. Enough to feed 4, maybe more. The fragrant rice, the taste, wowsers. Chicken Palak $16.95::::::::Donest like appetizing but its anything but. Creamy, vegetabley goodness. Not spicy like the description says but its a-ok. It was good. Sad I cant dine here when I want since I dont live in Chicago. Excellent Service.
