Definitely my very favorite seafood restaurant in Chicago. It's old fashioned in all the right ways. The service is impeccable. The food is to DIE for. Yes, it's expensive, yes, it's sometimes difficult to secure a reservation, but the experience is so worthwhile. The Oyster Bar is the place to go for a little more casual experience but it's the same great food. And the key lime pie is absolutely the best I've ever had. We went here for an early b-day lunch on New Year's Eve and could not have left happier. We had my dad's 70th birthday here and still talk about it. The bottom line is, when you want the best seafood, you go come to Shaw's.
