I've been to Ruth's several times (10+) and they have yet to let me down.  The service here is always excellent, especially George, who always seems to get it done right the first time. My biggest pet peeve when it comes to steakhouses is getting the temperature incorrect and the only way to fail for me is over cooking it (I prefer rare to medium rare).  That has yet to be the case here. The steaks are the main draw for me here and they are always done right. From the filet to the "Cowboy" bone-in ribeye, I always know I am getting a great cut of meat drenched in sizzling butter. The apps and sides are also guaranteed to please. Overall, I know this place will always be a first class dining experience.
