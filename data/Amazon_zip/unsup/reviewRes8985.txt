Date place! The food, drinks and ambiance run true to type - all presented wonderfully. There is a grace that extends also into the faux plantation shutters and slow rotating ceiling fans. Intimate and romantic. You could be in Vietnam in a bygone era while dining here. Our waiter however was more interested in providing the most basic level of service. I was going to order another cocktail but grew tired of waiting for him to take my order - and just called it a night. Will definitely be back but will decline to sit at this person's section. Would have given Le Colonial 4 stars otherwise.
