I've been going to the Pasta Bowl for years and I'm never disappointed. The conchiglie gorgonzola is my favorite dish. The staff are always attentive but not on top of you while you're there. The prices are great for the amount of food you get, too. If you order delivery the sauce may be a bit congealed by the time it arrives but that's sauce for you. Yum yum,
