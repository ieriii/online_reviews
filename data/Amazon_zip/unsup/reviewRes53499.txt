Definitely waited for almost two hours, but it was worth it. In addition to whichever inventive dog strikes your fancy, try the corndog (surprisingly our favorite) and get those decadent duck fat fries. Just do it. and don't be intimidated by the line - take a friend or your smartphone or a book and the time will pass reasonably quickly. Cash only.
