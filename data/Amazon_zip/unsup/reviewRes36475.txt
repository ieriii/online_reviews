I came here with a friend (and an admitted fan) so I had high hopes for the food, and the lunch special did not disappoint. First, it's an adorable cozy little spot with nice wooden chopsticks (not crappy break-apart), friendly service, and a fab lunch special. For approx $11 total (including tip) I got an entree, 3 crab rangoons, miso soup, and a drink. I had the drunken noodles which were not too greasy, full of fresh veggies, and the perfect amount of spice for my wussy palette. The rangoons were perfect 2-bites with a yummy sauce and the miso will be a favorite come cold weather. My only complaint is that the service was a little lacking. Friendly yes, but our empty drinks were never re-filled, nor were we asked if we would like re-fills (which was odd considering how often they re-filled the water... maybe I should be more proactive in my iced tea re-fill requests). Other than that, it was a great lunch and I will def be back.
