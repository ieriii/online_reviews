We just got back from a bachelorette party in Chicago and chose Sunda for our dinner venue after it was suggested by a friend and it was great! The food, service and ambiance was exactly what we were looking for. We were seated right away and our server was attentive and the food came out in succession at a good pace. The manager came over with shots (with his head sushi chef, who my friends wouldn't stop staring at) and wished the bride to be congrats and continually made sure we were all set throughout our dinner. As for food, I loved everything we ordered, but a few things stuck on my palette in particular: Garlic noodles with blue crab - simple and they weren't cheap with the crab so there were good chunks in thereSteamed Baos - delicious (that's all that needs to be said)Spicy Tuna with crispy rice and jalapenos - the crispy rice added an unexpected texture to the normal spicy tuna maki we're all used to and the jalapenos was the icing on the cake for those who really like spiceMiso Cod - It wasn't too salty and the fish was cooked perfectlyAs for the sushi, the fish was fresh. I usually gauge the quality based on the uni because that's my fav and it often has a funk to it if it's not fresh. All the sushi/sashimi we ordered tasted great and was well presented... For dessert, my fav was the mochi ice-cream and I hardly ever eat dessert! Overall a great experience and definitely worth 5 stars! And I give it a 6th start just cuz the manager is from Guam too! =)
