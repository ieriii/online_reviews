Sunday brunch was unimpressive. Only memorable item was the sticky bun...best bun I've ever tasted. Soft, sticky, sweet, buttery greatness. I would rate this place 4-5 stars on this bun but they had to ruin it with the brunch items. Pork rinds were over salted/seasoned. Ham and eggs were okay...nothing unique. Bacon was nice and thick but again just okay. Also, I get the whole rustic place vibe but wine in a glass cup? Maybe a beer would have been better.
