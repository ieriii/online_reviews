Wow - really not sure how this place lands 4-5 stars consistently. Let's start with the service... I get that friendly service goes a long way to making a good restaurant experience, but there is such a thing as being TOO attentive to customers. As in, "you just thrust your face in mine two minutes ago to ask if I was doing okay, and guess what, nothing has changed since then, so yes, I am still doing okay, and you're starting to creep me out." And when you ask me three more times between ordering and when my food comes (a time span of about 20 minutes) - then I'm beginning to get annoyed. Also, when the waiter came to the table holding the water pitcher at a 30 degree angle so that he is literally pouring it all over the floor, my feet, my friend's legs, and the table, and then proceeded to say "Would you like some water?" I had to try very, VERY hard not to laugh in his face. And the food... I was hoping that the extremely attentive service was not overcompensation for poor food, but it turns out my fears were justified. I ordered combo #5 and found it to be quite bad - the tamale was all dried out, with leather meat inside, the enchilada was sub-par and overly greasy, and even though I ordered a corn tortilla for my quesadilla, I'm pretty sure I could have made the same thing at home with ingredients from Dominick's "Hispanic Foods" aisle.  All in all, a disappointing meal at what I was hoping would be a great new place (Yelpers led me astray for the first time!)
