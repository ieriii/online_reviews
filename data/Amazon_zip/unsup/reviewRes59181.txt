Excellent place for Sushi! I have to admit that I probably can't call myself a Sushi connoisseur because I do not dive into the sashimi aspect of this type of dining very often but I do love maki rolls. This restaurant is not elaborate or fancy...but the sushi is exceptional! The price is also very reasonable in comparison to places like Sushi Wabi without compromising quality or taste. They always have a unique special..the lastest had yellow tail with mango...very good! My boyfriend and I have done carry-out at this place more often than not and then we can create our own romantic style evening with wine and fabulous food. Try it out.
