This. Pizza is supposed to be like this. "Stick to your ribs, perfect ratio of sauce to cheese to toppings, you can't eat more than a slice or two without immediately slipping into food coma" pizza.  This review is like a year late, but I just recently recommended Pequod's to a friend visiting the fair city and realized I hadn't recommended it to Yelp yet. Pequod's pizza and a few beers were the perfect antidote to the Chicago Half Marathon. And even with 12 months passing, I still have not forgotten the crisp, buttery crust and the thick, hot stuffing of Pequod's pizzas.  My mom will kill me for saying this, but this place is a reason I would move back home.
