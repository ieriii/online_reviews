I went here recently and was completely BLOWN AWAY!!! The decor was AWESOME, the server we had was GREAT and offered suggestions to my friend and I. We ordered the White Collar Crime as the appetizer. Let me tell you, it was WONDERFUL!!! The hummus tasted exactly the way hummus should taste and was very smooth- the baba had a smoky taste to it that was really, really good. (I HIGHLY recommend it!) I had the Ponzi Scheme burger and she had the Identity Thief. My burger was cooked to perfection and her sandwich tasted so good, I had trouble deciding which one I liked more! I'm not much of a beer and wine drinker, but their selection is really good. It seems like they spent a lot of time picking the beers and wines they wanted to serve. The music wasn't very loud when we went, but that may be because we went during the week. And if you have difficulty finding parking, ask them for a badge and you can park in a church lot (I think!) We didn't have to park because we took a cab from work. If I could give this place a higher rating, I would! I am DEFINITELY going back... and I'll be bringing more of my friends and family.
