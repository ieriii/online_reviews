Picked this place for dinner because it was close and the menu looked fantastic. It didn't disappoint! Very friendly service, nice atmosphere, good drinks, and nice food. The restaurant was surprisingly un-busy for a Saturday night, which was cool because we didn't have reservations going in. We were seated immediately and enjoyed cocktails. One friend ordered the Agropolitan, which was decidedly tastier and more interesting than the Palmer on the Porch that I ordered (basically an alcoholic Arnold Palmer). Mine was watered-down and uninspired, but that Agripolitan: man! The Lemon-Ginger Martini was also delicious. Another member of the party ordered the absinthe, which was presented in the "traditional French method." It was pretty but the beaker of water was hard to pour and led to my friend soaking the tray and napkins accompanying the liquor. The food was very good. I went with the flatbread special. I am blanking on what it included now, but key ingredients included roasted peppers, tomatoes and blue cheese. Very tasty. We split the carrot & sweet potato croquettes and those were to die for. All in all, a nice choice for a special dinner out with friends.
