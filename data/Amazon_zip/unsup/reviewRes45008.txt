My coworker Brian wanted to do Italian on cinco de Mayo. He choice was Giordanos for his bday lunch. I was a bit reluctant but I am so happy with what I ordered. Brian and Jim got the individual stuffed spinach while John and I got the salads. I have to say our server Layoneth was beyond awesome. He made sure we got everything we wanted and got us our food fast. He was great. I got the Greek salad with chicken and I was so excited about the anchovies on it. come on it adds a great flavor to the feta. Well when the salad came out, there were no anchovies on the salad.. Layoneth made sure that I had a side right away. The salad was so good and a nice alternative to pizza. Well at the end of the meal we told layoneth that it was Brian's bday. He brought out a awesome slice of chocolate cake that was on the house. I didn't think I would love it but the service made it awesome. It is a first come first serve so no reservations!
