For a BYOB, this restaurant is pretty upscale. The interior is really nice. Cozy, rustic, simple, and elegant in that way. Servers & runners were really nice. Our server afterwards helped recommend some places we could go to salsa dance, he seemed to be able to handle ourt able well and there were 15 of us. Food: Really nice. Ordered the Combinaciones with the Skirt Steak (after reading all these reviews) and the grilled shrimp. The skirt steak was juicy, tasty and not too tough. Shrimp was fine. We got free sangrias bc a friend got some coupon on Yelp. Sweet. Hear that the free sangrias come in bigger cups during the weekdays. :) I'd recommend this place and would come back.
