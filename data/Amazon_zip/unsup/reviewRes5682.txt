"PIG" is a fitting name for this restaurant because that is exactly how I would describe the staff that we encountered here and especially the manager. We went with a large party and were expecting a decent wait since they don't take reservations, however when we returned a little earlier than recommended we were given the run around and basically lied to. In the end, we found out that they had screwed up, but rather than apologizing they put the blame on us saying that our party was not all together when we initally arrived! The final straw was when the manager was rude and then actually started shaking his fist at our birthday girl! It was shocking! Completely unacceptable behaviour and of course we all left.  Don't waste your time or money!
