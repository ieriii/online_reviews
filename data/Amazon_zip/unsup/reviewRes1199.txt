I dream of Hot Doug's. Seriously. I've never been disappointed. But I refuse to go on weekends (not like I could go even if I wanted to because I work Saturdays). And when I do go on my weekday off - I don't go until about 2pm, after the lunch rush. I really wish this place was open later. Or at least on Sunday. Get with the post-industrial capitalist society Hot Doug's!
