so. good. Every Saturday morning between 9-10:30am, me and the man venture into Glenn's for brunch. The hostess recognizes us, asks if we have friends joining us, and seats us right away. A server comes over, asks if we want the usual- Glenn's dad's french toast, a side of bacon, and a mimosa for me, a plan and anti climatic dish for the fella. I'm only giving 4 stars because I feel as if most people go here for their seafood, and I have only ever eaten brunch (and non-seafood brunch items), so I can't give an accurate assessment of non-brunch foods. Their (brunch) food is AMAZING! I always want to try something new, but the french toast with a vanilla/cinnamon/brown sugar/something else wash over the texas toast french toast is too delicious to not consume. Their mimosa's and bloody mary's are epic. I'm not a bloody fan, but friends rave about how great they are- they're almost a meal unto their own, coming with 4-5 shrimp on a skewer and a couple massive slices of melon. Their mimosa's are both delicious and fun- you get a sugar rimmed glass with triple sec, a full glass or OJ, and an individual serving bottle of champagne. So good, it makes me not feel like an alcoholic for drinking before noon every Saturday. Every time we go, we leave with a bill LESS than what we have paid at the golden nugget for similar (but exponentially more delicious) food. GREAT prices for what you get, GREAT food, and pretty good service (though at this point all the servers know us and know we tip well, so it's a little biased). For people who want savory, I highly recommend the crab cake eggs benedict or the new orleans scramble. Sweet- go with the glenn';s dad. you won't be disappointed.
