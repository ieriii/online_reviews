I LOVE 90 MILES CUBAN CAFE! My partner and I have visited 90 Miles on a few different occasions, and always left VERY satisfied! I have had the Veggie Sandwich and it is SO GOOD! I like it so much, that I am afraid that I wont want to try anything else (is that really so bad?).  On the side we order the Fried Plantains, which make the meal special and unique.  Aside from the delicious food, the ambiance of this small restaurant is great. The walls are covered with cuban newspaper and magazine ads, which make for great conversation while waiting for your order. If you haven't already tried 90 Miles, I recommend that you go this weekend for lunch... you will LOVE it too!
