How do I put this politely without offending midwesterners? I strongly disklike, hate is such a tough word, thick crusted pizzas. There I said it. To me, there's something a little unnatural about eating your pizza with a fork and knife. Give me a NY slice that you have to fold in half and I'm a happy camper. However, with that said, Pequods is good for a pan pizza. After hearing much hype about the food, a group of us (half who had been and half who were virgins) decided to go for lunch. I knew what I was getting myself into, but I'm convinced that there is a Chicago style pizza place out there that will convert me from my dislike for deep dish or pan pizza. Pequod's came close, but not enough to convert me. Pequod's has a fabulous lunch special. For only $4.95 you get a 7" personal pizza with one topping plus a beer or soda. Mind you that 7" is enough to feed 2 and for that price you really can't go wrong. There was a great variety of toppings and everything was very tasty. As everyone raves about the caramalized crust is quite delish, but let's be honest....it's over cooked cheese.  Overall, Pequod's to me is like a Vegas vacation - Once a year is great, but more than one trip may be a little much.
