First off, Amanda H. down there is exactly who I don't want at the Violet Hour. Anyone who thinks being a law student and "throwing around official agencies, law enforcement, etc." is intelligent or cool is the kind of moron I don't want in my classier drinking establishments! Second, who complains about $11 drinks in Chicago? Third, this place is awesome. Don't go on the weekends. There is really no reason to bash this place. AMAZING drinks, excellent ambiance, and the days I don't feel like dealing with the Crobar crowd...it's good times.
