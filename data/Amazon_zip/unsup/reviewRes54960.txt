First of all, I love whiskey. So when a place claims to be a whiskey bar i get a bit skeptical. Not here though. As far as I could tell they had over 80 different whiskeys. The other problem with most whiskey bars is that the prices can be pretty high. But they have something like 20 whiskeys for $3 a glass.Now, the food. There are some basic things on the menu like salads and burgers, but there are also some more interesting items like duck fries, bone marrow. The list goes on and on. In the end this place is fantastic.Before you leave make sure you end the night with a Manhattan or a cup of coffee. Best of both worlds.
