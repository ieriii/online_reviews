I came in here, of course I had to! It was packed! I just wanted a smoothie! So I went along and it took a short while, staff were pretty nice to me, but when the person was done with the smoothie, no.. Just no never again a smoothie from here, it tasted like water and sugar! Instead of wasting $4.50 with tax nearly ($5) I could've made my own. But no, tsk tsk tsk.. So I bought two from other places of course.. I got one from Pho 777, it was ok.. They were nice though.. Then one from Pho Viet it was pretty good, the lady was really nice, or the store manger, so I'll probably give Pho Viet a shot as well as Pho 777.
