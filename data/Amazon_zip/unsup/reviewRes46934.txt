I really debated between three and four stars for this place. Pros: -Very friendly service -Knowledgeable service -Excellent wine list -Freakishly good desserts (try the cherry chocolate chip ice cream cookie --and by "ice cream" i mean salty peanut butter gelato Cons: -My pizza looked wood-fired. The menu screamed wood-fire quality. But it was not. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't great. -Not super vegetarian friendly. -Specials unavailable. -The atmosphere was just-OK for me. Maybe it was where we sat. It was fine. Ya know?
