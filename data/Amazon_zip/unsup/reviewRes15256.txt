I've been coming here for quite some time now and never wrote a review. Sabatino's is as "Chicaaaago" (said in a very nasaly midwestern accent) as it gets. When you walk in, it's pretty dark with dark wood paneled walls covered in old school pics of celebs that have dined there. The menu is large...portions are HUGE and most entrees include soup or salad and a side of pasta. They start every table off with a plate of heavenly, cheesy pizza bread. I can sit there and eat the pizza bread all day and be completely satisfied. Yum. I recommend getting the chicken parmesan or eggplant parm...both are extremely good...huge, breaded and fried to a crisp....and covered in a nice melty blanket of mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. If you want to try something more light, check to see if they have chilean sea bass. It is cooked beautifully...light flakey and buttery. If you want to end the night with some fire, get the banana fosters which is cooked table side for you. enjoy
