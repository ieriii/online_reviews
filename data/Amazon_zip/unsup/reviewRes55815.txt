Calos' is my favorite neighborhood restaurant. Not only are their Italian dishes superb, they have the best ribs in town. It's great that the ribs are a special during the week. You can't beat the price of the rib dinner, which includes your choice of soup or salad and a side of pasta or potato. Top it off with a martini, and I'm in heaven.
