Compared to other fondue restaurants, the prices at Geja's are much more reasonable. For one price, you get cheese and chocolate fondue + coffee with your entree selection. The reasonableness is actually what attracted me to try it out. However, the food was just ok. I didn't really care for the cheese fondue and the chocolate wasn't that special either.  The interior is cozy and has the potential for romance, but there was a family with children sitting at the next table so I wasn't feeling that swept away. Although, the service was great - very attentive.  Even though it was a good deal as far as fondue is concerned and the fondue experience is always fun, it was still a pricey outing and I would have rather had a regular meal elsewhere. I hate to say this because I typically like to support local restaurants and not chains, but if you're looking for great fondue, head to The Melting Pot. Though a bit pricier, they have a wider selection of fondue options and it just tastes better, at least to me.
