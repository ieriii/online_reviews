Great affordable and nice hotel! Relatively close to Chinatown as well! I've stayed here twice and have had pleasant experiences. My family pricelined this place to get an awesome cheap deal! What we mainly liked is its close proximity to Chinatown which is what we usually visit in Chicago. It has its defects, but I would say the pros heavily outweigh them. PROS: - Great location and close to Chinatown - Clean! - Lobby is beautiful and decorative - Great customer service (I requested extra towels and was nicely granted them) - Nice and personable parking/valet staff - Affordable on Priceline! - Clean and spacious restrooms - Swimming pool - Parking garage is easily accessible - This is little, but they have free Aquafresh toothpaste in the bathrooms! (my favorite brand) - Some rooms have a GREAT view of the Chicago Downtown Skyline CONS: - Parking price - A little lower quality for a 4-star hotel - No fridges in hotel rooms - No continental breakfast - Rooms could be more vibrant - Some rooms have bad views of just concrete - Some bathrooms have no vent/fan
