Went to Sunda the other night for a benefit for people affected by the crisis in Japan. If ever a restaurant deserves 5 stars, it's Sunda. The food is incredible. The truffled tataki tuna and American kobe sashimi were perhaps the best things I've ever tasted. But what makes Sunda special goes beyond the menu. The owners/partners, Billy and Aaron, and the staff, all donated their time and effort. Even the wonderful servers donated their tips! The result was a amazing evening that afforded Chicagoans an opportunity to get behind a worthwhile cause. In the end, Sunda raised $50,000 for people in Japan (of which Direct Relief commits 100% to Japan relief efforts). The generosity of this place can't be overstated. When you eat at Sunda, not only will you enjoy a world-class meal, you will be supporting an establishment that works to make the world a better place.To see photos of the night, follow this link - http://www.unscenemedia.
