I've been to Kinzie for a variety of occasions - quick lunches in the loop, and special occasions like Valentine's Day and anniversaries, and I'm always impressed with the food, wine, and service.For a chophouse, they have a great lunch selection. I love the herbed goat cheese salad, and they'll add grilled chicken or steak or other toppings to it too. We usually go to Kinzie for special occasions for a nice, inviting atmosphere. I've never gotten a stuffy or snooty feeling from any of the staff. Some recommendations - the cheese flight (amazing!!), the filet with a huge variety of toppings (I love the grilled mushrooms), and the mac & cheese side is oh-so good. The servers are more than happy to review all the different cuts of meat with you and explain the differences and the best way to prepare them. They're knowledgable about wine pairings also, and there is a great wine selection.Don't pass up the fixed price menus either. I've gone for the Valentine's Day special for a few years now and it never disappoints. The mushroom duck risotto is unbelievable, and the wine pairings are perfect. I've never had a problem with the steak being over- or under-cooked. And the price is a steal for the amount of food and wine you get. They always send you home with a little treat, too. Highly recommended!!
