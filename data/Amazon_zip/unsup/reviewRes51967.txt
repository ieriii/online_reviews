Tried Geno's last night and was not impressed. The service was good, but I truly don't get the 40+ minute wait for the pizza once ordered. I ordered a personal pepperoni which was large, but was also over $17.00. I know they are supposed to be famous for their crust and again I cannot figure out why. It was very much cornmeal based and was crunchy/crumbly which is not a texture I enjoy with my pizza. The cheese and sauce where ok, but since they all have to work together I found the crust really brought the whole thing down.
