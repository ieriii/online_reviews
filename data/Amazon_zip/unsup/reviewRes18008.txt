XOCO ("Show-co" to the gringo) completely delivered on my expectations. Upon learning of the Rick Bayliss establishment based on Mexican street food, I immediately put it on my short list to try. I finally had the opportunity to do so for lunch lunch with a friend. We started with an order of the guacamole & chips.  Not the best guacamole I have ever had, but it was very good. For my main dish, I enjoyed the Tuesday torta special - Pork Tinga: Chipotle-braised Gunthorp prok, chorizo, Napa cabbage, fresh cheese, avocado, black beans.  It was excellent! Flavors were spot on as one would expect from Bayliss.  Overall, I had a great experience at XOCO. It is a bit pricy for what you get, but it is much more approachable for lunch than Frontera or Topolobampo. If you want to get a feel for Bayliss' mexican creations, XOCO is the perfect place to start.
