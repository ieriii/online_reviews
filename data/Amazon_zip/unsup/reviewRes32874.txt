The first time I went there (about a month ago), the food was OK and the waitress was at least a little friendly. Going today, however, I was disappointed mainly with the wait staff. We had to wait forever for our food and the waitress had an attitude - haughty and giving vibes that she just didn't want to be there. She also got our order wrong and didn't seem to want to answer questions from the folks I was with who had never had Ethiopian food. Needless to say, I won't ever go back there again.
