My wife and I had an amazing meal at the Kinzie Chop House. My wife had the filet and loved it and I had a New York strip. The side were incredible too, broccoli in cheese and twice baked potato. My five year old enjoy her chicken strips too. The service was great and e decor was very nice too. All in all I would definitely go back there again and I would recommend it to my friends.
