the food is always great but I cant stand the staff. They all look miserable and not wanting to be there. Im not sure why they cant smile, be nice, fake a thank you. They are always busy which I get but the owner really should whip them into shape. Unless the staff gets the attitude from them.  I guess the lavender cookies are enough to forgo some friendly service. I cant wait for the competition to move in and teach them a lesson on friendly service, they should be ecstatic that they are allways busy and making soooo much loot.
