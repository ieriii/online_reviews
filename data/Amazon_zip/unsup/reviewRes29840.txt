This place is a real treat! My cousin Brian suggested to meet up at this place on our trip to Chicago. It looks like a classic 50's style diner with a similar menu, except that everything on the menu is vegan or vegetarian. You won't find any meat here, except for photos of rescued farm animals on the wall.  When I saw they had a vegan (chicken) fried steak with vegan gravy and mashed potatoes I had to try it. Who knows when I'd come across a such a thing again. It looked great and tasted surprisingly delicious.  While a bit difficult to cut through, it was really good.  My wife had the vegan turkey BLT sandwich and my cousin had the BBQ vegan burger. Both were fantastic.  Their shakes and desert menu looked amazing, but we did not have any room to try them, however I'm sure they are great. Also they have a great selection of micro beers and refreshing cocktails. If your a vegetarian or vegan, even if your not, this place is worth checking out. Highly recommended.
