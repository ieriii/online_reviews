Just happened in here the other night on our way to a play at Timeline around the corner. We lucked out! Nice place, friendly service, very good food. We were there early so it was quiet but filled up some by the time we left. The black bean burger, sweet potato fries, soda bread and curried mussels were all delicious. So delicious that we had no room for dessert which sounded wonderful. We'll be back!!!
