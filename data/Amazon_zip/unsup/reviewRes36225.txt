Love love love. They have interesting veggie sushi, which is rare in my experience. I used to get excited and think it was exotic when a restaurant had an asparagus roll. Now, I look at those menus disdainfully while thinking about Indie's mango-avocado-cucumber roll and the veggie tempura roll. I order the same thing every time (mango-avo-q roll and v-tempura) and it's delicious. Service is iffy - sometimes it's great, sometimes it's slow. But the sushi is so good that I don't complain.
