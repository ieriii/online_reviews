Beautiful People. Wonderful Drinks. Mouth Watering Dessert. Went here on a whim after we had parked in the area. We didn't want to end the night quite yet so we decided to stop in for a drink. I had heard of the place after reading reviews on good old Yelp. I'm so glad we stopped in! The vibe here is soo chill, sophisticated, and intimate. The wooden tables and dim light creates such an environment great for conversations. Also it makes everyone look way attractive! We were seated right away. Many were at the bar and waiting for a table downstairs for Curio. Great selection of cocktails. We ordered my favorite drinks of all time: St. Germaine and Prosecco and Pimm's Cup. WOW. Refreshing and it wasn't too sweet. Amazing combinations and well-balanced. Kudos to the mixologist! My girlie and I were craving for something sweet. Brown butter apple cake with apple cider caramel. Still warm, the ice cream slowly melted on top. There was crust of the caramel on top you had to use your knife to get through it. Highly recommend this dessert for all those who have a sweet tooth! Heading back here for a full dinner and maybe if we get here early drinks downstairs at Curio. I'm very CURIOUS....
