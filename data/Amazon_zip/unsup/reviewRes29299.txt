After hearing that they have good Thai food from a friend, we decided to check it out. I was not impressed with the food at all. To start off, we got the shrimp papaya salad, which normally I absolutely love, but not in this case. First off, they didn't even use fresh shrimp, it was some nasty dried burnt shrimp that was absolutely disgusting! Also, they put too much sauce on their papaya, it was like they were trying to cover up something, like the fact that their salad sucked. I also got the pad thai, which I feel is like a staple dish at all thai restaurants and you just can't go wrong with it. Yuck... my pad thai was too sticky like they overcooked the noodles and was just awful.  Would I come back? probably not.
