I don't even like burritos, but I will go to Irazu solely to purchase one. They offer a good selection of other veggie options, but I feel as if I have already attained perfection in the form of vegetables and some other crap wrapped in a tortilla. Highly recommended. Be warned, though, that they tend to get very busy. Expect a wait if you want to eat in at peak dining hours.
