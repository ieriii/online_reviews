I hate to do this..I own a food business and take all bad reviews to heart. But since every one else on yelp seems to love this place, my lone voice and rating isn't going to hurt them. I just don't like this pizza!!! I have stopped and grabbed a slice at least a half-dozen times over the years and still can't figure out what all the fuss is about. When the Chicago Tribune called it the best deep dish pie in the city I was mystified. That may have sparked one of my visits, to see if the pizza had improved. But alas,no. The same, lukewarm and doughy slices I remember.
