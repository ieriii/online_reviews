My reaction to Wilde's for the last several years has been just what the two stars stands for: Meh. Meh when I went for just drinks and service took forever. Meh when I have ordered several different options on the menu, each time hoping for a more tasty--or at least more flavorful-for-the-price--experience. And a huge big fat meh for ordering to go in the aftermath of the Gread Blizzard of '11, only to walk all the way home and discover that they got the order wrong, and thus have to walk all the way back to Wilde and get the right order. They were apologetic, and sure they were busy, but after so many second chances, this one blew it. If you're in the neighborhood and need a safe choice (the vibe is indeed charming there), or a way too greasy meal, then Wilde might be for you. For my own personal pub action, I will venture further south to the Duke of Perth for better quality food and drink at a better price.
