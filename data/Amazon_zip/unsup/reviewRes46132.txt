For a large chain you can't go wrong with Grand Lux. I no what to anticipate and you receive it. Prices are fair . Portions are oversized but everyone takes home I imagine. The desserts are too sweet but that is my biz and all mass produced desserts are too sweet imo. Service is Excellent. Location great and great atmosphere.
