Best cafe in Chicago for coffee and desserts! Food is not great though, try 9 Muses for the entree and come here for dessert and coffee! It's a perfect date place or to come here with a small group. I'm not big on their lunch special because I really don't like the food, but I'd definitely recommend their pizza if you're in the mood. It's my second favorite in all of Chicago (right behind DiMaggio's in Harwood Heights).
