Carnivale is the perfect place to splurge for dinner. On my income and budget, I only go on special occasions. That said, it is hands-down one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. The decor and service are impeccable, as is the food. My first visit was during lunch hours, and though it is no longer on the menu, I had a chicken-based paella that was wonderful. I also sampled the guacamole and empanada appetizers. They were equally tasty. For my most recent visit, I had the Pernil at dinner, which is extremely delicious. It is the most tender, flavorful pork I've ever experienced. The plantains are also a nice accent to the meat. The drinks are also wonderful: great sangria, margaritas, and mojitos. I highly recommend going on a night with live music. Also, check out the website for information on events featuring special foods. Be prepared to pay a pretty penny, but it's well worth it.
