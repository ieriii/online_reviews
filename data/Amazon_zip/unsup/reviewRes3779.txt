I visit there 3 times a month or even more often than that. It is more like hip restaurant with self service for me. It is not a real authentic Korean rice bowl with sizzling plat but the taste is great!!! Staff is very friendly and cozy atmosphere while I am having food every time. Music helps a lot tooo...Awsome place!! It is packed with people around late afternoon or early evening.
