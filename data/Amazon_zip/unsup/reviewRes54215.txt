I was so excited to go here as I have heard nothing but good things about this place and been given recommendation after recommendation for it. With that said my expectations were very high. This place isn't awful, but I certainly did not feel that I would recommend this place. The food was fair (we all ordered something different so I had a variety of things) and none of it blew me away. I was disappointed by the plantains and the shakes everyone raves about is not that great. I think what we have here is another hip place to be for Wicker Park. Oh yes, the guy with the beard and the weird creeper eyes wearing a flannel button up shirt from some thrift store, dirty jeans, a filthy looking beard and looked as if he needed a serious bath was there along with his hipster girlfriend wearing her over sized pink framed glasses, a retro t-shirt and a collection of other pieces from Buffalo exchange throw on...you know exactly the couple/kind of people I'm talking about. If this is you..then go ahead and go, I'm sure you'll totally dig it man. But if you want some actual good food that is above standard and not just hipster approved I don't recommend it. The service is very nice though. I also was surprised to see that they didn't offer any kind of drinks...it's BYOB which I'm not a fan of and think this kind of place should offer something, but that's my fault for not knowing.
