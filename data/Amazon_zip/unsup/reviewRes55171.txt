Where to begin...what an awful experience...food was terrible...service was worseLet me preface that I travel about once each year to eat at BBQ destination..last year Kansas City...year before Austin...etc...My favorite Chicago BBQ is SmoqueI ordered carry-out from this restaurant...was told 20 minutes...showed up and they forgot to enter my carryout...I actually watched the lady behind the bar enter my order, then turn to me, and tell me that what she was doing was a formality and my order was already entered...she actually just lied to my face...terrible customer service...after waiting a total of 1 hour for my food, it was nothing but disappointing....baby back ribs were terrible...hominy salad was tasteless...only decent item was baked beans with brisket...STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE...THEY TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS TERRIBLE VIA SERVICE AND THE FOOD ITSELF WAS HORRIBLEToo bad...I am looking for another Smoque or something at least worth going back to..
