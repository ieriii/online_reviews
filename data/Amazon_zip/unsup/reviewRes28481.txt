Great pasta dishes plus they know how to pour a pint of Guinness correctly!! I ordered the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare; mussels, shrimp, and scallops in marinara. It was great, the pasta was al diente, the marinara a bit spicy, and the seafood fresh and cooked perfectly. This is the only dish I tried but it was perfect and from what I saw at other tables, the other customers were having the same satisfaction as I. The place is very narrow with a nice bar toward the front...great space. I'll be back for sure...
