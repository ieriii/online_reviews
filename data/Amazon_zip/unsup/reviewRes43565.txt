I have only ever had slices of stuffed pizza here, so I can't comment on the deep dish, thin crust, etc (and I would never order anything else anyway). The stuffed pizza is my favorite in chicago, and that's saying something. I have to be in the mood, because its almost like going out to have desert for dinner...its SO thick and doughy. In fact, its really not technically the best pizza I could conceive of, but its just really yummy. The sauce stands out for me. I just like it. Others don't, and I can understand that...it is pretty tangy and thick. One slice of the stuffed pepperoni probably has about 1400 calories, but it is heaven. Also, the only place in Chicago I've ever seen that sells slices of stuffed pizza. When you're craving thick, heavy, yummy stuffed pizza, one slice usually will be more than adequate to satisfy...other places will make you order a whole pizza and wait 45 minutes. Here, you can be in and out in that amount of time and eat pizza that has been consistently voted best in the city. Everyone should try it once.
