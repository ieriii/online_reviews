Bravo, Indie Cafe, Bravo. It's a dangerous game mixing cuisines from different countries -- I usually find pan-Asian restaurants end up lacking and very generic -- but Indie sure comes out on top. The sushi is INCREDIBLE. The presentation is amazing, the prices are decent, portions are good, etc.  I'm a huge fan of the Popeye maki, the other special makis are all delicious too. The soup is good, and it's BYOB. Just go around the corner to the liquor store and buy some white wine and you're set! I live hella far away from this place, and yet I've managed to get over here a few times. With plans to go back. And since I haven't even been to all the sushi places within a few blocks of my house, that's saying something!
