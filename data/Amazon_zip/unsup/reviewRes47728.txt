I went to this place about six month ago. And I still complain about it. Nothing special for dinner, really. Just a pretentious place with very average food. My friends ordered this buffet with dinner, I just got a buffet. Well, I was surprised that they had just two kinds of cheese. Really? And this is a classy restaurant? My friends were hoping to enjoy Brazilian style fare. Instead, it was like the waiter was saving on meat. The best part was how the waiter was raving about sangria which was diluted red wine. Really? So many classy restaurants to go in Chicago, I want nice food and less showing off!
