The first time our group tried to go we decided not to wait in line. The second time, the line was not too bad and it was moving steadily so we braved the cold. Not going to write much, because its pretty much all been said!! Hot Doug's was super yummy, the staff was efficient, and Doug was patient and friendly working the counter. Everyone tried fun items, and my boyfriend's was super good. I don't remember what the name was, just that it had a sweet curry sauce on it that was amazing. The chili cheese fries were good too. I probably would not order plain fries because I didn't like them that much. Personally, I don't like the hand cut style of fries like they have here and at Five Guys. Good novelty place to take visitors. I probably wouldn't make a habit of going here though. Fun to try!
