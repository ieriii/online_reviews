So good! The mixed green salad (with pears, tomotoes, cucumber, goat cheese, and candied walnuts) is delicious and the red pizza with sausage and pepperoni (or chicken and bacon) is addictive. Be sure to order the pizza with extra cheese, and show up on Thursdays after 9PM to see the famous Stas sing karaoke. You will know him when you see him!
