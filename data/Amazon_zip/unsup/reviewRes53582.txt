This was the most amazing dining experience I have ever had. First and foremost the food was mind blowing fantastic. The music was exactly my style, but a bit too loud. The best part of the evening was when the chef came out with a huge box of fireworks and all the diners followed him out of the restaurant where he proceeded to blow them up just off the side street off of Ashland. It was a beautiful display that was sadly interrupted by the cops who hauled the chef away to the station! The rest of us went back into the restaurant and finished our meals. We were assured by the rest of the restaurant staff that they would be going to the station to bail him out. I have been fortunate enough in my life to dine at world class restaurants - but Schwa is probably the best restaurant I have ever been to hands down. The sheer brilliance of this chef is immeasurable. I highly recommend it and its worth the wait and frustration in getting a reservation.
