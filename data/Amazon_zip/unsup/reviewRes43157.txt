I've been coming to Milk & Honey since they opened. One of my favorite places for brunch! Milk & Honey has some very delicious plates that I frequently catch myself craving. After trying the entire brunch menu, the Breakfast Panini and Huevos Rancheros have prevailed as my two favorites. The pancake recipe intermittently changes so there are yummy pancakes to try every season. Also, I am no granola connoisseur but their product is one of the best I've ever tried. One star deducted because the quality has decreased over the years. While I am not certain whether the fresh squeezed orange juice was always fresh squeezed, I am certain they now pour Costco's Valencia orange juice for three dollars a cup. Service may vary from day to day. But from my personal experience, the waitresses have been nice and accommodating. Milk & Honey is small and often crowded. Yet the waitresses are able to promptly seat guests and get food out pretty quickly. Even on the busiest weekends, the wait never exceeds half an hour. Overall, a hip place for brunch. A touch more expensive than the traditional brunch joint but worth the price and wait!
