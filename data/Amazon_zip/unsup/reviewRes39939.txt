After months of friends raving about Longman & Eagle and telling me I has to go, I finally went. The food was very good, a lot of it cooked to perfection.  Really appreciated that the vegetarian entree option didn't include portobello mushrooms (a pet peeve). I was super turned off by the service, though. Our waiter was condescending and a total upseller. He told us we needed to each order 2-3 small plates and an entree each (there were 7 of us). He also told us we needed to order everything at once because the kitchen needed to pace the food. Funny, we waited more than 15 minutes between our small plates and our entrees. Decor and ambiance was great, I would've given it another star of two if it hadn't been for our server.
