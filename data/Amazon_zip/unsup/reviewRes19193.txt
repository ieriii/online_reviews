If you don't mind the touristy location, the Gage is a great place to stop for lunch when you're in the Loop on the weekends.  The BF & I were walking around downtown, looking to nosh on some food before heading off on our shopping excursion. Because the Shamrock Shuffle had just ended and it was a freakishly warm 86-degree day on a Sunday, restaurants all around the area were really really busy...meaning at least an hour-long wait. We headed to The Gage, where we were told that the wait for a table was going to be 10-15 minutes. Jackpot! We sat at the bar and ordered drinks, deciding to just eat there instead of waiting for a table. The house poutine was just as delicious as I remembered it to be...cheesy, meaty, saucy. It is seriously the most delicious drunk or sober food ever.  The BF ordered the fire-roasted chicken, which had Frank's Hot Sauce all over it. You can never go wrong with Frank's. I had the roasted woodland mushroom sandwich with truffle aioli. I'm usually a carnivore but this mushroom sandwich was AWESOME! The mushrooms were nice and meaty and filling. I definitely recommend the sandwich. No wait, delicious food at the bar with our cold beers...perfect meal at The Gage.
