SOOOO GOOOD!! We had pepperoni with tomatoes and spinach. I was already done by the second slice! That's how thick they are! lol. Also because we ordered their calamari, lol. which was btw, outstanding! Almost as good as Maggiano's Little Italy. Only thing was that we had an HOUR wait since this place was very popular. But the wait was definitely worth it! LOVE GIORDANO'S!!
