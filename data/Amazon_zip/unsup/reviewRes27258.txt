Great place with really different Mexican food. Don't get me wrong, I like regular Mexican food from a couple of joints around here but this was nothing like that and delicious.  I enjoyed the assorted appetizer plate we got, it seemed really big yet we ate all of it. I had the best Carne Asada of my life and then we got Mexican strawberry shortcake and hot chocolate for dessert. I was stuffed. One of the perks of being married to a Spanish teacher, she will take you to some great new Mexican places.
