My coworker told me to go here. So I took his advice. The steak here is fabulous. The meat comes sizzling in butter to your table. It's still sizzling. You do smell a little like meat after it, but it's so tasty. It was the best steak I had.  Very fancy. Nice atmosphere and a great waitstaff.  Also, the extras are great too. We ordered the mashed potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus was the best ever too. For regular mashed potatoes, they were excellent.  Everything seemed to melt in my mouth. If you love steak, you must come here and enjoy theirs.
