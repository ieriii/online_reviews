Consider this; Yelp does not have a rating system for food, atmosphere, and service. It is all combined into one. This serves the purpose and should; to measure the overall experience, experienced at a particular establishment. This explains the Three Star rating I gave the Purple Pig. The wine, delicious. The cheese followed suit. However I find it painful to pay triple+ the amount for a piece of cheese I can purcahse from Pastoral (one of my favorite places). I understand that restaurants have to make money, and there is a mark up. I know this. However to justify a mark up, in return I expect good service and an appropriate atmosphere. Note the three star rating. Here are my issues. Waiter, I understand you work at a wine bar, and therefore you should be/ are very knowledgeable about wine and cheese, it is your business. I work in IT and I know about the products I sell. BUT... Never do I give am arrogant and pretentious impression to my customers. Am I wrong to rely on my server for advice on what wine and cheese to select? I do not expect to feel embarrassed, and uncomfortable for my lack of the wine and cheese selection at the Purple Pig. Please do not feel bothered by my questions. My other issue is the atmosphere. I like the lighting, dcor is nice fits well. However noise level was too loud. I could not communicate with my girlfriend across the table without yelling. And I also did not care to listen to the guy next to me boast to his date, about his trip through Europe. I would recommend going here, but with a large group of people. Not an intimate setting (not implying that is how it is advertised).
