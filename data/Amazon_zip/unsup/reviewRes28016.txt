I would come here for the black beans and mashed potatoes alone. I can just see it: I'm having a bad day at work, work is finally over...I wander over to Frontera, grab a seat at the bar and just order some sides of black beans and mashed potatoes. Oh the joy that would bring (FYI: full menu is available at bar, wait times for tables can be INSANE. I suggest finding a party of 5 or more and making a reservation.) I heart Frontera. The appetizer sampler (cheesy quesadilla pockets, taquitos, ceviche, guacamole and jicama salad) is SPLENDID. I ordered wrong (for me) this time since I don't really like goat cheese and my tamale was filled with it (my fault entirely. If you like goat cheese, that black bean tamale is for you). I sampled a duck entree and it was delicious. Only one sad note: dessert this time was a bit disappointing. Nothing was truly great. But I do recall on the last trip the dessert was good. Remember, menu is always changing....
