Upon entering Sunda I thought perhaps it was too large a room to have any kind of "intimate" dining experience. But, the attentiveness of our waiter and the staff helped get me past that first impression. The menu is fabulous with so many choices that I will have to go back to experience more. My guest and I were both quite pleased with our choices. And, we were well taken care of throughout the duration of our visit...which was lengthy considering we had a lot to catch up on. We were made to feel welcome to stay and enjoy the experience. I thought it was a bit pricey, but was not disappointed in any way.
