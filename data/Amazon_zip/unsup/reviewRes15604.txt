As a healthy eater, this place was NOT very accomodating. I only asked if they could substitute another vegetable instead of potato. I got the "evil eye" and ended up with potatoes anyways. Their "Pollo" dish was very greasy too. Service was alright, nothing spectacular. The ambiance, music and decor are GREAT. A great place to bring your tourist friends.
