Hey, thanks Yelp! I would have never known about this place without you... ok, that's not true, I would have known about it, and kept driving by, again and again totally unaware of the deliciousness inside. I had some delicious mahi mahi and my fiance (oooh first time I'm using that in a review!) had the all you can eat crab legs. My mahi mahi was terrific. But, if you love crab legs, get that-- it's a great deal.... there are some downsides, they make you work for the meat (unlike, say Shaw's which cuts open the legs and pretty much feeds you), he didn't get a cracker, so that slowed him down on the crab consumption. But, the crab is fresh and delicious and they use real butter for dipping (unlike Cy's!)  I wish we had saved room for dessert-- they have Hoosier Mama pie... however, the competitive eating of the crab legs didn't make that possible.
