Every once in a while, you get a huge craving for pho, so I asked around and Tank came up more than few times! So of course, I had to go and try it out! The service is quick, restaurant is packd with people, but not uncomfortable and the food comes in large portions! the pho comes out steaming hot with a plate of veggies and optional hot sauce! The soup is flavorful and prices are very reasonable! It was a satisfying meal and I will definitely be back for more!
