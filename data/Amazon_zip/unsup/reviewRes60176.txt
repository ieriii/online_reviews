I love pho and wanted to try banh mi again. We got the beef brisket and bible tripe pho, it was a big bowl of broth but not enough noodles or beef for my liking. Very fragrant and delicious, though. For the banh mi we got the coconut curry chicken, which I was disappointed to find out was not in sandwich form. The French bread came uncut, and we ended up just ripping up chunks of it and dipping it in the curry. Not the sandwich experience I wanted; probably my own fault for not knowing better. The plum bubble tea I ordered didn't taste like plum at all - it was just a purple sugary drink. It tasted like bubble gum ice cream, which would be good if it's what I was looking for.
