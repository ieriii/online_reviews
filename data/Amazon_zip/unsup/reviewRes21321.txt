Got take out from here the other day. At 3:00 p.m., it was busy, but no line. The guacamole and short rib red chile soup were both amazing and traveled well all the way back to the burbs for dinner with the fianc. The soup reminded me of really yummy tacos al pastor. The torta we were not as fond of, though I'm sure this is partially due to the travel time, even though I did re-heat it in the oven. Definitely looking forward to trying more, hopefully eat in next time!
