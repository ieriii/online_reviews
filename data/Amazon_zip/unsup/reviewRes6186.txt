Knowing that Wildfire is something of a chain, I tried really hard to not like it. But I just can't. The food is amazing. From the warm bread to start onward everything is top notch. I've had fish, steak, and prime rib (my pick as best) and all were superb. Their mashed potatoes are creamy and delicious. And don't overlook the nightly specials. One night they had green beans in balsamic vinegar roasted in their wood oven as their vegetable special and I still have dreams about these beans a year later. What tops it all off is the service we had last night. I was there in a group of 10 and we made our reservation for a bit later than we probably should have to get where we needed to be. We explained our situation to our server and she told us she'd make sure we didn't miss our plans. She sped everything up without overlooking or rushing anything and got us out the door just as promised. A great experience.
