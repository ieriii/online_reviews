I'm sweating chicken grease, have the shakes, and can't stop licking my chops. I am coming off a serious chicken bender this weekend thus my withdrawal symptoms. I am embarrassed to admit that I ate Crisp's Seoul Sassy chicken twice in one day. I went for lunch with a friend because we'd both never tried the food but always heard great things. I ordered the half chicken with the Seoul Sassy sauce thinking that would be a lot of food and I'd take some home. I laugh at my naivety now because the thought of leftovers is just ridiculous. I inhaled all of that chicken. All of it. Since it was so good, and since I have limited self control when the discussion of dinner came up later and Crisp was thrown out again, I hesitantly agreed. Hesitant because I didn't want to go back there and let them know of my new Crisp addiction/problem! I needed a costume with a fake nose and mustache! This time however, I did not eat all of my food and really did have leftovers. Whew. The following day I ate KFC but that's a tale for another day because the star here is Crisp. After this weekend if the saying were true that you are what you eat then I'll cluck away and you won't have to ask why this chicken crossed the road- it was for more Seoul Sassy of course!
