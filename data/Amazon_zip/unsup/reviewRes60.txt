Best meal of my life. Nothing will ever come close, at least until I go to Next. ;) Words cannot describe the genius that one must have in order to pull of what Achatz et al are doing in a hidden spot a few blocks away from DePaul University. Upon walking through the Willy Wonka like entrance (was I having a flashback or was the room shrinking? ) what looked to be like an elevator door actually was the entrance to an experience like no other. We were welcomed.. A genuinely warm welcome and were whisked away to our little table. This is the 3 Michelin star restaurant that many can never replicate 100 times a night. The meal details? No way brutha, you'll just have to experience it yourself. I will say, you MUST fast before the tasting. I can stuff myself but this meal is not easy.    To end our night, around 1:30 am Achatz came out to our table, ( only ours ) painted our table top with a gorgeous edible work of art. Then, with a slight look of insanity, he lifted a volleyball sized ball of freshly made chocolate and slammed it on the table. It shattered and like a pinata, freshly prepared desert "candy" came out, cotton candy ect. It was a delicious work of art that, and ( thanks to the volume of wine ) looked like a drug deal gone bad. An abstract depiction with raspberry syrup splattered like blood, some stuff that looked like cocaine and enough pink and purple that gave it a post New Years South Beach VIP lounge appearance.
