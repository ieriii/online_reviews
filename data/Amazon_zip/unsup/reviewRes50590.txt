A Big Jones brunch had been on my list for ever and ever. Previously, I had only been here for dinner, which had to have been a couple years ago. On this occasion, I had a hankering for a burger, so the house ground beef burger was all mine. And it was some of the freshest meat I've eaten in a long time! So juicy, so tender. The burger was a little heavy on the garlic aioli though. I'm not too crazy about Cajun seasoned fries either, as they leave a MSG-y aftertaste in my mouth, but all the more room for dessert... ... which was red velvet cake! It's baked to order and takes about 20 minutes. Accompanied by toffee(?) brittle and housemade ice cream, this dessert was a winner. +100 on Open Table. +100 imaginary points for complimentary beignets too!
