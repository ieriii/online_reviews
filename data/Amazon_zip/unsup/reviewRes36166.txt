On the Northside of Chicago, this is the most authentic, closest to the Hong Kong bbq places I remember most fondly. Of course, this being Chicago, you only see mundane meats hanging in the front window, duck, pork, not the wider (some might say, horrifying) range of carcasses strung up in Hong Kong. I actually preferred the scary storefront they operated on Argyle, it chased off the crowds and the cowardly, but I was tipped off by the fairly large percentage of clientele who look Chinese or Southeast Asian who frequent Sun Wah, with obvious relish. I worry that the newer, nicer, Broadway digs might signal rising prices, being charged for extra rice, and lower quality, but so far it's all good. Call ahead to order your Peking duck, but also try any of the poorly translated Bok Choy dishes, the onion-ginger lobster or oysters, the stuffed eggplant (stuffed with what? never clear on this, maybe that's best), mai fun, and whatever you can't readily recognize that's being served to the Chinese family sitting near you (just tell the waitress you want some of what they're having). You know the kind of white people who can't share food, even at a Chinese restaurant? Don't bring them here.
