I have a new religion and its called Sultans Market. The menu is not huge but wow, everything was so amazing. I had the chicken schawerma (sp?) dinner. My friend had the lamb one. It is served on your choice of rice and I chose a mix of the two they offer which I would highly recommend. It was sooo much food for the money. For 3 people the bill was $24 and we ate like kings. We all had a dinner platter of some type. The only thing I wish I would of had was the smoked babaganoush instead of the hummus which was just ok. Also the pita was not as soft as I would have like. I will go back the next time I am in the Wicker Park area. I see they have one in lakeview too which is close to my job.
