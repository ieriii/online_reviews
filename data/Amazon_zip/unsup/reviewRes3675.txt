Being Korean myself and kind of a foodie, I think i make pretty good Korean fried chicken, but Crisp puts me to shame. Their plain Jane is really good. Not overly seasoned, lightly coated but very crispy and flavorful. I am a dark meat kind of guy, so I skip the full bird and just get the wings. If you are in the mood for sauce, I would get the Seoul Sassy followed by the bbq. Just be careful, since the bbq is a bit spicy, maybe they put Korean chili paste in it? The buddha bowls are pretty good too (just wished they gave you more chili paste than the small cup). Order it with beef!
