I've eaten at Irazu three times and each time has been fabulous. The outdoor patio area is lovely, the service has also been friendly and attentive, and the food never disappoints me. It's also conveniently a short walk from my house. HIGHLY RECOMMEND: The Vegetarian Burrito. It's around $5 and it's huge (and tasty). Potato Tacos. It also comes with rice, beans, and plantains. You will not leave hungry. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND: The Oatmeal Shake. You will not regret it. Sometimes the servers try to get to you to try a flavored version, but I personally think the original Oatmeal Shake is the way to go. BONUS POINTS: The prices are very reasonable The place is BYOB
