Well, friends, I visited Piece again for a birthday. Both of my previously tried pizzas were served: Chicken on white and pepperoni on red. I tried both and I have to stick with my original review. The chicken on white was a tasty treat! It's not the taste I crave when I suddenly want pizza, but it's a great specialty every once in a while. The pepperoni, for me, is too salty, but others in my party have proclaimed it their favorite pepperoni. The place was packed and service slightly slower than usual, but still very friendly. I might go back for karaoke soon.
