It was okay. Pretty crowded, had to wait about 20 mins to be seated with a reservation. Got hit in the head by a waiter with no apology. Their mojitos were okay yet pricey. The dinning room is nice and the service fast. I've definitely had better arrachera. The rice was so smokey tasting, not a fan. I ordered the yucca but wish I had not. It was like thick french fries. I tried asking the waiter before I ordered if they prepared the yucca any other way. I described how I was hoping to get it made, boiling it- like yucca con mojo. He kinda looked at me weird, acted like he knew what I was talking about. But he obviously did not. I was hoping for more of a Cuban influence. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again. I'm just use to homemade, authentic Latin food and if that's what you're looking for you can easily find better.
