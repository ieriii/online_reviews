I went last night for the first time (Wednesday April 14th) My review is mainly based on the service! We ordered: Oxtail Potstickers Hand Cut Spicy Tuna Sunda's Yellow Tail Jalapeno Sunda Rainbow Roll The Sunda's Yellow Tail Jalapeno came out first. It was tasty, fresh. It was unique to other places. Next came the Sunda Rainbow Roll, again presentation was great, fresh tasting, however nothing really special about it. An hour and a half passes (remember only having two items come to our table) and after ordering another glass of wine our waiter said he was going to come check on us again. He did come back and said "everything ok, can i get you anything else." I was confused, as was my friend. I said, "well you could get us the rest of the items we ordered?!" He said "oh what else was that" I told him and he goes "oh ok, yeah the kitchen is backed up, I will go check on those items" Who forgets half our food plus blames it on a slow kitchen?! Shortly after that happened some one else served us the Hand cut spicy tuna, again it was ok nothing special. Then a few more min. pass and another person, possible manager, comes over and ask what we are waiting for (pot stickers). Shortly there after we get the potstickers. (Potstickers were all very good probably the best item we ordered!). After we finished them, the waiter came by and gave us our bill. He said "oh by the way the potstickers were taken off" So it was nice they did take something off the bill, but the entire experience was not impressive. I don't remember an apology of any kind, although he may have said "sorry about the wait" at one point, it wasn't significant enough for me to feel better about it. Maybe it was his first night, maybe it was a slammed kitchen. I would have thought that would have been mentioned at some point during the hour and a half we were waiting. Overall the experience was just very weird and left a bad taste in my mouth.
