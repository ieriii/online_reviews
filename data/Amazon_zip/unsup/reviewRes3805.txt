thanks to yelp, i've found a great place for bi bim bop again. i used to get it at ricebox, which used to inhabit this space. after i accepted the fact that it closed, i reluctantly checked bi bim bop off my menu, cause from the name, i thought this place was one of those high priced salad bars! glad to get clued in my yelp that i was mistaken. so, their bi bim bop, which they call the baby buddha, is served with 4 vegs, cold, with a side of rice. have to admit, i like mine hot better, but it's great to have this healthy and tasty lunch choice again, close to work. the bonus is that i also love the seoul sassy- extra huge to the point of being mutant- chicken wings, and i love that they offer brown rice! and the guys who work here are easy to deal with, as well.
