Went in for lunch today. So nice and warm and dry, although I do admit the floor was pretty slippery. Had an excellent time. Service was so fast! I thought we had definitely been there longer than we had- such a nice repreive from a busy work day! Ordered the steak risotto. The tomatoes were the perfect touch to lighten up some stick to your ribs comfort food. You should go for lunch.
