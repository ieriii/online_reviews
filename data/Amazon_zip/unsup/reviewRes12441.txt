I went to Piece with the Windy City Pizza Club and had an ok time after having not been there for many years. I was very impressed with the wide selection of ingredients for pizza toppings and maybe had my hopes set a little high. While waiting I was able to enjoy a local stout called Roland. When the pizza came, though, I found it a little bland. The sauteed mushrooms and banana peppers were bland and did not taste very fresh. They did taste very oily and called out for oregano and crushed red pepper, which I have not had to resort to in a while. Piece is in a great neighborhood and has a great drink selection but I would think twice before coming back for food. Maybe I will check it out again in a other five to ten years.
