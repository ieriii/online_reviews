Pretentious? Maybe. Fabulous? Definitely. Although I live in the neighborhood, the Violet Hour is one of my favorite bars in the entire city. This is not a place to bring your group of 12 crazy friends looking to get Drunk with a capital D. Instead, its a quiet, muted atmosphere with thick drapes hanging and seats for all the patrons. All the drinks are $12 each, but very well worth it. The menu is divided into categories by spirit, and the bartenders are all extremely knowledgeable about their craft. They give excellent recommendations, and I would suggest sitting at the bar at least once to watch them create, mix and blend your drink. The line can be long (esp on the weekends) but the excellent service from the staff, relaxed ambiance and delicious drinks are worth the wait.
