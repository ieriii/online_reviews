There must have been a change recently as this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. We had a reservation for 830. Had to post $100 bond to get it, very annoying. We arrived at 8 and the place clearly had empty seats but they would not seat us. Fine. But they did not seat us till after 9. A very meek apology, but not a free drink. Service was ok I suppose. We waited a while for drink order. The a la carte selection was abysmal. Few choices and the annoying one word description. Pea, rice, etc. I suppose they are pushing the tasting menu but they seated us too late for that. The food, while good, not great, was microscopic. I got pea.....which was seriously perhaps 3 tablespoons of pea soup with a sprig of watercress. My chicken entree was 2 cubes of chicken, each one 2 inches by 2 inches by 1/2 inch. And watercress. I needed a pizza when I left.  Yuk
