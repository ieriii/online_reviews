Is it a bit pretentious? Absolutely. But, they know their alcohol exceptionally well. Even the drinks that we haven't liked were good, just not to our taste (and even then, they're happy to swap out a drink that doesn't work for you). The best alcohol experience of my life was drinking a 30 year old scotch. The second best was the Blue Ridge Manhattan at Violet Hour, and at $12 a drink, it's well worth it! And they're right by the Damen Blue Line stop, so you don't even have to worry about driving/parking! We waited an hour the last time we went with a friend who hadn't tried and while waiting we regaled him with tales of high backed chairs, fresh ingredients and fancy ice. He wasn't buying it BUT by the end of the night he was a convert.
