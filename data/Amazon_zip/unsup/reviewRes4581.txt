The purple pig is amazing and eclectic I love it! It is great European food with a modern chic twist I took my grandparents here on out trip to Chicago and though it was very crowded (unfortunately they don't take reservations hence the 4/5 stars] everything you eat there is going to be top notch and the waiters and waitresses are wonderful as well; over all great place to eat when not crowded.
