You have to be a lover of thin crust pizza to appreciate Piece. My husband and I went there on a Sunday afternoon so we were able to get a seat right away. Our waiter was friendly and helped my husband get a good beer. The flavor of the pizza was good but I definitely would have preferred a pan pizza. There just wasn't space for a lot of toppings so it was a bit skimpy. The chocolate chip cookies for the sundae was definitely burned. My husband thought the beer was awesome though. Would go to again though, it's a good hangout spot with friends
