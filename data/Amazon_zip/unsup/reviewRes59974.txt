This place is no longer the food-focused, quaint red and green steakhouse that was across the street. When we revisited this restaurant with some ex-Chicago residents, all of whom originally loved this place, we were surprised at the differences. Right when we arrived, the hostess told us Las Tablas is no longer BYOB for beer, so our beer had to be kept at their bar. She told us that you can BYO wine but, as others commented, there is a small corkage fee of $8. If they are trying dissuade BYO and boost their bar sales, they should get rid of that option entirely. However, some might like the option. Considering that the corkage fee would almost double the price of any wine I would bring, it might be better to get drinks from their bar. The hostess then charged us a $5 cover to get into the restaurant. Apparently Las Tablas has a band after 9 and they charge patrons a cover if they arrive after 9 looking to eat dinner. This may be something that they do only on the weekends, but it was definitely the first time we have been charged a cover for a restaurant. Well, we were seated next to the band and when they began to play our table discussion ceased. They were good, but loud--not really the atmosphere to catch up with visiting friends. I agree with the other comments, they still have decent food and good service, but their atmosphere has morphed into something more commercial. The bar option and the cover charge expanded the total cost of our restaurant experience and the band took away our ability to talk to each other. The quaintness of Las Tablas has suffered because of their expansion.
