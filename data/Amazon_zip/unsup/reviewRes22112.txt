meh. i was disappointed after ordering take out twice in one week. 4 stars and 900 reviews? i just dont think so, bro. my first time i ordered a load of food with a friend at my hizzy. we had a http://seamless.com discount so we kinda went nuts.  guac and chips 2 empanadas (one chick, one cow) 4 steak tacos 1 steak tostada horchata the only thing i really liked was the beef emp. everything else was bland and i was definitely unimpressed. the horchata was okay, but watery, which i hate. my friend said the tostada was good, but nuttin' spesh. the green salsa is effing hot as hell. good, but insanely hot. there's not much you can do with that. i dont want to pour fire down my throat. 2nd time, i ordered with coworkers for our free, once-a-mo lunch spectacular. not my choice to order from here. i got another empanada, but this time, and i swear i'm not a lunatic, it had cilantro in it. 4 days before, no cilantro. i can't stand that stuff. so, insert sadface here. i also ordered the pepito (chick) sammy, which was bland and underwhelming. it's coined "Chicago's favorite!" on the menu. favorite what? Chicago's Favorite Mediocre Sandwich in Bucktown? so, dont waste your time here. maybe head over to 90miles instead.
