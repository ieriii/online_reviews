Good food (not great), but poorly managed. I'm Greek and grew up in my family's diner/ restaurant/sports bar, but when my wife and I walk in there at 2:30pm on a Sunday and they've done their last seating, I have to draw a line there. You just don't do that. The last thing you want to do as a restaurant is make someone feel small or stupid. I could go visit my parents for that. Additionally, I lived across the street for a while and would get a kick out of the people waiting in the snow with their coffee. Part of me admired their patience, watching from my window, and the other part felt sorry for them.   I'm not saying the Bongo Room are bad people. I guess I just don't get it.
