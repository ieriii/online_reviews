Love it! At first there was some confusion about the dining deal that we wanted to use but it seemed to be just a miscommunication on their part, which was made up for with great service once we got there. We each got the combination plate which was great--tons of food and you get to try something like five different things (2 meats and 3 sides). They aren't lying about the Sangria either--it is some of the best I've had! We were a little skeptical because there were some bad reviews on here from a few years ago--whatever the glitch was, it seems like they've fixed it.
