I liked the old building better, but am glad to see that Gino's is back in its Superior location. Service is spotty, and it takes a long time for the pizza to be prepared. It's worth the wait. Order a goddamn appetizer (fried ravioli, anyone?), be patient, and enjoy conversing with your friends (if you have any). On to the pizza. Love the cornmeal crust! Order a pizza with sausage patty (not crumbled, for fuck's sake). The sausage patty is the size of the pizza! Fresh mozzarella cheese!  Awesome sauce!  You can't go wrong by going to any of the other pizza places in Chicago (Uno was outstanding, even!), but Gino's is my favorite.
