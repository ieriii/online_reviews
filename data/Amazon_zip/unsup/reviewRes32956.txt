I'm a huge falafel fan and this place is one of my favorites in Chicago. I came here for the first time on a date. The date was alright but the food was awesome. Although I never went on a second date with this person I've been back to Sultan's several times since. So thanks Mediocre Date-I think Sultan's and I will have a long and happy relationship :-) In additional to the falafel I've tried the shwerma, rice curry and lentil soup. All pretty yummy. They have a diverse menu, so vegetarians, vegans and meat eaters alike can happily enjoy a meal together. Pros: Cheap, friendly, fast, tasty, decent portions, byob and the patio. Cons: Cash only-a silly quibble I know but I did want to mention it so others will be prepared should they choose to go. However, there is an ATM in the restaurant.
