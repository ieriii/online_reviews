What can I say. I love, love LOVE this place! Doesn't get better than this. Excellent service, on point decor, a little pricey but completely worth it. Great place if you're an out of towner looking for a nice restaurant in Chicago. Also great to bring friends, family and that special someone if you're trying make an impression. Portions are a bit on the large size but you get what you pay for. If you can't finish, you can always take home a doggy-bag. The deserts are ordered prior to eating entre why?...because they are baked fresh! This includes the devilishly intoxicating fresh baked box of cookies, the binets, apple pie (I seriously recommend going a-la-mode) or anything else on the menu.  And yes, I will be going back when I visit this summer!!!
