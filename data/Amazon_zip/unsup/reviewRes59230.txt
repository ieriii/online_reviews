My absolute favorite hole-in-the-wall Chinese place.A little intimidating when you walk in because it can be confusing who you're supposed to be giving your order, but you'll get over it.Most everything I've ever had there is authentic and reminds me of home. They'll even make dishes upon request. I usually get Pan Fried Noodles with Char Siu and Chinese Broccoli...which is not on the menu. Love the Curry Beef Stew over rice. I do have to say though, the roast duck is just okay. I've had better. Sometimes I wonder how they're able to make a profit. I have to work very hard to order more than $12 worth of food so that I can use my debit card.
