I had been craving Indian food for some time and decided to order in to my hotel. I ordered the Light mixed grill, a side of green (mint) chutney, and a jaipuri paratha. The food arrived perfectly - the chicken and fish were tender and hot, vegetables were crispy and fresh. The dhal was amazing - it was so flavorful and spicy. This was an unexpected surprise. Needless to say, I was extremely satisfied with my meal. The portions were generous and everything exceeded my expectations (particularly for a delivered meal). Next time I'll try dining in.
