There were lots of favorable reviews. We gave it a try. What can I say? No, no, no. Do not go. Yes, the portions were enormous and it was inexpensive. If that's all that matters, pig out. Otherwise, listen up: Tasteless, bland food. Neither food or dining area was aesthetically pleasing in any way. The place smelled like a mix of grease & heavy duty cleanser. The only positive thing I can say is that the staff was professional & knowledgeable. What's with the 4 and 5 star reviews??
