I ate here 2 years ago, so the relevance might be a little off, and the food 2 years stale, but back in the day it should have been called G-R-A-H-A-M E-L-L-I-O-T. That's right, I just deconstructed his name. BAM! That's because when I went there, he had a deconstruction fetish (hopefully no porn like that) ... and it was delicious. My friend got a deconstructed Reuben and dessert was a deconstructed snickers (Imagine a layer of roasted nuts, with a layer of rich caramel, and some dark chocolate drizzled on top ... mmm). I forget what I got, but it wouldn't have mattered much because the free garlic popcorn was already good enough. BONUS PARAGRAPH: Apparently from reading some reviews on the right, there's a huge controversial Yelp battle going on. It's a good thing I went two years ago when he was still on vinyl.
