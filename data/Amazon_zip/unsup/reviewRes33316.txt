Quite a pleasant Friday evening. There was live music (a tribute to Maria Tanase) and everyone seemed to be in good spirits, even in the dulls of March. The staff was very friendly, and the owner Branko really makes you feel at home. I've long wanted to try Romanian food, and my first experience here did not disappoint. I've heard that it can get greasy and be too filling, but the mamaliga (soft polenta with crme fraiche and feta), short rib goulash, and strudel cu mere (apple) I ordered were extremely comforting, and not the slightest bit too heavy. The portions are really the perfect size. Not indulgent, but enough to satisfy end of the week cravings. The goulash was seasoned especially well, and the apples in the strudel tasted distinctly fruity. Romanian cuisine is definitely worth the try, and Little Bucharest provides a nice romantic location in which to enjoy it.
