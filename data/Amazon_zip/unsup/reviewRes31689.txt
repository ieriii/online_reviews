Delicious food! Fairly priced! Fast service.. nice atmosphere. The Chicago Diner is always busy but that's a good thing! :) People love it there. Whether you eat meat or are a full-out vegan [like myself], you are bound to find something scrumptious here to eat - such as the veggie "gryos" or "chick'n wings." My favorite things are the vegan milk shakes! Even my non-vegetarian family members go here for lunch and dinner!
