Simply off the charts. My only regret is my first visit here was for weekend breakfast. Which at Glenn's means we could not order off the "chalk board", mostly seafood dishes that sounded fantastic like halibut with blue cheese horseradish sauce.  These items only available after 3pm on weekends. What we did have was still amazing. A shrimp po boy with homemade tarter, avocado, bacon, tomato, and onion. The french bread it came on was thin and allowed for all the sandwich flavor to come out. One of my favorite sandwiches ever. The crab cake benedict was also very good. Every thing homemade from the sauce to the crab cake. If that wasn't enough the potato pancake that accompanied each dish was the best i have every had. Quickly pan fried and bursting with fresh flavors. I cannot wait to go back. A must do in Chicago.
