I had been looking forward to my visit to Chicago, mostly because I was promised my first trip to Hot Dougs. It lived up to everything I'd heard, and surpassed my wildest hopes. We got there early, waited outside in the freezing cold and had smiles on our faces the entire time...and not because they were frozen in place. Although the specials change often, here's a suggestion: Duck Fat Fries (only available Friday and Saturday!) Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Pork Sausage with Vodka-Cream Marinara and Burrata Cheese The Mountain Man (a damn tasty combination of Elk, Antelope, Venison and Buffalo) with Blackberry Mustard and Goat Cheese Pork and Duck Confit Sausage with Sweet Garlic Mustard, Duck Rillettes and Balsamic-Truffle Drizzle Swedish Potato Sausage with Dill-Garlic Mustard and Caraway Havarti Cheese Doug will shut the shop when he goes out of town, so call first to make sure he's open. Shop accepts cash only and the hours are 10:30-4; no matter what time you head there, be prepared to wait outside in line. But it's worth it!
