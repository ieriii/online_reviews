Holy Mackerel Batman! Its the Xanadu for all gastronomes. A great olive oil, cheese, balsamic vinegar selection and a killer bakery with artisan breads. If I lived in Chicago I would sublet a corner of this place and stuff my face with all of their yummy high quality goodies. Its not for the faint of pocketbook, but worth the weekly splurge.
