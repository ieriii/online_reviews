Go to Melting Pot........... More bang for your buck. They short you on meat/chicken/fish here and at the Melting Pot you at least get to pick from multiple different kinds of cheese and chocolate. There is no varity here. It is nearly impossible to walk in this place as it is so tightly packed.  Melting Pot is much more romantic. I will not be coming back here ever.  Did I mention they are unable to even make a decent martini?
