Went there again last night - this joint never dissapoints. Good honest old fashioned Mexican food at rock bottom prices. It's not flashy or fusiony, just the same stuff you would get in food stalls in Mexico City. The place is always packed, and you almost always have to wait anywhere from 5 - 20 minutes for a table, but the wait is worth it. It is BYOB, which is even more attractive. I have had the fajitas, the puerco a la Mexicana, the Carne Asada con Tampiquena, plus the brunch food too. The only thing marginally dissapointing was the puerco - which had small bones in it that made it tricky to eat, since it was a stew and hard to see the bones. Very tasty though, despite the bones. My friend swears by the mole there, so if you like mole sauces, theirs' if definitely worth a try. For appetizers, in my opinion there is too much sour cream on the nacho dishes, so I order them without. They are excellent though. Also, the queso con chorizo is unbelievably good - be warned though, it's greasy, however I don't know that it is possible to make this dish "ungreasy"! We never have enough room for dessert so I can't comment on their sweets! Service is efficient and pleasant.
