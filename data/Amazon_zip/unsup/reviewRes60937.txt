I stopped in for a glass of wine and a cheese plate while visiting from Wisconsin. I've been there before, but not for a few years; the vibe was very different than what I recall. Less trendoid, more serious, is how I would describe Bin 36 today. The wine was a Portuguese red, and it was solid. It was a very traditional, classic red, exactly what you'd get from your old friend when you visited his home in Lisbon. It was comforting and familial, and had a casual, welcoming feel. I liked it a lot.The cheese, recommended by the server, was a knockout. I've never had anything quite like it. It was a bleu, from so-called 'Bleu Monde' Wisconsin (uh, this is Blue Mounds, WI, West of Madison), but the kicker was the rind. The cheese was good, unusually so, but the rind, after tasting, filtered back into my sinuses and created the precise SMELL of a gorgeous day in rural Dane County! It was crazy and unique. I had a chicken appetizer, which was above-average, but for me overshadowed by the delightful cheese and cozy wine. The space is a little impersonal, maybe a little dated; and it seems the management is shooting for less trend, more... institution, I guess you'd say. After several years restaurants have to make that choice, and Bin 36 seems to be going for respectability rather than flash at this point. And that's fine with me. It's now the kind of place you'd take your fiance's parents, or a visiting friend with some class; or a serious date. Hah! I think if you took a date for this combination and didn't get laid, it'd be your own fault.
