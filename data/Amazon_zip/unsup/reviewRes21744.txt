Not all it's cracked up to be. Not sure what value the wood oven adds to the sandwich, but it wasn't apparent to me. Food was ok, but found a bone in my sandwich. Not acceptable for a restaurant of this stature. NOt sure it's worth the long wait in line. Go to any of the small, independent mexican restaurants in Chicago and you'll be much happier. Oh yeah, the churros tasted more like tortilla chips than real churros.
