Went for dinner a few weeks ago with some buddies. The duck entree was the best duck I have ever had. I'm a big fan of duck but very few places get it right and this place perfected it. I was with a couple friends and they all really liked what they ate too. I definitely want to go back and try some of the other entrees. If you like duck though, you have to try it here.
