I brought an out of town friend in to Lao Sze Chuan for hot pot, and it was not good.  1) Terrible service: It took 15 minutes to get our check. At one point I flagged down every server inside of 2 minutes, and half of them ignored me or looked away when they caught my eye. Even the person who looked like the manager passed our table three times and gave me nothing but a rude look when I asked for the check. 2) The service is inconsistent. The sauces they served for dipping were not the same at every table. 3) And after $100 for hot pot for three, it just wasn't that tasty.  I'm not coming back.
