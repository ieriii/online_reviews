I've had just about everything on the menu. I used to live closer to it and would go about once per week. The people that work there are real cool and the food is unreal. The wings are great but I usually go with the Seoul Steak Bowl with some atomic sauce on the side. For some reason the seoul steak bowl, beers, my couch, and football go extremely well together.
