Graham Elliot is a cool restaurant. I took my foodie parents here and everyone enjoyed their meal. However, there was one minor disappointment We were given a truffle/parmesan popcorn appetizer that sounds great, but in reality the popcorn was stale or too wet. Other than that minor deviation we enjoyed the "experience". GE is one of those places where the meals are pretty challenging. We had a cuttlefish linguini that challenged our pallets and I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. The consensus amongst us was that it should taste good, therefore it does... This is the problem with a place like Graham Elliot, the food can be challenging and delicious. So, I wouldn't come here if I was just looking for a great meal. Come to GE if you want to be adventurous and try something new. The meal will always be fun and interesting.
