If Hopleaf were in Wrigleyville or Lincoln Park, the place would be dominated by college-aged kids (or those just-out-of-school kids who think they're still in college). Thankfully, it's not! For me, it's worth going a 25 blocks north to go to Hopleaf. The beer selection is unrivaled -- sorry, kids no $5 Miller Lites bottles here -- just a lot of great Belgian beers on tap and a HUGE selection of bottles from all over the world. Everything I've ever had on the menu is outstanding, particularly the Belgian-style mussels (I know, I'm not the first to say that.) Whenever I'm there I look at other people's menu selections and want to try it all -- even my bf's wild boar stew, which is something I would not ever try in a million years. Hopleaf is a great place to go for the beer or stay for the food -- or even go for the food and stay for the beer. Either way, it's a win-win situation!
