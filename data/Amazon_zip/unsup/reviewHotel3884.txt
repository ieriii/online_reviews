This is a large old hotel that still retains its old school "charm" or lack of repair, however you want to call it. It sure could use some new wallpaper and carpeting for example. Having said that, the bed was very comfortable and the location is great. The bathroom was a bit small and could have used a few more shelves but otherwise it was fine. We went for a wedding here and they did a great job with the wedding. Both the ceremony and the reception rooms were beautiful and private. The convention rooms were on the other side of the hotel so the guests enjoyed the entire wedding area to themselves. They made good drinks.
