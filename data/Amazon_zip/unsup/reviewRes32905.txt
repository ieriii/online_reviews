Sunda is an unreal experience all around, the ambiance is sleek and warm, obviously with eastern influences, yet very trendy. The food is so delicious and innovative. Each thing I've tried, I did a tasting menu and a la carte- is delicious. The fish/ produce/ flavors are clean, fresh, and entice you to keep wanting more. Portions are generous, enough to share and at the same time petite. I love the creative cocktails, need to go back and try some more. This is definitely my favorite new restaurant in Chicago! It's the perfect place to have dinner to see and be seen, beginning to a great and long night out, or date for two. HUGE points to any man who brings a lady here, depending on her taste level, there's no way any woman wouldn't appreciate Sunda. In short, I went here for my birthday, it was by far the best time at a restaurant with a larger party (Of my choosing) I've ever had! Highly, highly recommend this one.
