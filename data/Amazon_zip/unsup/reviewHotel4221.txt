I'm staying at this hotel for four days. My first impression as I walked in was "awesome" but when I checked in, the room is terrible. Mine has stained that looks like blood, cigars and the room smelled like smoke, even though it's a non-smoking room. My parents room was so small and stuffy. My friends room were small and stained as well. When I asked the front desk if we can switch, their answer is no. This is not a great hotel to stay in. Trust me. Howevee,It's a great place to hangout at the bar, relax and chill.
