Always a consistently good choice in this area. We stopped by the other night after an event at the Harris theater. We were seated immediately and our server was quick to bring us our drinks. I had the Fish and Chips and my friend had the burger. Both were excellent . . .and when more friends came to join us- we moved our larger group to the main bar area and everyone accommodated us by moving our food and drinks. Service is always spot on and I just love the ambiance of the place.  Know that if you want valet parking- you have to go around the corner to the University Club on Monroe. Or just park under Millennium Park and come up from the underground garage right in front of the place. The Gage gets my business again and again!
