Well executed tapas with fresh ingredients, great service, and trendy atmosphere. I would say the best tasting tapas in Chicago. If you don't mind very pricey small dishes with great atmosphere and service, try out Mercat a la Planxa. Note you won't end up full here for less than 40 per person though! Mercat is located in the Blackstone hotel and I am not even sure if there is an entrance to Mercat from inside the hotel itself.  There is valet parking that is less than $15 on Balboa. The main entrance to Mercat is on Michigan. If you can, get one of the 3-5 tables on the upper level.  It is quieter up there and you get to overlook the rest of the dining room. If you can get seating in the upper level, it is a VIP dining experience.
