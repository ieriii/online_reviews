A really fun place to go with a large group. They're usually packed, but that's part of the fun. The beer is good, the Eugene Porter is my favorite. They also have a Hugene Porter that will send your night into a tailspin. I don't like their ales quite as much but nothing is bad. The food in my opinion is very average, although I've had many people dispute me on this. I've gotten their pizza and it came out a little cold. I've also had some desserts there and they weren't very good, especially not for the price. Go to drink, that's what breweries are for. The restaurant is huge, and the bar has woodworking of their clenched fist logo that is really badass. The bar goes 360 degrees around, and the bartenders are good about filling you up when you need another. I never need to hunt down a bartender at this place, they have great service. It's in Logan Square, the place is teeming with young people. Go and you will have a great time!
