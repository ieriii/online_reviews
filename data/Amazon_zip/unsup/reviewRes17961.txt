The first night I arrived in Chicago I had the pleasure of being invited to come and eat here. It was clearly packed and I was part of a large table. A bit cramped but I didn't complain due to the enormous aroma that was in this establishment. I was literally drooling from the aroma of the fresh food. This place is BYOB so my friends and I bought several bottles of wine to eat along with our food. We asked for the specials which varied from lobster ravioli, spinach gnocchi in a Gorgonzola cream sauce, another regular white gnocchi in a fresh tomato sauce.  We started off with the Bruschetta which had a different approach to it. It didn't have the traditional fresh basil leaf on top. It had actual small pieces of dry oregano on top of the mozzarella cheese cheese with a crostini that was crispy but not too dry. The tomato was also minced, not chopped that was nice because in one bite my tomato wouldn't fall off, haha. After the appetizer, I ordered the spinach gnocchi and it was super rich by means that the sauce stuck to the plate. The portions here are not too bad. The flavors are so stick to your rib, you have to have a to-go box. The creamy gorganzola cheese sauce was good but lacked just a bit of flavor, I prefered the one with the tomato sauce which was Super flavorful. The gnocchi was super good though, it was airy and fluffy. Tried a bit of my friends lasagna portion which was more than plenty and pretty delicious. The one I wasn't too fond of was the Lobster ravioli, which could have been the sauce that it was paired with, it almost clashed. However, my friend enjoyed it. If you must visit, please RSVP the place is super small. The staff is super accommodating and nice. Would definitely come back again.
