Being 100% not Mexican, sometimes it takes me a while to explore the menu and get a good feel for its authenticity. I have been to the Palace several times and tried most everything. The margaritas are a great complement to the enchiladas and the spicy, cilantro-y salsa is a great complement to the wonderful hospitality. Be sure to check out the patio out back in the summer. In all, be prepared for great Mexican.
