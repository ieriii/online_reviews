Food, 3-stars. (Except the mussels, which are really good and very plentiful for the price!) The rest of our meal was fine, but not exceptional - what they are trying to cook is priced right, but the flavor just doesn't measure up. Mac 'n cheese was pretty good, but had a slight burnt taste. Compressed melon salad had some interesting components, but was under-seasoned and didn't come together as a cohesive dish. Brisket had good smoke, but again not punched up in flavor. BUT, service was excellent; lots of seating options, from quiet/cozy to seen-and-be-seen; and the beer selection is phenomenal. Will definitely be back from drinks and maybe apps.
