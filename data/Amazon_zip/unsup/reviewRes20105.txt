Ahh...the elusive XOCO. Widely praised, always crowded and home to an apparently famous chef, Rick Bayless. Obviously, I had high expectations. Sadly, they were not met. I ordered the Gunthorp Chicken Torta (wood-roasted red chile chicken, pickled white onion, black beans, avocado, tomatillo salsa) and my dining companion the Milanesa Torta (crispy Gunthorp chicken, black beans, artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa) . My complaint: lacking chicken and beans; the sandwich was mainly bread. My friend's complaint: greasy. Now, don't get me wrong - I ate the majority of my sandwich. But it was just that: a sandwich.
