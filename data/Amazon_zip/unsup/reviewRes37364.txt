Hopleaf certainly has the best beer selection in Chicago, of this I have no doubt. They're always rotating there plethora of tap beers (though most stay the same) yet they always obtain new ones, a remarkable feat by any standard!  A selection of Belgians second to none. A really great food menu as well (try their mussles, best I've had not on the east coast). A wonderful bar with wonderful beers. What more could one ask for. And I hear people complain of their prices; they are wrong, for such great beers, their prices actually are quite on the low side, I find myself spending the same amount at Simon's for a much less worthy brew. So what else could one ask for?
