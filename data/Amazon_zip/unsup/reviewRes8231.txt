Great place and in walking distance from my home! Sometimes we had had to wait but never too long! During warm weather outdoor seating is a big plus and their expanded dining room has really cut down on wait times. The greeters are always friendly and the owner is quite welcoming. If there are long waits for a table, he usually brings out something yummy to nibble on. We typically get a salad and two pizzas to share. I have never had room for dessert so I can't rate those but the tartufo I have seen others devour looks delicious! Their pizzas are terrific. They are not the overladden deep dish Chicago pizzas (whichI also love) but thin, slightly charred pizzas with fresh and flavorful toppings. You can get red (with a tomato sauce) or white (no tomato) pizzas with an assortment of both kinds on the menu and the special board. The staff are nice, attentive, and friendly. The rooms are spacious, well lit, and comfortable. I recommend this place!
