This is my first experience with Ethiopian Food and I loved it! Go for the lunch special! You get a plate with little mounds of your choice of meat or veggies with a side of injera (sour dough flat bread).  The set up is very earthy and pleasant. The service there was very good! The waitresses there are very sweet and kind. Food is prepared fast! The tea is very good!
