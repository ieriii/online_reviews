Had dinner here while I was in Chicago for the weekend. Very close to the Holiday Inn at the merchandise mart, walking distance. The concierge at the hotel recommended it, and I was definitely impressed. They were able to sit a group of 12 people within a matter of a few minutes, and the service was fast and friendly. The server was willing to explain everything on the menu to us, and when prompted even gave us her recommendations on what to eat and drink. The calamari appetizer was good, and worked for sharing with a few people. The rock shrimp risotto was fantastic, super rich and creamy. I had a glass of Chianti and Chardonnay with it that the server recommended, and she paired it wonderfully. For dessert we all split a platter of different dishes, and all of them were absolutely fantastic. Oh, best of all.....they split the bill for each person. I can't remember the last time that I got a restaurant to split a bill 12 ways. Fantastic service, I would definitely recommend it to others.
