yes yes and yes! I really enjoy this place, I have been going here for years, and its just always good food. I only one complaint that I have is that sometimes I have waited up to 2 hours to sit and eat. Why would I do that? Well cause the beer selection while waiting is worth it and so is the food. I suggest that everyone checks this place out at least once while in the city. Just go on a week night.
