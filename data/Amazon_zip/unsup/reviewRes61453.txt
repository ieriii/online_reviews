I have to say, this place has excellent indian food. I've been here on several occasions and every time I've come out full and satisfied with everything I ordered. Decor and ambiance is basically non-existent and the service is slow, but friendly. The waiter never came to check on us, so we had to go up to the register to find him every time we wanted something. When we first got there, we waited 10+ minutes in an empty restaurant to have our order taken and another 30+ minutes to get our food. But the food is worth the wait. Portions are big, vegetables are fresh, and the meat is spiced and cooked to perfection. Biryani, Chicken Tikka Masala, Gosht, and Naan were very very tasty. Price is great for the amount you get, and Lahore is open very late. Go for the food, not for the environment (in case your friends are really boring).
