Ok, ok, i know this is completely touristy. Why don't i just go to the cheesecake factory (which is actually owned by the same people)? Basically, I come for the salad. I really like the asian chicken salad, but I live for the southwestern salad. It's this ginormous salad with chicken, black beans, corn, avocado, tortilla strips, pepperjack cheese and this really yummy honey vinaigrette. I've tried to recreate it at home, but I just can't seem to get it right. There's nothing better than sitting in the rotunda room eating this salad.  The service is usually pretty good, but on the way up the escalator, they always ask me where i'm from (just proving how touristy it really is) and when I say Chicago, they can't seem to contain their surprise.  Oh, and never ever try to go here for brunch. The line is ridiculous and the food sucks.
