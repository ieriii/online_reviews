I was really excited to have dinner at The Purple Pig since it's menu is definitely off the beaten path and is highly rated. I have two primary complaints. First, the food is meant for sharing and are small plates. All of the orders came out at the same time and was not broken up well. Secondly, we asked for recommendations and all of the recommended food was fairly bland, which is hard to do with pork. One really good item was the spreadable pork liver. If you do choose to go. You should try it.
