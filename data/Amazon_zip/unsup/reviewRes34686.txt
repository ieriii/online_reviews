It seems that no matter which sushi spot I try, within any price range, I always go back to Sushi X wondering why I went anywhere else. The Honey Roll and Crab Rangoon Roll are hands down the best sushi rolls I've had. I love the fact that the place is tiny and they play anime on a projector at all times. They also have some great local artists' work displayed and for purchase.  Sushi X, you're my hero.
