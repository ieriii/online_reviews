NOT GOING BACK! The service was horrible and the wait time was too long for what was served. Our order was simple...only 3 items (2 beverages and an appetizer) yet we waited....and waited for it to arrive. We also had to wait for the check and then waited for the waitress to take the bill to get our change. Simply just not worth it! 90 miles can equal 90 minutes...so if you have the time & patience maybe this place might be for you.
