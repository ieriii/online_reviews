We were just walking by on a Tuesday night to check out the scene, and for fun we asked how long the wait was. The place was packed inside and out, so we were shocked when the hostess said she could seat us outside right away! Figuring it was a sign, we decided we might as well stay for dinner. The highlights of our meal were... - Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. This was the last of the dishes to arrive, but it was worth the wait!  - Roasted bone marrow. Delicious with the accompanying sea salt and vinegar cilantro and onion. Could've been improved with bread that wasn't smothered in olive oil. I would have been happy with toasted French bread instead. Nothing was to die for, so not sure if we'll be coming back for another Tuesday night dinner. But it would be fun to try again in a big group!
