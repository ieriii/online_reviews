WARNING: for those ordering carry-out after midnight, make sure to check your order before you head out. they tend to "forget" to add guacamole on any items that should include it. (chachos, super burrito, etc). during these times, they've lied to my face saying that they're out when I can easily see guacamole on the tables of those who chose to dine-in. i've continuously had to argue with the staff before they miraculously "find" more guac (or a substitute in the form of pico de gallo or a small horchata) . just because I've knocked back a few prior to arriving doesn't mean im an idiot. dont take your lack of tipping patrons out on me. Other than this minor caveat, this is my go-to for those late night burritos and/or nachos. The menu has a fair amount of selection, and the prices are fair for the portions you get. Im not sure where they get their carne asada, or what they do to it, but it has no equal in the Chicagoland area.  I've been to my fair share of late-night burrito establishments in my lifetime, but La Pasadita is only 1 of 3, that I can actually go to during the day (sober) and still enjoy the food served.
