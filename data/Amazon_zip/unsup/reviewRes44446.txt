There are different sushi spots for different times. Sometimes, you want to go all out. That's what Kaze is for. Sometimes you want something cheap and decent. That's what the grocery store is for. Ultimately though, you need a place that's awesome and not too pricey, but not too cheap. You want to go out, but you don't want to break the bank. You have to manage your craving and be satisfied at the same time. That's what Wakamono is for. Sometimes, there's a long wait. You need to avoid it at prime time on the weekends. But it's great. The Eda Mame are cold and tender. The ends are clipped off. They have the perfect ratio of salt to moisture. Try the steamed bass appetizer. It's amazing! The black bean / ginger garnish and the mild sauce are the perfect complement to the melt in your mouth texture of the bass. A lot of the rolls have tons of sauces, but I recommend getting them on the side and mixing it up with different ingredients. Get a simple roll like a tuna and avocado roll to cut the richness of your godzilla roll. Get some nigiri. It's generous and always tasty. Salmon is great, Albacore is great. Yellowtail is great. The rice is a little on the sweet side there, but it's still delicious. The service is decent, but nothing special. It doesn't matter though. It's solid. It's the perfect balance and it satisfies! Yum.
