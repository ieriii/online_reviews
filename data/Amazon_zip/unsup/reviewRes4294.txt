I would give this place 5 stars if I had gone on a night when they had live music or before the music ended. As it was I showed up around 1am and was entirely weirded out by the front of the bar being decked out in neon sides with a bunch of bikers outside. Not that I mind bikers, I just don't associate them with jazz. But once inside I was sold. Beautiful art deco decor. Amazing drinks. Actually this place gets the vote of best vodka collins I've ever had. $5 I believe and all three went down smooth and cool as they should on a hot summer night. But the search goes on! Chatted with two guys at the bar about real estate prices and then stumbled my ass back to my hostel, a little too drunk for a single out-of-town woman in a out of the way part of town without mace. Yeah, I've done some stupid shit but I've had fun and lived to tell about it. I'm hard core like that ;)
