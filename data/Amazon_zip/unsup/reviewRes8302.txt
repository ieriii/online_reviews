Pros: Pizza, Service, Location, Outside Patio, Parking Cons: Coffee, Pizza, Price With sufficient parking to be found Spacca Napoli is a throw back of old world Naples Italy. i didn't feel overwhelmed with the choices, simply because the menu only has a few great choices to begin with Learning that the bricks for the oven were imported from Italy really added a nice feel and touch to the place and the overall atmosphere is warm and inviting. Spacca has plenty of space with an outside patio for those great Chicago summer and fall days. The pizza IS real good and plenty for one person to really enjoy. The service is great and those serving are very willing to answer your questions. Now the CONS.  Coffee, Instant, Nestle? SERIOUSLY? I was shocked to find out this. For me, is quite appalling and probably a smack in the face to all Italians who really take their coffee seriously and to charge THAT much for instant coffee... not a good idea and not a good idea to tell me that it was instant....... UGH.... ALSO, while Spacca Napoli have some real tasty great pizza, it is the price that really keeps me away for the most. This is why it is under my cons as well. It is one of those places that, if I wanted to really treat myself and spurge money, this is were I will go. For those on a budget, STAY AWAY as you will easily spend more than $20 dollars on some pizza and drinks.
