I went to Sultan's market after seeing it on "Check Please" on TV. I was expecting so much more. Me and my wife were very disappointed. She had the salad bar, Jerusalem salad. The salad was watery and had very little flavor. I had the vegetarian platter. The bisamanti rice was a tad oily, the hummus had no flavor. In fact, I've had better hummus from Jewel. The falafel was average at best and the salad was watery. The lack of spices and flavor is quite amazing considering that it's the basis of this type of cuisine. I realized that this place is popular because most people in that neighborhood have never been exposed to descent Middle Eastern food. So if you have sampled Middle Eastern food before, do not go here!! I recommend Oasis on Wabash & Madison in Jeweler's row. Another negative, they don't accept credit cards.
