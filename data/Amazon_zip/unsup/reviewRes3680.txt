a must try! the chicken is tender, succulent and overall...so crispy! we tried all three versions and my favorite was the seoul sassy, but the bbq version has yummy spicy kick to it. the plain jane was excellent as well, a nice change from the limited chain of fast food fried chicken! fresh and right from the fryer. yum. there's a huge variety of food, but it's only a soft opening so not everything is available, but i can't wait to try the other dishes! cash only for the time being!
