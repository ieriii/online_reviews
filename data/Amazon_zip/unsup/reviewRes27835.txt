As R. Kelly would say, "Fiesta, Fiesta" I'm picky about my Mexican. This is, as most know, due to the fact that you can dine at places across all spectrums. And, dare I say - I do enjoy the "upscale" Mexican experience. I recently dined at Frontera with some co-workers and was blown away. The margaritas are just to my liking. Strong, salty, big, everlasting. We also got the guacamole - which was so great. I ordered the quesadillas ... which were something I've never experienced before. Delicious beyond belief. The menu was great - had a wide variety of traditional and contemporary Mexican dishes and I think any diner would love this experience. It can get quite crowded - call ahead & get a table beforehand.
