Am I crazy, my wife and I met my sister and her boyfriend at The Greek Islands on a Friday Night at 7PM when there was also a Blackhawks game at the United Center?  There are a lot of places you can go to in Greek Town, the food at least 4 other places has the same menu with some variations. I have been going on and off to Athena, Rodity's, Pegasus and Greek Islands for more years than I care to say... My choice to go back to Greek Islands was a good one. Despite being told there would be a 30 min wait, the wait was only about 15 mins, they were calling names about as fast as they call numbers for orders out at Portillo's. We had Saganaki, it was good,The waiter was an older Greek gent, he didn't flame it very well, but it still worked.  I really like the bread the serve at Greek Islands, better than some of the other places along Halsted.  Greek salad for the table was perfect. I had a combo plate, which is a good way to get a sample of different things. Gyros here, are great (as they should be) The veggie combo plate was a disappointment, order the vegetarian moussaka instead. (wife's meal) I had Galaktoboureko for dessert, (a Greek dessert of semolina-based custard in phyllo) It could of used some honey, but it was more than ample. The service was great, including the bus boy who was always there to take care of clearing plates or making sure water glasses were full.  Greek Islands is top notch and a good value.
