City Search calls this the best Sushi place in Chicago. I think they are full of it, but I am yet to find one that is really better. The food is overpriced and the place is always jam packed. I think they shrunk the portions down since they first opened as well. If you make an order for carryout be ready to weave through a swarm of a-holes as you try and make your way to the counter. I will still go there, but it is because there is not much else to choose from. Someone open up a better place in the same hood!
