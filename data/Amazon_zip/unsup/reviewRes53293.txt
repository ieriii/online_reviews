My wife and I had to try this Chicago culinary experience at least once. We had read up and knew of the long wait ahead of us. We should have suspected reasons to worry when the entire line (90 minute wait for us) consisted of no one over the age of 30. The establishment is doing well. They have a very tiny seating area with about 5 tables that can seat 4 - 6 people, about 5 2-seater tables, and a small bar seating area that can sit about 10. It doesn't matter if you're staying or getting things to go, you're waiting in the line the same as everyone else. The food is good, but it is just good. The hot dogs are nothing extraordinary, so sticking with the different sausages is recommended. However, for the extreme wait outside with no bar service or anything else to keep you occupied, we would have expected something I couldn't get anywhere else. The specialty here seems to be the variety of meats you can taste, but nothing special about how they are prepared.Summary, the food is good if you're willing to put in the wait. However, anything over a 20-minute wait is not worth it.
