The delivery estimate for my pizza was 45-60 minutes and it was closer to two hours. Once the pizza got here, it was lukewarm at best. On the top of that, the prosciutto they put on the pizza tasted like it had fallen off the back of a truck. Their pizza definitely has a lot of potential because the crust was very good. However, my experience was poor.
