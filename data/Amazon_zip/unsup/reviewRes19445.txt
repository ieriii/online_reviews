As I walk through the door at XOCO I had 2 thoughts 1st thought: This looks like a fancy Chipotle 2nd thought: Holy $#@! it's Rick Bayless! Wasn't expecting him to actually be at the restaurant, but I shouldn't have been surprised - he's such a nice guy! He seemed to be supervising, in between talking to customers in line that is :) I was off the mark thinking it was a fancy Chipotle, don't be fooled by the wire baskets and relaxed vibe. I had a rough time deciding what I wanted, it all sounds so delicious. I ended up getting chips + guac, Shortrib Red Chili soup, a shortbread cookie, and the Barcelona cocoa bean drink. I was hungry! Everything looked good, I don't think you can go wrong here. The soup was fantastic, and the meat melted as I took a bite. The shortbread cookie was a perfect desert, especially after I dipped it in the hot cocoa! Already planning on going back (literally, I'm going again tomorrow :)
