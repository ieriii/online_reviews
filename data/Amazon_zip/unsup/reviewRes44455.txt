It took me six months after I'd moved to the neighborhood to figure out this place even existed, much less what it was (small sign on the door). For a neighborhood brimming with little sushi joints, Wakamono did seem to be a little pricier but I didn't feel like it was excessive. The rolls were good, especially the sweet potato, and the dark, minimalist Asian decor added a nice touch. The corking fee actually didn't bother me since they do offer a full bar. Speaking of, the cocktails surprised me - well-made and interesting. We walked in through the small bar adjoining and made a mental note to return. I can see how it may get crowded on weekends, but if you live in the area, it's a solid neighborhood option that feels slightly hidden away on a pretty bustling stretch.
