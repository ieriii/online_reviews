Who would have known that next to the Thai place there was this gem that I have been seeing so often is soo good!! We had a slice of pizza(thin crust) with spinach.. it was so tasty! the cheese melts in your mouth.. and it has a great texture. The service was great also. This place is def. worth it!! will be back
