My friends and I came here at about 6 30 on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. Yes, we may have just gotten lucky because we came so early but still, it was nice to be seated so quickly. Our waiter was very friendly and was very knowledgeable when it came to the differnt kinds of sushi. We ordered rather quickly but it was difficult waiting because we were seated right by the kitchen, so we kept seeing other people's food coming out! It took a little longer than expected for a few sushi rolls to come out, maybe 40 minutes. That ticked me off a little bit, the place wasn't even that crowded. The sushi was absolutely DELICIOUS. Besides eating something I was allergic to (totally my fault, it was clearly marked on the menu), it was a yummy evening. Besides the rather slow service, Id come back here. Imaginative sushi at a decent price in Chicago, can you beat that?
