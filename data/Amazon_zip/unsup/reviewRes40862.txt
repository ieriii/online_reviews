This place has a prime location because it's right off the Argyle stop and it has large windows. Large windows to see tons of people eating! Always a good sign when out noodle hunting. I had the Pho with beef and Wifey had the vermicelli bowl with egg rolls. I really liked my broth. It wasn't oily and the beef flavor really came through. The noodles were well cooked. The egg rolls with my wife's dish; not so crunchy and didn't taste fresh. Probably was kept under warming lights. Service was excellent. The servers wear camoflauged t-shirts as their uniforms. Our server was attentive, especially for a fast food, diner type establisment. Warning: the menu is HUGE! Great service. Hot Pho.
