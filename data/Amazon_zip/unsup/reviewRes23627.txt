How one could drive by this place hungry, with the windows down, and not stop, is proof of the willpower of every human being but the bubs and I. After condo searching through Bucktown, we zipped past and the meaty wafty goodness drew us in. The ease of purchasing wine across the street was also a major plus. The place is quite gritty inside with seating for somewhere around 30. The ambiance is perfect though, for the menu offerings, and the service is hard and fast. To start we shared the empanadas: spinach and cheese, zucchini, and chicken. Spinach and cheese was by far the best-not too doughy and lightly fried. I would have liked to see a creamy sauce accompany the empanadas versus the pico de gallo dip they provide. Pepito Sandwich, a little greasy which is perfect, with sauteed onions and sauce. Milanese Sandwich good, but nothing in comparison to the flavorful rib-eye in the Pepito. Will be back in the summer to sit on the patio. Only con is that they only have plastic cups. For a place that is BYOB, they should invest in glassware.
