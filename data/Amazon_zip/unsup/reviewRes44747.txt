I'm not much of a critic of Chicago deep dish pizza at this point as I've only tried it once in my life and Giordano's had the pleasure of popping my cherry. The wait is LONG but well worth it. You can order drinks and apps at the bar while you're called which is great if you can fit in... The Service is decent. Don't expect the pizza to come out as quick as a brooklyn-style will, but believe me it's well worth it. (see pics) Will definitely return for some more when back in Chi-town!
