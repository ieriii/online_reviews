Large menu, interior a bit on the loud side. Servings of food too large for my tastes. So large, I didn't get to get dessert, which was disappointing. Service was fine. It had a restaurant chain feel to it. Ordered the Santa Fe Salad. Tasted great (best part was the bits of bacon) but again too much food. I could have split it with someone. Some of the tables for 2 are too close together.
