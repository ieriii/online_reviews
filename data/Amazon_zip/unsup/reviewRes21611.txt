Superdawg rocks, don't listen to all the "it doesn't live up to the hype" Yelpers. What did you all expect - your hot dog to be delivered on a silver platter? It's your typical old school, Mom & Pop fast food drive-in. Nothing more, nothing less. There's window service, they greet you with the cliche "Hiya, Welcome to Superdawg..", and your dog & fries comes in a cute little cardboard box just waiting to be eaten (the contents, not the box..although I'm sure someone could prove me wrong). There aren't nearly enough of these places left in the US anymore but thankfully Superdawg has stuck around. I didn't give SD 5 stars only because it's difficult to get to without a car (only the Milwaukee bus goes that far) and it is expensive but it's worth it.
