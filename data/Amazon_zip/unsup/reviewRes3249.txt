I have been frequenting Crisp for nearly two years now, and I can say without a doubt that they are among the best chicken spots in the city. I would highly recommend the Seoul Steak Bowl, a mix of Korean Beef and Rice. I like to upgrade to the Organic Brown Rice for an extra $1.50. And ask for extra Alice's Atomic Sauce. If you're looking for wings, they have a pretty good deal where you get a full chicken, a side, and two drinks for somewhere around twenty bucks. Once again, I would recommend that you get at least half of the chicken in Seoul Sassy. And get some Alice's Atomic Sauce. And the final check mark in their favor...BYOB! Although if you are eating in, you better be prepared to get a little cozier with a stranger than you originally intended. But it's worth it.
