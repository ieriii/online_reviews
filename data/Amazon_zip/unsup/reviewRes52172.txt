Being in Chicago for the first time, I knew I had to do deep dish. The line was short out the door but it still took about 45 min to be seated. We ordered the bread sticks and 2 small deep dish pizzas, one pepperoni supreme and sausage patty w/ cheese. Also got a cannoli to share... pretty tasty. I wasn't impressed with the bread sticks, I guess I was expecting actual garlic and super buttery -- they were very similar to the Pat Oscars bread sticks, good but nothing special. Basically bread, lightly buttered with garlic salt, served with sauce. Glad we got them though as it took about 35 minutes after we ordered to get the pizza. The sausage patty pizza was something to write home about. It was not greasy and the sausage was not breakfast style sausage patty-- it was a very dense almost bologna style sausage, as if it was sliced off a large loaf. So tasty! The pepperoni was well, pepperoni. The crust was not what I expected being from California. It was more a corn-mealy dough, that wasn't very yeasty or puffy. The tastiness of the sausage made up for the lacking crust. 1.5 slices was plenty for me, I normally do 3 or 4 with non-deep dish. With 3 people and 2 small pizzas-- we had about 1/2 a pizza left over. My advice-- get the sausage patty! I'm glad I followed the advice of fellow yelpers and got it...
