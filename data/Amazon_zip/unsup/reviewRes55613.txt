I celebrated my graduation dinner there and I'm glad I did.It was casual and not too pricey given the crowd size we had.Amazing food. That's really all I can say. I don't think anyone at my table (and it was a graduation party) was disappointed and my family can be really picky.The wait staff was really helpful and I like that even for a casual place they offered to take our coats.It seems like a great place to take a date because the restaurant is lively, but not too loud.
