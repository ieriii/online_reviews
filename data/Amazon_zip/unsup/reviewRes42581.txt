Soooooo glad I finally tried this place! They definitely do deep dish the way Chicago is supposed to. It's the first place I've found outside the chains (Lou's, Giordano's, Gino's) that does it right. I still like Lou's better for their crispy butter crust, but this place is second in my mind. I ordered for pick up, but was very impressed by the place when I went in to get it. Deep dish by the slice!?!? I didn't even know that was possible. They must use a different cheese than the other guys, cause usually deep dish slices turn into a gooey oozy mess when separated from the big pie. We order a medium Art's Special, and all of the toppings were chunky and fresh tasting. I've been reheating the leftovers for 2 days now and they've been great too! I'll be back for sure!
