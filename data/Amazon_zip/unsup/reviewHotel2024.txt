I've stayed here twice - once with my family in 2010 and once for work in 2012. Location was good for the work thing I had in River North, not so good for the touristy stuff I did with family. If you're not familiar with the city and stay here be prepared to cab it. Both times I ended up with "interior view" rooms, but if the view from the bar is any indication the city-view rooms probably have a very nice view of downtown. Lobby is nice and staff was friendly. Inside could use some TLC, but it's not horrible. The 15th floor thing is weird but they have elevators inside that go straight to the hotel. I would probably stay here again if the room was $150/under and I had a reason to be nearby.
