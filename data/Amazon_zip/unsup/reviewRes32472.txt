This is my first yelp review, so I figured I'd start with my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Chicago. Breakfast until 3:30? Sign me up. Great natural juice selection? Yep. Tasty coffee drinks, check. Alcoholic beverages? Got that too. Eat there for breakfast, lunch or dinner and you won't be disappointed. The last time we went there, I ordered the polenta and highly recommend that. But really, everything I've tried on the menu has been outstanding. They've got some decent apparel too. And usually good tunes for background music. Chicago Diner, you rule.
