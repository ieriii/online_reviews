This hotel was totally unreal! It was a wonderful experience to stay here, if only for a couple nights (because there is no way I could afford anything more). The room service was absolutely amazing (though pricey), and they really paid attention to the minor details of your order. It was truly an excellent selection for a conference, as the rooms were spacious, the food service was on point, and all the amenities in the hotel compliment both service and decor (and I didn't have to pay for all the additional stuff). As for the location, you are right in the heart of downtown Chicago! What more could you possibly ask for? (Except for lower rates maybe) I recommend anyone looking for an excellent time (and carrying with them a hefty budget) in Chicago to stay at this wonderful hotel, as your experience will undoubtedly be a good one.
