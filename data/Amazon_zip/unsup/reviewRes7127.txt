Bravo! Sapori Trattoria was everything I wanted and more. My mother's birthday was this past Monday and since my sister and her husband were in town for the holidays, I decided we would celebrate here with the prixe fixe menu. Service from beginning to end was impeccable. We sat in the back room and next to a door. My mother felt a draft and the server put clear packing tape over the door and frame. Above and beyond if you ask me. My sister and I pretty much picked the menu but made modifications to some of the dishes. My father is allergic to sea scallops so we were able to eliminate it from one pasta dish. Our menu: Crostina Di Avocado Calamari Griglia Minestrone Soup Insalata Stella Bass Spaghetti allo Scoglio Pennette Cardinale Chocolate Panna Cotta Everything was delicious. The food was portioned appropriately but we had leftovers. Timing I believe is crucial with family style dining and Sapori Trattoria nailed it. There was enough time between meals so we had time to sit back and enjoy what was just served. In the end, the meal including two bottles of wine and coffee came out to be very reasonable. My sister and I split the bill and I have to say that I thought it would be more. As we were all putting our coats on, our server came over to say the manager was bringing us free glasses of moscato d'asti if we had time. They won me over.
