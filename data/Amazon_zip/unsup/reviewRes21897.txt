Oh my was this place good. I had the Torta ahugada and I was so thank full that my friend and I where seated at the bar up against the wall other wise I would not have been able to fully enjoy my torta the way I did for fear that the rest of patrons complain of what a slob I was being. When I say slob I mean I used my hands to eat and my fingers as a spoon/fork. They give you an option of 3 sauces to pick from I picked the hot which was excellent. The pork was tender enough and not over seasoned which was great because you really got to enjoy the hot sauce and the bread being soaked in it. AND the chef was there! Rick Bayless (hope i spelled that right) he was having a very serious talk with one of the other chefs (it seemed serious), i was very tempted to say hello but was to shy. Oh and there papaya mint water was sooo good, just wish it was bigger. Great place for lunch and a fast dinner,
