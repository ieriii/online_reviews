"Lets go to Meli's for brunch" I was surprised because I had never heard of it.Came away with the conclusion that it is the best kept secret in Greek-town. We didn't have too much of a wait on a Saturday afternoon which was a huge bonus. We all ordered different things, I got the crepes with feta and sun dried tomatoes, my friend the banana caramel pancakes and her husband, the eggs. Everything was delicious.. especially the pancakes. Even the coffee was so good, a perfect way to start the weekend. Huge portions, but everything was amazingly tasty. They even have Nutella crepes which I will try the next time I go. Pretty reasonable too, every dish is under $12. When I mentioned this place to another friend, got the response "The brunch place with the hot waitresses?" Another fun piece of trivia to know I guess!
