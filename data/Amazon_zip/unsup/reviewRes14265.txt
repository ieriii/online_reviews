Sometimes, when I'm sad, probably because of the poor health decisions I made the night before, I get on my bike and cruise over to 90 Miles for a Lechon sandwich. I think it's probably my favorite sandwich in the world, and after I eat it, I don't worry about feeling terrible anymore. The pork is so tender and delicious, and the bread is crispy. The hot sauce is killer in flavor and spice, which is difficult to accomplish.  I've never had anything other than the Lechon, because the thought of something else not being THE BEST sandwich I've ever had makes me hedge my bets and go for the old reliable. However, I've heard that their other items are incredible as well. Also, try a mango tea drink thing if you want to drop the dough. They're delicious and refreshing.
