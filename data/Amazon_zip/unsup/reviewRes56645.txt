This place is SOO DELICIOUS. It's one of my favorite places now!One of my really good friends mentioned this place to me a couple of months back. We finally had a chance to try it last month, and I cannot believe we waited this long to come here!Between two people plus with cocktails and tip it was less than 100 dollars. We eat a lot though for small people... we probably ate enough for 2 adults and 1 child. We ordered a formaggi and salumi tray (three meats, one cheese) and it came with a delicious strawberry marmalade and bread. My friend does not like marmalade but he thoroughly enjoyed their homemade one! We then went on to have the truffle egg toast which was FANTASTIC. You absolutely must order this if you come here!! The bread was delicious warm and slightly toasted and the egg was perfect and runny! Delicious.We also got the risotto carbonara which was incredibly rich because of the quail egg. It was mediocre compared to the rest of the dishes and I could not taste or find the panecatta in my risotto. Last, we got the octopus aka the polpo con rafano which was very good. The outside of the octopus was seared, and slightly crispy, not chewy and very tender.We also ordered the anchovies but the downside was that the order was forgotten. We informed our waitress and she asked if we would like it and we declined, opting to skip out and get desert somewhere else instead (we ended up going to the publican for oysters and beer instead... FAIL). We also had two cocktails while we were waiting on our table (which is why we skipped the wine during dinner). We waited about an hour on a busy Saturday night (around 7:30) and instead of walking around outside (they offered to call us to alert us when we had a table) we changed our minds and sat at the bar for a drink. The drinks weren't mind blowing or amazing, but enough to distract us while we waited. Overall, I loved it. The decor was spacious and inviting and the staff are all very hipster and down to earth.
