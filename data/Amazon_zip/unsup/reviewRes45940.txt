This place is garbage. I was forced to come here for a reunion with some college acquaintances. I was not looking forward to dinner, and yes, I acted like a big baby about it in private. My husband chimed in, "Oh come on. It's not *that* bad. What's the big deal?" By the end of the night, my fears of an over-priced, crappy service, terrible-food experience proved to be true. We walked into the restaurant and the lobby was crowded with tourists, then went upstairs to the host stand, which was also crowded with tourists. We were led to our table of 18 guests and were seated. The party was assigned two waiters, who split the table in two by guests. Apparently one waiter put in the order immediately while the other took his sweet time. Half the table received their food, while the other half of the table waited for 30 minutes, watching the food go uneaten and cold at the other end of the party. When I received my miso salmon served with white rice, it was served with a weird giant tortilla chip stuck in the fish. Because nothing says "Asian Miso Salmon" like a giant tortilla chip, right? The sauce on the fish was ridiculously salty, which was a general comment around the table-- "my food is really salty." The Grand Lux Experience continued to deliver garbage. I pulled out a few fish bones from my mouth. The last straw was the bill. My husband and I paid almost $120 for 3 drinks and 2 entrees. I've paid way less for way more at many 4-star restaurants just around the corner. There are too many great restaurants to over-pay for crappy service and food. And this place is never going to change because it will always get Michigan Ave tourists through the door.
