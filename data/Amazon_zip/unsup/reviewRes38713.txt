I live right across the street from here. Its the first place I ate when I moved to the city. I was amazed. Now that I have eaten around, not as amazed as much. I have had really good experiences but recently I have had bad ones. For example I ordered a brisket sandwich (which is usually amazing) and half of it was fat!?! The mayo dipping sauce, fries, and brisket/ham are usually very good though. I give 4 stars cause its close to my heart, but I have had a few bad experiences recently. Also the wait is a bit long, Get a bigger space!?!?!
