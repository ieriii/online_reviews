I went here on a date not too long after they opened. The food was nice, atmosphere pleasant, and service adequate.  I had heard they were known for their rabbit and sangria. We tried a number of items, including their specialties. I thought the sangria was good, but nothing to write home about. The rabbit was gamey, but it's rabbit. I didn't like it. We tried the dates as well, which didn't compare to Avec's. (Avec stole my heart with their dates.) What I did really enjoy, though, was the Montana y Mar (I think that's what they called it), steak and sea scallops. Very tasty, very tender. Their mushroom risotto was good, too. For dessert, I had the four chocolates, which were all delicious.  If you're having trouble deciding (or you can't read the Catalan), ask your server, they're good at explaining and making suggestions.
