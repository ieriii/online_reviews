Hopleaf is a wonderful place to grab a beer and bite to eat with a small or medium sized group. The beer list is ample, the food is amazing, and the only thing that sucks about this place is when there is a wait. They recently expanded, though, and hopefully this will fix the last one. Try the mussels, try the ham and cheese sandwich, and the sweetbreads when they have them. Don't try the frog legs unless you want to feel depressed at their smallness and start thinking about how to save the frogs at dinner. I'll be back. And did I mention the staff here rocks? Doesn't matter who it is, they are all solid, from the door staff to the bar back.
