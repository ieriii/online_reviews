Pretty cute spot! HUGE maragaritas. Boyfriend got the carne asada, which was a healthy portion, shall we say. I got the taco dinner and let me say this: they tasted exactly like the tacos I make at home! Flavorwise, I'm saying...they tasted like they had a packet of taco seasoning in it. The fried ice cream was a nice ending to the meal. We were stuffed! Would return again, but would not order the tacos por una otra vez. =)
