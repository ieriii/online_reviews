we went on Sat 5/29/10 as walk ins and had to wait over 1 hour to be seated. the best thing our group of 4 did was walk to Havana bar, literally the next block south on Clark and had our Mojitos there with a small appetizer. the server seemed like he was impatient with our order and would roll his eyes when we would ask to repeat a question b/c we were unclear about some things and even when we chose to not order dessert. the trio ceviche was definitely worth it. the icing on the cake for this awful rating was when my husband was eating the left overs the next day, he almost broke his tooth biting on a ROCK! seriously, it was a medium size pebble, and makes you wonder how it got there. so after all that is said and done, we can check Rick Bayless' restaurant off our Chicago to-do list, but probably would not go back.
