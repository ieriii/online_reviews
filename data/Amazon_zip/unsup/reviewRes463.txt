You need to eat here at least once. It's certainly not cheap (two people doing the 24-course tour with wine pairing and tip is like $900), but absolutely worth it. As Chicagoans, we have a rare opportunity to benefit from Chef Achatz's leadersip in the world of "molecular gastronomy". Definitely don't miss out. I'm glad we didn't. Although it will ruin some of the surprise, you can get a sense for how unique your night will be by checking out flickr photos of the food: http://flickr.com/search
