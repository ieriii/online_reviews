After being here my second time, I have to say that the White Dragon Roll takes the cake! It is creamy, crunchy and delicious! My boyfriend prefers the Volcano Roll which definitely has a kick to it and the presentation actually looks like a volcano.  They do the best job with BYOB. Both times we have brought Sake and Sapporo. They took the Sake and heated it and put it in a nice serving piece for the table. Also, they kept our beer in their walk-in so it was nice and cold every time. They have a nice waiting area in the front with tables, but we made reservations both times so there wasn't much of a wait. The only negative thing I would say is that the tables are really close together, making it a tad uncomfortable.
