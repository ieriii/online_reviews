Normally I hate when people write a bad review after one visit to a place, because it's really not fair... maybe it was just a bad night? But my recent visit to Nuevo Leon was so godawful that I'm breaking my own rule. First, the place was dirty, crowded and cold... they clearly have no idea how to warm the place in winter. Our server took our order and then literally disappeared for 30 minutes. By the time she finally showed up and asked if we needed anything, we had a laundry list of requests. "Yes, napkins, more water, the check and a box, thanks." She finally brought the napkins and check, but we never did get a refill on water. It was absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. They also messed up both of our orders. My friend requested flour tortillas and they gave him corn ones - which were greasier than anything I've ever seen in my life. I also had requested no sour cream and my dish arrived with sour cream on the top. We didn't bother trying to send it back because it likely would've taken another 30 minutes to actually receive the correct order. The level of incompetence was absolutely stunning. We happily walked out without tipping (which I never do) and so did the couple at the table next to us. If this is the best Mexican restaurant in Pilsen... I guess I'll be staying in Logan Square.
