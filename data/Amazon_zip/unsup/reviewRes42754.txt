I advise phoning your order in seeing how the pizzas take forty minutes to make. If not, you will grow hungrier by the minute as you sit in an uncomfortable chair listening to soft rock blare. Such a combination might cause the weaker willed ones to start to sing along to songs they probably know but won't admit they know unless alcohol or slight starvation reveal that people do in fact know the words...and...um.. ...uh, anyways, I got the stuffed pizza and found it to be slightly better than Giordano's but not as mind-blowing as others might have you believe.
