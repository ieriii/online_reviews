It's no secret that I love this place. I have brought various friends and ladies here in the last 2 years after I discovered this place. Last time I went, a couple of lady friends dined with our bottles of wine. Kudos to deliciousness. I had my normal Casado. Love it. Though it's nothing elegant, it's a hearty meal that really has the home cooked feel--perfect thinly sliced steak with caramelized onions, an egg, Costa Rican rice, veggie salads (yummy beets...!), and delectable plantains. In fact, everything has the home cooked feeling. We had the pork and bean dip as well as the guacamole. Wow, the guac here is delicious. My friends ordered the same as me as well as the veggie sandwich, which I am hoping to stray away from my stable and try. As my companion put it, "It's got all the ingredients that you can make it at home, but, each time you try, you'll just fail miserably. It's so delicious." Even though they were packed....not pointing fingers...there was a table of 15 that seemed a bit high maintenance. Kudos to the staff there. Omar, as always, made sure we were taken care of, and we didn't wait too long for our food. However, we were happily occupied with our bottles of wine in the mean time. I always bank on spending around $15-20 here including tip. It's worth it. That usually includes enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Cash only, so make sure you sure walk up to Walgreen's to buy something in order to get cash back. So...when do you want to get Irazu with me? And, yes, I pronounce the name like an American who's never taken Spanish before.
