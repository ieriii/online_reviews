I can not speak more highly of this place! I got my Wedding cake here, everything from the tasting to the pick up was perfect, they kept in contact during the design process to make sure everything was perfect, and it really was. I dealt with Mitchell am he was great. Perfect customer service, i love that he remembered me when i would call, even though it was busy wedding season. HOWEVER the great experience did not end there! the cake. Oh the cake. By far the best cake i have had in Chicago. My choice for one of the tiers of the cake was vanilla cake with raspberry filling and american cream cheese frosting. I honestly have dreams about how good that cake is! on our wedding day, when we cut the cake, and each fed each other a fork full, we were meant to hold that pose for the photos....not me, i had to keep eating!! Love it.
