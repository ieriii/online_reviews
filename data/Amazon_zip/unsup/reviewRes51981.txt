Our first stop in Chicago! We came in pretty early..about 6pmish. The place was packed, loud and looked a little dirty to me. Maybe it was all the writing on the wall....but maybe that's what they were going for. OK, we ordered 4 pitchers of beer, Combo appetizers, garlic bread and a large Deep dish combo pizza Beer: Delicious. of course You can never go wrong with Heineken Combo appetizers: consisting of : Calamari, mozzarella sticks and some green things: Ok...a little on the cold side, calamari a little too hard to chew, but its calamari Deep dish Pizza: Damn! Its a lot of pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Its was seriously amazing. I could only have one...since we had quite a bit of appetizers. But man....This is one of the reasons why i would come back to Chicago. Now for the bad.... Everything was going great! good food, great company, 3.5 pitchers of beer down.....good buzz going...THEN a fucken cockroach runs across the freaken table toward my purse! DAMN IT! of course I freaken jumped out of my seat and out the door. 20 minutes later...I return sit down (of course on the other side) pay and leave. WTF! My friends talked to the server. We just let her know that the restaurant was probably roach infested and we made no complaint, just informed her after we paid. ::::shivers::: Strike one Chicago!
