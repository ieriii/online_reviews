This is our favorite restaurant because the food, service, and prices are amazing- a rare find! They don't take reservations past 5:30, but you truly don't need one because the servers are fast and efficient, without sacrificing the quality of service. I absolutely love the saganaki and skordalia here. And it may sound silly, but their pitas are seasoned perfectly and are the best I've had. The calamari is also amazing, as is the athenian salad. And the dessert menu is impressive, though we never have room for it.
