I just went back this past weekend for Sunday Brunch. Not happy to report that the wait time is just as crazy...over an hour for a table of 3. Yes, the food is good but NOT that good. The service is snobby and rude at times. Only when someone figures out how a make a decadent breakfast menu - in a bigger space that actually accept reservations will place change. Until then, we are stuck with a long, long waits and rude, rude wait staff.
