As a Rick Bayless flagship restaurant, this place is so hyped up and I was expecting a major letdown. Remember that Public Enemy song "Dont believe the hype"? All you hear and read about is how this "celebrity chef" is a Chicago favorite and even the POTUS (Pres. Obama) puts one of his restaurants on his "top-10 list." I was visiting from So Cal, and I was anxious to experience this place - would it live up to the hype? For the most part - yes. But it I think FG is so over-hyped that I was expecting something "out of this world." So yes, its good, but its not a GOAT ("Greatest of All Time") restaurant. The ambiance is ok, with nice artwork mixed with saturated red walls. The table we were originally seated in was uneven and we had to re-locate to another table (a bad first impression). I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance, and my understanding is that I was "lucky" to reserve a table for a weekend dinner 2 weeks in advance. But I hear that if you come early (around 5 or earlier for dinner) you may be able to get seated that night if there are "no-shows" or if space is available. We started with the trio-trio ceviche - this was a wonderful starter! Each one was full of flavor that just burst into your mouth. My tongue was satisfied. For the entree, I had the Chicken mole, it was good, but a tad bit too heavy on the sodium. The portions were also fair, but at $24 for the mole, its pretty pricey and I expected more (for what you pay for). The service was excellent, with a person carrying a water canteen coming by every three minutes to re-fill my water. Fantastic. Our server was also attentive and made sure our needs were fulfilled. Overall, this is great place and the food is good. In LA, there is a place called Border Grill in Santa Monica. I thought both the decor and the food (please dont get upset Mr. Bayless) reminded me of that place. So if you like Border Grill, you will like FG.  But remember that Public Enemy song.
