So we went out with two other couples for what we had hoped would be a great meal here and I've never had a more disappointing experience in my life. If I could give zero stars, I would.The place was an absolute madhouse. We got seated out on the patio, which was a beautiful setting. The service is slow and we waited a long time for our food. While we are waiting, the restaurant staff keeps adding chairs to a table across from us until finally, it is completely blocking the aisle. A little while later, the hostess comes up to us with another group she is going to seat and demands that we get up and move our chairs, so she can get by. We're so surprised, we do it without arguing. Five minutes later, she tries to do it again. This time we refuse and she starts getting testy with us but we won't budge. Finally, she gets the bright idea to try another route and leaves.The food shows up and it is bland, bland, bland. I had the gnocchi and it was one of the worst things I've ever tasted. All of the other dishes we ordered were equally flavorless. While we are waiting for the check, I get up to use the bathroom. I walk in and thought I was in a Rush Street bar. Somebody had puked in a urinal, trash can was overflowing and there were no paper towels in sight. It looked like nobody had cleaned it all night. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Fed up with the whole experience, we ask to speak to the manager. He comes over and we describe all of the issues we've had. He listens, thanks us for telling him and walks away. No apology or anything. We pay for our incredibly overpriced meal and leave, all of us swearing that we'll never return.
