Really fantastic. Chicago born and bred people can be aholes about pizza and will argue for hours about how deep dish really is pizza and not like... pie. I am a traitor and not much of a deep dish fan. Pequod's, though, is weird in a great way. Once I compared it (before having it) to upmarket Pizza Hut and I feel like this is pretty accurate - spongy golden crust, a little crisp but springy, with burnt delicious cheese. Sauce is spot on and not sweet/nasty which is a huge problem in Chicago pizza. It takes awhile to come out, but when it does you have to cut it free from a cast iron pan that is black very likely from 40 years of grease baked into it. Very cool laid back waitstaff. Last time my friend and I got a pitcher of Half Acre Gossamer to ourselves, which is the world's best easy-drinking pizza beer. Try the fried zucchini - it's a vegetable! A word to New York: don't fear the fork. It is the only way.
