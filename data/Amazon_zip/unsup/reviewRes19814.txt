I was soo hungry. So hungry I stopped in Jimmy John's first actually. But then I was walking by XOCO and threw my brand new uneaten sandwich away (Hey, I looked for a bum first). Anyways so glad I walked in. Alright, yeah I just reviewed Frontera Fresco online, and no I don't think Rick Bayless is a god, well maybe, but anyways his restaurants rock! Seriously try XOCO or any of them. If you don't absolutely love them stick to On The Border or Taco Bell (not that anything is wrong with TB). I ordered the Pibil sandwich. IT WAS AWESOME! Try it!
