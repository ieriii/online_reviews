Doug is a genius! I can't think of a better way to combine an adventurous eating experience with semi-convenience and a decent price. I say semi- convenience because there is the notorious line outside, but surprisingly, there is available seating inside, thanks to the attentive staff. The price is decent considering the fact that some of these dogs are made of just about anything from rabbit to smoked shrimp. He has the regular menu with more of a streamline fare, but the real deal is the "out of this world" specials; these are dogs (technically sausages or emulsified meats) the likes of mandarin orange teriyaki chicken sausage with chili-garlic mayonnaise and butterkase cheese for $7.50. Fries are separate, but come here on a Friday or Saturday and order a generous helping of french fries cooked in duck fat. They're open from 10:30 to 4:00, they're closed on Sundays, and they tend to take most holidays off.   For a foodie with out the money and means to experience creative eats, this place hits the spot.
