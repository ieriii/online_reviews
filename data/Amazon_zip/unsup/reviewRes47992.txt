My most recent visit to the Publican was to celebrate a close friend's graduation from law school. For a party of six we were a bit light with our ordering for various reasons- one had just come from a BBQ, several have shamefully small appetites, etc. For most I would recommend ordering more than we did, though we certainly enjoyed everything we tried: -Daily pickles: my fave was the cauliflower, but overall the perfect combo of slightly sweet & tangy -Octupus -Beef tongue -Porcini mushrooms: not a fan of the cheese -Half farm chicken: lovely & moist, really enjoyed the fab frites that came with it but the sausage was a bit hard -Pork belly: guhhh, the FAT! So good. And then three desserts- the strawberry shortcake, some type of brownie, and the coconut ice cream (my favorite for the hints of lime!) The Publican has a really fun interior, great crowd, and pretty good (not stellar) service. The food is adventurous and tasty. A must-try Chicago restaurant!
