Goodness abounds. I'm usually not too adventurous of an eater but I had a duck sausage when I went. It was great.  Not only is the food good but Doug himself is a wonderful person. My roommate and I didn't know that it was cash only until we were next in line. We told Doug we didn't have cash and he told us to order, eat, and then go to the bank right down the street and come back. Super, super nice guy.  You're going to have to wait in line to get in but it will be worth it to chat with Doug and to have a yummy Chicago style hot dog or one of their unique sausages.
