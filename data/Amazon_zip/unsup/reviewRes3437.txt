It was with trepidation that I tried this "fusion" Korean place being that I've never eaten at a non-authentic Korean eatery. But all my trepiditiousness was deflated once I tried the delicious food. Who knew Korean and Mexican food blended so well together?  The Korean burrito with beef bulgogi was delectable, huge and came with an amazingly spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce. The wings with korean bbq sauce were addictive and wonderfully spicy. I think we are going to start seeing a trend of Korean-Mexican fusion food. There's a super popular Korean taco truck in Portland, OR now too, it's taking over! On a side note, we met the owner and he was very nice and hooked us up with samples of other things on the menu that we didn't buy for free!
