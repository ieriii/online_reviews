YUM. Beer. Fun crowd. Also, best vegan dessert I've ever had [peanut butter cookies with vegan ice cream]. Warning: some of the beer is very high in alcohol content compared to the average beer, so you will be very drunk, very quickly. This place fills up - it's hard to get a table, but be patient, it's all worth it! Also, the wait staff has always been awesome.
