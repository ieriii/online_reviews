Good spot. The meat is good, but not the best Churrascaria in Chicago. Wine selection is great and the place is very classy and cozy. The price is too high for the quality of the food, so i would select this place only if I'll need to impress. As for the pure food experience, I'll choose another spot. The flames in the dinner room are gorgeous. Pick this spot, again, if you want to impress.
