Once upon a time, I liked to go to this place called Violet Hour. It had great drinks, good food and a friendly staff. Then, they became an over-hyped mess of assholes who deemed it necessary to post a list of rules in their bathrooms. Needless to say, they jumped the shark for me a long time ago. But then along came Gilt Bar...so much prettier, so much better drinks and, most importantly, such a less pretentious atmosphere that is reflected by the staff. They are all great. I am especially in love with Manny the bartender who will take my annoying "just give me something good with vodka" request and turn around and hand me the best drink ever. Gilt plays great music at just the right sound level, which also is imperative for me to enjoy myself. And the food is nothing short of amazing. Their mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts side dishes are probably 2 of the best things I ate in 2011. I just didn't want to include side dishes on the official Yelp thread. Anyway, if you want a sexy but not too uppity place to enjoy some great craft cocktails and some even greater food, then Gilt Bar is it. PS- Save room for the chocolate cream pie. You can thank me later.
