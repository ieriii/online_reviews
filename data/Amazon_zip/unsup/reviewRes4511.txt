I really love this place and I don't go there enough! It is so old school and classic! You go there and are transformed into this other place where you can just sit and enjoy the music. One thing to note is they don't take credit cards, at least they didn't before and I don't think it has changed. And the mixed drinks are small--they come in a little glass that looks like a votive candle holder.
