There was nothing about this place I liked.....which is odd because I love baked goods. However, both my strawberry/lemon cupcake and my double layer chocolate cherry bar were crap. They both did not taste fresh. Additionally, I had to seek out help...apparently standing in front of the cupcakes with my wallet out was not an indication that I was wanting to purchase something!
