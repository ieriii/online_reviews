I've only experienced Sunda for Sunday brunch, but I'll definitely be back for dinner/drinks First of all - the bloody mary bar? When they say it's all about the garnish, they aren't kidding. I've never seen such a bloody mary spread, with everything from the traditional celery to pickled cucumber to bbq pork bits and everything in between. Yum! Total bang for your buck, and a great way to start off the morning while you wait for the main course. The caramelized goodness they slap down on the table when you're seated is seriously to die for - don't forget to share with your brunch mates! I love the East meets West vibe of the brunch menu you. You've got all the traditional items - eggs benedict, french toast, protein omelette - for the less adventurous, and then a crazy variety of "Eastern" brunch dishes for those ready to explore. We ordered a combination of several and almost licked the plates. We also ordered some dimsum for the table to split. The soup dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and pork shumai were all delicious, but for $9/order, I'd rather go to Chinatown and stuff my face with cheap dim sum Icing on the cake: GREAT service and beautiful ambiance and decor. Can't wait to come back for dinner!
