Went here a couple months ago and fell in love with the gnocci pasta! I went back a few weeks ago, only to order the gnocci pasta and find out it was completely different! It was no where near as good, I was very disappointed. I could hardly eat any of it it tasted so bad.Other than my horrible gnocci experience, the bread with sweet vinegar is to die for, as is the St. Germain lemon drink. I also love the ice cream!
