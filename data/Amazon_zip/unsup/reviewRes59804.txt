There pizza is some of the best I have found in the city. Very taste, fresh ingredents, pizza by the slice ready to go, delevery is fast and they wrap the pizza in foil to make sure no cheese is lost in a pizza slide or to the top of the box. Free pop with delevery, I got to tell you of all food Pizza is what I'm the biggest food snob about. So if you have had Art of Pizza, next time you have a craving try them!!!
