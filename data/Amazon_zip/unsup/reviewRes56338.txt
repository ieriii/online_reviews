Simply put, the best Vietnamese food I have ever had in Chicago. I was a fan of Pasteur, and Simply It follows veteran owner Tuan's signature style of inventive, delicious food. Conveniently located in Lincoln Park, the restaurant's decor is warm contemporary. BYOB and close proximity to nearby bars makes this restaurant a great start to a night out. Still working out a few kinks in service, but overall outstanding value and great food. Highly recommended.
