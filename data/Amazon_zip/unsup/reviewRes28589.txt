Went here for brunch, highly recommended when you are in the mood for a more upscale breakfast, i.e., not-so-greasy-spoon. My boyfriend and I tend to want to try everything at a restaurant the first time we go there, so we tried the appetizer platter to get a feel for the place. It was a great way to sample and not too much food, you can still get an entree. The jicama salad and the ceviche tostadas were the standouts.... verrrrry tasty :) We didn't make a reservation and it was pretty crowded (after all, Rick Bayless is awesome), but they have walk-in, no reservation tables at the bar and around the bar, so we only had to wait about 10 mins.
