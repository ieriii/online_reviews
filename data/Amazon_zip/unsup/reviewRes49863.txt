Awesome sports bar. Tons of large HD plasma TVs spread over 3 floors and the patio (yes 2 large TVs face the patio so you can watch games outside). The standard bar menu plus a ton of unique and pretty damn good food choices. Great service. The crowd is good - fun but not too fratty on Bears game day. The only reason there is 1 star docked is because for some very odd reason, some of the TVs in the basement level are set to certain channels and cannot be changed. I was in here during the Bears game today and there was not a soul in the basement level not wearing a Bears jersey yet the Dolphins/Texans game was featured prominently on one of the main TVs. When I asked the waitress to change it, she said that it was physically impossible because the bar is set up so that the basement is a place where multiple games can be watched. Not a huge deal because there were still several large TVs showing the Bears game, but it was a little annoying because the one showing the other game was the one easiest to see from our table.
