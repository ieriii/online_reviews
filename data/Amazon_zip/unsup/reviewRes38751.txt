yes, it was on "check please". yes, it seems to be always crowded. yes, the atmosphere has changed alot since it first opened up it's doors. though, it's still worth coming back to again and again, because it's all about the beer. the great breadth of selecction, knowledgable staff, and appropriate stem ware make it a worthwhile experience for beer aficionados. definitely a great neighborhood bar.
