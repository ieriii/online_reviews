A place of many firsts. The first place I experienced molecular gastronomy and prix fixed meals. The first place I've ever enjoyed Asian flavors from a non-Asian establishment. The first BYOB I didn't bring liquor; subsequently, first place I tried sparkling water. The first place I met a server genuinely excited to serve each course with matched knowledge of ingredients, preparation, and plating. The first place I was wowed by: presentation, creativity, unique pairing, and TASTE. The first place I ate foie gras, duck and thymus. The first place I enjoyed the entire journey of the meal and pondered the same question over and over with each passing course - "What can top this dish?" The first place in Chicago that ignited a love for fine dining that's not just good but fun. The first place I signed up on the email list just so I could partake in underground meals exclusive to only pre-made reservations. The first place I've visiting over and over and was blown away each time. The first place I've slipped those words, "my favorite restaurant," a few times here and there.
