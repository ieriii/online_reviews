It was my first stay at the Fairmont Millennium Park and am so glad I discovered this place. The hotel is in a beautiful part of the city, surrounded by lots of gorgeous scenery. We had a great view from our room. I can't imagine that there's a bad view from any room in the hotel. The hotel is also in a quieter part of the city, which is nice when sleeping. The staff there are wonderful too and very quick to take care of anything you need. The hotel is very close to Millennium Station and the CTA, which makes it really easy to get to. There are also several restaurants nearby and a CVS right across the street. Our room was great and very spacious. The bed and chairs were super comfy. The closet was spacious as well. The bathroom was huge with a separate shower, bath tub, and separate room for the toilet. There was also vanity outside of the bathroom with a bench where I could do my hair and make up without taking up the bathroom. A nice touch was the Nespresso machine. That coffee was so good! This hotel made our weekend in Chicago a wonderful one!
