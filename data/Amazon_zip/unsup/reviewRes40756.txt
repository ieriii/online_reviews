I went here recently on a Sunday for the chef's tasting menu. $75 is well worth it for the 7 course meal, and it's a bonus that it's BYOB. The courses... of course I can't remember the details.: 1) Salad course - 50 minute egg with several vegetables: brussel sprout, fennel, fried squash blossoms, and turnip. The egg was cooked well and the veggies were tasty. 2) Scallop and crab dish. 3) Seared tuna in a broth - this was the weakest of the 7 dishes. The tuna was bland but the broth was tasty and there was crispy leek flakes. 4) Soup with mussels. The mussels were awesome and the soup had specks of hot sauce 5) The duck dish. Perfectly cooked with a pork belly filling and a side of vegetables. 6) Desert 1/palate cleanser. It was refreshing shaved ice with passion fruit jelly slices. 7) A chocolate and pumpernickel bread pudding. I'm usually not a desert person but I could have eaten 4 more of these. To sum it up, the price was worth it. Only one course was a miss in my opinion (the tuna) while everything else was good. The fact that it's BYOB is awesome.
