Super cheap, and right down the street from me. All the food was awesome. This was my first experience with tostones and i'm pretty sure i'm now hooked. I really loved the yucca fries that came with my cubano. I really liked that the patio was open in the middle of winter (with canopy), and was neither cold nor drafty. Albeit I doubt the commonality of fireplaces in Havana, theirs was perfect and greatly appreciated.
