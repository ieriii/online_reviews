I'd probably give this place 5 stars if I were more into jazz or poetry... but alas I'm not. I used to go for their slam poetry night with a friend that was an english major... she "got" it and I just liked their drinks. It's an older crowd and pretty laid back. They always card me (I don't get carded much) but it always seems to be just a formality.  Unless you get there early you never get a seat, but there's a lot of standing room. It's usually a good time, and the drinks are good and strong!
