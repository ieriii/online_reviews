After reading about this restaurant on-line, I decided to give it a try since I live in the neighborhood. We did a 7 course tasting menu and brought one bottle of wine. Courses included scallops, bass, mussels, lamb -- it was very meat/fish/seafood heavy. No course was without meat, excluding the desserts, which were both more savory than sweet, so totally up my husband's alley. I prefer more chocolate! But overall the food was good - very rich flavor with fresh ingredients. We brought a dry Cabernet, which paired perfectly with the food (but we could have used another bottle). For a Friday night dinner, the tab ran around $180. So definitely not a cheap dinner, but for 7 quality courses, we enjoyed it.
