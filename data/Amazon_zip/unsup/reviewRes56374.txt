I discovered this place on a whim. There was a man handing out menus outside. Some of the best Vietnamese restaurants I have tried were in Washington Dc. My favorite is 2 soups, Pho and a tamarind soup. The Pho was good but it came with red onions that were raw. I get bad heartburn from raw onions. the tamarind soup was good but needed a ittle hot sauce. This made it better but was more broth than anything else. Not as good as Dc but worth a second visit.
