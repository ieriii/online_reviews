I am so disappointed in the degradation in the food and service at Glenn's. This used to be my go to restaurant for over a year. The first incident was on a Sunday, we had a reservation for 8 for an important family event and proceed to wait 30 minutes beyond our reservation time with enough open tables to seat us sitting empty. Then the breakfast, I have ordered the scrambled eggs with chives and parm at least 25 times and raved about them to my family. The portions everyone received were half the size of the normal portions I received in the past. On a subsequent visit we questioned the new plastic syrup bottles on the tables and were met with rude comments from the server. What a shame! The general manager from Glenn's reached out to me to discuss the situation which I thought was very professional.
