Not bad for an Asian Fusion restaurant. Super trendy and chic (and huge inside), and yes like others have said it is quite loud inside, so if you're looking for a romantic date night this probably wouldn't be the spot. But we were here for a bachelorette weekend, so the noise was not an issue for us. Shaking Beef - Just eh. Tough and kind of bland to be honest. Uncle Paul's Roasted Chicken - Really flavorful and tender! Loved this one. Longevity Garlic Noodles - A real basic dish, but very very strong in the garlic department! It was weird that they served this dish last after all the meat dishes had arrived. Being the Asian gal that I am, I'm used to eating noodles/rice WITH meat and not separately. It was weird eating just the noodles by themselves, but it was good. Crispy Brussel Sprout Salad - This one was recommended to us by our server. I really can't stand brussel sprouts, which is why I was surprised by how much I loved this dish! Probably my favorite dish of the night. The bitterness that I usually dislike about brussel sprouts was cleverly masked by the salad dressing and the crispy shallots provided an excellent crunch. I could eat tubfuls of this salad and not get sick of it... it was that good. Overall would recommend for groups, not for dates, and definitely for that brussel sprout salad!
