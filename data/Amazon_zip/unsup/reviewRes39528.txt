I can always count on leaving happy from this place. The kalbi (Korean BBQ rib) is always tasty. I have tried many Korean restaurants in the city and the burbs, but I always end up wanting to come back here. And of all the Korean restaurants I've been, this one comes with the most side dishes. There's so many, and they are so good that most of the time I am already near full before our entrees arrive. Its very good food for a great value. Here's a bit of advice before going, go on a day you plan on washing your hair and clothes. You will leave this place smelling just like the BBQ.
