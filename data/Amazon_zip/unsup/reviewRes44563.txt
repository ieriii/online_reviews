I had a chocolate chip cookie, which was pretty decent, and also some of a german chocolate drop, which was not so great. All the cakes in the window do look pretty impressive, but I'm not typically in the market for crazy designer cakes. And the eating/hangout/study room next door seems pretty cool too, not a bad place to chill or read or whatever. I also had the tres leches cake, which was pretty moist, a fairly well done tres leches. I'd give it a 7/10.
