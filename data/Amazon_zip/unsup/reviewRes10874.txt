So far, one of the best place for thin-crust pizza in Chicago!!! They give you 3 types of pizza: white, red, and plain and then you get to choose the toppings you'd like. Toppings range from $1 - $3.50. I love the red pizza with meatballs, basil, and ricotta cheese. The place is huge and the servers are helpful and friendly. Definitely a great place to meet up and have a beer and pizza.
