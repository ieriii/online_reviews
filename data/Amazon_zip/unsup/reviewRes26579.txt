I want to start the review by getting a few things out of the way - I'm Vietnamese, my parents are fob and my grandmother owned a restaurant in what used to be Saigon. So please, no haters assuming that I just don't know what authentic Vietnamese food tastes like. Also, they do cater to Caucasians to some extent here, but I can't really blame then based on the location of this place. They are smack in the middle of the LP douchery. I just really can't imagine a bunch of people in this neighborhood lining up for Pho with tripe, intestines, balls, and tendons. With that being said, the food at Simply It is good, fresh, affordable, and there are at least a handful of items that are pretty authentic. I personally like the beef Pho (it's simple, but definitely passable for a decent bowl of Pho), the egg rolls, and the Banh Xeo (Saigon Crepe). This is what I usually get because this is what I would want if I were going to Argyle Street, but often don't due to my laziness (and at night it's my fear of all the crazy vagrants). One thing I would advise not getting - the Banh Mi sandwiches. I'm not crazy about them here - and there are a handful of places, both around Argyle street and in other neighborhoods that make a mean, mean Banh Mi sandwich - I wouldn't want to ruin the experience of the glorious Bahn Mi sandwich here. Go to Nu Lan, Bon Bon or Ba Le for one of those. I also adore the owner, Tuan. Nicest man in the world. Very thankful for and appreciative of his patrons - and he lets you know it. He often throws in something on the house - seriously I probably get something for free about 50% of the time I go there. Who does that? And I love that he brings complimentary fresh fruit with the check after your meal. My mom always used to end our meals the same way (with fruit, not a check). A couple of other plusses - they deliver and it's BYOB.
