Pros- -Was seating right away on a Friday night @ 8:45pm -Ambience was nice Cons- -Mango Margarita tasted like water with a hint of tequila -Took quite a while to get our waitresses attention about said margarita, she was busy chatting it up with another table -Cuban chicken was bland, no flavor at all! -Overpriced
