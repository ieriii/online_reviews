I went here a few days ago with a friend of mine. The food was EXCELLENT. The decor was nice and we were really impressed by the bus boy's water pouring skills. Seriously, he's a pro. There are two things keeping me from giving this 5 stars.  A. Its a little expensive (I'm a total cheapskate.) B. I was looking at the drink menu, and found a major faux pas. They have a couple of things listed as "martinis" where the main ingredient is rum. A martini never contains rum. EVER. The end.
