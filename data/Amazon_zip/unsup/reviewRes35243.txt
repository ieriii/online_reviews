I went with a group of about 14 friends last Wednesday. We had reservations and had requested that 2 ducks be set aside for us. Service from the start was quite slow. It's a huge restaurant and they did seem to be quite busy with a large group in the back. It took them quite awhile to get to us and to take our orders. We asked to have an additional duck added to our order. After about 20 minutes (some people had food already) they came out to inform us they had no extra ducks. This would have been fine if they had told us this initially, but at this point we were all quite hungry after watching some of our friends finish their food. When the ducks did finally come out they were delicious. It was my first time with duck and I really enjoyed it - particularly the fried rice. It's BYOB but with a corkage fee as they have a full bar there. Aside from the service issues, the food was all quite good and I will go back, but with a smaller group and ensuring that we requested the exact number of ducks ordered.
