We had a large party of 8 at Glenn's for a 30th B-day dinner. If you've been there, you know it's small and 8 is a large crowd. I was both surprised and delighted when i called Tues night for a Thursday dinner and they had room. I have been here for brunch MANY times and love, love love it every time I go. Dinner, not as good. The waiter was great after a rather long pause, I really like the options both on the menu and board but my dinner was lacking. I ordered the Halibut with asparagus and roasted red potatoes as a side. The fish was a tad overcooked, the asparagus bland but the potatoes were good. Definitely go back, especially for brunch.
