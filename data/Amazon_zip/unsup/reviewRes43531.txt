I've gone by this place a dozens time and finally tried it. My boyfriend & I each had the crabcake sandwich. It's wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst. I was very disappointed in the cookie/cakes/brownie/cupcake counter. Everything looked incredible, but the glass door to the dessert case was left wide open. There were bugs flying in & out. I don't understand why some restaurants do that. The outdoor seating area is nice, but there are a bunch of places up & down Division that have outdoor seating. I'll visit one of those places before coming back here.
