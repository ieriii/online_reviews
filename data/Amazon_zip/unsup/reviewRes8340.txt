Well, this place was good. I enjoyed my meal here. It's just not a place I would go back to. Don't just think think crust, think... the real authentic Italian stuff. It's just different then most people expect, I think. Service was great and our pizza's (including one of the specials) tasted good. In the end, though, i felt like I had an average meal for too much money. The gelato, though, was AWESOME.
