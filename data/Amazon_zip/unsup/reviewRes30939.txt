My new favorite steakhouse in Chicago. I had a $1000+ business dinner here for a party of 5 (but we did order several bottles of wine and the seafood tower). I love how the service was just amazing. The men at the table were able to get NFL draft updates from the manager, we had the dry ice and lights presentation of the amazing seafood tower (make sure you confirm what and how expensive this is before hand because our server went a little over board but we managed to finish it), steaks were presented on sizzling plates and we had like 6 attendants serving us our sides on each plate. I got a thank you call the next day for my visit. I highly recommend this place for business dinners and will definitely will be bringing more customers and friends here. I had a petite filet, loved the lobster mash, butter cake desert, asparagus side were the favorites at our table. Oh, and how could I forget the pretzel bread basket! Yum!!!
