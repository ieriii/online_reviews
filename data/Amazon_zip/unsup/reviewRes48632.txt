I like David R.'s review of 4/26--we must have been drinking the same Kool-Aid, though our parties apparently did not order exactly the same things. My friend and I passed around a pistachio fig scone, weisswurst, hash browns with ramps, a pretzel, and an omelette with gruyere and trumpet mushrooms. These were all excellent, though we did also get a totally forgettable (though not bad) sandwich with a fried egg and some meat which I won't bother to look up. The noise level was energetic but not uncomfortable (i.e., not a Blackbird migraine). It was busy, but they seated us immediately at a nice table by the window as we'd requested. Service was friendly, professional, and attentive. I hope I'm not getting anyone in trouble by mentioning that they gave us a free crumb cake when we asked for a second scone to take away but they were already out (not their fault, we didn't ask about a second one until we were ready to go).
