My favorite restaurant in Lakeview. Great drinks, amazing food, cozy atmosphere and the friendliest staff. The blackened shrimp appetizer is amazing - so are the cod brittles. The bartenders make great drinks - love Lisa and another shorter cute girl. Patrick, Bred, Cristina, Debbie and Spark are my favorites in the restaurant. They treat you like you like gold - like you are the only patron in the place. Love this place. Love it!
