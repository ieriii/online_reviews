Hot Doug's is a must-do for Chicago natives. The hot dogs / sausages are delicious and creative, definitely. Kangaroo?!? Foie Gras?!? Rattlesnake!?! In a sausage?!? Was it worth an hour wait in the cold? I'd say yes. But for me, a lot of it came down to a rite of passage - ensuring that I did not live in Chicago but fail to go to the city's most esteemed hot dog stand. Kind of like going to a Bears game when it is below freezing or to the Taste of Chicago when it is boiling outside. No pain, no gain, right? I'm not fully sure it lived up to all of my expectations - I don't see this as a regular stopping point - but worth doing at least once and I'll probably drag my out of town friends there too.
