I came here with high hopes and was definitely impressed by the large number of delicious side dishes and the seafood pancake, but I've definitely had better kbbq meats elsewhere. We had the seafood pancake as appetizer, and it was delicious. A little bit crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, it was full of flavor with a generous amount of seafood. For the grill, we had the pork belly and the bulgogi. The pork belly was very bland, and they give you a plate of salt and oil to dip it in (which helps, but not by much). Not a big fan. The bulgogi had more flavor to it, but nothing special. The meat came in tiny broken pieces as opposed to the large, juicy pieces you see at some other places.
