The single star is because yes, this bar has awesom drinks and once you get inside the service is fairly good. However, both of those positives are almost entirely negated by the doorman and the inconsiderate way in which they treat their potential patrons prior to allowing them entrance (where they then charge approximately $15 per drink - which is fine in some places, but more than almost any other place in Chicago.) I have been several times and am always frustrated and a little insulted by the rudeness of the doorman (always the same guy.)  Once we got in almost immediately, because one of my party gave him some money. Every other time, we have waited for over an hour. That is both ridiculous and inconsiderate for a place that refuses to take reservations and does not provide a comfortable waiting area. This past weekend I brought some friends from out of town, one a 30 year old from France.  We waited for an hour, were called and then the doorman asked for our ids. My French friend (a 30 year old with facial hair and some gray) presented a valid French id. The doorman refused to accept it and would not let him in. They were with me for the entire weekend, we went to two clubs and multiple bars; the Violet Hour doorman was the only person to even question his id.Just as a side note, I am not someone who refuses to stand in line. I am more than willing to wait, or pay extra for bottle service, if it is the type of bar/club/restaurant where either is necessary. However, I expect to be treated well, and the Violet Hour (because of its doorman and the waiting area) completely fails in this respect. I cannot remember a single incident where I was ever treated as poorly as I was at the Violet Hour this weekend (primarily because of the doorman/waiting area).  Frankly, lots of places have perfectly good drinks and I would rather go somewhere that doesn't treat its customers like crap.Needless to say I won't ever be going back.
