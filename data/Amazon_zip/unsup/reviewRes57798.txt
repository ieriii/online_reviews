I've been to Nana's twice it was great the first time and even better the second time. The food is fresh and has incredible flavor. They are family friendly and a much needed addition to Bridgeport. I went with my family and my daughter order the chicken off the kids menu and it was to delicious I wanted to order some for myself I also loved that she was able to get a salad instead of fries! Even if your not from the neighborhood it's well worth the ride the food is amazing!
