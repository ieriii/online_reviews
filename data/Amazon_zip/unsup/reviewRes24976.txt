This place has become my favorite tapas in Chicago. I have been there twice since but the second experience was just perfect with Eddie serving us. We did not get the fixed menu this time because we might be too full so Eddie got a sense of what we might like. He choose a selection of red for our flight and ended loving all three that we needed the names of each. The next day we ended up at Binny's buying several bottles. I'm almost done trying most of the menu and these are these are my favorites: Tocino, bacon dates, Mushroon Arroz, and Padron Peppers. The best part of the meal was the ending, Eddie suggested this wonderful fresh cherry puree drink and it was just perfect.
