So this place is "romantic"...and they have a live guitar guy in a corner, but the ceilings are kinda low, the tables are kind of close together, and the tables are narrow. Your first thought is if you are trapped in a wine cellar and where's the nearest exit. The food is especially "meh". I like fondue, I don't love it, but the main entree doesn't warrant this place to have amazing food. You are cooking the meats in oil so you'll have to be careful of the splatter. It doesn't really give the food that much flavor. Yes, there are sauces, but I think its worth coming here for cheese or chocolate fondue and just skip the meal. I hate to say this, but I think the Melting Pot has better fondue. At least you can cook your meats in different flavors of broth, which gives the food more flavor than just oil. if it hadn't been for a http://restaurant.com coupon, I probably wouldn't have come since I don't think the full price is worth it. Its great for if you want to have more of a fun date and not the typical meal. Its definitely not for the typical foodie.
