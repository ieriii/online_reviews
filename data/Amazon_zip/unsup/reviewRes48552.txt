We had high hopes for Publican. Having arrived via Amtrak on the way to NYC, we had a six hour layover. Since food figures prominently in our lives, I researched and decided Publican was the place to go. Arriving, we found the space to be well designed. It had a definite German beer hall influence combined with a bit of Prarie style. Understated, with craftsmanship evident in the simple furnishing. The seating is mainly in communal tables with some high round standup tables and peripheral two and four tops. We went for a two top. The focus of the Publican is beer and food sourced from local purveyors, particularly hog farmers. The beer list is monumental with a large section of Belgians, the holy land of beer. The menu is not large and offers both small plates and large. We started with local beer and then later went to Belgian. Our meal included Walleyed Pike in fried morsel form and Porchetta, theirs being a pork belly rolled with herbs, roasted, and then sliced in a thick slice. The Pike was excellent, but the Porchetta was tough and stringy. The flavor was great, though. The main problems was the service. I hate it when the wait staff is just going through the motions. Our waiter must was so mentally groggy that he paid little attention to our needs and did not really want to offer much info. Furthermore, his personal hygiene was poor and his uniform was not clean. It ended up being a ho-hum choice for our one night in Chicago. If the service had been better and the Porchetta not tough, I would have given the place another star.
