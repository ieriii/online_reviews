Love love love this place. Get there early. You'll wait after 10 on the weekends, but even after an hour the food is more than worth it. Pancakes are awesome! Love the staff and can't get enough of this place. No alcohol, though, so don't come here if you're looking for mimosas/bloodys. More of a typical "breakfast" place than "brunch."
