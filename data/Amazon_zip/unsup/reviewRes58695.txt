Ambiance was wonderful with a lot of energy. The hostess sat us at a table and there was only 1 drink menu for five of us. We had to get our menu as no one attended to us. The food was good - flatbread with rib meat was my favorite. Drinks are very over-priced.If you are over 5'5 and sitting in one of the wooden chairs, you will be most uncomfortable. This may sound strange but when you are paying that much $ for a lingering meal, you want to be comfortable. The seat of the chair is not deep enough.
