I moved from Washington State and have been searching for good Thai food in Chicago. Good Thai food should be fresh and spicy. So far Opart is the first to serve me spicy food. I was so pleased! I sniffled, my lips burned and I broke out in a little sweat! Thank you Opart for a wonderful dinner. My only disappointment is that they serve Crab Rangoon. This is not Thai food it is American Chinese. Stay true to Thai, don't Americanize it!!!
