Fogo 2 Go, I wish I could quit you! If I could manage it, I'd lose 10 lbs instantly. This is one of my most beloved pizza places in Chicago; the ingredients are fresh, the crust and sauce are quite good, the staff are super friendly, and it's flipping cheap! If a break from deep dish, ultra heavy pizza is something you are in need of... this is the answer! Also, their broiled chicken is pretty damn tasty - everyone loves chicken... even vegetarians (shhhhhhh... we won't tell on you!) Your taste buds will second this review. Trust me!
