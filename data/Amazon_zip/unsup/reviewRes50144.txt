I dig this place for several reasons (cue the list!): - Plentiful outdoor seating, replete with large TV for relevant sporting events - Tasty food, including such winners as the pulled pork, mac & cheese, and wide selection of potato products - diverse, if not vast, beer selection, including personal favorite Delirium Nocturnum - cocktail list that includes beer-based martinis, which i hear are good - bottle service (what?) that is actually really reasonable (~$120 for a bottle of the goose?) if you have a bunch of alcoholics with you In the crowded 2 block stretch of Division on either side of Damen, the Fifty/50 is a totally respectable spot that gets even better in the summer.
