Good main fish dishes, rude service, BAD catfish sandwich. My girlfriend took me to Glenn's Diner for a nice dinner tonight. The hostess was very nice and even on a Friday night we got a table without waiting long and not reservation. We ordered the arctic char special and a catfish po'boy and split the two. The char was spectacular! The po'boy was good, great sauce, but then I bit a piece that was obviously uncooked or a bad part of the fish (rubbery, unchewable, blech). When I called our waitress over she took it back to the kitchen. When she came back she said that it was fine and the catfish maybe just wasn't the fish for me. Nonsense! I've had catfish dozens of times, even cooked it myself! This was a bad bit of fish. And I know that because I'm writing this in between trips to the bathroom: I've been poisoned! Furthermore, after I complained the waitress offered me something else (soup or an appetizer), but I no longer had an appetite. However, my girlfriend had dessert and she charged us for it! And she was very rude when bringing us the check, just sort of shoved it at us without a smile. I'd been thinking about taking some friends here for my 30th birthday bash. I think NOT.
