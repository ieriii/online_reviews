Although you'll most likely have to wait quite a while before getting a table, you will be blown away once you step off the escalator into the unique second story dining area. The interior is very well designed and if you can, try to get a table with a window overlooking Michigan Ave. As a Chicago native, I'm not a big fan of touristy restaurants like these but I cannot deny- Grand Lux has it figured out. For you under 21's like myself, the strawberry lemonade is incredible- real strawberries in it and sugar on the rim. Portions are very generous and have all the variety in the world. I ordered duck potstickers as an appetizer- fantastic. I think the best thing on their menu are the different pastas and you can't forget the baked-to-order desserts. I recommend the beignets or the creme brulee...they bring out both chocolate and vanilla. Overall, Grand Lux is a dining experience that is pleasing to the eye, filling, and delicious.
