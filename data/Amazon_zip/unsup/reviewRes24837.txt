Holy Toledo, what a great experience! First off, the atmosphere is fun and the servers actually seem like they are excited about the food...and they want you to be excited too. And I was. Let me tell you...I was. La Mesa de Jose--the tasting menu--is such a great value at $65 that it seems downright criminal. You just cannot imagine the beautiful treats that just keep on coming out of the kitchen...each one more delicious than the last. Plus...bonus...it's not one of those tasting menus where you'll probably end up getting something you don't want. The waiter will walk through the menu with you and will find out what you like, what you hate, etc and the chef will tailor your experience. Um, quite cool! Tasty charcuteria, piemientos de padron (lovely Spanish peppers), the croquetas, cocas (flatbreads), wagyu beef...oh my goodness...what a lovely spread! You will not be disappointed in a single dish. On to the drinks--we started with a sparkling glass of cava and then switched to the recommended bottle of wine (verdelho)--a winning combo. Not exactly an inexpensive experience. Two people ordering from the tasting menu and having drinks should expect to spend about $200 plus a tip. And you'll want to tip generously because the service is top notch. What are you waiting for?
