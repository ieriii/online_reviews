I love this place. The reasons? Our waitress Cindy who was friendly and fun. The pollo loco--panko crusted chicken with jalapenos among other things, something I've not seen elsewhere, but I sure did enjoy it. Their spider rolls, I've had them at other places but theirs are my favorite. The spicy scallop, it was so good we ordered another round. It's BYOB, always a great thing in my book. Easy parking. Green tea mochi.
