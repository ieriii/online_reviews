Some of the best dining the NW side has to offer. Excellent food, Excellent value.  I always get the Butt Steak which has "fit for a man's appetite" next to it on the menu. Pizza bread comes out first, then a loaf of fresh bread, before you even order. Meals come with soup or salad, and pasta or potato comes with meal. You will not leave this place hungry.
