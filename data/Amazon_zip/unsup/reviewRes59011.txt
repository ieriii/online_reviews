Visited Sunda on my 1st trip to Chicago and I must say- I can't wait to go back! The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Our waiter was knowledgeable and well trained on the extensive menu options. The food was amazing!! Don't be fooled by the atmosphere and local chains. The service is warm and inviting. The general manager even came over to our table to check on how our night was going and welcomed us properly to Chicago!
