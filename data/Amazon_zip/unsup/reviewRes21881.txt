I hope to update this review with a higher rating once I try XOCO the second time. I figure it must be worth trying again considering all of the 4 and 5 star reviews. Although, is it just because it's Rick Bayless? I won't even go into detail about the service or atmosphere. Just know that both are a little different and made for an awkward first time visit. Ok, maybe it was just me, but I didn't know what the hell was going on. On to the food. I ordered the Mushroom Torta. It was simply put, gross. The bread was so burnt black and hard that I could hardly bite into it. Is this what tortas are supposed to be like? If I would have known they were sandwiches with burnt hard as a rock bread, I never would have ordered one. The flavors were there, I think. But when something is burnt, that's all you're going to taste. My boyfriend had the Chicken Torta. He didn't finish it. We ordered the guacamole and chips. The guac is nothing to get excited over at all. It was definitely smooth and creamy, but the flavor was dull and bland when I was expecting something much more vibrant out of that tiny $4 cup. Like I said, I will try again. I'm hoping it was just an off day. But next time, I'm returning my sandwich if it comes out black and burnt. We ordered two sandwiches, two diet sodas and an order of guacamole. $30. Not worth it.
