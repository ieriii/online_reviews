I went here with a friend for lunch a few weeks ago. The miso salmon was good, but not great... I have to say I am a bigger fan of the Cheesecake Factory's rendition of this dish. My friend wasn't a fan of her food, but the five stars are based on the beignets alone. They were the most delicious and stole the show. I will definitely be back for these.
