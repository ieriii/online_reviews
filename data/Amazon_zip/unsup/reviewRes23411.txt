A large place with a huge menu. I found some of the food very good but some not so. Two issues were salt and olive oil. Both used liberally when cutting back would really move the flavor up to another level of quality. My baked chicken had nice flavor but was a bit dried out. The salad was just ok without a memorable dressing. My tea water was nearly cold and when I asked for hot water the manager told me it was hot. I told him it was my decision what was hot and what was not hot and I eventually got some hot water.
