Loved the food at Publican! Just went for the first time in June, 2011 and the atmosphere was great. Was worried we would get stuck at communal seating but we had our own table and the communal table looked nicely spread out. The short ribs melted off the bone. The sirloin was fantastic. We ordered the waffle and strawberry shortcake for desserts. The waffle was truly fabulous but the shortcake was hard, difficult to eat and just not very unique. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the service was prompt but not super helpful. We asked for recommendations for a beef option and his reply was "well we don't have a lot of beef options so you'll just have to pick one". Can't wait to go back and try some more dishes!
