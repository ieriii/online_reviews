Holy crap is this place amazing! The waiter recommended the lamb chops and it came with these two great sauces on the side. The chops were so good I didn't even want to use the sauce but then I felt bad because the sauce was so good! So we ordered another round of chops! Unbelievable! The lamb chops are expensive ($48 for 4) but so damn worth it! Everything else we had was great with the exception of the paella which the rice seemed a bit overcooked. Scallops were amazing! They even brought a few items out for free which was a nice thing. Very expensive place but worth every penny. Mmmmmmmmmmmmm....
