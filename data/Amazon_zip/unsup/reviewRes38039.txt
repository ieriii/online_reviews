I am a fan! Giordano's is my first go to for delivery when I am in Chicago. Sure it is a bit pricey, but the food is always of good quality and downright yummy! I had the thin crust Pepperoni and Cheese + Cesar Salad tonight. They said it would take 1 hour for delivery and they were here within 40 minutes.  Thanks for being my pizza away from home :)
