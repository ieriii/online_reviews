I get the sense I missed something here. I assumed the food was on par w/ the drinks but I must've been mistaken. Where did I get this gross misconception from? Did I just order the wrong item? Had the Workingman Burger and while tasty, didn't really win me over. I don't really know what happened. It had bacon, beer onions, cheddar... where was the tastiness? Was I going mad? None of flavors stood out. It somewhat felt like London. I also had the Cross of Gold and I thoroughly enjoyed that. Tasty and not too filling. A perfect drink after a crazy day of work and to unwind w/ your friends.  Go for the drinks. Skip the burgers.  I think I'll try their pizzas next.
