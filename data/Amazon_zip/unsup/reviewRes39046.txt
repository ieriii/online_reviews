We just moved to the Old Irving/Villa neighborhood and this was one of our first restaurant stops. WE LOVE THIS JOINT. In addition to really great pizza, they also have some nice entrees as well as great bread at the table. If that weren't enough, the waitstaff is AMAZING! If you know what's good for you, ask for Jennifer - she's a riot and will keep you in stitches all night. We were able to meet the owners on our last visit and that made us fall even more in love with it. Is it fancy and cutting-edge? No. But, if you want to feel like you spent your hard-earned dollars with people who work hard for their money and serve up the best food possible, you're in the right spot. If you're really lucky, you'll show up on a night when the accordian/keyboard player is there. The guy's a relic, but you can't help but love him. Awesome place. We plan to be regulars for the rest of our time owning our house!
