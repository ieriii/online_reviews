The five stars are for the dessert menu only. I love the baklava. Mmmm...If I didn't care about caloric intake, I would most likely eat the baklava every day. The other dessert items are good (or look good) as well. I've sampled quite a few, and no complaints there. An added bonus: everything is pretty cheap!
