My five stars are for the pizza alone! I can't really say much about their entrees since I usually get the pizza which I've probably ordered 200 of during my 12 years living in the neighborhood! Dining in? The space is great with great wait staff and a fun bartender who makes a great martini, dirty with olives stuffed w/ blue cheese! Delivery or carry out? Quick and delivered HOT! Whatever pizza you order, it will be even better if you ask them to cook it extra crispy for you and uncut (if delivered). We LOVE Calo!
