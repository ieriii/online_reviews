My friend took me here for my b-day. So many wine flights! I tried the white traveled wines which were pretty good. We got some american cheeses which were okay. I got the Moroccan pork chop which was tender and seasoned well. For the dessert we got to try different chocolate delights. The smore-styled chocolate was delicious. The place was nice and was pretty empty for a sat dinner at 530pm.
