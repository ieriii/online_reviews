Great pizza! We ordered a medium stuffed with everything in it which was more than enough for three hungry people. The multiple layers of cheese, toppings, and sauce covered crust easily topped my list for best pizza I had while visiting Chicago.  The Greek salad was meh and the service was a bit slow to get my beer refilled. But the pizza is the real reason to come here, everything else is just filler. Damn, now I'm craving this pizza. I think I'll order one to be shipped to CA
