Great hotel. Nice, well appointed, quiet rooms. Friendly, helpful staff. They don't offer a wide range of amenities and services but what they do, they do very well, including free wifi which is rare in a nice hotel. We really enjoyed our stay and will make The Talbott our go-to hotel in the Gold Coast area of Chicago.
