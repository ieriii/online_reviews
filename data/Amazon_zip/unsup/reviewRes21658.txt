I grew up eating hot dogs and fries here and now that I live across the country, Superdawg is one of the top ten things I miss about Chicago. The fries are the best I have ever had, no question. And there's something especially yummy in that ketchup! I'm not afraid of extra ketchup on fries as a rule, but their ketchup is out of this world. Especially when it's on crinkly delicious Superfries! The atmos is fantastic. The place is full of all kinds of people--a guy in a massive pickup truck decked out in Bears gear, families with kids, old couples sitting at the tables, and highschool kids in their parents' cars. You push a button and someone comes to take your empty boxes and tray away...and those ladies deserve tips for the kind of crap they must put up with from some of the kids there. It's fun to just say the names of things on the menu. Whoopercheesie! Whoopskidawg! When I visit I always go to Superdawg at least once (yes, that means that sometimes I go more than once). I don't even eat meat anymore and I'm thrilled with a grilled cheese (on dark bread!) and fries while sitting in my rented car. On one of my last trips I arrived late at night and less than 90 minutes later, I was digging into some of those fries. Superdawg is also on the way to the airport, so it's usually lunch before I fly back to SF. One time I even brought two orders of fries home in a Tupperware container I carried on the plane! (Maybe it's a good thing I moved away. I think those fries make me a little crazy.)
