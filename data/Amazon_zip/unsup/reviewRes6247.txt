I love this place!! It's not too fancy, yet still not completely casual. You can come as you are and not feel like you are out of place. I usually order the glazed salmon or the herb chicken. On occasion, I've ordered the ribs and I have yet to be let down. My husband LOVES the parmesan crusted rib-eye. If you go, you must try a martini. I'm biased to a dirty or the cosmo wherever I go. I must say, they have one of the best in the city. My friends try other types and I have not heard a complaint yet. I really love that you can bring the kids and there is a great menu for them as well.
