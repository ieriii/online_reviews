What an extensive drink menu?! Our server actually had the whole thing memorized and was able to answer our questions about the menu with surprising ease. My friend, his girl, and I went this past Sunday late afternoon to grab a drink. I was famished after a long day, and decided to get the burger. Suffice to say it did not disappoint. It was pretty juicy, and the brioche bun complimented the burger patty well along with french fries battered in beef fat. Yum! We had a round of Three Floyd's Zombie Dust. A difficult drink to come-by, especially on tap. So I've been told. Haven't made it to the liquor store lately, so I can't adequately confirm that particular statement yet. What I can confirm is that the burger was well worth the price ($12 meal including the fries). It's definitely made its way into my top 5 to join Davanti Enoteca's Davanti Burger, Three Aces's Ace Burger, and Kuma's Corner's Solace Burger. Might've even displaced the Ace burger in my standings. Also, whiskey flights?! I honed in on that section of the menu for a good 5 minutes. Flight of 3 single malt bourbons for $14. Not bad. This being my second visit to this establishment, I didn't realize how much I was lacking in my knowledge of whiskeys. Albeit, I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur or aficionado, but whiskey is my default drink. Between the three of us, we maybe recognized only 5-6 of the brands in a long list. Could've used a one-liner descriptor under each selection. Might've helped a tad. Educate us! The first time I went, I met up with some Logan Sq residents for the $5 special apps Mondays. Think it was Shrimp fritters with black garlic aioli for $5 + $1 cans of Milwaukee's Best. Again, not a bad deal. The free shots of whiskey didn't hurt any. Except I'm not into fritters. Luckily I could enjoy the can of Milwaukee's Best with a shot of bourbon for only $3. Made my night. Plus there were a couple marketeers walking around giving out free samples of some locally distilled whiskeys.
