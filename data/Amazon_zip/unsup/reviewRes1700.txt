These hot dogs are freakin amazing! Between my two friends and myself, we ordered 7 hot dogs. All of them were delicious, but the two really mind-blowing ones are the foie gras and the alligator dogs. Wow... Just wow. Its been almost a year since I've visited Chicago, and I still find myself thinking about this place constantly! Hot Doug's was completely worth the hour wait in line (at minimum), and the long taxi ride (as it is located a bit outside of the city).
