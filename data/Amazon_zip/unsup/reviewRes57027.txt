Spending an hour at Piece is a thoroughly enjoyable way to kill some time. The pizza is surprisingly good, and the place has its own microbrews! There's nothing like drinking some house specials and washing it down with a solid red pizza with pepperoni! They have several wide-screen TVs tuned to sports, so you don't really even have to bring anyone you care to listen to in order to be entertained! I'm a fan of the Worryin' Ale. I have yet to get there when they've had their stout available, but I hear it is excellent. I'm even a fan of their white pizza, which ordinarily I do not much enjoy. Only downside to this place is that it tends to get very busy during peak hours, of which I am not partial to. For a quiet brew and pizza, there's nowhere better in the city.
