4.5 stars. There seems to always be a line here and considering it really isn't near much, it stands out... The only disappointment was when we found out duck fat fries were only served on Fridays, so we missed those. I was impressed how nice the workers were inside even though it was busy. You would think there would be no place to sit, but people tend to eat quick and leave to clear table space. The Chicago dog is legit and so are the tots and pigs in a blanket (especially w/ cheese sauce). The bacon wrapped dog was good and the prices were good. They did have some crazy dogs that were expensive, but they're unique. This place is worth the wait and one of the best places I ate in Chicago.
