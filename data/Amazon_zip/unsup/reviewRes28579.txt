Pequod's has a very strange logo and a pretty good deep dish pizza. They definitely go lighter on the toppings and heavier on the sauce, but the carmelized crust offsets that to make a darn good pizza. It's also fairly easy to get a table here, most people seem to leave quickly after seeing a crowded front room not realizing there's far more space upstairs. Also, they deliver during lunch on weekdays, unlike the Lou Malnati's on Wrightwood. Definitely a bit expensive for what you're getting in my opinion, but the carmelized crust is unique enough that it's good to go Pequod's every once and a while.
