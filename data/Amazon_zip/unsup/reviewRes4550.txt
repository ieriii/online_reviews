I finally got to the Green Mill for the first time, after living in Chicago for almost two years. I liked it tremendously because they obviously take music very seriously there (you are only allowed to talk between songs and between sets). Also, the room itself is really cool, really ornate in a good, weathered kind of way, and the bartender was very good. I went because my friend's landlord's (!) band, the Gypsy Rhythm Project, was playing. They were excellent! I had a great time. The place was nearly perfect. My only complaint is that drinks are a little expensive. There's a cover, which is fine because I don't at all mind giving money to the musicians, but I paid $4 for a Schlitz, and I did have to raise an eyebrow at that.
