Non food Highlights- - service was great. Our waiter was friendly and down to earth - have great drink selection, from bud lights to pimms cups - the whole feel of the place is very neat. It looks upscale from the outside, but not all pretentious - the upstairs reminded me of a lofted area in a plantation house. It looked as though there was a room you could rent out which was beautiful- looked like a bachelor party was there Food highlights- - big portions - comes with 4 BBQ sauces - cornbread is awesome! - price is great for food and location of the restaurant - hushpuppies worth a try - chocolate mousse pretzel crust salted caramel dessert is a MUST!! My favorite part of the meal- a real stand out Not a huge fan of the Mac and cheese. We got a few combo platters. None of the meats were out of this world, but consistently good.
