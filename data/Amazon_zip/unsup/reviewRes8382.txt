I am a huge fan of Brazillian steakhouses I've eaten at these around the country and am very critical. Fogo de Chao passes with flying colors. This is my second visit to the location, and everything was on point. A usual complain at Churracarias is that the meat is always well done. Not here, you actually get what you pay for, a choice of rare, medium or well-done. EXCELLENT ! Heed all warnings of pacing yourself or you will regret it. You get 16 cuts of meat, and it is usually my mission to get all (Mission accomplished !). I have to say the leg of lamb and the top round are my top two favorites. Closely followed by the Parmesan crusted pork tenderloin( something I have only seen here). Another trend with most Churracarias is that they usually marinate the meat in just sea salt. NOT HERE, you can actually taste the spices, they are variant and amazing. Also the closer you get to the center of the meat skewer, it gets bland, again.....not here, it was as flavorful as the first cut. The salad bar has the usuals, green salads, cold cuts, and mayo based salads (try the russian with green apples, crasins and chicken) . You also get 3 hot entrees on your table, mashed potato's , fried plantains and rolls, warm and buttery...hmmmm.... Fogo De Chao has not failed to impress me again, from their quick service, vast salad bar and excellent choice of 'well cooked' meat. Its a must try and you get what you pay for, all $50 of it.
