Probably one of the best meals I've had ever. It's a performance of what food can be. Having Grant Achatz prepare our dessert was amazing and getting a tour of the kitchen and prep areas downstairs by him personally was even better. Be prepared for an evening and come prepared to sit for a least 4 hours or more. One word to describe it = Awesome!!!
