What can I say. Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. My only complaint (which is personal so didn't effect rating) is that their beer is way too hoppy for me. With that said they have a great bottle selection! Fish and Chips - amazing Bacon fat popcorn - amazing Burgers - amazing Thank you owners for investing in the neighborhood. Business owners pay attention - if you build in the square we will come!!! Gentrification - let it rain!!!!
