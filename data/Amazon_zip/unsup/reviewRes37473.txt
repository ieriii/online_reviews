While in chicago for a quick 36 hour trip (I had never been to chicago before) and immediately fell in love with this place. Maybe it was strolling past the large cheese and aged balsamic vinegars (stored in a cabinet) while making it to the cafe (i was really hungry). The cafe breakfast is awesome. The crowd eating it was also very well-behaved - come here if you want a wonderful breakfast/brunch/lunch in a low-key atmosphere that won't disappoint.
