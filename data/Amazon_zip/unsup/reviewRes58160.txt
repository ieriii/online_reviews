Iv been to Mercat twicie and enjoyed both expierences very much. Had the tasting menu both times and would do it again-Food was of good quality and and was prepared with thought in mind. Dont be afraid to ask for certain dishes if you do the tasting. The braised rabbit agnolotti was fantastic-Wait staff was knowledgable about the menu very attentive.-High energy dining room-good sangrias-Not cheap
