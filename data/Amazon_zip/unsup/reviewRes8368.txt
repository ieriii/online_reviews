Salad bar was very mediocre compared to Plataforma and what was formerly Porcao in NYC, as well as the Fogo in Philly. Everything was very good and fresh but the selection was about half! I also thought the meat could be better--my favorite picanha was overly dry and flavorless, the filet mignon was so fatty and inedible the first round but much better the second round. If you're a woman, they seem to assume you want more well-cooked meat so I had to switch from medium to medium-rare. There were no ribs and only 1 type of chicken (parmesan-encrusted which was delicious) so I think the meat selection is significantly smaller too. The service was amazing though and there was lots of privacy even though they don't give you a choice of where you are seated (in one of the back rooms or in the louder/crowded center)
