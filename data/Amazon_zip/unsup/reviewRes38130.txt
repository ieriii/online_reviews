I took a trip to Chicago and second on our list, after a very long run from Grant Park and through magnificent mile was Chicago Style Pizza. I have had great pizza from Zachary's in Berkeley, CA and had to see if i could find better in Chicago.  This place was the closest I've ever had, the pizza was top notch, amazing and perfectly cooked crust, lots of quality cheese and toppings for days. The sauce was fabulous. The atmosphere was just ok, but I will come back on my next visit to the windy city. Two thumbs up!
