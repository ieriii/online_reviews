Absolutely the best burger I've found in Chicago. Amazing. The "Gruntburger" is the best: fried onions and blue cheese. OMG. They will split your burger for you if you want, which is really great for two people (it's a 1 lb burger). Also, they have great attitudes and make you feel comfortable. If you strike up a simple conversation, the bartenders will remember you the next time you go in. Just a really great place. It's definitely worth searching for a parking space!
