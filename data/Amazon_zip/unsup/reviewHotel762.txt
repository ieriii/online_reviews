I was in a wedding at the 4 seasons last weekend. We stayed here because even at $200-$300 a night its cheaper than the 4 seasons! This hotel is very convenient, very clean, very serviceable and very forgettable. The hotel bar is average, and the room decorations were so dull. I mean, white linens and 2 black and white photos? And no flat screen? Strange. I also found the lines at check in to be long and annoying each time i needed something. That being said, there are beautiful flower arrangements and the seating in the lobby is generous and well appointed. They should have hired the lobby decorator to do the rooms as well!
