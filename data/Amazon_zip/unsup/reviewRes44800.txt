So happy we stumbled upon this place. After walking around the Art Institute all morning we found ourselves starved and in the mood for authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. We asked a random guy on the side of the road where the nearest place was, and all he had to say was "Giordano's." We arrived around 3pm on a Thursday and got a table right away. Though the service itself was a little slow, we didn't mind as we were eating with an old friend and had much discussion to catch up on anyway. We ordered a large deep dish, stuffed crust 1/2 cheese, 1/2 sausage pizza. Some soda and bread held us over as we waited nearly an hour for our food to arrive, but the relaxed and very visually interesting decor of the restaurant, in addition to it's cleanliness and nice wait staff, made the wait worth it. The pizza itself is what dreams are made of. Hot, juicy, thick... mmm. We ate it up and even had some left over (that we later tried to give to a homeless person who refused - really?). It made for an EXCELLENT breakfast the next morning and a great memory of our time in Chicago.
