My hubby and I dined at Sapori Trattoria to celebrate our two-year-anniversary. It wasn't fabulous but not terrible either. I liked the food and would definitely return, but I would do a few things differently. Strategic seating: I'd make sure we have a good table in the front. I would not sit in the small room off the main dining room with the little window. It's too dark, the speakers are broken so it's eerily quiet, it's right next to the kitchen and across from the bathrooms. It's where we sat and I was unimpressed. Menu choices: Portions are HUGE! Unless we're really hungry or with a big party, I will skip an appetizer and stick with the mixed salad to start. It was enough for two and delicious! And, while I read lots of raves for the chicken pesto gnocci, it wasn't that great. Kind of dry and boring. My husband had the meat lasagna and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! We shared the coconut sorbet for desert...yum!! Dining time: We arrived at 6:00 p.m. and the restaurant was quiet. I was curious when the crowds would arrive but by 7:30 p.m. the place was hopping. Next time, I'll be sure to make reservations for 7:00-ish. I like the atmosphere to be alive when I'm dining out at a place like Sapori. Being there too early was uncomfortable. We were the server's only table, and she was a bit too eager in the beginning. Once she had more tables her flow was right on. Overall pros: Good service, good food, friendly staff, easy to find taking public transportation.
