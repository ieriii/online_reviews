My 18 year old daughter and I went to Sunda on April 1st for dinner. I made last minute reservations and they were only able to get us in at the sushi bar, but that was okay -- especially since those who were walking in at the same time as we did who didn't have reservations were told that the wait was over an hour!The service was great! Our server made recommendations that were OUTSTANDING! She was there when we need her to be and that was all that mattered! The room was filled with what looked to be groups of people - all having a great time and great conversation. The restaurant was very loud, so be prepared to use your outside voice during dinner conversation. I'm not sure if that was just where we were sitting, but it was very loud. But, we didn't mind since we were there for the food!We started with the Rock Shrimp - which was hot and tasty and crunchy - my daughter was all over it! I also ordered the pan roasted duck, which was to die for! I l really enjoy well prepared duck and my daughter had never tried it - she fell in love!! We also had the firecracker cut roll and then also had dessert! We split everything and DID NOT leaving hungry at all. I did have a nice glass of wine, which I barely finished because I was so into the food!This will be a special occasion place for me, since it is a bit over my regular price point, though I felt that for the quality of food and the standard of service - this was a great value!I was exited to share a new type of food experience with my daughter and will maybe try Sunda for lunch the next time with her to see the "lighter/quieter" side of Sunda!
