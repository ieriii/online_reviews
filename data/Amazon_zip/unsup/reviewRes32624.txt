I love The Chicago Diner. I first came here about five years ago, and was especially impressed by a vegan mango shake, way before my vegetarian/veganish days. I've been coming ever since, having never been disapointed. The food is always great, service is friendly and likable, atmosphere is social and totally all-american, old school diner. The sweet potato quesillda, dagwood sandwich, mac n cheese, sweet potato fries, kale salad, karma burger, black bean burger, chicken cesar wrap, and beer/drink selection will knock your socks off. The Smores shake is the best damn milkshake/ smoothie/ice cream treat I've ever had in my damn life. Fathoming that it is vegan is almost bizarre, and hella good. I've ordered it the last 4 times I've been there (in the past 2 months) and the last time I upgraded to the larger size. Anyways, pay Chicago Diner a visit. Plz get a smores shake.
