A very good friend of mine & fellow foodie/Yelper in Chicago recommended Bongo Room after a fun night out. She told me that they have red velvet pancakes, so it was an EASY decision to have brunch here. They didn't have the red velvet pancakes on the menu the day I was there, but they had an impressive list of yummy pancake dishes to choose from. I was close to choosing the strawberry-banana pancakes after seeing another diner at another table with a big fat stack covered with juicy looking strawberries, but my stomach told me to go with the banana-heath bar pancakes. Listen to your stomachs people, for they are most wise. The wait for the food wasn't bad, but the anticipation was nearly killing me. I sipped a tasty mango flavored iced tea while I waited. The friendly waitress brought both my friend & I gigantic plates with equally gigantic pancakes, covered in plump slices of banana & a butter toffee cream sauce. We also got the hash browns, which were chunky red-skin potatoes cooked to a heavenly crisp. I also added bacon as a side, because no pancake should go without bacon. But oh those pancakes. They looked so scrumptious I had to take a couple of sexy pictures of them before I dug in. I'm posting them for your delight! The sauce on top was a perfect compliment to the perfectly ripe bananas & the moist cakes; I didn't even THINK about syrup. Eating that delicious breakfast made my entire face happy. I couldn't finish the entire portion, but it even reheated well later. I could've turned a cartwheel in the middle of the restaurant. Mark my words, I WILL eat here again.
