If I had to describe the perfect dining experience, this would be it. I personally had 4 cinnamon rolls and 3 pans of bacon, together. I tried re-rolling the bacon in the rolls and it just turned out to be a sticky sweet mess that I was more than happy to clean up. Like the pig under the Flintstones sink. I was one happy PIS! The glazed ham, house roast beef and turkey were all great as well. The 3 buck mimosas were a steal. And 4 dollars for fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. You can't even get that deal in the burbs. But at 43 bucks a head including drinks this whole brunch was on the cheap. We then went on the roof to have a couple more drinks in the sunshine. What a great place and the atmosphere, from the huge dining room to the deck are worth the price of admission.
