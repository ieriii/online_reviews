This place had been on my radar since I moved to Chicago and I finally got to eat there, after waiting in line for about half an hour. Is the food good? Yes. Is it worth the hype and the wait? Probably not. There are many other superb breakfast/brunch joints in Chicago to satisfy. This is more of a tourist trap than anything else. I had a tex-mex scramble or some such variation thereof. It was good but I didn't die from pleasure while eating it. The coffee is pretty tasty and you can get it in hazelnut, which is my favorite.  Our server was clearly bored with her job or maybe with life. She wasn't very attentive or friendly. I can sympathize with her working in the food service industry myself but if you want a good tip you better at least smile. Sheesh.
