Dear Milk and Honey, I love you. No they don't have a huge menu but they are amazing at what they do. I've gone here many times and I've never had a bad sandwich, event he ruben was tasty and I usually hate sauerkraut. No,this place isn't cheap but even Panera has sandwiches that run 7 bucks and up. The service is fast and the employees are always friendly. Fortunately I've never had a problem finding a table, either.
