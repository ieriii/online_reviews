I've always enjoyed Wilde for a random mellow beer. I went to brunch today, and my Wilde-loving bubble was burst. I got the crabcake benedict, and despite being hungry I couldn't eat it. The food was lukewarm when it arrived. It tasted like old smelly fish, and the english muffin was so hard that I had trouble cutting it with a knife. I gave up after a couple bites and just ate my side of fruit. The coffee was pretty bad, which isn't surprising in a bar setting, so I'll give them a pass on that. My dining companion was unimpressed with his skillet. I tried a bite, it was mediocre but nowhere near as bad as my meal. The waiter was MIA most of the meal, and when he finally showed up at the end he removed my almost full plate of food without comment, and ran off before I could let him know of our difficulties. Our bill was over $30 before the (undeserved) tip for two brunch items and one coffee, which is fairly high for the low quality food we were served. With tasty Kanela Club north of here, I don't see myself trying Wilde's brunch again. Maybe if I can get past this nightmare of a brunch I'll stop in again for a beer. I'll give them one star for nice atmosphere and another in hope of improvement.
