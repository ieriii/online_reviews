I used to live a block away and when I moved I chose a Seoul Sensation Korean Burrito from Crisp to be my final Chicago meal. The beef bulgogi, crisp romaine lettuce, corn, carrots, rice and tomatoes. Yumm.... Allison's Atomic sauce is the perfect sauce. I think it might be a simple mixture of chili paste and mayo but I can't be sure. The Foodie's Choice Crisp and the Seoul Steak sandwich are also amazing. Everyone I've taken to Crisp has fallen instantly in love. My south side friends were bummed they don't deliver that far and my coworkers would try to trade me lunch when I brought leftovers. My only regret is I never tried the wings. I'll be visiting in December so I'll definitely do it then (if only I can resist not getting a burrito).
