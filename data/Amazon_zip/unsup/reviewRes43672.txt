My girlfriend took me to Kinzie Chop House for my birthday dinner, and it made for a delicious end to a jam-packed birthday weekend. I had a peppercorn-encrusted 12 oz. filet cooked to perfection, which is to say that it was cooked on the inside and very, very rare on the inside. Just how I like it! The filet was a very thick cut, too, which I find important for a perfectly prepared filet. It was easily among the best steaks I have ever enjoyed. The salad and sides were very good, too. I especially liked the broccoli fondue. I'm not going to get a long-winded about this, but we were delighted with our meal and will definitely be back!
