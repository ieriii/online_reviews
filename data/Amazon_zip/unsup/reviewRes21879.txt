Much smaller than I thought it would be - but the staff was great and very accommodating of our large group. Actually, we had made a reservation and they called to confirm and were very on top of things. We got there pretty early and the place filled in very quickly! It was GREAT to take advantage of their half off margarita pitchers, even though I thought a pitcher there was a little pricey full price. Our food was all great and we had a blast. The one thing was, being so small, we really weren't allowed the opportunity to sit and talk. They pretty much asked us if we were done to leave, but we were occupying a lot of space, and there were quite a few people waiting for tables so I sort of understand.... Just to note if you are going with a group - they really don't want to split bills between credit cards so either make sure you all have cash or one person is willing to put it on their card.
