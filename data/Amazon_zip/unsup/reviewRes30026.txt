I love meat (that's what she said). Where would I be without meat? I've contemplated about becoming a vegetarian, but one of the reasons I don't want to become a veggie is because I would never want to eat out. I am an avid fan of going out to eat. I don't know why, but there are so many things about going out to restaurants that I love from the quality of the food, the service, to just the social aspect to it. So when I'm really craving a particular brand of food and I got this group ready to go, and then we here, "oh yeah, I'm vegetarian", I automatically cringe because it's like telling someone, hey let's have sex, oh btw, I have an std... But when I came to the Chicago Diner, I was thoroughly impressed by their food. Everything is vegetarian. EVERYTHING. And to this day, I refuse to believe that my cheesesteak sandwich was vegetarian. It tasted exactly like meat and I was shocked. If every restaurant that I went to was like the Chicago Diner, I could easily become a vegetarian, but of course, it's not (thank goodness). Their sweet potato fries are the best and everything there is just solid, good food.  The wait is extremely long. Don't expect to get a table just walking up without waiting a decent amount of time, especially for dinners on the weekend. But overall, it was a good experience and definitely want to go back again.
