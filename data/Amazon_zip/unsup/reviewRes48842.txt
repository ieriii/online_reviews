Loved the Publican! I'd say the biggest problem I had was deciding what to eat. We ordered some sausages for appetizers: the blood sausage was excellent, however, I did want a little more from the Boudin. The spicy pork rinds were a bit of a disappointment, not bad but comparable to something sold by Frito Lay, I was looking for a bigger crunch and a stronger spice. Our friend ordered the farm chicken and this was very tender, it comes with a grilled summer sausage on the side and this was so tasty that I now grill summer sausages when I barbeque. However, by far the best dish of the evening was the porchetta, this was a succulent cut of meat wrapped in pork belly and herbs and roasted, it comes out on a plate size cut, and my wife and I split it with a little help from our friend. This dish alone was well worth the price and the visit. Last but not least, the beer selection is excellent and the staff is incredibly knowledgeable about which beers best suit which dishes. I had three and each was well balanced with the food before me. I tipped extra on this alone.
