Awful Service. Average, watered down food.  Bar Service - awful. Expected a long line - no problem as it was expected. But if you are going to have guests waiting so long then the bar tender and servers should be smiling and welcoming once you are in. Not the case. We sat at the bar for a drink after waiting for a hour in line to just to get in. Then we are greeted by a gruff, unfriendly bar tender. When we asked about a particular margarita he just slapped down a drink menu and walked away. Okay so if you're going to have a bad attitude and seem bothered by the guests than the drinks better be awesome. Nope. Drinks were awful. I have had much better margaritas and mojitos at Pure Tacqueria in Atlanta at half the price. Table Service - awful. We then go to the table and get the world's laziest waitress. Even though the other servers were slammed they at least stopped to talk to their guests - not ours - she did not explain any of the food we asked about and after taking our order (and forgetting to bring us our appetizers) she stood behind a serving station and spent a good 10 minutes writing her name and doodling on her starbucks coffee paper cup. Meanwhile no guacamole... She blamed it on the kitchen of course.  Food - average. When the food came - it was very average. Nothing special and kind of bland.  The chips were greasy and the salsa actually tasted like a canned version. The rice was fairly good, the beans were average and the main course was just blah. Think this place is all about hype from the chef being on television. But he should probably check on his actual restaurants a bit more. I have a feeling if he were around a little more than it might hopefully be a little better. Would not recommend the experience based on my visit.
