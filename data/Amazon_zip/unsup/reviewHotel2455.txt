Its a huge hotel, this Hilton. Don't get lost. If you're driving to it, parking is a bit tricky. Do not pull up in front of it on Michigan Ave. Instead, drive past, turn right, turn right again, turn right again and viola, you'll be in the right spot. Where the bellmen will help you unload your crap, point you toward self-parking or valet your piece of crap car as if it were a brand new Porsche. The rooms are standard fare for Chicago hotels of this calibre. Nothing special. Nothing negative. The resto in the lobby area is actually not bad. Pricey of course, with the normal compliment of dumbed down foodstuffs for the masses.
