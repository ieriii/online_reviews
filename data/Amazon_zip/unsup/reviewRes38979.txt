La Villa has the best thin crust pizza I have experienced in Chicago. I have never actually ate in the restaurant, but I have had their spaghetti and meatballs as well, and it was tasty. If I had to choose however, it would always be pizza hands down. The pizza is always hot when it's delivered, and who can sneer at old school RC? Bonus! They also use FRESH garlic on their pizza (if that's to your liking and you order it) which is delicious.
