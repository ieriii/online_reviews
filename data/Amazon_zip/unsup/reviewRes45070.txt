The Strozzapreti Amatriciana with guanciale, tomato, red onion, garlic, chili flakes and pecorino is quite amazing and not your typical American Italian fare. The pasta was cooked al dente and finished in a white wine sauce with onions and hand-smashed canned tomatoes which soaked up the sauce and gave each bite more flavor. Guanciale is unsmoked Italian bacon prepared with pig's jowl or cheeks and tastes different than pancetta and hard to find.
