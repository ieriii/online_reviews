Fantastic chopped salads! had the Manhattan Salad with turkey, avocado and cheese. My friend had the Manhattan with tuna. The other friend had the Portofino chicken salad. very reasonably priced $14/ea. fancy art deco decor for such a large restaurant and food was excellent. Good for groups or couples, all occasions. Multigrain bread was to die for, so warm and fresh, could not stop eating it throughout the whole meal. Have been back a number of times.
