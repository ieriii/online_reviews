Conveniently located a few blocks from our hotel and millenium park, we decided to dine here for lunch because we missed our brunch reservation that Sunday. Very nice restaurant with very pleasant staff; our server was far beyond sweet (Indian young woman, I think). Not sure how I felt about the paper sheet covering our tablecloth (somewhat tacky I thought, but hey, I'm just knit picking at this point). Not much to say other than the food and service was superb (coffee and water always filled to the brim without ever noticing); everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My group and I were extremely satisfied with our choices which consisted of scallops, lamb curry over rice, fish and chips and the hanger steak salad. All worth ordering. The scallops (my favorite thing to order) was nicely charred and delicious, a must get! Worth coming for lunch! Can't speak for brunch or dinner, but if I was still in the area I would most definitely venture back.
