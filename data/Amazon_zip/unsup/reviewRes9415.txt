I was a little unsure when I made the reservation for a friend's birthday, because the intriguing menu had no vegan choices (I'm a vegan). However, I called and they said they could easily accommodate me. OMG, am I glad we went! Service was friendly and helpful, and Sprout was able to create a 10-course vegan tasting menu based on local fruits, vegetables, and grains on the spot!! Examples were cold avocado soup with fresh cucumber and herbs, cucumber with borage and garlic scape, and licorice salad with pear and chopped macadamia nuts. This will definitely be a go-to spot from now on.
