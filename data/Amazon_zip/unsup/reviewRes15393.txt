One of my two favorite bars in Chicago (the other being Aviary). Fantastic cocktails catering to a wide range of favor profiles. The coktail list is extensive and it was a great joy to sit at the bar trying a dozen or so of them. Robert was my bartender who has been there since day 1 and has a large hand in the cocktail list. His cocktail (I believe) the Star 80 is one of my favorites. It is a unique take on Tiki and mighty fine to enjoy. The bar is posh and comfortable With some of the largest barstools I have seen.The back bar is filled with house made syrups and tinctures and is beautifully lit. The only issue is drinks do tend to take a while, but they are well crafted and well worth the wait. They never rush you to order another round or leave if you have been nursing something. I highly recommend going.
