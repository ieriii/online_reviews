This is snazzy hotel in a great location. You're close to Millennium Park and Michigan Ave (where all the shops are). We had a room on the 13th floor with a great view of the park and buildings. The room itself is spacious and lovely. The king size bed was very comfy. The bathroom was spacious as well. The shower was nice with a shower head atop and then a shower massage. The facility itself has a nice fitness area and both outdoor and indoor pool. They're both lap pools and there's a hot tub as well. We didn't get to enjoy the outdoor pool as much as the weather was on and off rain. There's a sauna, a basketball court, and a game room with pool tables. We ordered room service one night and it was good, nothing out of the ordinary. There is one complaint - one day maid service took awhile and we had to call twice. That was a bit annoying as they didn't come into our room until after 4PM! Also, beware even if you touch a drink in the mini bar refrigerator they'll charge you! All in all though, a great place and I'd stay again.
