Le Colonial was ok. I thought the food was pretty decent, but I had just eaten at Hai Yen in Lincoln Park a few weeks earlier. The food was very similar but half the price. Portions were small. I did like the decor. It has a sort of island chateau feel to it. I know its supposed to have like a Vietnamese feel, since I haven't been there all I can describe it as is Islandy. It reminds me of the Caribbean collection at Ethan Allen. lol
