We placed a catering order from Simply It for a party of 50. I spoke with the owner, Mr. Tuan, several times in the process of placing the order. He was wonderful about walking through the menu and making suggestions. The food arrived on time and was delicious. He threw in a few dishes for free, and we had more than enough food for the group. I got more than a dozen compliments on the food - it was a huge hit!
