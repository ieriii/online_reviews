Our favorite Pizza! We drive about 25 mins to pick up our order and it's totally worth it. Our favorite order is the red pizza with cheese and banana peppers. We usually just order a pizza and whatever lighter color beer they have at the time. We have also treated ourselves to the carrot cake = its fantastic!  Never disappoints! p.s. you may want to have 2 ppl. pick up as street parking can sometimes be a pain
