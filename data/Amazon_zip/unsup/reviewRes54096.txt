Really great food! Super affordable and decent sixed portions (I split a torta with my friend and chips and we were really full) The best part was their service. We ordered out and they forgot to put out chips and guacamole in the takeout bag, so called them and the manager PERSONALLY drove out and delivered to us even though they don't deliver. Plus he threw in some cookies and was extremely polite, we;ll definately be going back!
