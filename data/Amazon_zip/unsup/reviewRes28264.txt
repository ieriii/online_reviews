I had the reconstructed cesar salad-the parmasan twinkie with marscapone whatever was good but the chicken with 'cranberries three ways' was overly salty and the whitefish with 'balsamic citrus foam' was interesting but the whole place takes itself waaaaay too seriously. It's all about what Graham Elliot wants to do, not about the customer. The server looked at us in horror that we didn't order the 10 course tasting menu for 114.00 but after she said it was a series of 'bites' we decided against it. If you like the whole foodie top chef thing-this is you place BUT the food isn't all that. I feel bad saying it, but it's just okay. And the popcorn that there so proud of was stale and a little soggy. Overall: meh. Too bad-great bar.
