Okay, Indian food. This was my third attempt with you, and though it was the best of the three experiences, I think I'm done. India House is alright. If someone suggested going back, I might. But if I'm making the call, it's pretty low on my list of places I specifically want to go. As we sat down to dinner, I handed our server my Groupon (as per the Groupon instructions). Then the food experiments began... Papdi Chat (Pastry crisps topped with boiled potatoes, chopped onions, cilantro leaves smothered with sweet chutney and chilled light yogurt) - This was... gross. Like, a cardboard wafer with cold random items on top. Two bites and I was done. Chicken 65 (Boneless chicken marinated in yogurt cooked with spices and curry leaves) - I actually liked this a lot. Chunks of chicken with a very hot sauce. Probably the highlight of the meal, but it wasn't a lot of food. And Chicken Tikka Masala (chicken cubes in a cream sauce) - It was alright, though I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce. Just tasted like a relatively flavorless gravy. I like naan. I also ordered their signature martini, which was... mango and something. Weakest martini I've ever had. We had our water glasses refilled constantly, so they get points for that. But our actual server vanished after taking our order. We had to flag him down to order additional drinks and later, to get our bill. At the end of the night, our server handed me the bill. He'd neglected to take off the Groupon amount. I reminded him of this and he seemed confused. I just did the math in my head and left the remainder in cash. Indian food just isn't my thing. If you like it, you may love India House. If you're on the fence, I think you can find a better restaurant (like La Madia next door).
