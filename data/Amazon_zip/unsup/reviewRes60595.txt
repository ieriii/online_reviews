So it was my surrogate mothers birthday, so she asked (all 5 of us 1 bro 3 sisters) us if she can go out to dinner. (because were are never around each-other) So she lives around that area so she was telling us abut this great place RJ GRUNTS. And we all agreed to go there and the place was so packed with people.(thats a good thing) And not to talk about the food but it was so great everybody got somthing different. And we all tryed eachothers dishes they served so much on the plate that all so filled when we left (and the bill was under $100 including drinks to feed all 6 hungry people-- what a deal!!)..................I WILL BE A LOYAL COSTUMER TO THIS PLACE BECAUSE IT WAS ALL IN ALL SO GREAT OF A NIGHT ---------------- i highly recommen this place to everybody!!!!
