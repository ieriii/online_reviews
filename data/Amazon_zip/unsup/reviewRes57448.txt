Our party of four had a very rushed dinner experience. The flatware was tossed on the table at our arrival and each course was whisked away the moment we finished. I had to grab my plate from the waiter to finish my meal !  If you want a quick dining experience, eat here. If you want a slower pace and equally good food, go across the street to Santorini. The skordalia is better there anyway.They also have free valet parking.
