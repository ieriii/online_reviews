I can't think of a better sushi restaurant that I've been to. This place rocks! We had the brussel sprout salad which was amazing -- I don't even eat brussel sprouts! We had a special role that night which was the best one, but the caterpillar role was very delicious as well.  A+ for environment. B for service.
