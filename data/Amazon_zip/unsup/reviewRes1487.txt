It was a Three Dog Night! Super delicious, great experience, but brutally long wait on a Saturday. Most of the people seemed to be tourists eager to check out the legendary encased meats. By the time we were at the register, I felt like we summited Everest. The food gets served surprisingly fast once you get through the line, through. We had the Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade", "Veal, Pork and Chive Bockwurst" and "Rosemary and Garlic Smoked Chicken Sausage". All were equally delicious and perfectly complimented the duck fat fries. I'll be back, but during the week when the line will hopefully be shorter. Cheers to Doug for such a great place!
