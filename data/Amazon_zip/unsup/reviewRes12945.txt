Recommended by a local while eating dessert at Skip Bayless' Frontera Grill, Cafe 28 totally delivered. Experienced a fantastic brunch complete with a Bellini and a spicy eggs benedict made with perfectly cooked poached eggs, asparagus, serrano ham and a spicy hollandaise sauce on an english muffin. When I go back to Chicago it's dinner next at Cafe 28!
