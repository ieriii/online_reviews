I will go against the grain and say that Art of Pizza is NOT that best deep dish pizza in all the land. No disparaging remarks I will make on this pie because it is one of the only places in Chicago that's willing to not fuss around and hand over some deep dish pizza by the slice! You got that right, they sell deep dish pizza by the slice! You know what, there are other spots that sell deep dish pizza by the slice, and they always end up sogged up like at the baseball stadium and nearly inedible. I would qualify The Art of Pizza as best deep dish pizza in Chicago sold by the slice! That's it! The restaurant itself has experienced remodeling over the years and is a bit bigger than it was before but still bears dirty tables from the high volume of people eating in there. I guess there are lulls where things are less sloppy but most times I am there somebody's leftovers are lying around. All in all a solid slice of pie, and there is nothing better than a solid slice of deep dish pizza, particularly when sold by the slizzice!!!
