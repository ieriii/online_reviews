I dined here a few times since I was staying in the adjacent hotel. Seems so silly to be impressed by the seemingly simple items that I noshed on. I fell in love as soon as I had my first meal here...breakfast. I couldn't believe how enamored I was with my order of 1/2 Grapefruit, topped with sugar and bruleed and Creamy Hot Irish Oatmeal, raisins, brown sugar and chopped walnuts. I certainly didn't have any grand expectations of such seemingly simple items. I've certainly had sugar on top of my grapefruit before but never bruleed and I've definitely had oatmeal with all of the above ingredients before but either I was very impressed with the execution or perhaps I have been deprived all my life...you decide. I returned for a late night wine flight and dessert...the bartender Jimmy was very friendly and gave great recommendations for the Housemade Sorbet & Housemade Ice Cream, Chef's accompaniment paired with Vision Cellars Pinot Gris and Inniskillin Ice Wine. I returned for a second visit and thoroughly enjoyed the D&S (I believe this is the sommelier's label) 2005 Proprietary Red and even brought home a few bottles (in retrospect, I wish I had bought a whole case...yes it was that good).  All in all, I definitely plan to re-visit should I ever travel to Chicago again.
