I thought the only place to get awesome Korean chicken wings (called Seoul Sassy at Crisp) was all the way up in Lincolnwood at Dong-Ah. I was pleasantly surprised to find Korean chicken in Lakeview that's so flipping good. By the way the wings are huge. What they call "5-pieces" is really 10 pieces anywhere else. Most of the guys that work the counter are pretty laid back and friendly which make visits all in all a good experience.
