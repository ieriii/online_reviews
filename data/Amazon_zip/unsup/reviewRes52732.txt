I live not too far from Brazzaz, but had never been there as I am not a big fan of their concept. Last Sunday my friend insisted and we ended up going. I had their buffet as I don't eat red meat and my friend had the meat option. The ambiance is ok, not anything spectecular, they definitely do have some issues at the host desk, the restaurant was more than half empty, but they still had a line upfront. As I said I had their buffet as I do not eat red meat, which I also told our server as soon as he came to the table. However, we both were charged for the full price, I had to remind the server that I did not have the meat dinner. The way our server reacted seemed like, it was a common mistake, I am sure if I was on a date I would just handed him out my credit card without looking at the receipt. It's also weird to find out that servers cannot process a payment. We wanted to leave as soon as possible to catch the Oscars and our server was not able to process it as he was not allowed to. I think it was an extremely overrated, overpriced restaurant, we could have the same dinner, even better for half price at any other restaurant in the area, I am a frequent diner, live in the area and I am positive that I am not going back there. Thanks
