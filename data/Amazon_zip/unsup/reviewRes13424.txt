I agree with Lauren H, I used to really like this place, but my brunch experience last weekend had made me want to throw in the towel for this place. Mostly it was the hostess. The hostess told my boyfriend and me that there would be a 20 minute wait despite the 5 open tables, because those were being held. I was surprised that they were taking brunch reservations now, because most small restaurants don't. But, okay, I understand, so we waited. And waited as these 5 tables remained open and more opened up as diners left. But what irritated me was that as tables cleared, she just stood there with her clipboard. See, when I was waiting tables, whenever I hostessed, I also bussed tables when I wasn't busy. And since this place only had once busser who seemed to be running his ass off, those recently vacated tables stayed dirty and we stayed hungry. And the hostess just kept standing immobile with her clipboard, looking around the room. Not clearing tables, not running drinks. Just standing. And those 5 original open tables stayed open the whole time we waited. So yes, it took the full 20 minutes to get sat. Another 10 for our server to stop by. And after the food came and was just mediocre, I decided I never need to go there again!
