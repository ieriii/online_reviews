This place is terrific! We had reservations for five that shrunk to three on the way to an 8:00 pm, Friday night reservation. Upon arrival they were very accommodating and didn't miss a beat. The food was great! The appetizers were very different and despite there exoticness (pickled hard boiled egg) they were really good. They prices may have been high but the experience matched the price and then some... Kudos!
