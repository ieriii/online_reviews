Simply It is simply delicious, affordable, and has a nice atmosphere! The food was flavorful and fresh. There were a lot of vegetarian options. The owner was happy to seat us quickly even though it was busy and we didn't have a reservation. I was with a friend who was visiting from London (though she is German by birth) and can be somewhat picky. She also thought the food was delicious and fresh, and was happy to get a cuisine that she can't often get in London. We didn't realize it was BYOB, but with no corkage fee on top of that I will definitely be back with wine in hand. And the complimentary fruit at the end of your meal is refreshing and a nice touch.
