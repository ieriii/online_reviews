My fiance made reservations for Alinea on the night he proposed. We had been talking about going for some time and it lived up to every expectation.  Each course was delicious and and wonderfully creative to eat. Almost every course was served by a different waitor and they were all friendly and helpful. I can't say enough what a wonderful dining experience it was!
