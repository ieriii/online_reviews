What do you get if you cross The French Laundry with a frat party? You guessed it, Schwa. I surprised my mom for her birthday with dinner at Schwa last night and it was an incredible experience from beginning to end. Chef Carlson and his band of merry men have created a breathtaking culinary experience that achieves the highest level of food preparation and presentation that also manages to be intimate and intensely person. The food is both complex and playful with harmonius blending of unusual and sometimes surprising ingredients but the real strength of the kitchen is in bringing their love of food to the guests. By removing formal waitstaff and opening the kitchen to interested patrons they bring the experience directly to the guests. My mother and I agreed the this was one of the best meals we have ever had and can't wait to return.
