Waking up naked in a kingsized bed in soft white sheets, wrapped up in a fluffy goose down comforter, with pillows strown in every direction, looking into hypnotic eyes of sea blue, is just heaven. This was my mornings at Hilton. I'm such a lucky girl. Pampered and adored. Trust me, this is not my everyday. Nor, every month. But for this moment... this moment was just opulent. The Hilton Chicago is very traditional in style. Not usually my cup of tea but more, his. Being more of an appreciator of modern / contemporary styles and decor, this would not have been my first choice, but I was won over by the spectacular views of the lake and the decadence of the hotel grounds. Surprisingly, their room service was extremely tasty! -1 star for no bathrobes, and another one for making us feel cheap for having to show our room key in the evenings after getting back from our nightly outings. Very awkward. I wouldn't choose The Hilton myself per se but I'm not going to deny that my stay here was very pleasurable. I love all the spiders and their webs on all the windows. Strange. but I like weird.
