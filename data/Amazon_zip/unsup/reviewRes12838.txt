We received *incredible* service and our food was delicious. The passion fruit frozen margarita was wonderful and a member of our group proclaimed his raspberry mojito to be 'the best mojito he's ever had". The pistachio crusted chicken was exceptional and I would definitely recommend it to anyone heading there! It was a bit pricey for my range (a drink, entree, and side dish came out to a little over $30), but I could see myself returning for a special occasion.
