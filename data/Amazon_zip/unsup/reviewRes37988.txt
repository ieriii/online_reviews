Dear Hopleaf, I am so sorry I dismissed you as nothing more than a hangout for hipsters and that I ignored you for over two years. It was me not you. But after so many friends spoke so highly of you, I had no choice but to see what the fuss was about. I have seen the light. I can now commune at your tables with the expertly prepared mussels, fight with my dining companions over the fries and garlic aoili and enjoy every bite of my divine CB&J sandwhich and perfectly crusty mac & cheese. I am even willing to withstand the long long wait times to be able to spend time with you. I hope we can be together forever. Love always, Punktriss.
