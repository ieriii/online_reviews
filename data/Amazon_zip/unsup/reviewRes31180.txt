Excellent breakfast at noontime yesterday at Nana's. I had huevos rancheros, friend Mary O. had a Greek Omelet. Both were excellent. I also had a rum cake with pastachio for dessert, and Mary O. had a chocolate something. Both were excellent. I drank coffee, which was good, and Mary O. had a pomegranate cola that she liked. Everything is organic, and the preparation is very good. One caveat - we talked with Omar, one of the owners, who told us that he is still having problems with suppliers. For example, he had no burgers yesterday, because the supplier couldn't supply him! Omar said people were getting angry at him, but he is a vegetarian and believes in Nana's mission to serve organic food. He was not about to go to Jewel and grab beef on sale, just to have hamburgers. He's a believer. He also told us they've been open only for a month, and he's already got plans to expand. Bridgeport, you are lucky. This is an excellent place, and you should go there now, whether or not red meat is on the menu.
