If you're feeling for a korean bbq fix, this is a great place to get it at.Once you order everything comes out promptly and of course, cooks in front of you. Tons of tiny side dishes everywhere it also keeps me chewing yummy! The only complaint I have is that the kalbi was a bit bland of marinating. I'm pretty sure it was only that day because the second time I came back it was pretty good then. Typical pricing for korean bbq, great food, service was typical. I'll come back within the next few weeks when i'm craving for bbq again.
