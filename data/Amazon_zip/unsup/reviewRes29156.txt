I just left my weekly yoga class so my zen was already flowing. I was with my brother and he wanted to do Indian food, but I wanted Thai food. I won the debate because Opart Thai House was BYOB and his choice, Marigold, was not. We arrived late last night about 9PM and the restaurant closes at 10PM on Tuesdays. We were seated immediately and equipped with our wine opener, wine glasses, and water in seconds. The waiters were fast! I took a second to take in the atmosphere. Traditional decor, low lighting, and chill music made for a pleasant dining experience. We started with the Fresh Spring Rolls, no egg. Instead of the egg they put in pieces of tofu. Cool! The best part about the service was that our server picked up that we were a table of vegetarians and continuously asked "no egg? vegetarian style?" after every order. I thought that was just awesome. For dinner I had Curry Fried Rice and Kuay Tiew Kee Mao which was flat noodles, sprouts, Chinese broccoli, peppers, and cabbage. AWESOME. The curry fried rice was delicious and the noodle bowl was spectacular. The portions were just right, too. Most Thai/Asian restaurants assault you with dishes that bloat you beyond belief, Opart had a great balance. The hype holds up. Great food, nice atmosphere, BYOB, very reasonable...makes for an awesome night out!
