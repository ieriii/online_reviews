Not bad. I've eaten here once before, and just got back from a dinner this evening. It's a nice place, the ambience is a little old school for me. Lights are quite dim. Service was good, as you would expect in a premium steakhouse. The steak was frankly OK. It was served extremely hot, which is excellent. Juices were oozing out of the meat. I ordered a rib eye, my wife ordered a NY strip, my mother in law ordered a filet. They were good, but not out of this world. I've travelled the country and been to some real fancy places, but at the end it comes down to who makes the best steak, this is definetly a 5 out of 10.
