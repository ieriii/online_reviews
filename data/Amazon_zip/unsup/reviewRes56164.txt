Fresh food, nice service, great salads.I have been dieting and eating out can be a challenge. Not so at Icosium where I could select all the ingredients for a wonderful salad. Fresh, fresh, fresh! Crisp greens, interesting choice of vegetables, including artichokes and hearts of palm (favorites of mine), meat, cheeses, herbs and delicious dressings. Plus - the portion was tremendous! And the price was under $10 - if you haven't been there yet, go, go go!
