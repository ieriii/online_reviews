If I could marry a bar, it would be Revolution. Hands down, it's consistently more satisfying than any man could ever be. My four hour foray here on Saturday night proved once again why I LOVE this place. Beer = amazing. The Willie, their (dark, sinfully delicious) Scottish Ale, proved the best find of the night, even though the alcohol percentage is a bit on the high side (which tends to be my preference - though that's probably not something I should be proud of). Their Belgian Wit was also refreshing, and even their IPAs weren't too bad (this coming from someone who tends to avoid the hoppier varietals). Food = yum. I've already described for you the pretzel's slurp-worthy cheddar ale sauce in my first review, so I'll let you know the polenta fries are an excellent choice, and their chicken sandwich is damn good (though take a bite with too much mustard in it and your eyes might start watering - it's THAT spicy). Service = I don't know what our bartender's name was, but he was most excellent. My friend Sarah E. referred to him as our little leprechaun, and while I'm fairly certain this was her inebriated self talking, he was a very friendly chap. I even got my FREE mug club beer, though my birthday was two weeks ago. I LOVE free stuff. Especially free alcohol. Obviously, the love remains for you, Revolution. Until next time.
