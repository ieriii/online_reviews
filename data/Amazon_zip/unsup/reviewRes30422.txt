I really like this place. My only complaint is that the ambiance is off...it seems outdated with the dark wood table and chairs, candlelight. So the vibe is a little cheesy, like it's trying too hard to be romantic. Also, the sign in the women's bathroom was really entertaining...it's an historic 1920's building with the same old ass plumbing system so they ask that when you flush, you hold down the lever and count to five. Haha. The detailed instructions were very helpful though! BUT, everything else about this place is awesome and it totally deserves 5 stars. The paintings that hang on the walls contrast the decor, as they are more modern in style and are in good taste. The service was fantastic! Stephanie was so sweet and genuinely personable. The food was excellent, even down to the balsamic dressing on the house salad. I had the butternut squash ravioli, which had the perfect amount of sweetness for me. I had the Rocky's Revenge ale to complement the dish! Yum! I also love that they serve breakfast all day and are open early. I will def be back the next time I'm in Chicago!
