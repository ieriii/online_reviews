Went to Las Tablas last weekend with a group of 6.  Overall rating was a one star: Service - no stars: The beer I ordered when the waiter first came to our table never came. I then had to ask three times for a soda, which finally came 10 minutes after I was done eating. And out of curiosity--In Columbia, does the salad usually come after the main course, or was our waiter that bad??? Food - two stars: The shrimp and steak both had really great flavor--which helped make up for the horrible cut of beef they use. They use a very thin, rubbery cut which takes a bit longer to chew than would be expected.  Probably won't be going back anytime soon.
