This place has great decor, and very nice concept. Food was definitely very good. My three stars are because of stuck up hostess and non- caring managers. We were greeted by no smile and were left to stand there for 40 minutes where there were so many tables available. I'll go back if someone else is treating me. Until then not so much.
