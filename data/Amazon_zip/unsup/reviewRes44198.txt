Read all the way through: Let me say that I love the bakery here, but I'm absolutely livid. I was told when I walked in this morning that the beignets were still being made and that there was a new person making them. So I had my coffee and worked in the lounge. An hour later, I went back, and I got my beignet, which was stone-cold. It was obviously not being made fresh, but defrosting from the freezer! More so, they have amazing breakfast sandwiches, but if you ask to have it heated, they put it in the microwave! What the hell? What self-respecting bakery that takes pride in its work will put perfectly excellent bakery and throw it in a microwave so it will get all "gummy". AND...AND....if you ask if they can warm it in the oven in the back, you are promptly told, "no"!  Geez people.... so close to being one of the greatest bakeries in Chicago..... Ike H....the same lady was the one who LIED to me about the beignet! I agree, she is NOT the most pleasant person to deal with...everyone else there is pretty cool. So, I went and spoke to the owner about my experience this morning. He informed me that the beignets were in fact made fresh, but that the new girl making them put cold filling in a fresh, out of the oven, hot beignet, which is what caused the problem. So I changed my 2 star to a 4 star. The owner was extremely proactive, very pleasant, and offered me another beignet tomorrow!
