Next time I make it out to Chicago, I am bringing a tent and camping right next to this amazing hot doggery. My friend made a special point to take me to Hot Doug's last time I blew through the windy city and I must say I am truly thankful he did. Not only does Hot Doug's shed light on just about everything you can do with a standard sausage (rattlesnake? alligator? whipped-cream and bananas?), they also rock out the extras - the toppings I mean: Gorgonzola cheese and cherry-drizzle, spicy-Thai peanut sauce. The setting is great too, and of course the place is packed, but then again waiting outside in the cold just makes savoring the hot dog that much better. Now if only they had some sort of crazy delicious side-dish like duck-fat fries... oh, wait a minute they do!
