The food is decent, similar to some of the other restaurants in Greek Town. The last time I went though, we had a bad experience with a rude waiter. In addition to the waiter being generally unfriendly, I ordered a piece of chocolate cake for dessert, which was very dry and stale. I had just a small bite and had the waiter dispose of the rest and was still charged for it.
