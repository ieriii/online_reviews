Simply delicious. The food is authentic, flavorful, and NOT AT ALL GREASY! Why did I "scream" that? Because it's so rare to find delicious noodles that aren't greasy! On top of the food, the people here are so friendly and nice-- they're always willing to modify a dish to suit your specifications, or give out a recommendation. There's not much else to add that the 200+ people that reviewed this place before me haven't already said.... but I can't encourage you enough to give this place a try! OH and they deliver -- even just 1 pho! :-)
