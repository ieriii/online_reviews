We started off w/a glass of champagne at the bar and from this vantage point, the place looks great...dark and modern... once we were seated, my boyfriend and I both noticed how loud it was in the dining area... Having read so many articles and yelp reviews, we were prepared for what lay ahead...just reading thru the menu is fun...the chef is obviously inventive and really enjoys what he does. My bf is a big wine guy, but was unfamiliar with the choices on this list (and the set-up of the wine menu is definitely different), but we finally decided on a great cab franc. There are so many items that look great on the menu, it was hard to choose what to eat, but we narrowed it down to the kobe beef carpaccio (good, not great), the buffalo wing (good, but we couldn't taste the infamous Budweiser foam), lake superior white fish (omg, excellent...like a picnic on a plate) and salmon BLT (I really liked, but the bf didn't think it came together well). We finished with the 'to die for' molten carrot cake...YUM! Service was excellent and our waiter was very informative and helpful. We thought prices were fair for Chicago and you are really getting an experience at GE, unlike any other. So, why only 3 stars? It was pretty good, but it's not your weekly go-to place. The concept is quirky and it might just work, but I am hesitant to visit regularly for an all-American meal served gourmet style. I will return if the menu changes drastically, just because it is close to home and I am curious.
