Most of the reviews have grasped what Wilde is: great ambiance, pretty bar area, good food (Mac and Cheese is to die for). What I love is the specials! Half priced wine from a decent wine selection is fantastic. The food specials are great - i had a fantastic rainbow trout. Service is hit or miss, I've had painfully slow, but also a couple wonderful experiences. I've been there a few times, but no one has recognized that yet, so I haven't received 'regular' service, but we'll see...thats when the four will become a five great place to take friends during the week, its slower and the soundtrack is great.
