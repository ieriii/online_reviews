I've made a few visits to Noon-o-Kebab, each time bracing myself for a long wait for a table. However, I've lucked out each visit & gotten a table immediately! (it helps if you come early and/or show up with a very small group). The kebabs here are among the best I've ever tasted - my personal favorites are the Chenjeh and Barg kebabs - and the dill rice is a delicious complement to the meat. Appetizers such as Baba ghannouj are good too, though the entree portions are so big that you are probably going to be leaving with leftovers even w/o an appetizer order. Only two complaints about my visits: 1) they don't serve coffee and 2) one somewhat busy evening we were practically rushed out the door in order to free up our table for another waiting party. In spite of these little bumps in my dining experiences here, I'll probably return again very soon...
