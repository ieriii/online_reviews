I would visit again, just for the atmosphere! It was lively, and although it's close to the UIC campus, it wasn't full of college kids. The crowd was nicely mixed between college students, young adults, possibly their parents, along with professionals from the UIC hospital. I really liked the casual, warm aura of the restaurant! We ordered 5-6 dishes to share, and each dish was a bit on the oily side but very tasty! Our waitress was wonderful and had great knowledge of wine. This is a great neighborhood place to meet up with friends for a slightly nicer dinner occasion.
