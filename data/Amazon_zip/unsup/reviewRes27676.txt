My BF has been talking about this place and their caramelized cheese for quite some time, so I finally broke down and agreed to go.  We ordered carry-out for a large pan pizza with sausage, onion and mushroom. The pizza looked and smelled great. Since we had a 20 minute ride home, plus the time it took to find a parking spot, it took us about 45 minutes or so before we actually ate the pizza-that was a mistake. The crust was a little soggy. Luckily it was thick enough that there was still a hint of crunch left. Maybe that caramelized cheese had something to do with it... The overall flavor was great! The veggies were fresh. There was a good amount of sausage throughout, however, I personally would have preferred a little more cheese (un-caramelized) . Having said that, if you have the time/ patience to wait for a table, I would. I'm sure had we done that, my rating would have been higher.
