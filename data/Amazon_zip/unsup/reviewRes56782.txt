This place has the best pizza in the US! I've lived in London and New York City and trust me when I say this is one of the top 2 pizza restaurants I have ever eaten at. My family and I go there almost every weekend and we never get sick of the food there. You will NOT LIKE their pizza if you are a fan of fatty, deep dish pizza, but if you are a fan of fresh tasting, non-greasy and extremely delicious pizza that does not make your stomach feel bloated afterwards, then this is the place to try. The best time to go is before 6pm. Otherwise there is a long wait. Jon, the owner, however makes the wait worthwhile because he serves up some complimentary appetizers. For those who love truffles, order the black truffle forcacia. It's not on the menu. It is the most heavenly dish. Yes, I've tried Frasca. It was disgusting and expensive! The ingredients they used were canned or have been sitting there for hours. No, the pizza does not taste fresh at Frasca at all!
