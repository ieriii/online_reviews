Really good ribs. The other bbq meats I tried were not exceptional, but the ribs were pretty much all I could have wanted them to be. Staff is very attentive and friendly, and their whiskey selection is a nice twist if you're looking for more than just food. Prices are also extremely fair for its location, and there is plenty to do nearby.
