This is my favorite spot for cheap Thai in Chicago--the curries in particular are excellent. And lunch or dinner can be had for around $8. (The Opart Thai in the South Loop has similarly good food with a more upscale atmosphere and an alcohol license.) The decor is comfortable and unpretentious. Dark wood divides the rooms and covers the floors, and thought was obviously put into the design. The closest comparison I have in terms of feel is Hai Yen in Lincoln Park. I've always had good service here, though it's nothing remarkable. This was the first of the Thai places along Western that I tried, and it's so good that I keep coming back even though I've been meaning to explore some of the other options. Which says something.
