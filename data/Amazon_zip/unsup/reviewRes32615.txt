Five stars alone for Demera's commitment to a happy customer. After reading my first review, the restaurant manager emailed me with an apology and an invitation to come back. Trying Ethiopian food was on my bucket list and because I had never given it a try, I headed back last night. I had no idea what I was doing and neither did my dinner partner, so I was very happy that the manager and my server were able to create a meal based upon me loving spicy food and my boyfriend's inability to tolerate it. We started with sambusses, which are like flakier samosas (sans potatoes). Then, we just asked for the meat-chicken-vegetarian surprise, which worked out great. Getting in touch with my Irish side, one of my favorites was the cabbage and carrots, which were a little sour and complemented the spongy injera bread. I had heard about this Ethiopian bread/eating utensil on Check Please, but there is really no way of describing it. I love pretty much anything sour and chewy, so it was a very pleasant and unexpected combination with the savory flavors. Pairing all of this with a delicious Spanish dessert wine and a tiramisu that had the consistency of a bread pudding just added to the list of the surprises. It was not what I was expecting at all, but that wasn't a bad thing. A review on Check Please could never give you a full picture of what Ethiopian food really is; you need to experience it yourself. I was happy that I gave Demera a second chance. I will come back next time I go see a show at the Annoyance across the street.
