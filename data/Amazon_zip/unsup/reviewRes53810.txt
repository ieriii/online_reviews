Every time we go, I can't make up my mind and want to try at least 4 different things. The wild game sausages squick me out a bit so I don't get those. Sure, waiting in line is sometimes a pain - but it's also part of the fun. If you don't want to wait in line, don't go here. Plain and simple - it's not for everyone.No matter how crowded it is, they always manage to help you find a place to sit. The staff is friendly and I like that Doug insists on running the register and interacting with customers.
