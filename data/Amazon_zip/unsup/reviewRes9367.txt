I called ahead for a party of six as open table did not have availability. They were able to accommodate our group at 7 p.m. on a Thursday night. In addition, half of our party had several food restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, and dairy). Our server was very helpful and explained to our group what to change, what to order, etc. The suggestions were excellent. Our group ordered salad, English pea soup, foi gras, burrata, and scallop apps. In addition, we ordered the Ricotta, Snapper, and Salmon entrees. The wine and beer selection was very good as well and next time I want to try their tasting menu with wine pairings. The ambiance was conducive to an intimate dinner with a group of friends.
