AMAZING ROOF TOP TERRACE! I went on a Monday night with a few friends and it was great. Not too many people, and extremely friendly staff. Awesome roof fireplace, and an overall relaxed "zen" decor. The sliders are delicious, and I highly recommend the tacos! They come in 3's (chicken, pork and fish) and I highly recommend getting all 3 fish tacos (sounds gross I know, but IT WAS DELICIOUS!). I think they use sword fish, and it was just an amazing party going on in my mouth with every bite. Drinks are also great!
