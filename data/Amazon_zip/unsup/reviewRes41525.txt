I read a few of the reviews before going, and was surprised at some of the comments about food quality, prep, etc. I found them back on their game this Sunday night. Sundays are chef's choice, so bring a bottle of both red and white because you might need them both! Our server-Liz- graciously offered to keep the whites chilled till we needed them and service in general was calm, measured and not stuffy in the least. With ten or so tables in a small and hard surfaced facility, the noise level could get out of hand, but not the case with this group of American diners who seemed to be able to converse without screaming at on another; an ugly American trait. Food selection and quality was superb; and though most courses in the 4 course prix fixe appeared small, the result was quite satisfying. If you haven't eaten an week, you might want the 7 course meal, or try 90 Miles (the Cuban restaurant) down the block... All in all a good deal in an upscale hand crafted meal. Expect $50 a plate, excluding wine (you bring it), tax and tip.
