This place is amazing. I'm still a little bit of a sushi amatuer, but I do know what I like and what I don't, and what it's supposed to taste like. Luckily, I went with someone who lives in Chi-town and knew that this place is a BYOA - bring your own alcohol. So we made sure to stop at the local market and pick up 2 bottles of wine. When I walked in I was immediately impressed, the ambiance is very modern and relaxed and the staff was extremely friendly, and spoke English very well. We were seated and brought over a wine chiller; however, when we pulled out our bottles, we were advised that only 1 bottle is allowed at a time. Since we didn't know that rule, they were very forgiving and said that we could have both bottles, but only 1 on the table at a time. They also aren't allowed to pour it for you, since they do not carry a liquor license. So be ready to pour as much as you want in your glass! We ordered a huge array of sushi and it came out in decent time, as most sushi place should, as it's RAW! The food was amazing, and I can't wait until I'm in Chicago again to go back to Coast.
