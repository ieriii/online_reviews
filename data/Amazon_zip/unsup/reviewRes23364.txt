We went here for a birthday brunch for myself;) I wanted something low key with my bf and just something delicious.  LOVED the Cafe con leche! GET IT. Its like the hot version of Thai Iced coffee so... not iced. But its got that sweetness with the condensed milk its like DUH deliciousness in a cup. Followed up by some light, but filling crepes. These are a more hearty crepe than what you're used to... its almost a pancake like dough-y-ness goin' on and its filled with goodness.  Also the atmosphere is so unique and adorable it makes me want to check out the other location.
