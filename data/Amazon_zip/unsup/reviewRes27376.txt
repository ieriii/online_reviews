This is one of two super favorite pizza places in the city. I am not a huge fan of chains, so this is a great place to get great pizza, without having that chain restaurant stamp ruin the experience. I would personally recommend the pan pizza if you go there to eat it for a meal. Otherwise, the thin crust is a very good substitute. The service is great, and the place is quite laid back. Another nice thing is that I don't think I have ever had to wait too long for a table, if at all. There's also a full bar with good beers that would go really well with the pizzas. My favorite part about coming here is that I know I will have good pizza to eat the next morning, as there are always leftovers, and what good is pizza if there are no leftovers for that late night, early morning cold pizza craving!
