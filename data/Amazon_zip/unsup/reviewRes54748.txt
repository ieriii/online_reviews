So it gets another star with the update. We were up early this past weekend, and decided to give it one more try since we could beat the rush. The service was very quick and kind, however the food was incredibly bland. Generous portions, too generous. My husband hated his benedict, and my entree was blah. Tables were close together, there was only one stall in the bathroom, and the coffee service was a bit sluggish. Nice marketing and fresh food, but I feel no need to return.
