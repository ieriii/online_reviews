This is my first time vising the Chicago location. i was quite mesmerized by the decor as we patiently waited for our tables. Two days before NYE at 8:30pm, the place was reasonably packed. My group of 3 were anticipating a 30 minute wait with an opportunity to sit at the bar based on a first come, first serve basis. We were seated in 15minutes. Clientele will range between business and K.I.T. friends. I always enjoyed eating Wildfire because they have one dish that I have not experienced at another restaurant. That item is the mushroom crusted porkchops. The flavoring and juiciness found in two pork chops that feel like the beefy versions of filet mignon. Their steaks are equally as good and price is reasonable. Pair the food, the decor, and the friendly staff, it's a great place to eat and gather.
