I refuse to mint this place. I absolutely refuse to. Sure, it's a good place to go get some (expensive) craft beers, micro brews, etc.  Sure, my service was prompt and the busboys worked at light-speed to remove my spent mussel shells from the table. Sure the mussels in white wine were damn good; tons of tasty broth, chunks of potatoes, bacon, and shallots.  Sure, sure, sure... Damn you hopleaf. I know what you're all about, a Belgian gastronomic pub that caters to the hipster d-bag crowd, the ones who like to dress up on a Tuesday and drown themselves in pomp.  I can't blame you aging hipster d-bag, this beer is too heady to miss out on, this food is just too refined, too likable.  First of all, go early (5 pm on a weekday, much earlier on a weekend), or you'll be relegated to the bar area where the service seems spurious. I did admire the ease with which the kitchen turned out dishes, very fast, very efficient, high quality. I'm not sure why I want to hate this place. Maybe it's because I feel out of place without a pair of fake Tina Fey glasses and a sleeve full of witty repartee. Damn it. I'll probably be back, but not because I want to.
