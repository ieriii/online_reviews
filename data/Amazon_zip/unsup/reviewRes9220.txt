I love Le Colonial, especially the upstairs bar on either cold or hot weather nights!! When they designed Le Colonial, they really outdid themselves with the 1920's Southeast Asia feel that they gave it. I always feel like I'm in some another country. My favorite small plate to nosh on when I stop in at the bar, is the 'bo bia soft salad roll' which contains julienne carrots, jicama, bean sprouts, and aromatic herbs in rice paper. It comes with a spicy-sweet peanut plum dipping sauce that is so tasty. I never leave without drinking the vietnamese coffee, served with the sweet condensed milk. It's so rich and delicious. I definitely need to stop in again soon!!
