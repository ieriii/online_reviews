Excellent food and wondeful catering. We ordered from here for a party of 75+ and everything was fresh and tasted great. Our guests couldn't get enough and kept asking "where is this food from.". Very reasonably priced too. If you're paying in the store, they only take cash but it's well worth it you credit card payers. No place else I'd rather go for a falafal pita sandwich!
