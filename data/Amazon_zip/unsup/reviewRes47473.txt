I might go back to drink but NEVER TO EAT The decor is gimmicky but if you like that then have fun. They have virtual concerts which means tapes of concerts on the TVs. I'm not a fan of taped concerts but if you are its for you. The food has TRANS FATS. I ate it by accident because they give you some chips to snack on and I forgot to ask first so I was extremely sick after eating it.  But they seem to have good drink specials on off nights.
