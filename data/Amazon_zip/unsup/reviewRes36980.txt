Since finding this place last fall I have been here quite a bit. I like the mix of both Japanese and Thai food to pick from. The food is reasonably priced and tasty. I always have a hard time picking between maki or a Thai noodle dish. It's also BYOB with no corkage fee. Parking in the neighborhood is difficult, but I always manage to find somewhere to park, even if it's a few blocks away. The dcor suits the restaurant well, with white glowing orb lights and warm red walls. They have short noir videos silently playing on the flat screen TV by the entrance which make for interesting viewing and conversation while waiting for the food to arrive.
