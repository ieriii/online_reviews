I can't stand how much I LOVE you right now! I am sorta mad at myself for ordering biscuits and gravy w/ 2 scrambled eggs at ANY restaurant --- partly because it seems so basic and partly because I am REALLY trying to order healthier..  However, I know this is not the place to go if you are looking for fruit and granola. Well, there is nothing basic about L & E's biscuits and Gravy. Here this simple country dish has been elevated to a place that I wouldn't think possible. They are so amazingly, earth shatteringly, divinely tasty that I will probably crawl to the door in the worst weather with the worst hangover I have ever endured for it. I usually Dr. my eggs with salt lots of pepper & hot sauce but nothing on this plate required any seasoning at all. Eggs perfectly cooked and tasted like eggs should taste. On second thought... It's DISGUSTING!! Don't go there. Please don't take my seat, my parking (even though I could walk from home), etc.. . Again the bartenders here are amazing. This time I had the Bloody Maria. Marta, "Mo' Chedda, Mo' Betta...." The staff in general here and their service really rock. They are friendly, knowledgeable and not at all over the top or pretentious.  I almost hate writing this review because I don't want it to be spoiled by the masses... or change... augh... inevitable? Summary: thumbs up.. WAY up.
