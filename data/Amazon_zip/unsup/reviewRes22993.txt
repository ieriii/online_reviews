We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Greek Islands. The food was wonderful and very filling. We started off with the Saganaki--yummy! (it was fun seeing little bursts of flames occurring throughout the restaurant).  Then we had the gyros and mousaka. Both dishes were delicious. For me, the tzatski was the best I've ever tasted. And ok, I'm going to sound a little weird but the potato that the served with the mousaka--heaven. Yes, I'm getting excited about a potato. Great portions of food--had leftovers for home (yay!) The service was wonderful. Very friendly and most especially very attentive. They seemed to anticipate what we needed.  Free valet is a plus--and those guys hustle. It was raining pretty hard but the guys did a great job getting everyone's car back in a very timely manner.
