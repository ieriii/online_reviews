I've never been to the actual RJ Grunts but Its one of my favorite places to order from when I'm at work (when I can afford the calories lol). I love the pepercorn burger with the spicy ketchup and chips (Those chips are insane!).When ever the office is ordering food, we always consider RJ's when in the burger mood.:)
