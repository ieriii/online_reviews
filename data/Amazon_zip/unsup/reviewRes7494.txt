attended a large party (16) with friends and a pre set menu that was fantastic. food was great, drinks were stiff and most important to me was the service. our waitress and food runners could not have been more helpful. everything you requested was brought out immediately and many times they were one step ahead of us by bringing out extra sauces, plates, napkins, etc... they could tell we needed. ribs and wings were my favorite along with their "bookshelf wall" of great liquors. for a big party i would highly recommend the upstairs. thanks chicago q!
