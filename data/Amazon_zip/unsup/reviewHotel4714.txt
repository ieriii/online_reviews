The B & B's great location was the first reason I chose to stay here. I was in town on business for 2 days and since I used to live in Chicago I knew there would be a lot of things to do within walking distance of the inn. It's a cute place with some antique furniture and a variety of different sized rooms to choose from. We stayed in the front of the building which proved to be kind of loud with the street below being busier than I remembered. I had to get up early both mornings, otherwise I wouldn't have cared. If sleep is important to you, I wouldn't recommend staying here when there's a Cubs game either. But, for the most part we enjoyed our stay and will try it again. The staff was really nice and helpful.The breakfast is, as stated on the website, conservative (?) but they give vouchers for Trader Joe's next door, which we would have tried had it not been so busy (again, the Cubs).This was my first stay at a B & B and really, it's not for everyone. But, like I said, it's a great location with good restaurants, stores and bars nearby and it's right next to the El.
