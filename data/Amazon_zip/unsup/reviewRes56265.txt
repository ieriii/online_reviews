We called ahead and arranged a party for twenty for my daughters bachelorette party, we prearranged the menu and were served immediately. the food was delicious, the service was wonderful, the staff explained what each dish was and the wine we brought was poured for us. we had a great time and felt like we were the only party in the restaurant. the place was full the whole time we were there, but the service certainly didn't feel like it. i will be coming back and will suggest visiting this jewel to everyone that visits Chicago.
