I really like this restaurant. Extremely consistent with food AND service. I have never been disappointed with any of my food choices, and I wish I got here more often. Love the saganaki, mousaka, and the dolmades especially. My sister is a big fan of the sea bass and gets that every time. A friend of mine said the lamb chops were the best she has ever had, anywhere. Free valet is a bonus. I am always sure to tip. Sometimes the service may seem a little brusk...as in, I am still taking off my jacket and the waiter asks for my drink order...but I don't think they are rushing anyone, they are just trying to give good service. As long as they are just as quick bringing out my food, the check, my change, etc...I am not going to complain. I would recommend Greek Islands to anyone.
