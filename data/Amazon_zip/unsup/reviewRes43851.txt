When I first moved to Chicago my aunt gave me a gift certificate to this place, and I was very grateful. The food is amazing, and the menu changes regularly. Their salads are wonderful, their sandwiches are enough to satisfy any appetite, and the side dishes are fresh and varied. The major flaw is space - people wait in a line at the register to order, then go to their seats. Usually the line is long enough to restrict people from seeing what's on the menu and from getting to their table. When it's crowded, things get a little mercenary. Still, it's worth it! At the very least, it's worth waiting until things are less crowded.
