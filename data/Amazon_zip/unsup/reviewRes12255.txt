We were celebrating Mother's Day a day early. Since I had seen this place on a "Check, Please!" review last night I decided I wanted to go here. Since we have a 4-year-old, we thought going to brunch would be better.  I love Cuban food and was really looking forward to it. First off, the service was TERRIBLE! Not once did they come to refill our water, it took forever to be seated even though there were plenty of tables open. The hostess just never came to the front to seat people.  The food was... eh.  I wasn't impressed. I had the Ropa Vieja Sandwich because I really wanted some shredded beef. It wasn't nearly as tender as meat I've had at other Cuban restaurants. The beans were good but not spectacular. Hubby had the "Taste of Cuba". He liked the empanadas but I thought they were gross. The plantains were bland and he didn't care for the other thing on the sampler.  I just wasn't impressed at all.  There wasn't nearly that many Cuban items on the brunch menu IMO. Maybe I should try it out at dinner and see if it can impress me more.
