This is my favorite of this type place since Asado in Evanston closed. I prefer the selection of meat here to the one at Fogo de Chao, and Brazzaz's salad bar is MUCH better as well. I remember at Fogo de Chao thinking, really? This is it? Last time I was at Brazzaz, their lunch special was only $20 a person, and though the selection is smaller at lunchtime, it still contains my favorites. Not that anyone ever has room for dessert, but those are damn good as well!
