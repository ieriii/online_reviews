TOO MUCH CHEESE. i am a HUGE cheese fan, but this was beyond too much for me; it almost seemed wasteful. me, along with the other two friends i was with, each had our own pile of excess mozzarella on our plates that was probably equal to an entire half of a mozz cheese log from trader joe's. anyways, one piece is all i needed, even being extremely hungry, it was very filling. overall, i would say it's okay. i thought i might as well try it since i wasn't paying.
