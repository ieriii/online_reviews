Despite the pretentious vibe, Violet Hour really does have phenomenal drinks. There can often be a lengthy wait to get in, but to their credit, this is because they don't allow standing inside. Everyone gets seated. That said, I'm not sure the wait is really worth it if you only want one drink. If you're looking to spend a couple of hours there, the wait is more worthwhile, I'd say. The list of rules can seem a little intimidating (no cell phone use, no jeans, etc.), but it doesn't seem like they really enforce them. I've worn jeans there and no one has looked at me askance. I've also seen people using cell phones without being reprimanded. I also think this is a great place to take a date because of the way the seating is arranged--there's a lot of privacy and you don't feel like you have to scream to be heard. The bottom line for me is the drinks. I don't drink beer or wine, so good cocktails are at the top of my list when rating a bar. Violet Hour certainly does not disappoint in this regard.
