After having a bad experience at Yolk on Wells, I decided to give its sister property a try. My companion and I arrived around noon. I knew from my previous Yolk experience that the portions are plentiful. I ordered two eggs (scrambled easy), toast and fruit. Since it was later in the day, maybe they were trying to get rid of some eggs? My two eggs, looked easily like four.  Unlike my experience at Yolk on Wells, our server was extremely polite and attentive. A busboy removed dishes, as soon as we were finished. The server returned at least three-four times to insure everything was okay. I would return for another visit. Yolk is the perfect place to eat if you have fasted for a week and need some sustenance. They provide huge breakfasts.
