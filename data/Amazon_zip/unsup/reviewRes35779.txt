Finally made it to the Oyster bar. Come by 630p or the wait becomes crazy. Extra bonus - 1/2 off oysters from 4-6p! I had forgotten I had the bisque here before, and it was okay this time around too; the chowder was better. We noticed a couple got a bucket looking thing of crab which we're definitely ordering next time. Warning though - DO NOT get the fish tacos. Tortillas tasted like they came out of a bag, had a piece of fried halibut tossed in with some stringy veges.
