I love Rick Bayless. Just had to say that. I have been to Xoco, Frontera, Topelobampo, and own multiple cookbooks. I love his approach to mexican cuisine and the flavors are unbelievable. Of his three restaurants, Frontera is my favorite because of the casual atmosphere/menu. The food is a nice happy medium between what you typically think of when you think mexican food, and a five star amazing chef's interpretation of mexican. The menu is seasonal and very fresh. I crazy love the margaritas, the chicken in mole enchiladas, the black beans, ooh it is all so delicious. Service was what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The only downside is how far in advance you have to call for a reservation. This is not somewhere you can just stop into either unless you are patient enough to wait 1.5-2 hrs, which I am not.
