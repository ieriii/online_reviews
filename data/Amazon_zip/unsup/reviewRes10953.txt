I was a pretty big fan of the huge pancakes I ordered smothered in white chocolate cream and some kind of raspberry something. It tasted like a delicious cinnabon. Mmmm. I got there a little earlier than most people normally do brunch (around 10am) and we still had to sit around outside for around 30 minutes or so. So go with people you like to talk to...ha ha. Its a little crowded on the inside and I felt like our table was sort of thrown in the middle of the walk way of everyone so that was awkward at times. But the service was great and the tea and food selection was awesome. And it was great to walk outside once we were done and see the swarm of people still waiting to get in. It was definitely worth the wait!
