I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. I always get whatever pancakes they are featuring at the time and each time, they get better. Although it's a stack of three pancakes, they are much more filling than your traditional pancakes. They're a little pricey, but that might just be a matter of opinion because I can never finish half of my breakfast. Will definitely dine here again.
