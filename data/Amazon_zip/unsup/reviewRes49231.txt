I live across the street from this place. I managed to avoid it for several months, but now I go in once a week to treat myself to a red velvet cupcake. Actually, I lied... it's more like 2 red velvet cupcakes, 3 black and white cookies, and a croissant. I always take it to go and walk back across the street to my apartment so I can begin the self-loathing...
