After my first pig out of seoul sassy wings and a buddha bowl a few weeks ago, the guy that brought out my order told me I'd have dreams about it. Man was he right! There is rarely a day that my mind doesn't think..Hm...I could really go for some Crisp tonight. Finally went back this week and ordered twice as many delicious enormous crispy perfectly sauced wings as last time, and ate until I couldn't lift my hand to my mouth anymore. Amazing. Also, I could just drink that seoul sassy sauce. YUMMMM. I think I'll be passing up on the bowls from now on, just don't have room for healthy stuff with all the delicious wings I'm stuffing in my face.
