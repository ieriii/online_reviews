Hands-down the best hot dog I've ever had. My friends and I ordered so much that I think we scared the old lady who sat next to us, but her loss! It was all delicious. The polish was fantastic, but the special dogs really rocked my world: Cognac and hazelnut pheasant sausage with black currant sauce, chicken pate and truffle-balsamic cream. To die for. Duck sausage with truffle aioli and foie gras. Delectable. Also, spring for the duck fat fries. A quote from Doug: "Eat anything fried in duck fat, even if it's a shoe." Amen! The wait, well, it was really long - about 1 1/2 hours (we got there at 12:45) And it was cold. But if you're game, go for it. The food is fantastic!
