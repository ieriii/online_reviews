I went to the Bongo Room on a Friday afternoon at about 11:45 am and there was a 30 minute wait to get in. I somewhat expected this because I have heard of the place and usually see a line when I drive past on the weekends. When we got in, it took us about 15-20 minutes just to get our drinks and order our meals....slightly long. Our waitress was all over the place, in fact it took me over 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee ( I think she forgot)Anyways, I figured this would be water under the bridge once we got our meals. I was very dissapointed in the food that came to the table. I got a chorizo and avocado egg dish, others at the table got sandwiches, and one got the heath bar pancakes with bananas. I have to say, the pancakes were fabulous, best item that anyone had ordered. My omlette was not that great and overpowered by way too much chorizo. I've had better food at other brunch places such as Milk & Honey where I've waited less time, paid less money and had an all-around better experience. Actually after the meal I felt sick to my stomach for the next couple hours. Safe to say I will not be returning to this place.
