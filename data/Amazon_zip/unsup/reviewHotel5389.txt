My boyfriend and I just stayed in this hotel last weekend, and can I tell you what a pleasent surprise it was.Between the price I paid (very little considering location), the location, and the incrediably friendly staff, I could not have been happier. Some quick positive tidbits: felt very safe and secure, they had safes in each room, the kithcenette proved very helpful, the water was always hot, asked for some extra towels and pillows, and were delivered to me within 5 minutes, and the rooms were very cleanSome quick negative tidbits: bathroom was a tiny bit crowded (but the shower was very good size), free breakfast was not very good.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was on a budget and wanting to be right in the action!
