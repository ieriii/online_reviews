We absolutely love this place. Don't try and get in without a reservation as it is usually pretty crowded. You really can't go wrong with any dish there. Portions are large and every entree includes complimentary pizza bread, soup and salad.Service is always outstanding with experienced servers and the owners usually stop at your table to make sure everything is good.
