I've never been disappointed with Calo!! The food is great, they have a huge menu, the service is quick, and you can usually be seated pretty quickly even if you don't have a reservation. Now, don't read that as you shouldn't try to make one... I definitely would if it's a weekend night... it can get pretty packed. The caprese salad is super fresh, and even though it's not directly on the menu, you can order Veal Parmesan, which is one of my favorites. It's great for groups, and they have a pretty good wine selection.
