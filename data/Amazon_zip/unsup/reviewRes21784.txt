I went here for the first time last weekend. I loved it. Very true Chicago atmosphere. There were some real North Chicagoans here, not the transplants that you largely find in the city. The food was good, I had a Super Cheesy and Fries. The fries were perfect, slightly over done. The burger the typical char burger with all the fixings. The service was surly and entirely appropriate. I plan to go back next time I'm in the area.
