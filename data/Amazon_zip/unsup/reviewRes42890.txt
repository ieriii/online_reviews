Believe it or not, the "best pizza in Chicago" title is subjective. Consider me one of those people that has Art of Pizza as best in town. It's cheesy, greasy, and perfect. Stuffed, deep dish, and thin crust are ALL outstanding. The sausage is great, as is everything else. My little complaint is that if they would embrace the old-school red-checkered table tops the way most pizzeria's do, it would be what I consider the world's perfect pizza joint. Also, don't go for anything but the pizza. The other stuff is okay, but they could scrap it all off tomorrow and still get the same crowds.  Lastly (I swear), slices are really good, but there's nothing like downing a pie straight out of the oven when the cheese is still scolding and you're downing Diet Pepsi in between each bite because the roof of your mouth is burning, yet you can't stop eating because it's just that good.
