I don't live in this neighborhood, so I don't get to go here very often - except for the occasional happy hour. Actually, the last few happy hours here were farewells to people leaving the company, so there was more drinking involved than normally.... Anyhoooo..... the beer selection here is great, always something to please the palate, so this place gets props for being a good bar. THEN, there's a full restaurant in the back! Great food - my fav is the duck reuben which is amazing, and well, honestly the thing I end up ordering every third time there.  I will say that this place gets crowded on a friday night, so be warned - get here early and claim your spot, and don't leave, just have another round, the world will take care of itself till then.
