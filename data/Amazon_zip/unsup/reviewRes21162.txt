I wanted to be absolutely sure about this place before I wrote a review because it somehow seemed too good to be true. A Bayless place that's reasonably priced and still unbelievably delicious? I couldn't believe he could possibly do it without reducing the quality proportional to the price reduction. And yet, I found myself absolutely blown away by my first impression of the place. Although the line was quite long, especially for a late lunch (2:00 and the line was nearly to the door), it was well worth the wait. The first thing you notice about the place when you walk in the door is the smell. It combines the earthy notes of Mexican Chocolate with the spicy kick of chiles and the delicious smell of cheese melting over a grilled sandwich. It's totally intoxicating. As the line moved forward, I could see a familiar face as Chef Bayless sprinted around the kitchen, plating dishes, mixing chocolate and talking into an ABC camera all at the same time. I figured that if Chef Bayless was at the helm, I couldn't lose. I was right. My jamon torta was beautiful. There's no other word for it. The serrano ham blended smoothly into the avocado and the manchego, and all of that blended seamlessly into the soft-on-the-inside-and-crunchy-on-the-outside bread. It was definitely in the top 3 on my great sandwiches list. I also snagged a bit of Melissa F's red chili and pork shoulder soup and it was almost as delicious. I found myself craving the food again less than a week later, and since I had a lot of time on my hands (between work ending at 3 and school not having started), I headed back. I was curious, above all, to see if the same quality held up without Chef Bayless in the restaurant. Although I wasn't entirely surprised, it did hold up. I ordered the same jamon torta and shared the red chili soup with a friend and it was just as good as the first visit. In fact, writing this review makes me want to go back right now. Too bad for me, I guess.
