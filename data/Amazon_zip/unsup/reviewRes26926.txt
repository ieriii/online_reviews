Sports bar pizzeria 1. Sad to read about the owner's daughter passing away from cancer. She looked like a lovely young woman. I'm humbled by how they took such a tragedy and turned it into a positive by creating a scholarship fund in her name. If the place was crap, I'd still support it just by this utilitarian virtue. 2. Food Bruchetta- pretty pricey. My friends from NYC apparently loved it. I thought it was too salty and the basil was wilted. But in their weekend here we went to Pequod's *twice* and they got the bruchetta each time. Pizza I don't dig chicago style deep dish, especially the dough-cheese-soggy dough-sauce technique. Thank god pequod's doesn't do this, they do thick dough, *scant* cheese (I had a plain cheese and was struggling to find any cheese), and copious sauce. That caramelized crust is ridiculously good and their trademark. And it is simply the *thickest* dough base I've ever come across, it's almost too thick dare I say. In the end, I'm still used to the non-Chicago, dough-sauce-cheese style. I wonder if I can get my next pan pizza like that. I'll be bringing my parents here when they come visit.
