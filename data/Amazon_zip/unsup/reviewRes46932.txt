You have to love a place that not only has good food but good music as well. The decor is very cool with an amazing old, wood bar. The servers are very social and knowledgeable on the menu. The wine and beer selection is some of the best in the city. The food also rises to these levels with great portions that fill you up but don't have you taking a doggie bag home.
