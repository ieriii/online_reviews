This hotel is BEAUTIFUL!  It's a little weird because at street level you have to take an escalator (around the back) to get to the lobby. But once you start going up the escalator, you enter the most amazing lobby I have ever seen. I just kept thinking what a beautiful wedding you could have there! (But, I don't live in Chicago... and I doubt they have weddings in their lobby). My room is huge - but I heard some of my coworkers complaining about small rooms. Maybe I just lucked out. It also has great decor, and the beds are oh so comfortable. The mirror in the bathroom is lit from the back - so it's excellent for getting ready. The service has been amazing and the restaurant downstairs is delicious!
