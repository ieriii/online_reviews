Considering I hadn't eaten in 10 hours a store bought frozen pizza could have satisfied me. I'm glad we didn't do that though. First the wait for a half full restaurant (45 mins) is ridiculous! Second be aware that pizza takes foooorrrrreeevvvvvveeerrr (yes forever) Third 6 people ordering 3 pizza sounded like a great idea to a starving crew (and I would argue it still was) but the waiter even questioned the food amount and told us if we did finish all of it he would be truly impressed. Fourth the amount of food seemed overwhelming to our waiter and he forgot our salads. Lucky for us (and him) they came out quickly afterwards. And finally the pizza and the table fell silent to sheer amount and overwhelming hunger. We ate and ate and ate. My ratings: Hawaiian- Lots of flavor, solid sauce, pineapple on top and lots of Canadian Bacon (ham) inside and cheese Pepperoni- (lots of amazing cheesiness and I wish for a bit more pepperoni inside) Special - Wayyyyy too much green bell pepper and not enough sausage and extras The center was solid on all of them but the crust was a bit too much so they did fall to the wayside. Overall MAKE RESERVATIONS BEFOREHAND! know that the pre-order doesn't work all that great because when we sat we still had to wait (which was torture) service is very attentive great if your not so hungry you want to hurt people otherwise the nect time I wanted to see the server was with pizza in hand. Was it worth it? Yes the food was amazing!
