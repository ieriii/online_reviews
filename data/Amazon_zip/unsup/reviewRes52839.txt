Came here for lunch today with my boss and co-workers. Initial impression was great. The weather was perfect for sitting outdoors and the ambiance was fantastic. Music playing in the background, just a slight breeze, and lots of sunshine. Things went downhill from here.  There only seemed to be one waiter working when we got there. This significantly slowed things down, I don't want to blame the waiter since he did a good job, but having one waiter at noon just doesn't suffice. It took us about 15 minutes to get our order in. Our mariquitas appetizer came about 25 minutes later. It was delicious, nicely fried and garlicky. Our entrees came about 15-20 minutes after that. We were getting a bit restless and asked what was taking so long, and they claimed that the tiliapia that one of us ordered took a while to cook. Doesn't sound like a good excuse to me. When we finally got our food it was pretty good. I had the Cuban and it was a solid version of it. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal as well. I would like to think that the restaurant was having a bad day, but from the looks of a couple of the other reviews it seems as though some people have had similar experiences. I would be willing to try it again if I know it isn't going to take an hour and half to eat a sandwich. Three stars for the food, -1 for the service.
