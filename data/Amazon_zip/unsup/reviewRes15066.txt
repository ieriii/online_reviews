Such a cute place! I loved the atmosphere right away. It's nice and cozy and private and you can have a good time with friends without being bothered by others in the bar. The waiter was really nice and my drink was very good (it was one of the gin drinks, I can't remember anymore). I also love postcards as business cards so I was sure to snag the one that came with our bill. Pretty reasonably priced (in terms of Chicago as I have seen) and the hidden door is awesome. The wait area is a little awkward since people coming out can easily run into those that are waiting. We went on a Saturday evening around midnight and the wait wasn't too absurd. It also felt awkward taking photos since the place was so dark and... it just felt like it was a no-no. Bathrooms are cute and clean and lots of space to maneuver around. Overall, a great place. Definitely would come back next time I am in town!
