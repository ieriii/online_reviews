Came here just before christmas. I have been here a few times in the past but it had been at least 3 years. Was a little hesistant after reading that it got only one michelin star. Had the chef lost his marbles? Were the staff resting on their laurels? I felt this was my best experience at Tru. All the dishes tasted great and were very creative. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Yes, its not a cheap meal but I don't mind shelling out some $$$ for gourmet dining. I have been to a couple of 3 star michelin restaurants and honestly this place was right on par.
