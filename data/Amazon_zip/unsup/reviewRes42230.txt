For Chicago Vietnamese, I'd say this is about as good as it gets (tied with Pho777). My favorite dish is the Bun Thit Nuong (vermicelli, greens and meats) and Tank delivered. I got the one with beef, shrimp, egg roll and fried pork. Normally, I am not a huge fan of shrimp but this was very good with none of the dreaded fishy taste. The bowl was full to the brim and I was completely sated by the end.
