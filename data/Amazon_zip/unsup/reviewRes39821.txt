If you're looking for a swanky restaurant with a nice decor dont come here. If you want unbelievably good tasting Korean BBQ then do. It's open REAL late so you dont have to worry about making it here by a certain time. As with many BBQ restaurants, try the Kalbi. I also like the onion pancakes. There isnt much parking in front but there is ample street parking
