Awewsome burger. Awesome Vibe. Awesome free round of beers if you're waiting in line. Whaaaat! Oh, that's not all folks - they have half off burgers on Tuesdays! I'm in love. The burger is super juicy and came out just the way I ordered it. The Fries are DELISH! And the mac and cheese was OK. The top was yummy b/c of all the crunchies tho. Yes, it has an eeri resemblance to Kuma's Corner....but it's just as good and it's closer to home so I will be back.
