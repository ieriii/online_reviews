Came here last summer while visiting Chicago before training. We had been walking around all day and wanted to get a drink or snack before having a real dinner. We had heard this place was good so we walked alll the way down Michigan avenue from one end until we reached it finally. It's right next to Millenium Park so it's around a nice area. So we ended up having beer. We also got the Chips (fries) which came with this really good gravy sauce to dip it in. This was very good and probably the only reason I remember this place. I have tried to find a recipe to make the curry sauce, that's how good it was. There really wasn't anything particularly fascinating about this place. Maybe if we ate there I might say something different, but to come here for drinks, it wasn't really what I thought it would be.
