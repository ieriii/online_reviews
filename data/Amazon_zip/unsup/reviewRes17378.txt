The interior is exquisite, but comfortable, and the food is amazing. I love Indian food and I have my favorites of places. Since I can't afford this one too many times a month, being a college student, it can't be my favorite. However, I came here twice. Once to enjoy the lunch buffet with friends and once to celebrate two birthdays. So, I got to eat a lot of the food! During the buffet lunch, I was so stuffed, that I could barely stand to sit up. Although I made room for Mango Kulf! Delicious. During the birthday dinner I got to try many dishes on the menu, especially since we mostly ate different things at the birthday and passed around. The Naan was perfect, and so buttery and flavorful! Mmmm! My Indian roommate was with me on both occasions, and she's had food from many of my favorite places, but this and Gaylords are the only two with her authentic stamp of approval =)
