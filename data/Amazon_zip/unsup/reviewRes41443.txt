Best filet in Chicago, served here, period. I usually ask for extra butter sauce so the beef stays hot a little bit longer. And, no A1 is necessary. New York strip is excellent as well. I have problems with their side dishes. Very uninspired and bland. They try to mix it up every so often, but nothing unusually good transpires from it. Desserts are pretty decent, but I'm usually stuffed that I don't partake in it every time.  The service for the most part is excellent. On two different occasions, they overcooked my steak and were very apoloogetic and brought one within 5-7 minutes.  I've been to the other steakhouses, except for Flemings, and nothing beats Ruth's Chris. I don't care if it's a chain - if Outback made anything similar to Ruth's Chris - I'd eat it.  Go for lunch - it's a better deal, too. The place is usually pretty full on any given evening.
