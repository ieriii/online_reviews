I had an Open-table coupon for this place, I purchased it for the fact that the dining is touted as upscale and its a BYOB (huge plus once I saw the food prices). Each of the eight courses were presented beautifully...they say "presentation is everything" but i have to say that I only enjoyed 2 of the 8 courses. The one scalop was the best I've ever tasted, excellent with a slightly rich flavor of a delicate soft cheese - so delish!! Border-line orgasmic! The rabbit was chewy, the Lobster bisque was tasty but served just below room temp. and the short ribs were fatty. Careful about the chocolate dessert, the red beet puree is bitter. Servers were pretty good. For the price I paid (even with the coupon), I'd say steer clear.
