Finally went to Violet Hour! I was expecting the staff to be extremely uptight, but to my surprise, they were very nice and super attentive. We only waited about 15 minutes for our table, granted it was a sunday, and memorial day weekend, but it was pretty quick. The Bouncer said please do not use flash,,, a lot. haha. they were very nice about us.. we kept snapping pictures... and they wouldn't turn out unless we used flash! and for some reason our candle kept going out, and they kept coming back to relight it.. pretty nice service. We had a variety of 4 different drinks. 3 out of the 4 drinks were very yummy! strong, but yummy! I don't drink often, but i will come back to drink their drinks! Even though it was a little warm inside, the only downside, overall experience was pretty good.
