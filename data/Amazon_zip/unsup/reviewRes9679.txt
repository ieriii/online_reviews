This place was great! Was in from out of town last weekend and went to Sprout for a fun/fancy night out. Great experience all around. I started with the scallop dish which was absolutely fantastic. Melt in your mouth, great texture combination, and just all around amazing. My boyfriend had the Frog, which we both liked. I prefered scallop though. Next course is why I am giving it 4 stars.. . I had the pork, at the suggestion of our waiter. I love pork and the pork was cooked well, the preparation was just too sweet for my own taste. The BF had the Rabbit which was pretty fantastic. I had a third course (Melon) for dessert because I wasn't really interesting in something sweet, and it was good. Not a lot for what it was though. Lots of restaurants in chicago, but i will go back sometime!
