One of the longest dinners of my life. That's my number one issue with this place is that our dinner took almost 3 hours. We order 3 courses, appetizer of the cerviche trio, 2 entrees, and dessert but I totally don't get why it took so long since it's mexican food. All the tables around us took just as long. It took forever to get the first course and then huge gaps of waiting time between each course. The servers don't seem to want to turn over the tables, perhaps wanting us to drink more during the wait time.  This brings me to my other issue, the drinks. The margaritas were quite good and shaken tableside. However, for $9-11, they were quite small, being served in martini glasses.  To the main event, the food. I was really underwhelmed! I really had high expectations being a fan of the show. The mole had some good flavor but other than that, food was really mediocre at best. Not worth the long wait.
