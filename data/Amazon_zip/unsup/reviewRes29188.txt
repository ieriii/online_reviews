I know people may be surprised, as this is supposed ot be one of the best Mexican restaurants in the country, but it really didn't live up to its reputation for us. May be because I am not a fan of corn based food (corn tortillas...etc). It definitely has a huge fan base, unfortunately not us. Sorry
