While in town for work, I took my mom here for lunch. We had a fabulous time sipping the wine that came recommended with our entree pick, munching on fried olives stuffed with chorizo, and enjoying the glorious weather Chicago was having that minute with the sunlight streaming through the large glass windows. Here's what we tried: Broccoli with Roasted Garlic & Anchovy Vinaigrette - AMAZING, fresh, bright flavors, perfectly cooked Burrata & Micro Greens - good but a bit too subtle compared with the rest of our meal Taleggio, Fig & Onion Marmalade & Escarole Hearts - gooey, savory and sweet, and the most filling part of the meal (thank goodness, because I'm a hungry girl) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - Savory piggy goodness I wish I lived in Chicago still so I could frequent this place. I'll miss you my royal swinish friend.
