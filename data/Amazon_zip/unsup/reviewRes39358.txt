San Goo Gab San is, in a word, bumpin'. Place is packed. The large booths and expansive space accommodate big groups, which you are likely to see.  The barbeque pits are smokier than the vents are effective, so don't wear your favorite sweater. The menu is extensive and the food never fails, except for the one time they were out of buckwheat noodles when I needed some, stat. I went for the japchae instead. Japchae is a classic dish that consists of cellophane noodles, vegetables, and beef (optional) stir-fried in sesame oil. It's as appealing to the provincial palate as the ever-popular pad thai. It is thus a good option for vegetarians and picky eaters, who you can't always leave behind.  The banchan will cover your table, leaving very little remaining space. Seriously, it's hard not to knock into things. At least it is for me. Note: the staff is not going to baby you. They might not even smile. Deal with it: they are working very, very hard. They take their jobs seriously. Juggling millions of tiny plates, navigating past fire-pits and serving an endless bustling crowd is what they do. Welcoming you is not. San Goo Gab San is an institution in Chicago. The late-night scene can't be beat. All kinds of folks go in there, ravenous, in various-sized post-party groups. It's people-watching galore!  The best part is you will never, never leave hungry. Geonbae!
