Absolutely delicious. I've been going there for the past 5 years. Great service, friendly people. Cool atmosphere -- yes, there are no windows -- but the decor is very urban and the Japanese anime on one of the walls fits the place perfectly. We' ve also held a couple of private parties there -- it turns into a cool private club. They don't serve nigiri, only maki rolls -- but very imaginative and HUGE. My faves -- White Tiger, Red Dragon, Double Stack and Godzilla. For appetizers -- Spicy Tuna Salad and Wasabi Garlic Mashed Potatoes steal my heart (I mean stomach :) ) away.  BYOB with no corkage fee is a big plus, with a CVS across the street in case you forgot to pick up a bottle of wine or some beer. They opened another location on Diversey east of Clark, but there's a full bar there, and I like to bring my own. Keep in mind, one roll from their MEGA section will fill up even a hungry appetite.
