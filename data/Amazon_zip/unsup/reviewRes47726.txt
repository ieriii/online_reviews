We had a delicious meal for our anniversary last week. For $44 (plus tax and tip) you get an all you can eat buffet with an amazing assortment of appetizers and entrees. In the Brazilian steakhouse style, the servers come around with skewers of meat, fish, chicken and other selections. The service couldn't have been better, as we were asked several times if there was something specific we would like more of. The only problem was filling up too much on the appetizer/ salad bar!  There's definitely something for everybody- even great vegetarian options (I think that would be $25 all you can eat). The steak, Moroccan chicken and salmon were my favorites! It was raining, so we didn't check out the roof deck, but we really enjoyed the ambiance inside. I'm not sure why they said a 7pm reservation wasn't available- we came at 6 and there were plenty of tables available when we left at 8. We'll definitely go back!
