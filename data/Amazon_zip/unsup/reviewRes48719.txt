I was in Chicago for the weekend and my wife and I met a friend for the Publican's brunch. Her husband was a sous chef working that day. My wife and I were pretty hungover and had a six hour drive in front of us. We stood around drinking coffee and juice waiting for our table; it was busy. We then got seated and the chef sent over sticky buns, blueberry donuts and almond cake. All were fantastic and decadent and went great with the strong coffee. I ordered a meal with sausage, beef tongue and a couple other meats and the waiter said "you have a 6 hour drive? You're about to go into a food coma." My wife and her friend ordered two other entrees, but her boyfriend sent out three dishes before our orders came out: fried oyster biscuit and chorizo gravy (oh my GOD), wine poached egg (delicious), and wild king salmon lox (the best salmon I've ever tasted in any preparation) and chicken fried steak (also, best CFS I've ever had; unique, citrus and buttery flavor). We ate SO much food and had lots to take home. Food, service, atmosphere was all great. The prices aren't as high as you'd expect for such good food; coffee and an entree might set you back $20, and the amount of thought and skill in the kitchen that goes into each dish is worth the price. I'd love to go back and try dinner next time I'm in Chicago.
