My wife and I stayed here July 30th. We arrived at three oclock in the afternoon and they said our room was not ready yet and it would probably be about an hour. We had reservations for 4 pm so I told the clerk this was not acceptable. They finally got us in our room about 3:30. The room looked nice but the air was not on. When we returned about 6pm the room was 80 degrees. I called the front desk and when the person arrived he told me there was no one available to fix the air and I could just open a window. (it was 89 degrees outside) Needless to say we spent a very uncomfortable night. The room was nice but I felt like the service could have been a lot better!
