I would give this a 3 and a half stars. I love it for promoting and encouraging sustainable food. We were there on Thursday when they had half off on the wine bottles. The food was good, freshly made and tasty. But nothing that blew my mind. We started with the croquettes with the dill sauce - they were tasty but were on the greasy side for me. I ordered their flat bread which had garlic, cheese and heirloom tomatoes - this was the yummiest dish that we ordered. My husband ordered the gnocchi and we did not like it too much. All in all a cute little place, and the service was very good. Though a little pricey for the quantity of the food.
