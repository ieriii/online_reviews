I may not be doing Zed451 justice since I've only been here once for Sunday brunch. While the food is good and the harvest table is fresh and innovative, $60 for a brunch just seems a tiny-bit on the expensive side. I did enjoy their selection of brunch food (the salmon benedict was very good), as well as their roast meats. Their dessert selection was also excellent. But overall, I probably could have gotten the same food somewhere else for much cheaper.
