My take out order was messed up so that was not a good start. I had to make my own rice since they forgot to put it in.  I might as well have cooked the whole meal. The ropa vieja and frijoles negros were kind of tasteless. Too many Latin places I've been to in Chicago leave out the authentic ingredients and spices and everything comes out tasting just plain salty and one dimensional. This is one of them. I don't get all the hyped up reviews - either they come from people too far removed from the real thing and what it's supposed to taste like or they're friends of the house. Sorry, but not worth it.
