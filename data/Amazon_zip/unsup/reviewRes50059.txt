My husband is Colombian so we have tried just about every Colombian restaurant in the city. This one is one of the best if you want red meat. They have more than one location and depending on when/where you go, you might even get blessed with a little something special (music and dancing) which is great for a group/party. The Yucca and the Plantains have always been good, but the secret with the Yucca, and the Arepas is to either eat it while it is really hot (careful starches hold heat) or to make sure you have enough of the juices from your meat to eat it with or it will not be as good. I find that most of my firends/family that don't like Las Tablas either don't like meat, or they don't know the difference between Colombian and other South American cuts of meat. My favorite of all times here is the Plater for 2 with a side of Empenadas and Arepas. We can share it and have plenty for a 3rd or 4th.
