Different is the first thing I thought when walking inside this mind trip of a bar/lounge area. I felt kind of uncomfortable walking into this place because it seemed like you have to be real quiet and dress fancy but for anyone who knows me I am a very loud person. We didn't get kicked out. I went for a friends birthday and we got a cozy booth area. The drinks are pricey but they do have a good list of beverages, beer and wine as well as mixed drinks. Their menu is unique but hard to read because it is so dark! The candles on the table were enough for ambient light but not good enough to read the menu. I had to pull my iPhone out just to read it. I ordered a beer (cant remember I just ordered what my friend got and the birthday girl got an Indian summer. I have to say it was delicious. I didn't get to walk around much or sit at the bar or check out the washroom. I could only imagine the washroom being as crazy as the whole setup of this place. Pricey but fun. Its different but not somewhere I'd like to spend a weekend. If you're looking to impress a date or just want somewhere to chill with your bf/gf this is the place. It's not like any other place I've been to and that's a good thing. One thing I would invest in would be a DJ or someone with some music knowledge. It was a terrible mix or 90's and pop music. Very weird choice for such a swank little place.
