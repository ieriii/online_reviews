This jazz club is so cool everything comes across with a meringue lightness, yet, all is so obviously executed with extraordinary care and on a grand scale that it's a tip off that reveals the soul of the establishment. It's a former speakeasy loved by Al Capone (apparently he had an escape inside if it was raided), mobsters, Sinatra, other music greats and actors...even today. The atmosphere is very old school and classic. Also, the Poetry Slam on Sundays lead by the Poetry Slam founder Marc Smith ("so what!"- that's a thing audience says to him) is fantastic. I have an interesting perspective to my review because I've been a customer and performed in slam a bit here. It's great as a spectator, some true talents out there. I am very entertained and inspired. As a performer. The crowd was kind and involved. Its cool having a jazz band back you up as you read your poem. Marc- he's the greatest- so nice and incredibly talented. Ha I loved that he always teases me. Seriously, he does relentlessly. They serve alcohol and it's dim and kinda secksy. The music and bands and dancing are amazing! Ha! the bathrooms are great tons of graffiti everywhere! But funny random stuff and jokes. Definitely check it out. It's a piece of Chicago history and fun too!
