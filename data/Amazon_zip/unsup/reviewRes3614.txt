I went to Crisp for the second time today, my first visit being shortly after they opened. I couldn't remember exactly what I liked so much about it, but I had been thinking about it ever since that first visit. Today, I was reminded of why it stayed in my brain.  The Seoul Sassy wings are phenomenal. They are crack, and I'll be thinking about how to get my next fix until I get back there. Who would have thought that bird skin could be sooo delicious? The sauce is perfectly spicy and sweet (my favorite combination of flavors).  Unfortunately, their delivery range stops just short of my building (they only go as far north as Irving Park). Shucks! Probably for the best, though. I might weigh 200 pounds if I could have those wings some to my door. (The Buddha Bowls are really good, too, and probably a whole lot healthier!)
