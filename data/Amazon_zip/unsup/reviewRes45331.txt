I absolutely love the ambience in this place. I always want to sit in the library, but it never seems to work out for me. The menu, on the other hand, is not exactly tailored to my tastes, I think, and I usually leave feeling like I would have been much more satisfied somewhere much less expensive. I feel like the selection is pretty limited as well. Has the potential to be one of my favorite places in my neighborhood to eat, but the food falls just a little short for me.
