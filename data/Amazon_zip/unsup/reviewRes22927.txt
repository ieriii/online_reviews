I've loved Irazu since I started going in the late 90's. Hard to believe they've been around for as long as they have. So glad they're doing very well and since their son took over the business, the restaurant has some great added features - expansion of the outdoor patio, more items on the menu. Over the years, I've stuck to a few of my favorites. The vegetarian plate is one of them, (loads of food), consisting of rice, beans, sweet plantains, cabbage salad and the veggie of the day. The highlight for me on this plate is the frijoles negros (black beans) and the amazing cabbage salad!! The salad is citrusy and refreshing with some great flavors. The veggie tacos are also very good and filling, with black beans, yellow rice, tomato, lettuce, avocado and if you want, hot peppers. Perfect for an inexpensive, quick meal. Stopped in the other day and wanted something refreshing for the hot day. I ordered the ceviche which is raw fish marinated in lime juice, with avocado and some chopped tomatoes on top. The bowl that it comes in is deceiving. It appears to be small, but as I ate, it began to seem like the never ending bowl of ceviche. I hate wasting food, so I ate as much as I could stuff into my belly!! It was delicioso!! Empanada's are a semi-new edition to the growing menu. And since I'm a lover of empanada's, I had to try them out. Hand made fresh in the back kitchen by Mama Irazu herself, her empanada's are made with a corn dough. I love corn and these were very good. Can't wait to try the other veg flavors! A newer item on the menu is the hor-cafe. 1/2 horchata and 1/2 coffee. An interesting combination and it was very pleasing. You can't go to Irazu without trying one of their shakes. My favorite is the avena (oatmeal), which has a great flavor and grainy texture. Exceptionally tasty!! I didn't know it but you can combine 2 different shake flavors, so next time it's avena y chocolate!! Can't get enough of Irazu's!!!!
