I feel like I should be writing two reviews... one for the food and another one for my initial impression. The food review would definitely be a good one: the shrimp cocktail was great (I loved getting a side of horseradish), the steak was prepared perfectly and didn't even need a steak sauce and the crab gnocchi was a great change up to a potato. The desserts were excellent as well. I chose Mastro's for my birthday dinner with a good friend and even noted on the reservation that we were celebrating my birthday. We showed up to a busy restaurant and were shown to our table: a first floor table, the first one on the left, directly beside the kitchen door that swung back and forth every couple seconds. After being blinded for a few minutes by the kitchen lights, I asked the hostess if anything else was available, they politely said that was it at the moment. However, they did say "oh, you shoulda asked for a table in the middle of the dining room"... glad this was my first time there and I didn't think of that off the top of my head... right? Why would you have a table like this? Why not put up a wall next to it to shield guests eyes from the kitchen? This table shouldn't even exist - END OF STORY. We decided to have a cocktail in the bar before being seated at a nice table upstairs. MAKE SURE YOU REQUEST A TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DINING ROOM!
