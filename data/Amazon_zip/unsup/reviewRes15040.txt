wow! Sit at the bar and really take in the craftsmanship. Each cocktail is delicately made and deserves your full attention. If you want a cheap drink both in cost and in composition this is not the bar for you. Don't get me wrong though I enjoy a PBR and shot of Jamesons as much as the next guy but sometimes I enjoy heaven in a glass!
