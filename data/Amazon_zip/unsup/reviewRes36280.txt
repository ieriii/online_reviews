Let's cut to the chase. I was kind of bummed out about the charge for a glass concerning the BYOB. None the less, the food has been mostly exceptional. Impressive wine list. Crab Rangoon is better than any similar restaurant around that I've had. The Pad Thai is just... okay. Nothing really to blow your socks off. The Pangang Curry is fantastic (but was cold when I received it =/ ) as well as the ginger salad. The ambiance is different, but strangely cozy. Surrealism blankets the walls. Alcohol is over-priced for Edgewater. All sushi I've had from Indie has been delicious. Definitely a place worth trying.
