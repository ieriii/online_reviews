One of my new favorite restaurants! We went here on a Friday night for my husbands birthday...and both loved it! The service was great, very professional. I made a note that it was my husbands birthday when I made the reservation, so they added some nice extra touches which I greatly appreciated. I also requested to sit in the back room (I think it's called the library) which they accomodated, and I would definately reccommend...you still feel like you are in the main restauarant, but tucked away a little so it's more private. The only frustration of the evening was the loud and obnoxious foursome next to us, who kept getting up to smoke throughout their dinner, so would come back smelling like an ashtray as we were eating, but I guess the restaurant can't do anything to prevent that. We did the 5 course tasting, which was the perfect amount of food, and each had one mixed drink and a glass of wine (on the expensive side, or we probably would have had more...since the meal lasted a couple hours). The food was expensive, but worth it since every bite was so, so, soooo good.  Very creative and fun menu. Everyone from our waitress to the bus boy was on top of things the entire night and took the time to explain everything, and make you feel very welcome. We will be back, even if just for special occasions!
