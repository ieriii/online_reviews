Good service, romantic upstairs, great iced tea. I prefer to sit upstairs in the Polynesian palm room to dine.The downstairs interior doesn't have the same romantic ambiance. It's a very large room downstairs, that can play host to larger parties. I like what they've done with the intimate upstairs; lined with teak furnishings and palm fronds. I pretty much order the same two things on the menu, as other things I have tried were unimpressive. Love the Shrimp Fried Rice ( I crave this regularly) Great Iced Tea ( and a wide selection of exotic hot teas ) *If you love tea, come here. Charming location. I give this restaurant 4 stars because I can count on the shrimp fried rice and a great iced tea in a relaxing, romantic atmosphere after a long day.
