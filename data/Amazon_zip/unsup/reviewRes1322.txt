My boyfriend has been wanting to try Hot Dougs for several months and I decided to take him today before driving him to the airport. We showed up at 10:30 am and there was already a line, but we only waited fifteen minutes. The food is excellent and while I wouldn't wait two hours for it I think it's worth the trip. Oh, and I bought a hat. My boyfriend summed up his feelings with this phrase: "SON OF A BITCH, THEY HAVE TAB."
