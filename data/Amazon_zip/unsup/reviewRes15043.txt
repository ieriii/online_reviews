Maybe the other reviews built up my hopes a bit too much, but I was not overly impressed with The Violet Hour. We visited around 8 pm on a Saturday. The line outside was not very long, but I felt there were too many parties leaving compared to the rate at which others were allowed to enter. The atmosphere is nice, but I feel like the music was too loud for the designed effect. I assumed it would be much quieter to allow for more intimate conversation, but it was just not possible. Our server was friendly, however, I got the impression on multiple occasions that our table was being passed over on multiple occasions. We were well-dressed and polite, so I am unsure of the source of this inattention. I am comfortable for paying a large sum for a basic drink, but the $12 here was not really what the quality or venue demanded. I had the Old Square Sazerac and was delivered something which tasted like it had far too much low quality liquor. For the price, I expected something much smoother. While I enjoyed the experience, I would not consider this worth the cost and would not really recommend to someone who had not already exhausted some other locations in Chicago.
