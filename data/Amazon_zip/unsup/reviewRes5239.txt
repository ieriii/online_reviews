One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. There will probably be a wait but it will be worth it. It's a lively & loud place and sometimes you will have to share a communal table.I wouldn't go with a large group or if I had time constraints. Couple of my favorites from the menu are the pork shoulder, the pig's ear, and the eggplant & goat cheese smear. Very nice wine and beer list. Enjoy!
