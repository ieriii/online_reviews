Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy! My BFF planned an awesome birthday dinner for me here. I LOVED the food! Everything we ate was great. I especially liked the mussels, the flank steak, the corn, the tuna...uh everything. Seriously. It's served kinda family style. You order a bunch of dishes and share. It's a great way to be able to try a bunch of things. All the plates are pretty unique and have a lot of style and flavor that you won't find at other restaurants, and that's what I loved most about this place. The beer and wine list was nice. I like the wood tones everywhere and the bathroom area is pretty cool. Our server was good also. The only downside is I think it was a little pricey for what you get. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind spending a decent chunk of change on dinner from time to time, but it was like spending entree-sized money on appetizer-sized plates. Overall, I will definitely go back, in fact, I can't wait to!
