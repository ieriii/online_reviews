Wow! I was suggested this restaurant by a customer from my store, and I ordered the food for carry out after I was done closing. Not only was the hostess so sweet, she also offered to co hearse the kitchen to holding off on the order as long as possible so that it would stay warm.         The menu is very dynamic considering its it drawing on a rather limited source of "ethnic" food, English, but OMG DELICIOUS. Even out of tin pans and reheated 20 min after it was made it was amazing. DO NOT MISS THE MUSCLES IN SAFFRON,or THE CORNED BEEF! Ate till my hearts content, and cannot wait to go back and soak in the lovely atmosphere at the restaurant.
