I really would like to like this place. I just don't. I've been here a bunch of times. I will probably be back, not by my choice. The service is decent, not good, not outstanding, just decent and a little slow. Maybe I'm just not a fan of their food, which I've yet to find something that I really like.Even their omelets, hamburgers which are simple please me food, kinda left me not feeling so hot after wards. Not sick, just "Ugh, why did I just eat that?" feeling. I wish I could like this place, it just doesn't excite me, not even close to a twirl of my finger or raising of an eyebrow.
