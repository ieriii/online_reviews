Oh Korean BBQ and Karaoke... What can I say? (Awesome) San Soo Gab San is awesome. One of the most popular Korean BBQ restaurant and rightfully so. It's authentic Korean, Korean people come and eat here, and even the ladies who work here are like the rude asian aunties (I say that in an endearing way because I'm Asian and perhaps one day I will also become a rude asian aunty) that I encounter in Asia. But seriously I do love them, and their blunt manners. It's weird, I know. Perfect place for gathering with friends around fire like our ancestors did, to eat flame grilled meat. MEAT!!! Your hair will stink for days, your breath will smell like kimchee. Wear and old tshirt. Don't go to a fancy establishment afterwards without showering 2x. Vegetarians will also not be disappointed by the amass of side dishes that come with the meats. But it is probably best that they skip this one.
