For Chicago Style pizza this place has it going on. Ive been going there before the expanded or even had a bathroom about 10 years. The owner Art is not only active in his company but kept most of the same people around. The super beef is a great sandwich and on Sundays they have a deal for 3 or 4 bucks for the Spaghetti Dinner (Soup,Salad, and a huge plate of pasta with two HUGH meat balls. Try this place and you ll be a repeat guest...
