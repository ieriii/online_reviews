I just had a very delicious experience at Chicago q. The dcor of q has a modern country feel. The walls and ceiling are white detailed wood. The floors are wide planked with a medium stain and the tables are dark which serve to create a nice contrast in a very inviting way.The service is wonderful. The wait staff is very attentive and easy going in this gourmet BBQ restaurant. Instead of the automatic boring basket of bread before the meal that most restaurants serve, we were served intriguing sweet pickles and seasoned potato chips. That was a pleasant surprise. The artful presentation of the food goes against the traditional sloppy style expectations of a BBQ experience. Though each member of my dining group ordered his/her own items off the menu, we all tasted everything. So here is my take on the food: The hush puppies appetizer appealed to my eye in its display on the plate and to my taste buds. For my main course, I had a very generous portion of the tender and flavorful pulled chicken sandwich that also included three different sauces in which to dip the sandwich for the full BBQ experience. My sides were pickled onions and cole slaw. Both had a unique flavor twist to a common food item which made the lunch even more special. One of my dining partners had sliced kobe brisket, which was very tender, with a side of the most delicious honey corn bread. The other, had a chopped kobe brisket sandwich, also very tender and flavorful. The only disappointment was the side of french fries that came with the last mentioned sandwich. They were unexpectedly dry, heavy and flavorless. I am thinking sweet potato fries would have complimented this dish much better. The dessert was a large piece of carrot cake which was a big hit all around.Overall, this is lovely place to grab a delicious meal with reasonable prices.
