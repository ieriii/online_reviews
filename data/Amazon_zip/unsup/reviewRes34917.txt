I understand that there are something things that you just don't get delivered because its just not the same as in a restaurant. However, Sushi X has made me realize that there are exceptions to the rules. I LOVE ordering from Sushi X. My rolls are consistently good. I can never resist the honey roll. So tasty. But by far the most delicious item (besides my beloved honey roll) are the wasabi mashed potatoes. I'm sure its nothing incredibly complicated that they have thrown together, but I think that its delish! They don't have a lot of rolls to choose from. However, for indecisive people like myself, the menu size is perfect. I've never eaten at the restaurant itself but then again there's no reason to. I can get enough sushi for two people for less than $50 delivered to my home. I highly recommend that everyone try Sushi X! P.S.-Kudos to the staff for always providing ample wasabi and ginger (my fav!).
