long wait before seating as expected.. service was pretty slow .. ordered the Eggs Benedict , chocolate strawberry pancakes, and a glass of orange juice... orange juice was more on the sour side then sweet.. the Eggs Benedict was pretty decent and the pancakes was just average.. there are just far better options for breakfast places around the neighborhood then yolk.. for the wait and price I'm paying, i would expect better service and food...
