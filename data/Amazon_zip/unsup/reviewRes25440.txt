Arroz soup and truita de patata are extremely salty. How can you make a salty truita which is a Spanish omelette! Not traditional and authentic. I've had real ones in Spain. To make matters worst...the cured meat like salami and prosciutto were not salty in comparison. That is scary and unbelievable.
