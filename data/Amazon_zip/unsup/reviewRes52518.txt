I've eaten here twice. Each time, I needed some crazy amount of meat to satiate my appetite, and each time I ate here I was slightly disappointed.  The meat is not as flavorful as Fogo. The garlic beef was not that garlicky so that was disappointing. I like the warm pineapple to change things up a bit. The salad bar is different and better than Fogo. It offeres antipasti, homemade signature salads such as seafood salad. An anomaly is that they also have sushi. I haven't tried it yet because I don't eat sushi from non-sushi places. But I admire their effort. The service is very attentive and they are all very friendly. Word of advice - for dinner, they bring around this beautiful ice block that has fruit and flowers embedded into it and then they pour your a shot from it. The shot costs $11 per shot and it's not that great. There are so many different brazilian steakhouses in Chicago...spend your money elsewhere.
