Contemporary and modern twists on some classic Southern cuisine best describes the tasty treats to be found at this delightful Andersonville gem. A group of my friends went for Dinner Saturday night and all 7 of us were absolutely satisfied with our experience. The place was packed and they're were long waits for tables, but our reservation was immediately honored and we were sitting in a matter of minutes. Waits for drinks can be lengthy, but we were forewarned by our waiter (Danny) as many of the specialty cocktails are very "labor intensive". We did wait about a half an hour for our appetizers, but were treated to complimentary boiled peanuts to tide us over. An interesting texture and bean like flavor helped us forget the wait. For apps we had the pulled pork grit cakes, potato croquettes & crawfish cakes. All were amazing and to add to the enjoyment, they were served on the house with sincere apologies. Yippie! We also got a round of beers comped too. Big Kudos to Big Jones for quickly acknowledging their error and correcting it. For entrees we had the shrimp burger, beef burger, fried green tomato BLT, gumbo, eggplant fritter & fish special. The Fritter was a bit of a disappointment as were the FGTBLT. Good flavors but messy and difficult to eat. Burgers though were amazing and the special fish was equally delicious. Yumms on the mac n cheese and the fried okra. We had a blast at Big Jones. Informative and attentive service with just enough sass to keep us entertained. All 7 of us were unanimous...Big Jones is AWESOME!
