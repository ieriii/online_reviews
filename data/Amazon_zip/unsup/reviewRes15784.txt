We went here for Valentine's Day on a recommendation and it was lovely. We easily found parking, despite it being a trendy neighborhood. And the food...The food was amazing...very flavorful and fresh. The wine was delicious, too, and the waiter was able to recommend a wine to go with my meal. Overall, the bill was very reasonable. For two drinks and two entrees, it only came to 50 dollars.  We will definitely be back, and the only problem will be not knowing whether to order the same great meal or something else. Everything looked so good!
