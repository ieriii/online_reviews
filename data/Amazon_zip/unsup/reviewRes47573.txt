Alright, this one is just for the lounge area.... DRINKS - Pretty good, not excellent. They have some interesting specialty cocktails, but nothing mind-blowing APPS - Mehhhh I'd skip them next time. The BBQ chips with onion dip were pretty good, but a little too strong/salty for my taste SERVICE - Lame. There were two servers to cover the entire lounge, and we had a hard time making eye contact with them. ATMOSPHERE - Really the only reason I'd come here. I just love the lounge, despite the uncomfortable bench seating. Love all the warm wood tones and the high ceiling
