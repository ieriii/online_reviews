on saturday i stood in the freezing cold with 20 mh winds and snow for atleast an hour, but it was worth it in my opinion. We got a bunch of specialty dogs, and the "Celebrity Dog of the Week" was this asian-inspired dog which was surprisingly really good (it had sriracha mustard and seaweed salad on top) and this sounds weird, but tasted like sushi! :) the salma hayek was ehhh...and i didnt finish mine... i went for the duck fat fries....and they were greasy, crispy and sooooo good. I seriously couldnt taste the "duckness" of the fries... go with a small group, go when the weather is nice, and leave your children at home!
