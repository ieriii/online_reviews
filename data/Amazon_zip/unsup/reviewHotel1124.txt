I really like the decor of this place. The rooms are comfortable and a decent size compared to other hotels at this price I've stayed at in Chicago. The view from my room was of Millennium Park, which looked really great at night. There were a few problems. We had paid extra for a package that included a late check out time of 5PM, when we got back at 4PM to get ready to leave we had been locked out of the room, and had to wait quite a while for them to get it fixed. Also, the rain shower shower head thing, looks good, but not really functional. I like water pressure. Other than those complaints, it was an overall good experience and we would come back again.
