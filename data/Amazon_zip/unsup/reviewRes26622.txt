OMG !!! Anytime you go to a restaurant two days in a row your either really greedy or the food is EXCELLENT!. I'll go with the food is EXCELLENT! I've been here about 3 times in 4 months and will probably go again before the snow melts. It's just that good. I've never had garlic spinach with pine nuts, shredds of green apples sprinkled on top. It sounds very different and it is, but it's very good. I went with my sister on the 1st trip and the chocolate balls we had for desert were soooo good I had to come back the next day with my husband for desert only. I've never had fried chocoalte balls with melted marshmallow and some type of sauce drizzled on top melt in my mouth until eating here. It was the best desert I've ever had in my entire life.....I'm not exaggerating! It was a little more expensive than your average tapas restaurant but it was worth it. When you go try to get a table next to the window and you'll have a beautiful view of michigan ave. During the weekends Mercat is busier but you can still get a seat in a reasonable amount of time. The only thing that didn't please my palate was a rice dish. It was too dry and lacked flavor.
