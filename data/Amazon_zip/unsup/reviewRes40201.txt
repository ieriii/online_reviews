i'm korean. and a hungry girl. especially after a night out drinking! so having a basically 24 hour korean restaurant in chicago is killer! kalbi-tang is one of my favorites... next to boodae jigae. and yes, boodae jigae is a spicy stew filled with ramen noodles, bacon, spam, and hotdogs. this might sound nasty to alot of people that aren't korean, but i'm telling you, after a night out... this is the best meal you can have (but if you have a heart condition, you probably shouldn't have any. boodae jigae is a heart attack waiting to happen). and get an order of kalbi to grill and eat. when i'm at a club, i seriously begin thinking about what im going to order here as the night starts to come to a close. yeah, im a fat kid at heart... cant help it.
