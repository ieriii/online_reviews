I really give this place an A+ for effort, a C for execution. We started off with the 5 ceviche tasting. There were a lot of great possibilities on here, but the end result was bleh. The flavors didn't stand out and I didn't think the fish used was that fresh. We also had the ropa vieja, and the beef was pretty good, but how can you mess up beef? I ordered the Arrachera, flank steak with chimichurri sauce and sauteed onions. This was pretty good, but again it's really not that hard to make chimichurri sauce and beef taste great. The man had the Bife Angosto and it wasn't good at all, in fact it left him a little ill for the next few hours. Overall I appreciated the ambiance, cocktails and vibe, but for all those people I saw waiting for hours to eat there, really, there's got to be some place else to go.
