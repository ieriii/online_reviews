Solid but not amazing. The look/design/decor is great. Lots of colors...I ordered the skit steak because it was $19 and one of the cheaper things on the menu...now I know why. I highly suggest trying something else. I ate most of my dates New York strip which was wonderful! Kinda a funny story that has nothing to do with the food....it was the night of Michael Phelps last race in this years Olympics and the entire 300 seat restaurant got up and watched the race at the bar as their food sat on their tables. Anyway, I would recommend this place for groups/special occasions. Enjoy!
