I've heard many things about Carnivale, it's expensive, it's pretty inside, the food is great, the food sucks, it's not worth the wait, it's totally worth the wait.. I've always been curious about this restaurant because I see an advertisement for it on 90-94 on the daily. I finally ventured to this place last night....  And you know what... I liked what I got...  The decor was bright, colorful and pleasing to the eye! We had to wait a little bit to get our table... I had reservations at 9:30 and we didn't get seated until about 10 pm, but we had the bar to keep us company, the drinks were a bit overpriced, but they were delicious and did the job! I had a mojito, an orange martini, and a margarita. All drinks were priced about 8 to 10 bucks.... I started off with the scallop ceviche and was impressed, it brought cold and heat with sweet and tangy! It was very tasty, the scallops were served with a pineapple reduction mixed with habanero juice. For the main course I had their version of pollo, it was half a roasted chicken served with roasted potatoes, green beans, green olives, and a chimichurri sauce! The chicken was juicy and the sauce complemented it very well! I really, really enjoyed the meal... all together it was about 45 bucks for everything! I would totally suggest coming here! Oh and valet only costs $5!
