I want to be able to give this 4 or 5 stars because I love the atmosphere - the space is amazing! However, between the service quality and the prices, I just cannot justify it. It seems they get by with their prices and service simply because it is a trendy place that people want to visit. I went recently with a large group of 14 people. We had two servers, but at least three times during our meal, they were nowhere to be found as if they completely deserted us. They were slow with simple drink orders and seemed to have some attitude dealing with a large group. My previous experience was a table of two. Much better, but still not impressive service. Food and drink quality are probably 4 stars, but still not worth the price paid. They basically take inferior cuts of meat and dress them up with sauces and garnishes. Drinks are similarly disguised as ultra-chic but actually very simple and not worth the $12 you'll pay.
