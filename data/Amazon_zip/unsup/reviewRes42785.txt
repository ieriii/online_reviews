I happened to walk by this little joint over the summer, it's just under the el tracks. I picked up a menu and reminded myself to order from here. Fast forward, like, 4 months! Ok, a little behind on adventurous take-out, I tend to order from the same ole places. The pizza came within an hour and was hot and fresh. I wouldn't say, based on a one-time order, that it's my favorite pizza. But it was tasty and I'd definitely order it again. It's highly likely that next time I'll try some of the chicken on the menu. My go-to for chicken is chicken hut.....but I'm open to being woo'd by other chicken joints. Btw, when I stopped in for the menu, the staff was very friendly (it was early 10:30 ish) and it was meticulously clean. A+ for that!
