My boyfriend and I stayed here last summer, before I moved to Chicago. We were attending a wedding and this was where the wedding party was staying and close to the reception. Our suite was amazing! Two flat screen TVs, giant bathroom and a really cozy bed. It was very difficult to get myself out of that bed and onto an early flight at O'hare the next day. Because of the wedding we did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked enjoying the expensive and beautiful room. I did enjoy the little time I did spend in the room though!
