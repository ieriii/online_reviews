Free internet and decent coffee, the baristas can be funny to interact with but are pretty useless when it comes to fast and efficient service. That's why I shamelessly go to Starbucks across the street when I'm not looking to make a night of it with my laptop. Filter-type crowd, but much quieter as people are actually working. They have cutesy elaborate cake window displays and a fantastic pastry selection. Everything I've eaten there that wasn't sweet was stale or just blah.
