I was rather disappointed by my first trip to Meli's. First the good stuff. It's a very clean place, well decorated, with good ambience. Our server was friendly. We started with fresh juice, which was fantastic. Unfortunately, the main part of the meal just wasn't very good. My omelette looked like mush and tasted like it. The potatoes were small and flavorless. It was a mediocre meal to wait a long time for.
