Holy hell this place was amazing. I went around 6pm on a Friday night and since my friend already got there and was drinking wine at a counter table I didn't have to wait for a table. We ordered as soon as I got there and the food came about 10 mins later. I had the pork sandwich in the tomato sauce (abho-blahblah?) which was fantastic. I ordered the sauce spicy, and it really was. I was fine with it but my friend had a heart attack when she tried it. While the line for a table was gradually growing longer and longer as we ate we never felt rushed or hurried by the staff. Holy hell this place is good.
