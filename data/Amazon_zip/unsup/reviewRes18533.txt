I used Yelp to find this restaurant and the reviews told the story. This is a quaint little BYOB restaurant with a great atmosphere inside. My wife and I had a great meal here and received incredible service. I would come back here again for good food and good service. Just remember to bring a bottle with you -- I had to walk two blocks away to get some wine......
