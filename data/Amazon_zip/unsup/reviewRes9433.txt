The food was extremely tasty, but the service is what really pushed Le Colonial to 4 star level. We showed up on Valentine's day for a prix-fix menu--Vday happens to be my birthday, so my man has to deal with a double whammy. Though he had faxed his information over weeks ago, we arrived to "no record" of our reservation. The staff, far from snooty (even though I came in off the street in jeans), apologized profusely, sent us upstairs for drinks on the house, and then gave us a table within a half hour, despite a packed house!  Might I add the portions were huge! We had delicious chocolate cake the next day because we had to pack our dessert to go. Thanks to everyone at Le Colonial who made my birthday/ Valentine's day wonderful!
