My wife an I went to Sprout with another couple last Friday night. The couple we were with are new friends of ours and the wife has serious food allergies but loves to try new and exciting restaurants and foods. Let me say that the staff at Sprout could not have been more attentive and conscientious to our friend's food allergies. They helped her pick items that were delicious and would not conflict with her allergies. That being said she had the veal, lamb and not sure what dessert while her husband had the foie, sable fish, and again not sure about dessert. My wife had the scallops, wagyu and pear while had the octopous, short rib and apple. We tried everything that everyone at the table ordered and for the most part were blown away by everything. The only slight negative was my octopus which was served cold (which I didn't know) and wasn't overly exciting. All of the dishes were spectacular; especially the short rib which literally melts in your mouth and it's served with the most amazing gnocci with truffle oil and mushrooms; AMAZING!! The wine list and drinks were reasonable and well priced. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. At the end of the night we spoke with Dale, the head chef, and he couldn't have been nicer and more humble. You must go to this place now before you can't get a reservation.
