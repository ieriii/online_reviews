It's silly to make everyone wait outside in the cold when there's tons of waiting space inside the restaurant. Take Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. They make you stand outside and wait, because of a simple reason. There's just no room inside the restaurant for anything but tables. We waited outside for maybe less than 30 mins and went inside to find tons of space in the three-story building to stand. They could easily implement a beeper system, but instead, they make you stand outside in the cold. Great first impression. On top of that, our waitress sucked. We ordered a medium four cheese pizza. The waitress told us the prep and bake time for the pizza is about 45 mins, so we ordered an appetizer to feed our grumbling bellies. After waiting 30 minutes for a spinach and artichoke dip (which probably takes 10 minutes to heat up in the microwave), we kindly reminded the waitress that we were still waiting for the dip. She said she'd check on it and didn't return. Our pizza came. Then, our waitress came by and dropped off the dip without saying anything. I think she forgot about it and didn't want to fess up. Either way, the dip really didn't serve its purpose anymore. We were starving and attacked the pizza. The first piece was admittedly really delicious with gooey cheese and chunky tomato sauce. But this is where I made my crucial mistake: I started eating the tempting dip, and by the time I went back for the second slice of pizza, the cheese had gotten cold. You could see the huge layer of hardened cheese sitting on top of the layer of cornmeal crust. The pizza just didn't taste the same anymore. And, our waitress completely forgot to bring my friend's drink and never once refilled our water cups. After paying a mere $12/person for a very filling (although mediocre) meal of two pieces of pizza and appetizer, I went straight into my food coma. And then, proceeded to unbutton my pants for my new food baby.
