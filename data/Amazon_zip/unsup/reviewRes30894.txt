Food was average for a Chicago Steakhouse but the Customer service I received was horrible!! DRIVER BEWARE when visiting this establishment. The valet company VPS damaged my vehicle and it has been a horrible experience every since. When I contact a manager I was told that I had to contact VPS, their valet company, after receiving no response from them I again contacted the restaurant...several times..and was finally put in contact with someone. The end result...I will never visit this establishment again and I will NOT valet my car with anyone affiliated with VPS. The manager at Maestro's did not seem to care about my issues although he did enjoy the $1000+ check that we paid for the dinner. The valet company was horrible and the owner was rude and inconsiderate. BEWARE WHEN VALETING your CAR!!!!!
