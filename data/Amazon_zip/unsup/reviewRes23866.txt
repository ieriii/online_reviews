Ate here the first time Thursday night, came back Friday for lunch to make sure this place was as good as I thought. The dry chili beef and chicken are both amazing, salty, crunchy, spicy these two dishes alone are worth a visit. We also tried Tony's chicken which was strangley addictive (a little on the sweet side for me). Also had the szechuan boiled beef which was really good but it was in a large bowl of chili oil which may turn some off, try it over rice. I cant wait for my next visit
