I've been to Revolution twice now, a year apart. A couple quick observations in case you are skimming and don't want to read the whole review: -- It's good. Know how I know? It's not uncommon to have to wait to get in. People come back. It's always busy. --Great beer. I've tried many kinds, and they don't seem to ever get one wrong. They also have a nice spread, from a dark porter to a light wit. --Good food. You've heard it before: gourmet pizza toppings, lots of veggie options, bacon fat popcorn. Revolution also does a nice job at hiring a staff that is friendly and helpful: they check on you regularly whether you're already at their table, or you're waiting for one and working on a drink. The ambiance is memorable: interesting light fixtures, mod portraits on the wall, dark wood paneling. You're tucked in quite close with other tables, but it never feels crowded so much as properly busy for a restaurant in high demand. They're good at handling big parties, but can also find a niche for duos. In general, it's the kind of place you can't really go wrong on. It's not a uniquely Chicago experience at Revolution, but it's a good experience nonetheless.
