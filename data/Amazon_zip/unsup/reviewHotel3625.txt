I recently attended a baby shower here -- the shower itself was wonderful, but the Drake needed a bit more pizazz. The hotel is beautiful, but it is "past its prime," needing some serious redesign that incorporates the best of its old elements. The architecture, idea and history of the place are appealing -- the older, broken down elements are not. For example, there is a ladies' "powder room." Each lady has her own vanity in a little private bathroom. But the faucet leaks. The chair upholstery is worn. The toilet paper roll fell off the wall. Also, the tea for this place is outrageous. $30 for tiny white bread egg salad sandwiches. I get it, I've been to a high tea before, but this is not worth it. So, a spruce and a spiff and the Drake could be back in business as a heavyweight, instead of silently shuffling off to the bench.
