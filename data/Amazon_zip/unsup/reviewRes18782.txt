Had dinner at The Gage last weekend while in Chicago for a weekend trip with my boyfriend. The food was average at best-- we had the poutine (average) and the peppers (average) to start followed by the venison burger (bland) and the duck (tough). But we were trying to enjoy ourselves, so after dinner we ordered some port. By the second to last sip of the port I had to spit it back out---there was SO much sediment in it. It wasn't just a tiny bit (normal) it was like there was a tablespoon of dirt at the bottom. Clearly, I had been served the bottom of the bottle (not acceptable). Here's the kicker- when I went to tell the waitress that they had poured me the bottom of the bottle SHE TRIED TO CONVINCE ME THAT IT WAS NORMAL. I understand that a little sediment is normal and to be expected sometimes...but this was actually like a tablespoon of sand in my drink. Maybe this is my pet peeve, but when a freaking adult makes a mistake at their job, all they need to do is APOLOGIZE and acknowledge the mistake. The waitress instead was like "well i mean i could take it off your bill"--like that would be such an inconvenience for her. Overall, the food could have been MUCH better and then to be served a drink like that with such attitude is pretty much unacceptable. Do better.
