Pretty good sushi, decent service, good atmosphere, but the place can be a little loud and the tables a little close. I felt like the tables next to us could hear every word we were saying (probably because I could hear every word they were saying). If you don't have a reservation and don't want to wait 1+ hour, go before 7pm on the weekends. The BYOB is nice, very few BYOB sushi places that I've found in this neighborhood.
