VH is the type of place I go when I feel like having dramatic, whispered conversations with my friends. It's the direct opposite of a Wrigleyville sports bar, and is more reminiscent of a speakeasy than anything else I can think of. The man at the door who checks ID has a really hushed voice, and when he tells you the two rules (cell phones off, and no smoking), it sounds like he's briefing you on a spy mission. The entrance itself is rather secretive-looking. There are wooden boards on the front, with what appears to be the standard "post no bills" stencil spraypainted on, but actually says "post no ILLS." It makes me smile. Once you're inside, it's dark. Quite dark. There are very tall, wide chairs, clustered together in twos, and little tables with votive candles. Intimate and lounge-y? You bet. The menus are on single pages of parchment-like paper, and everything looks delicious and wonderful. They've got their mixology down. I ordered the delightful concoction known as the "Daisy 17" - Wild Turkey, house-made grenadine, and orange bitters. When the waitress brings that particular drink over, you get a little pyrotechnic show for your garnish. The bartenders are well-dressed and precise. Every one of them wears a fabulous tie and mixes chemistry-set cocktails like he was born knowing how. My favorite cocktail is the "Iron Cross" because one of the ingredients is Pisco (a Chilean brandy) and I'm floored that they have that. It's not a drink for everyone - there are raw eggwhites in it - but I find it delightful. VH used to get 5 stars from me, but the magic has worn off a bit. The first few times I went, there wasn't much of a wait at all. Now, there's a long line. Le sigh.
