There's something very impressive about a guy who could whip up a four-course meal that would kick your ass, but who chooses to use his gifts for something he really, really loves.The atmosphere is kooky and a little old-school. You get the feeling he's got a lot of fans who probably send a lot of gifts, but for good reason - the food is incredible. Aside from having a pretty decent Chicago-style hot dog, it's the specialty menu that would keep me coming back time and time again. My very first specialty dog was a buffalo-ale and chipotle stuffed sausage with La Fin du Monde mustard and harvati cheese. It was epic. My tastebuds weren't prepared for the exquisite deliciousness that I forced upon them; they loved it. I've also had the pleasure of enjoying a bell pepper chicken sausage with pesto, fresh mozzarella and roma tomatoes (that mozzarella made my day) and a few others that have yet to disappoint me.Even with the great food, the nostalgic atmosphere and the generally awesome idea behind the place, nothing matches the friendliness of Doug himself. I won't take the time to explain - just go in, introduce yourself and understand. Then get ready for the best sausage-experience of your life...
