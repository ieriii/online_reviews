This may be the #1 reason I want to move to Chicago, and more specifically the Lakeview neighborhood. I came here because I'm really interested in eating vegan, plus I have all kinds of dietary restrictions. I got the blackened tofu filet and am SO GLAD. It paired perfectly with the garlic kale, mashed sweet potatoes, and quinoa. topped it off with a delicious vanilla porter that was recommended by the waiter. It was honestly the best meal I've had in recent memory. I went with 2 avid meat-eaters who absolutely fell in love with their choices. There was no better-than-thou air about the staff, which really helps omnivores feel more welcome & less judged. They've got everything you could possibly want: breakfast, sandwiches, entrees, and dessert. Everything can be made vegan & they even have a gluten-free menu. It might not be dirt-cheap, but the large portions make up for it. I also like their eye for local breweries & organic spirits. I can't wait to go back - and hopefully move next door so I can come here daily.
