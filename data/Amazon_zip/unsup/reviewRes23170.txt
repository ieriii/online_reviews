Very good food here. I had the milanesa dinner. Yum! It had a bunch of cheese melted right over the top. I do wish the milanesa would have been bigger. It's a bit on the small side especially compared to the other steaks. I loved the oatmeal shake too. I did feel the service was poor. I don't know if I caught them on an off night but seriously the place is as big as my closet. It shouldn't be that hard to give good service. If it was an off night I'll update this review because I'm definitely returning here.
