It was a nice prixe fixe menu, so we could at least try the restaurant. The prixe fiixe menu allowed for a fair variety of choices. The restaurant was of course crowded for a Tuesday night, but service was still decent. Good wine list offered a nice selection to pair with our dinner. Overall - definitely on the pricier side and the food was only partially worth the price. We may go back, but it didn't truly impress us. Flavor profiles were generally standard. Of all the restaurants in Andersonville - Anteprima is definitely one of them.
