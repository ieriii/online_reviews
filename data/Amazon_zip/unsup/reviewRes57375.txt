So amazing and so happy I found Coast! The decor is fabulous and the food is to-die-for! The waitstaff was very nice and cordial. To the people who say that they don't care for the snootiness, well then head out to the million other dives in Chicago and maybe you will fit in and be happier. Food and Service are great. I just wish they were not BYOB!
