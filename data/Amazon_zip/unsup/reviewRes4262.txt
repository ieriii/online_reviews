My identity: jazz singer, first and foremost. And I haven't reviewed Green Mill. I feel like a sinner. Green Mill might be my favorite jazz club in the country. You step in and are transported to a time when gals and gents dressed in their finest zoot suits and slinky dresses to hear jazz. It's a time when musicians had gigs every night of the week. It's a time when people fell in love (or lust) while swaying in the arms of their partner on the dancefloor. Green Mill makes you feel like a romantic and a night walker all at once. It's paradoxical in its old fashioned feel it arouses, while simultaneously making you linger until 4 AM and wanting to go home with someone. (preferably a musician) It's understood that the music here is the best, at least 95% of the time. Kimberly Gordon on Sunday nights is the kind of singer I fantasized about being when I was a little girl. Sit in Al Capone's backwards booth (so he could see the action going on outside) and take your best mug shot. If you want a seat, come very early, and plan on staying all night, because you won't want to step out on the streets of 2011 ever again.
