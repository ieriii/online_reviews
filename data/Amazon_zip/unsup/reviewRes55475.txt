Piccolo Sogno is one of my favorite places to go. Probably why I chose to write my first review on Yelp... (I've relied on Yelp to search for anything and everything.. finally decided to contribute)Service is great and the food is absolutely delicious--I even crave their balsamic vinegar and olive oil. *nod* I know... I pretty much finish everything laid out in front of me whenever I go.Insalata de pere is light yummy-good to start the meal... their pizza is great. Crispy and thin-- and cheesy and melty. I've had many entrees, pasta, pizza, fish here-- but my all time favorite is stracci di farro. Last time we went, the server asked if we wanted white truffle shavings added for $10 extra, and while I thought.. hmm.. is it worth it? It was definitely worth it. From appetizer to dessert, it's a great place to enjoy a mouthwatering meal.
