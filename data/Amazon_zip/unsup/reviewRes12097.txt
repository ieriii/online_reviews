I've been here a few times. Their pizza is pretty good and kinda lives up to the New Haven-style staple. But the true stars of this place is their multiple flat screen TVs showing all the games of the day and their good beer selection. It's definitely become a bit of a trendy place to hang out, but then again, you're talking about Wicker Park and it's part of the experience. Recommended!
