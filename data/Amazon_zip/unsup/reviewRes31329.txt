great dining experience, light, beautiful, tasty food in classy but easy atmosphere. We arrived with 5 (inc. our 8 yr. old) early last saturday - seated @ chef's table behind the sushi chefs. Liz was our waitress and had some great food recommendations and Aaron the m'd comped us a california roll to get things ..well, rolling. we shared: brussel sprout salad and lompya's to start - the salad was killer. Entree highlights were shaking beef and the sushi # 10, for desert the mango tiramisu is big enough to share and is really light and works with the asian fare. Wine list is reasonably priced - based on some overlap with my cellar @ home they run @ about 2.5 times retail. Hits are the excellent 09 whitehaven SB is $48 here and is $59 @ sable !!!, however the 09 ben marco malbec is $18 @ my house and $68 in Sunda. Overall a great choice and would recommend
