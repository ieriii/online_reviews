Consistently good food and experiences here. It can get rather crowded Friday and Saturday Dorsia style. But if you have a Matlock dinner time the crowds are manageable. The hundreds of other reviews kind of speak for themselves, so I am kind of , struggling of what else to add to my review. My favorite choice is the Forest burger, rare (although I think that last time they misunderstood me for "raw", oh well) and a side of mashed potatoes.
