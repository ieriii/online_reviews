OVERPRICED and UNCOMFORTABLE!!! Hospitality was okay. Concierge was helpful when I wanted to find a place to eat, though that isn't asking much. Room looked really nice... until I went to bed. The most terrible mattress I ever experienced. I had what felt like the worst case of insomnia that lasted for HOURS. And the noise from the shower next door kept me up and caused my heart to race. I started to get angry. It was driving me mad! Drip-Drip-Drip-Drip, just wouldn't stop! In fact, it sounded amplified. Maybe the tub materials and leaky faucet? Is it rude to knock on your next-door neighbors door and ask them to sacrifice a clean towel for the tub to catch the drip? I was sure it would last for fifteen minutes. But it went on forever. Earplugs hardly helped. I vacillated about calling down to switch rooms, but I was exhausted from my travels and I imagined the effort. I thought I might end up in a room that was worse. Or it might take an hour. Packing and unpacking around mid-night would not be fun! When I left at 7:15am I wasn't in the mood to argue upon check-out. If I EVER return to this area, I will INSIST on staying somewhere else. Breakfast was overpriced and I didn't dare. I was certain the quality would be poor. No complementary buffet for the price? That's ludicrous. At least then I could judge the food by having a preview! ps. Sorry for venting! I know it's no fun to read.
