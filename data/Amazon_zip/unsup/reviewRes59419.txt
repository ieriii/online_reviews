This place may have fallen victim to it's own success. I used to eat here whenever I hit Chicago in the late 90's and I'd rave about it wherever I went.I've been going back lately, and I considered another meal at Giordano's unfinished business.The pies are still first-rate; fantastic crust, thick as dessert pies and loaded with cheese and savory toppings. But the experience overall was really damaged by the service experience, which has devolved to that of a really busy roadside diner.Giordanos is crowded - people love the pies and if you go, count on a long wait. This bothered me not at all, but to be hustled from the front door and deposited in the to-go line and rushed into ordering in assembly-line fashion was pretty lame. The staff is harried and impatient, and they are so motivated to clear-the-table-turn-the-table that even when I got seated I felt like the kid in "A Christmas Story" going to see Santa.Let's not kid ourselves - I'm going to Giordanos again; It's a true-blue Chicago Pizza, and one you can't find outside of the city. But this place has developed some warts.
