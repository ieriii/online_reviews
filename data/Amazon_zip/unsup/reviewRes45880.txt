Chicago's grand lux is a cut above Chicago's cheesecake factory; not by much! My boyfriend and I always order the tex mex eggrolls as an appetizer; this time we tried the "pork taco" appetizer and were as equally pleased! I just loved my Rasberry Daqueri! He had the southern fried chicken w/coleslaw & mashed potatoes - mashed potatoes were A "must-do"!! I ordered the asian-glazed salmon, brown rice with SPINACH in place of asian-medley veggies.. . so loved it! Got the "to-die-for butterscoth pudding dessert" which is "new". Our waitress, Amy, was heaven-sent truly. I always love it here! Glad Chicago is home to this ever-so-loved mini-chain Restaurant.
