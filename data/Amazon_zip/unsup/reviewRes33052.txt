I really enjoy Yolk when my husband and I go often Saturday mornings. It does get really crowded after 8:30 am but we manage to get there before then. I had the Eggs Benedict and the Eggs Caprese (not in the same day :-) and they were DELICIOUS!! Just don't forget to request eggs well done as I have, because these two dishes call for poached eggs that are a bit runny, although sometimes I like them that way, it's better to have them well done. The coffee isn't bad either. For the money, nice atmosphere and good food, it's worth it!! Be warned, this place is crazy crowded after 8:30am on Saturday mornings (and I am assuming Sundays too) expect a wait and you won't be too disappointed finally getting your food.
