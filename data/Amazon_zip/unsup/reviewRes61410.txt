A good dining experience soured by a "mistake" on the check! After a great meal, we were presented with the check which was off by $5......I ordered the Surf and Turf.....3 small shrimp and a skirt steak which is offered in the menu at $24.95. The bill came and the meal was priced at $29.95. We asked our waitress about the mistake and we were informed that $24.95 is the lowest that the meal "could cost" but that due to "market conditions", mine was priced higher. I reviewed the menu from front to back and there is absolutely no mention of "market pricing or that the bill would be subject to inaccuracies and fluctuations at the management's discretion. While I've eaten here before and live a whopping block away, I will not return and I will no longer recommend them. Sorry 90 Miles, you had me and now you lost me....proper customer service would have been to correct the bill and advise us of your new "moving price structure" LIVE AND LEARN
