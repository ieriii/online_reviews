Love this place. I've been here enough times to try almost everything on the menu. Favorites are: Brussel Sprouts - Best sprouts in the city. bar none. Paris mushroom and truffle pasta - never knew paris shrooms were so damn good. truffle pasta - obv. Pork meatballs - Huge tender balls of deliciousness. Sauce goes very well with the balls. Cornbread - Up there with Q for best cornbread in chicago. I could probably eat 5 pounds of this. no joke.
