We found out about Gino's East on Superior Street from TV Show Man V Food, so while we were in Chicago traveling there for a few days with family, Hubby said that we just have to go there. There was 6 of us all together so we ordered mozzarella sticks, and chicken wings to start with and 2 deep dish pizza pies, one was a large meat feast and the other was a medium ham. The starters were yummy, i stuck with the mozzarella sticks as the wings were to spicy for me. I found that when the pizza's came out they were ok, but i stuck to the ham, I found that there was a lot of sauce and not much flavor to them and was not to keen on the crust as it was a bit dry for me. They make sure that your drinks are filled up. If there is any pizza left, then they put it in a box for you to take home, we only had the one slice leftWe went on a Saturday around 6pm and they were queuing out of the door, but the line did move quickly and when you do get to your table they do warn you that it will talk about 40-45mins for the pizzas to come out. The music is quite loud in there, so if you want a place were you can have a conversation without having to shout over the music, then maybe this is not the place
