Laughable wine list. Very dry hush puppies. Mediocre food (mine was fine, the other five at my table said their's were below average). Horrible service. I did like the "country" atmosphere. For reference, I had the "Competition" St. Louis full slab of ribs. The ribs were tender and meaty, but the sauces weren't that interesting. Crowd was mixed. Lively atmosphere.
