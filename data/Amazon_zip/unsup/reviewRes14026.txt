Ironically, I ran across this place by readying yelp reviews. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, and it's a couple blocks from my place. So, I took a quick drive. I ordered food for take out. I ordered the Media Noche, and got my girlfriend the Lechon (from the owner's suggestion). We also ordered some croquettas and fried yuca. I grew up with a bunch of Cuban guys, all claiming that their mom's cooking was the best. I think I'm going to gather all of their families and take them down to '90 Miles...' The food was outstanding! I had to keep stealing bites from my girlfriends Lechon sandwich when she was looking and I wouldn't give up my Media Noche. I ended up talking to the owner while I waited. Super nice guy. Extremely friendly and likable. I'm so glad I have a "goto" take out place a couple blocks from my house. '90 Miles....' is a great addition to Roscoe Village.
