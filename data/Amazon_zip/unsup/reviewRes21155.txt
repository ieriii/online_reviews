YES, MARGARITAS! So deliciously strong. They never disappoint, and honestly by the time you leave here you wouldn't remember anyway. The food is good, there's tons of seating in the back, and the service is quick. It's everything you want in a Mexican restaurant. Good Margs, Good Chips, Good Salsa. No fuss.
