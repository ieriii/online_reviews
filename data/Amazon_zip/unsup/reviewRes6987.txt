If one of the specials is the french toast stuffed with mascarpone, GET IT! Oh my god. Out of this world. It's served with cinnamon butter, some sort of delicious hash brown / home fry-ish concoction, and the freshest and most tasty orange slices I've ever had. Followed with ice cream and cheesecake, this would be my last meal on earth. Seriously, it's amazing. I love Chicago q!
