I tried Las Tablas last night for the first time and was quite impressed. I came in with a friend of mine who has been coming here for years and we had a great dinner. The place is fairly large and seems to accommodate big parties quite easily. Of course that didn't do wonders for the noise level, as it was a little high with the restaurant so busy. Regardless, we only waited a few moments before we were seated and the waiter took our drink orders right away. Unfortunately, that is where my rave review of the service stops. As I said, it was busy, but even so, our waiter was very inattentive. Those drinks I mentioned that were ordered when we first sat down, we received them half way through our meal... about 40 minutes later. Now I am not a skilled professional in the art of mojito making... but I don't know that it should take the better part of an hour. Although, in the end I basically chalked it up to him being super busy because as soon as the tables started to clear, he stopped by to check on us quite a bit... even so, the drinks should have been comp-ed. As far as the steak, VERY yummy! It was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. I wouldn't venture as far as saying the best I've had, but worth the higher price tag. Also, they offer smaller versions of their house specialty... which was not small at all and a pretty good bargain. I do agree with some of the other reviews about the sides leaving a bit to be desired. I wouldn't object to giving it another go... maybe try a seafood dish next time!
