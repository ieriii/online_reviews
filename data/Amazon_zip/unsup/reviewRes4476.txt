I had heard great things and was excitedly anticipating this experience long before I arrived in Chicago. Unfortunately, it was indefinitely ruined by whom reviewer "Laszlo" accurately refers to as the "lowlife bouncer/tattooed gorilla".  I have NEVER been as disappointed in a service provider as I am in this man. Not only did he have ZERO respect for the safety of his patrons as he overzealously crunched them into an unbreathable fire hazard- he also had zero respect for people in general. From rudely scolding silent adults to BE QUIET upon arrival to telling me "lady, people travel from all over the world just to stand in this place" when asked why our group of 10 was misled into thinking there was enough room to accommodate our group in such a small venue.  Of all the places I have been in Europe, NY, and LA- from the exclusive invite-only to the underground drum & bass shows I HAVE NEVER felt so UNSAFE, DISRESPECTED, and APPALLED at the lack of compassion one individual can show for another. This venue is well on its way to becoming the next E2 nightclub. If you want to experience the mobster scene I suggest Providence's Federal Hill- real people & experiences. Contrary to what you'll find at this establishment which only provides a random Neanderthal with disillusioned importance because he is the doorman to someone else's legacy.
