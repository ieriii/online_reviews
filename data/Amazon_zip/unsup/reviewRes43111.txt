Heard a lot about this place, so was excited to come on a Friday eve for dinner and drinks.  Ambiance is dim lit and warm. We were seated in the open area to the left of the restaurant opposite the bar - but would have preferred the bigger back dining room area, which seemed a bit more intimate and with less through traffic. Service is quirky friendly. Menu is a mix of plates to share - we did just that with the sage and butter gnocchi (fair), wild salmon with capers and tomato entree (fair+), side of fries (great), and finished with the warm brownies (poor- kind of bland and cakey, not gooey or dense enough), cookie dough ice cream and hot fudge (poor - fudge had a tart off taste). The 'house wine' was decent, and true to our waitress' description of being "not bad - wine in a box". Would come back for the ambiance and drinks menu.. or just for the fries!
