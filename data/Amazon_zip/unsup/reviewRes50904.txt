I miss living in Chicago. I miss it a lot! Yow know what I also miss about Chicago? Wishbone. I miss rolling out of bed on a Sunday morning and going with my roommate or my now husband to Wishbone for an amzing breakfast of crab cakes, cheese grits, and sweet tea. Orginally being from NC, I remember my mom calling me and telling me about a place in Chicago where the owners had lived in NC. Turns out this was the place. It's a cute place to go and sit and chat with friends. My husband even tried the grits and he's about as Midwestern as you can get. At least he is a sweet tea fan now. I miss this place a ton! hey guys, feel like opening a place in Phoenix?? I'll be glad to help!!
