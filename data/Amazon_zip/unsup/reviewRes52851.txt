This place just rocks it. One of my go to places for a Cuban steak sandwich and cortadito (cuban coffee)! Oh, and the coconut flan - an indulgence for me. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is quiet but not austere. I love going for lunch in the afternoons. I took my sons and they loved it. Just hoping they open a Loop branch.
