this place is a classy joint and they make a killer martini. but some nights they have shitty poetry readings and other live music, which doesnt fit this type of place at all, and they shush the crowd. what the fucks up with that? its not the fucking symphony in here. people want to chat while they get their entertainment at a bar. i think its under new ownership or something because i feel like this is a more recent thing. if they would just cut the bull shit this place would be one of my favorites.
