My husband and I recently had dinner here. I love fondue and could pretty much eat it everyday if it wasn't so fattening. He's not as much of a fan as I am, but agreed to go to Geja's for a special occasion. He was even a big fan because it was such a romantic atmosphere and the great food (my favorite is the cheese appetizer). It's much more romantic than the melting pot, although you do get many more choices when you order at the melting pot.
