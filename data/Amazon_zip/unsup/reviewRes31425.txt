We to Mastro's for the first the last week. Wow! Great atmosphere and the food was beyond amazing! The service at Mastro's is top notch, our server Griffin was very well versed in his wine selection and recommended a great bottle my husband and I enjoyed. The crab stuffed mushrooms are fantastic and you can't go wrong with any of their aged steaks, especially the filet. Everything down to the whipped cream is homemade and delicious. If you haven't tried this new gem in River North, it's definitely worth the visit. Reservations strongly recommended.
