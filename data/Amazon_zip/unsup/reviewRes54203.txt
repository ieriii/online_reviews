It's sad when unreasonable people (like Bianca S.) who rant and ramble about a simple misunderstanding, have a forum to explode and disrespect others. Her one-sided viewpoint is all that is shown here. I'd like to express another perspective:#1...CLEARLY STATED ON YELP:  NO RESERVATIONS!!!!! and NO CREDIT CARDS (in other words, CASH only...there is a lovely ATM conveniently located next to the cash register)How can one be so quick to condemn when everything is CLEARLY LISTED ON THE VERY YELP PAGE you are writing?#2...Party of 12, on a Saturday night? What, no red carpet???#3 The cashier gave compensation...NO, THE GRATUITY WAS NOT DENIED to the server....the compensation equalled about 20% of your bill. Enough? You enjoyed every morsel didn't you?#4...It's BYOB, you're lucky they have glasses to offer (and no extra charge for set up)!! ...if you prefer styrofoam, I'm sure they would accommodate you.#5 NO SYRUP in the shakes!Just calm down, have cup of tea (or wine) and relax. It's not that serious.I know MANY people who WISH they could even get out TO a restaurant! ..or even have a long period of time to spend with friends/loved ones.Enjoy the wonderful opportunity(ies) you have...don't sweat the small stuff!Appreciate the multiple blessings you have!My perspective is:I feel like I win the lottery every time I wake up and CAN face a new, beautiful day!Blessings, light and love to you all...BTW, the FOOD and STAFF are delightfully DELICIOUS!!DEFINITELY A 5 STAR DINING DESTINATION!!
