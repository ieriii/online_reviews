On my quest for tasty pork products, I came across Rev Brew's pork belly sandwich. How did I not spot this on the menu before? Is this a new item? Anyway, the pork belly sandwich was de-li-cious. The arugula, garlic aioli, and runny egg just take it over the top. That sandwich accompanied by garlic mashed potatoes and the "Bottom Up Wit" beer made the walk in the rain totally worth it. I can't wait to come back and try more things from their menu.
