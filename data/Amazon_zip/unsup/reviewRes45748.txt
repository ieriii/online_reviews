Wilde is a welcoming, cozy sit-down pub and eatery in a neighborhood otherwise devoid of such comforts. A tasty, home-cooking style stick-to-your-ribs menu, a big draft beer list, an oaken library decor and a friendly staff make for a pleasant place for an after-show drink and chat (nearby Lakeshore and TimeLine theaters offer fine entertainment). Also, as of this writing, a half-price late-night menu on Fridays and Saturdays. Can run pricier, but worth a little extra for the atmosphere. Will continue to come here when I'm in the neighborhood.
