I'd like to be able to give this more stars.  Every time I've gone, the food is mediocre at best. Sometimes its over-seasoned like the salty Ropa Vieja I had once. Sometimes its under-seasoned like the surprisingly bland Guairito sandwich. Its also not bringing anything really new to my Cuban cuisine experience. So that's the bad... The Cafe Con Leche is really excellent. The smoothies are pretty decent too. The real reason that 90 miles is a good place to go is for the atmosphere. This place will make you feel like you were eating beach-side in a small town on a Caribbean coast even during winter. Its pretty amazing what they did with a shoe box restaurant on a somewhat remote corner of Logan Square.   I'd say this place is great for getting together with friends to have a casual meal during the Spring/Summer.
