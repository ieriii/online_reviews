This is the best tasting thing that has ever been delivered to my home. It is the best tasting deep dish I've ever had. The burnt cheese crust is mind blowingly good. I work out five times a week and would happily bump it to seven if I needed to eat this every day. Order it now. Get the sausage. I am 90% vegetarian, but the sausage changes all that. I seriously don't think I will ever order deep dish from another place if this is an option. Dying to try Spacca Napoli next!
