I came here to redeem a Groupon and thank goodness for it because I would have been a bit upset to have paid full price for this food. My friend and I shared the seafood combination and skirt steak dishes. We got an enormous piece of steak but unfortunately needed a chainsaw to cut through it. Everything suffered from being too chewy except for the baby octopus. In fact, even the plantain and cassava were tough to masticate. The seafood and meat did not taste seasoned or marinated, and the chimichurri didn't help much to add flavor. The highlight of the evening was our empanada appetizer. The crispy, fried little pies came with various fillings, my favorite being cheese and chicken.
