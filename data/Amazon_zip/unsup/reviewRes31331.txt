What can I say? Excellent service, great good and decent prices. I've had their soups, the Nanadict and a few of their sandwiches. It is more expensive the restaurants in the area but the difference is minor. I live in Canaryville now and I was quite surprised to find such a different restaurant in Bridgeport. I've been back several times and will continue to go back. Go! have one of their fresh squeezed juices and support the community!!
