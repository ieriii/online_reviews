I really hate to write a review based solely on the service that I received but I must. I came here for a shake (carry-out). A waitress and cashier were at the register talking as I patiently waited behind them for five minutes. Finally, after realizing what they were talking about was not work related, I inquired about the more exotic shake flavors. Neither one could explain them and finally found someone who could. I tried ordering one of the flavors but they were out. In the middle of the cashier's sentence of explaining to me they were out, she took her attention off me and started complaining about being hot to the waitress. She never got back to that sentence. I tried ordering another flavor and they were out. I then tried to order another and the waitress, who was waiting to resume her conversation with the cashier said "Why don't you just get mango. We DO have mango." I ordered nothing and left. I get a feeling that sit-down service may be friendlier that take-out service but not sure if I will ever find out.
