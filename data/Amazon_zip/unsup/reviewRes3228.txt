OMG TO DIE FOR CHICKEN!!! The moment you put the hot and sweet glazed chicken in your mouth you will become an addict like me. My walking into this place was purely due to the yelp reviews about the bone-in seol sassy chicken and the buddha bowl- not forgetting the Kimchi! YUMMY Guys, all the amazing reviews are totally accurate. BELEIVE THEM. I came back to work and I have referred a bunch of people to check this place out. It is a great place to hit up, and the location is awesome to go for a walk while you digest. Keep in mind tho, unless you come totally hungry and not eaten in days then you will for sure walk out with a doggie -bag still full of food. Highly recommend this place.
