heard rave reviews about this place from Jeanie P and Grace L. Food: I ordered the seafood risotto and got a huge plate, with tons of muscles, scallops and shrimp. all those good shellfish yum yum. Risotto got to be a bit too heavy after a while but I was impressed with the huge portions of al dente pasta my friends go. Wine: We got a bottle of nice crisp white wine, I don't remember what it was but they had a good, inexpensive wine list. Ambience: small, busy and dark. Lots of trendy 20 and 30 somethings. Service: excellent.
