Nuevo Leon consistently delivers a quick, quality meal on the cheap. I usually try to arrive by 6-6:30 and find this the cutoff before their major dinner rush. My food has never taken more than 10-15 minutes to arrive, which makes it the perfect go-to place when hunger pains are evident.  Did I mention that the hunny and I have never spent more than a $20, and we leave feeling full and satisfied?!  There is a parking lot sortof on the corner at the 4-way stop, and there is paid parking on 18th.
