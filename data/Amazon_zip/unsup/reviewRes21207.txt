I wouldn't have expected anything less than amazing from a Rick Bayless restaurant, and it indeed was amazing! Xoco is a much more casual place than Rick's other restaurants, but the food is just as delicious and the flavors just as well developed. The line on a Friday night was pretty long - almost out the door - but it moved fairly quickly. There is a good beer selection that is balanced between Mexican favorites like Bohemia, and microbrews from the Great Lakes area. The sandwiches were super tasty and the chocolate is everything you can imagine from it. The chocolate is roasted and made in-house. Here's a run-down of what I ate and exactly why it was delicious: -Chips with salsas and guacamole: A wonderful and smoky chipotle salsa, medium-spice salsa verde, and a very good guacamole. Very, very good guacamole! -Suckling pig and pickled onion sandwich on a crusty, warm loaf of bread. Came with a habanero sauce. The meat was juicy and tender. The pickled onions were a really nice balance for the sandwich. Be careful with the sauce, though, it's actual habanero. It was pretty hot for my Danish tastebuds. With just a touch of sauce, it really rounds out the sandwich with a nice floral pepper taste. -My girlfriend and I split an order of churros and 2 hot chocolates (the almond milk hot chocolate and Mexican City thick). Churros were crisp, sweet, and spicy. Splurge for the chocolate dipping sauce. The almond milk chocolate was tremendous and rich. The Mexican City Thick is almost thick enough to chew. It was spicy (especially nutmeg). If I lived in Chicago, I swear I'd be getting Xoco sandwiches and chocolate at least a couple times a week. It was great.
