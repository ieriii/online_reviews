Great place to grab a drink and eat. They have good specials too. My roommates and I just moved a block away and we bring guests to this place too. They also have good vegetarian selections if you are vegetarian. The staff is very nice and friendly. I gave it 4 stars only because it tries to act hard with it's heavy metal music and hardcore decor. The patrons and the staff are all very friendly, so I like it either way.
