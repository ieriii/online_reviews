So the lady and I visited Little Bucharest for some late night eats the other day. Really had no idea what to expect. The place is has a lot of character, quaint decor, a friendly staff. The food was very filling. For two people, you can definitely get away with sharing one appetizer and two entres. No need for a soup or salad. No room for dessert to be honest. We had the two recommended items on the menu. The Short Rib Goulash and the Sausage Stuffed Chicken Thigh. Can't go wrong with either. Again, very large entres here and more than filling. The live music was a big downer the night we dropped in. It was basically Eastern European dance music played on a backing track with a live singer. Lots of feedback from the mic, waaaaayyy too loud. We really thought that was going to wreck the evening for us. Perhaps this is what we get for eating so late. Maybe it was just a reflection of the big birthday party going on that night. I'd recommend double-checking their website to drop in when things might be a bit more low key. Sounds like their have live jazz and strolling minstrels pretty regularly depending on the night of the week. The owner (Branco) was a great host. Yes he visited our table to check on us a few times. Yes he was very friendly and clearly passionate about his restaurant. But the most memorable experience of the night was when a patron started dancing on the bar. The owner joins her and then together throws a few glasses (or bottles) down to the floor behind the bar in celebratory fashion. Opa! If that wasn't enough, he then carried her on his shoulder parading her through the restaurant and back to her seat. I can't make this stuff up. Interesting place to say the least. Looking forward to what a second visit to Little Bucharest might drum up. Would be fine with a bit lest excitement.
