I was planning my trek to Superdawg long before I moved out here-they're featured on a show called "Hot Dog paradise". I was looking for the authentic Chicago dog w/ neon relish & all. They pack it all cozy in a box w/ fries. I've had the hamburger which is pretty good, but can't compete w/ 5Guys moving into Chicagoland. I always get the Superveggies which are deep-fried tempura veggies so you don't feel like you're eating that bad. This place is just fun and retro.
