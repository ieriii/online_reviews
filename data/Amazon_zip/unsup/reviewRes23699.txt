I work as producer, and in this bizarre and crazy world we get food all day long. Including catered lunch. I took over ordering lunches because for starters I love food, trying new food, and supporting my favorite restaurants, and also because generic catered food starts to taste exactly the same each time. I have now gotten Irazu for the crew 3 times, and each time we are blown away. I order the Casado in steak, chicken, & veggie. The chicken is pull apart, tender, flavorful and yummy, as is the meat. It comes w/rice & beans, sweet plantains, and cabbage salad. I can't vouch for the salad because cilantro is #1 on my most hated things, but people give it 2 thumbs up. Also, their guac is beyond. Super salty chips. Heaven. These wonderful people also take care of me...last time they brought me their famous oatmeal shake which lives up to its name, and this past time a mango shake. Woah. I had to share w/my coworkers as it tasted like the sweetest mangos in the world. Haven't dined in the restaurant, but the most important part is the food...and it's fab.
