Stopped in on Friday for a lunch meeting. The restaurant was very accommodating and sat us by the window. My friend had two of the home brewed beers and enjoyed both, I had the pear cider beer, which I love. The food was very tasty, I had the beet Greek salad and he enjoyed the chorizo pizza. Good service, comfortable atmosphere and tasty food all in one place, close to home (or office) - you can't go wrong.
