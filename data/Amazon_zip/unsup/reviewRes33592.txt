I'm sorry but this place is nothing to jump up and down over.  My wonderful husband took me here for Valentines Day (shout out). We were told to go next door and up the stairs to their other dinner/bar seating area. For starters, i'm giving it at least 2 stars because our server was really great. He was super attentive and was great at recommending all kinds of things to try on the menu. But that is where it ends. We had the lobster risotto; meh. Super fishy taste. My hubby loved his pasta. I had some kind of fish, it was unique and I can't remember the name of it, but again; meh. Maybe I should have just gotten the pasta, but our server recommended the fish so I figured I'd try it. Nope, never again. Now the creme brulee at the end? Forget about it...DELISH! But that was about it.
