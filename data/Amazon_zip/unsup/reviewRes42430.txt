Okay. It is really odd as much as I enjoy most Asian food that I had never been to a Vietnamese restaurant. I have been to Argyle many times, but for whatever reason have always passed by and thought, "I will have to come back and try this sometime". Well, yesterday was that sometime... And I have no idea why I waited so long. It was wonderful. The service was very quick, friendly, and attentive, especially considering that this place was packed. Saturday at lunch time here is crazy busy. Anyway, all of the food was excellent. My girlfriend and I shared the pork and shrimp spring rolls and a Vietnamese crepe. Also, she had the beef pho and I had oxtail pho. We both had the Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk, which was very good. Our only problem with this restaurant was that it was way too much food. We had no idea that the crepe alone would be so filling since it was labeled an appetizer. Anyway, that is hardly a complaint. We are neither one sure how authentic this restaurant's food is or how it compares to others in the area, but we know it was good. Very good. So we will be back.
