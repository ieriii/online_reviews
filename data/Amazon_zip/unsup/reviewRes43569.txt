The place your own order concept stresses me out and my food just wasn't that good. My boyfriend had eaten breakfast here once and never stopped talking about it. We tried to stop in a few times but it was always so crowded we didn't want to wait. A couple weeks ago we drove by and it seemed pretty slow - we jumped at the chance to eat lunch there. I ordered the Avocado, Smoked Gouda, Romaine and Tomato with Cracked Mustard on Mulligan Bread. It sounded so good, I was super excited. When I received it I was very disappointed. The cracked mustard was very harsh and did not compliment the buttery avocado. The cheese and bread were okay, but together I thought it was a bitter, bland mess. I was very disappointed with the bland chips also. My boyfriend ordered the Grilled Pastrami and Swiss with Horseradish-Mustard Spread on Dark Rye. His first bit a huge fatty piece fell from his lips and disgusted me. Granted, we understand Pastrami is a naturally fatty meat.... This was insane. He picked most of the fat off and let it in a mound on the plate. He was very disappointed and agreed the chips were awful. The lemon tart was, however, delicious. The atmosphere was pleasent, but the order at the counter and get your own water was frustrating... especially when you want to sit outside. This place is hyped a lot and I don't get what all the fuss is about. There are so many other places in the area I would rather eat - very disappointing.
