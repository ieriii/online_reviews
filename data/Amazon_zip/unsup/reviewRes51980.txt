After hyping myself up for some deep dish Chicago-style pizza, I left Gino's East a tad disappointed. Our Chicago host gave us the standard list of options: Gino's, Giordano's, and Lou Malnati's. I had been to Giordano's before and our host had never been to Gino's, so Gino's it was. We split a medium veggie, along with some cheesy bread to start. The bread was actually quite good (albeit a little soggy), and I loved that it came with plenty of sauce to dip. Let it be known that I'm a sauce guy. I also prefer New York pizza done right, but I can handle Chicago-style due to copious amounts of marinara. Unfortunately, the veggie pizza was too much cheese, not enough sauce. Not even close to nearly enough sauce. The cheese as well wasn't supremely tasty, pretty stretchy, and often felt like overkill. The bread was decent, but nothing spectacular. On the plus side, the veggie toppings were quite good. Our waiter was decent, and came by to check on us a few times while the pizza was cooking. Also, the atmosphere is pretty awesome (check out all the scribbles on the wall; ours covered up the Sistine Chapel mural), and you'll see this location show up on the Food Network or Travel Channel if you watch long enough. Anyhow, I'd steer you towards Giordano's over Gino's East, and will definitely try to stop by Lou Malnati's next visit.
