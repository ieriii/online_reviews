Popping my Yelp cherry with a review about sausages. Sounds about right.   Yes, you will wait in line, sometimes for up to two hours. If you have a problem with that, don't come here. If you don't, the prepare for some deliciousness in the form of encased meat on a bun. I've had more sausages here than I should probably be willing to admit, but I'm not afraid to say it: My name is Ashley K. and I am a Hot Doug's addict.  My absolute favorite dog is the Portuguese linguica. Doug changes up the toppings on it from time to time but it's usually a saffron aioli/rouille and topped with a mild, creamy cheese. Heaven on a bun. All of the pork sausages are generally fantastic. The chicken sausages are a bit more hit or miss for me. The steak chimichurri is superb, as is the Teuben (reuben in hot dog form). I have yet to try the famous foie gras sausage, as I'm not a huge fan of foie gras in the first place.  And the duck fat fries, oh the fries, if I weren't trying to fit into my wedding dress in 2 months (or live past 30), I would eat you every day.    Hot Dougs may "only" be a hot dog joint, but Doug elevates them above and beyond your typical hot dog. Doug puts such attention to detail into his dogs, and I really appreciate the different flavors that he brings together. Doug is always at the counter, taking orders and conversing with customers. He doesn't need to do that - but he does. And that says a lot to me about how much he appreciates the business that comes in to Hot Dougs. And, there you have it folks. Review number 1, in the books.
