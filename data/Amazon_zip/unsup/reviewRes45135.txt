Had a 6:30 reservation last night for 4. We sat down and quickly realized they were VERY short staffed. We never had an actual waitperson. I busboy took our order - at 7:30 - only after we flagged someone down. We never heard specials. No one ever asked if we wanted another drink. No one asked if the food was okay (it was okay, nothing special). We flagged the host down to get our check. Really the worst thing was no one ever acknowledged there was an issue. I can understand it's not the fault of the people who did show up to work, but it is the responsibility of the management to at least provide a baseline of service and stop seating people if you can't serve them. We will not be returning.
