Alright, so i have only ever got one thing from Crisp before, but I love that one thing, and it's their Bim Bim Bap, or the Bad Boy Buddha Bowl. Rice, egg, chicken/beef, and assorted veggies. It's cheap relative to other places in the area, its good for you, and very tasty. I'm only giving it 4 stars because it doesn't come in a hot stone bowl, which keeps it hot and makes the rice nice and crispy, which is a big deal! I also haven't tried anything else, and thought I couldn't rate the whole store, but I'm sure it is all just as tasty!
