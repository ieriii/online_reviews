Great Persian/Iranian food! I had Adass Polo with Chicken-Persian white rice with lentils, raisins, caramelized onions, saffron and Persian barberry , my husband had Adass Polo with lamb, we also had chicken cutlets for appetizers- great flavors in the food! The atmosphere is very relaxed- we were with our friends who have twins and this place is great for kids. Great service as well. My recommendation to the restaurant owners is that they serve Arabic coffee as they would have been perfect on top of a delicious meal!
