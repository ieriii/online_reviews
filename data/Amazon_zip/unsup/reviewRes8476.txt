i used to say that all brazilian places taste the same but i realized the errors of my ways! first off... my first impression was that their salad bar seems smaller than the rest. i was disappointed at first but then i realized why... their meat is so much better than the other places so they don't need a wide variety of salad items! their meat... /drool. isn't over salted like the rest of the brazilian places. and is cooked very well. i got plenty of medium rare cuts and they were perfect. their service is just superb. a manager overheard one of our girls say she didn't enjoy the top sirloin. he came over and asked why. he figured she liked the more tender cuts and suggested the beef ribs which he sent over to our table and it just melts in your mouth. it's pricey but well worth the trip!
