The service and atmosphere of this restaurant were wonderful so I am basing my one star on the food only.The food at this restaurant was such a disappointment. The menu itself looks fantastic. Unique and delicious sounding appetizers and entrees fill the pages. Almost all of our 4 entrees, however, left much to be desired. Everything was way too salty and had awkward pairings. On the beet salad there was some odd dressing that tasted kind of like the dust of a raw walnut. I hate to give such a bad review to a restaurant with such great service, but I hate even more to see people spend their money on less-than-good food.Great concept, bad execution.
