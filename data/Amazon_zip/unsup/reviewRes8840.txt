The server took foreverrrrr!! She took a good 5 minutes to take our drink order, dropped the drinks off without even giving us a second to say "were ready to order!" and didn't come back for 20 minutes to take our food order. When we asked for a good appetizer recommendation, she suggested the Prosciutto with arugala & Parmesan. It was literally a few strips of meat SOAKED in oil, like each piece literally DRIPPING in oil when I picked it up. Then the oily meat was topped with a mound of dry arugula lettuce & a few pieces of Parmesan. NOT appetizing!! Then came our main order- the Funghi Pizza (pizza with mushrooms) The sauce had no taste to it, let alone there was hardly any sauce on the pizza, and the pizza itself was soggy. Both my friend and I were NOT impressed with the food at all. Plus, beyond pizza there are no other choices except different variations of anti-pasti (almost all including the oily prosciutto..ick)  I understand the place offers traditional Italian fare, but I would suggest adding some salads, soups, or mozzerella sticks for variety...and some more sauce to your pizzas!
