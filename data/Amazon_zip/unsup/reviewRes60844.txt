Really enjoyed the ambiance at Zed. I was there with a party of 8 for a girlfriends birthday. We enjoyed cocktails, wine and a great selection of appetizers. The portions were perfect for sharing. We had the samosas, calamari, duck flat bread (which was amazing) and a delicious cheese plate. Our server however was a bit goofy and did not explain the cheese plate presentation. Other than that, I really enjoyed Zed451 and would go back for a relaxing evening of wine and flavorful food.
