First the Hotel's positive attributes: The location is second to none; it's across the street from the Hancock Tower on the northern periphery of the Magnificent Mile and the southern edge of the Gold Coast; it's in the city's shopping district and near landmark destinations; and it's a little over three blocks away from the picturesque western shore of Lake Michigan and has spectacular room views of Michigan Avenue. Where the hotel fails: they try to come across like a boutique hotel, but are really just a Marriott-type hotel in knock off polyester boutique clothing; the walls are tissue paper thin and everything said can be heard; the doors slam even when you try to close them gently; they play sucky pop country music over the sound system; we had problems with our room safe, there was no "Do Not Disturb" sign in our room; the shower head, a peculiar, bizarre, and intimidating two-headed device, had loose plumbing, the alarm clock was missing the backup battery, and other parts, our one room service order was screwed up, and a call to the front desk and concierge went unanswered. All of this for a premium price in the toney Gold Coast area. In this case, the positives do not out weigh the negatives, which is surprising since the Westin is part of the Starwood properties. Starwood markets their hotels as modern, urban, efficient, technologically advanced, and for some properties, edgy. The Westin on Michigan Ave is anything but, and that is why they are just okay with three stars.
