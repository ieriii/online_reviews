Wow, they know how to marinate fried chicken here, and I love that it's still crispy! How do they do it and not get it to become soggy?! I usually get the Seoul Sassy. It's my favorite but I get the Crisp BBQ as well. I want to try other items on the menu, but I'm kind of addicted to the chicken and know that there's no way I could eat all that food. The place isn't huge, but there is seating there. It's kind of communal. The prices are pretty average but more than your typical fried chicken chain restaurant/fast food spot. There are daily specials as well.
