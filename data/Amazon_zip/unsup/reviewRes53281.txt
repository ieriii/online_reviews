I joined Yelp just so I could add some information to all the fabulous reviews about Alinea. The food, wine, and service are as good as everyone says - there's not even a question about that. Here's some info that I was looking for before I went but had trouble finding:Atmosphere - Very cool. Good noise level, fancy but not too fancy. Dress code for men - jacket required, no tie necessary.Dress code for ladies - cocktail dress or dressy business clothes, but you don't have to go all out.Price - $200+ for the dinner, wine pairings are $150 or $300Are the wine parings worth it? - YES! But plenty of people were ordering bottles.How much wine is it? - 10 tastes, equal to four glasses total. They top you off occasionally for bonus wine.Food allergies? - They happily accommodate them in such a seamless way that you don't even notice.Pretentiousness of servers - Not a problem at all. They were subdued but generally very nice. Do you actually get full? - We did. I was completely stuffed when we left. That could have been the wine, however.Birthday treat? - Yes! Delicious little truffle cake thing, and a souvenir menu.So, is it worth it? - Whether you think spending the equivalent of a mortgage payment on dinner can ever be worth it is up to you. But if you are open to that possibility, this is definitely the place to do it. You'll always remember the experience, and the food is amazing. These 5 star reviews are not exaggerating.
