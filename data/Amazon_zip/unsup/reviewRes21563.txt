As always, Rick Bayless brings another delicious restaurant to Chicago! I know I'm behind the game in trying this place out since it's far from new at this point but hey - I just moved to Chicago. I went with a party of six and we all thought our dishes were delicious. The Milanesa Torta was my choice and though it was quite tasty, I tried my friend's Pepito and realize that that is the way to go next time. The churros with vanilla icecream to dip in was hot, fresh and delicious! This place was worth the 20 minute wait (much shorter than I thought it would be for a party of 6 on a Saturday night, might I add). Great place when you want a Rick Bayless fix but haven't the time to go to Frontera or Topo.
