Oh my, pork belly. How sweet/savory you are. I've had pork belly at Takashi and at Chilam Bilam, among many other spots. Nothing compares to the pork belly at Davanti Enoteca.  A crisp pork belly with a peach mostarda is one of a few wonderful dishes I sampled at a recent lunch visit. I'd definitely recommend going for dinner, or whatever meal you'd like to eat the most as the menu is filled with great small plates choices.  Davanti is the only restaurant in Chicago with fresh hearts of palm from Hawaii. They're definitely a lot more interesting than your canned or bottled palm.  For my pseudo-entree, I tried the linguini with sea urchin and crab. I hadn't ever had sea urchin and I'm rarely impressed by a pasta dish, but this was fresh, had wonderful subtle tastes and couldn't have been better.  As I've probably mentioned before, I'm a sucker for small plates, but Davanti Enoteca is more than just a tapas-style Italian restaurant, it's tremendous food 4 blocks from my office.  If I have any complaint, it's that the staff didn't really match the level of the food. Our server was slow (especially for lunch) and didn't explain the dishes quite as well as I would've liked. I'm being overly picky about that, though...it was a terrific experience.
