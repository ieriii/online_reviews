The plantains are awesome! I always place an order to go with me. And the lechon is always tender and juicy. The entree portions are huge, but I usually finish it cause it tastes so good. :) If you don't eat meat try the grilled veggie dinner, it's also very good. Don't forget to bring a bottle of wine with you. I always see large birthday parties having a good time at this place.
