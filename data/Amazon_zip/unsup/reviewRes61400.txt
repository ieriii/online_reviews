Large portion sizes priced reasonably low! Our server made wonderful recommendations from the drinks to the entrees. I had the Cafe con Leche - best cup of coffee ever! My friend had the Mango Tea. We shared the avocado salad that was dressed in a lime vinaigrette. this alone was the perfect meal. simple. refreshing and satisfying. We also had a skewered shrimp special that was perfect. The atmosphere was causal, fun and comfortable. This is a must-go-to place that you'll probably visit more than once!
