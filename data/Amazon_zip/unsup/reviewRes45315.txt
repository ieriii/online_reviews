Great neighborhood place! My boyfriend and i usually stop in about twice a month. Great food, creative cocktails and a good variety of beer. Last night we went in for a late dinner. The place was packed and another guest walked right into our table, spilling my brand new glass of wine all over. Not only did a server (not ours) clean it up immediately, but our server brought me a brand new one. We complimented the manager, Cyndi who was awesome too. Wilde is a great neighborhood place- delish food and awesome service!
