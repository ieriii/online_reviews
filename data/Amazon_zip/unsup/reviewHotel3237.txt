"Oh and be careful with your mini fridge. It is weight sensitive, so the moment you even partially touch a bottle in there your room will be charged" and then she ended that phrase with a cheerful, perky, giant **smile** My brother and I were kind of in shock that they do that at the Hard Rock, because I mean if you stay here, you most likely are semi social meaning you would like to have a drink or two, but that phrase alone made my brother and me not even keep our leftover deep dish pizza in the fridge because we were so worried!! Instead we left the boxes on our AC! ha ha But that aside, this hotel is pretty much amazing. We even brought over two friends to see our two queen bed, corner room with a view and they live in Chicago and were quite impressed with my brother's selection of a hotel heh. It has the coolest decorations ever and HUGE bathrooms. Each floor is themed with a famous rock star, our floor the Annie Lennox floor, and there was a giant head shot of her in our lobby and my brother couldn't resist the photo op to pose like she was heh Every room has a flat screen tv and black out curtains and we even had a hallway in our room!! YUP!! a hallway!! And we didn't even have a suite, so I wonder how amazingly spacious and fantastic those rooms are at this place!! "Ummm adam, I can't see you because I'm in our HALLWAY" we found ourselves joking about for the night. And of course it is complete with a few full-length mirrors because any rock star has to have a way to check themselves out before leaving for a night on the town!! The downside? Well it isn't cheap. The hard rock cafe is actually located elsewhere in Chicago (but there is a store downstairs for memorabilia) and parking isn't included (valet is $45 a night or something like that!). But you do get free wifi!!! And I mean how could you be a rockstar without free wifi?? I know I couldn't ;-)
