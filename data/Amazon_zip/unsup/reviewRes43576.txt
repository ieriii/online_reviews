I live a block away and pretty much eat here on a weekly basis. After trying Malnati's, Gino's, and Chicago's I had decided I preferred thincrust, but the art of pizza's deep dish is fantastic and is all I get from the place. There sandwiches are ok but you will be regretting not sticking with the deep dish or pan style pizza. I haven't tried the thin crust so I can't speak to its quality.
