Sort of far North, Spacca Napoli is worth the trip. The traditional "pizze" restaurant has a friendly and efficient staff. The menu is split into appetizers, salads, and what they're popular for-pizza. We had the calamari and shrimp appetizer, delicious with some fresh lemon juice and not fried and the buffalo and argula with olive oil pizza.
