Mango basil mojito (yucatan d'aristi rum, fresh mango and lime, basil, organic cane syrup, soda): Strong drink, delicious! Pastel de chocolate y cacahuate (silky chocolate-peanut butter cake. Toasted peanut ice cream, crunchy ancho-candied peanuts, tequila-spiked honey Manila mango): this dessert is a study in textural contrasts. Crumbled choccolate soil, salty sweet ancho dusted peanuts, smooth creaminess of toasted peanut ice cream, tangy sweet cubed mango, and an unbelievable airy silky and rich chocolate peanut cake, surrounded by a deliciously tangy sweet mango sauce. SO GOOD. Frothy mexican hot chocolate (rustic oaxacan dark-roast chocolate steamed with hot milk): this was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I'd definitely get this again. Ambiene is lively and festive, colorful art decorating the walls. Good place for a date, great place for a group of friends. I'll definitely be back!
