I had never had occasion to stay in a hotel in Chicago before, so this was an unusual occasion. The ICH turned out to be one of the nicest places I've ever stayed in (Hotel Indigo in Asheville, NC still takes the cake). Our room was in the older of the hotel's two towers, the one that used to house the Medina Athletic Club. The room was on the 25th floor, and had great views up and down Michigan Avenue and out to the west. The Room itself was very spacious, and the bathroom was enormous, with a separate shower and bath. We got brunch in the hotel restaurant, and the buffet was off the chain in terms of quality and selection. It was also priced accordingly . . . The topper, though, was the fitness facility housed in the hotel. You have not only the gorgeous and historic swimming pool, but a full complement of cardio and weight equipment. And the dry sauna was delightfully hot. On the down side (and hence the missing star), this place nickels and dimes you on things like internet. I've heard not-so-great things about the promptness of their room service, but, almost needless to say, we did not order room service. (At $18 for a "Maxwell street polish sausage," can you blame us?)
