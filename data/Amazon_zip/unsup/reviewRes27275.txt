So everyone has been talking about how great this Mexican restaurant called Nuevo Leon is. It's located right down the street from me on 18th Street. I've been hearing about it for some time actually. My uncle (who is Mexican) was telling me about it and said it was amazing. My roommates went and loved it. It almost sounded too good to be true, comrades. Well, it was all too good to be true. I went there and was not extremely impressed. I ordered the bistec ranchero, which is basically skirt steak with ranchero salsa on it. The taste was not too exciting, and the meat was tough. My friend got the bistec a la mexicana, and she barely ate any of it, saying the meat was really tough as well. Her food was like 8 bucks, which isn't too bad price-wise, and mine was $10.50, which isn't horrible either, I suppose. However, even for $8 the food should be pretty decent. I don't think it lived up to the price at all. While I thought the main course was kind of a drag, I do have to say they had awesome horchata. They also bring out free soup and chips and salsa. The salsa was really good and so was the soup. The place is also BYOB, which is kind of cool. I guess I'll end up going back because the food wasn't horrible, and I can bring my own booze, which could make for a cheap night out, but I was disappointed overall. Maybe it was an off night. As I said, my uncle is Mexican, so I have eaten plenty of authentic Mexican food. While this was authentic, that doesn't mean it was fantastic. The point is this, America: Nuevo Leon has a lot more hype assigned to it than it's worth. Word.
