I decided to hit up The Bongo Room with an out of town friend; we're both Ann Sather fans, but since I just moved to Logan Square, we figured we'd hit up someplace more local for brunch. HOLY COW. Say what you want about hipsters and their ironic facial hair choices, these guys can crank out some AMAZING flapjacks. I had the red velvet hotcakes, and my friend went with the lemon ricotta and sour cherry hotcakes. Each came with three hotcakes, which could have doubled as saddle blankets for a Shetland pony...that big. My red velvet ones were delicious, with a cream cheese frostingesque topping; surprisingly, none of this was overpoweringly sweet...very nicely balanced. My friend's hotcakes were definitely not sweet; they packed a nice, tart punch. Paired up with a side of bacon (which had half a pack of bacon...they don't skimp on the portions), about a bushel of home fry potatoes, and bottomless coffee, and you've got one honey of a breakfast/brunch. The prices were even good for the quantity. With locations in Wicker Park, the South Loop, AND Andersonville, you can find one near you about anywhere in Chicago, and it is TOTALLY worth the trip.
