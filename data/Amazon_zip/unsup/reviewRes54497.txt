The Chicago Diner. Best Veggie Restaurant in the city, hands down. They do everything right from Gyros to Ruebens. The fresh juices and smoothies are also delicious. One need not be a vegetarian or vegan to appreciate the cuisine, and if I could eat there everyday I would have no problem swearing off my carnivorism.
