If I had it my way I would go to bed at this place, wake up here, and spend almost every waking minute within its confines. I love this grocery store for stocking all the fun and wonderful goodies that any foodie can appreciate. From the thick cut bacon, to the unpastuerized French cheese, to the white chocolate lemon shortbread covered blueberries. I have had the opportunity to breakfast it here a few times and feel it can't be beat for a non-sit down joint. Their pastries are great, especially the scones which have the perfect amount of flake and butter. I also was able to go to one of their classes where Eve Aronoff cooked us a beautiful spring feast with great wine to boot.  Also for those of us who are Whole Foods devotees, F & O has them beat for the fact that they also sell SODA...I'm talking Diet Coke, which I always end up having to go on a extra trip for anyways. Now if only my Seattle groceries could jump on board this genius bandwagon!
