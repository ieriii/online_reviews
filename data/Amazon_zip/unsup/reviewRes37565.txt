I'm certain I won't say anything here that hasn't already been said. Hopleaf is great, minus the wait. But it's worth the wait. I joined a friend for an early dinner there, and we were seated well within our 45 minute estimated wait time. Service was slightly lacking, but luckily the two of us had enough to talk about so that fact fell to the wayside. We shared an order of mussels, always tasty; and then I opted for the toasted ham and cheese sandwich. After all, sandwiches are my #1 favorite food :) It did not disappoint. Overall, I really like this place and would probably offer up 5 stars if it wasn't so damn crowded all the time.
