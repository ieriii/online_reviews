My first thought when I walked in the door and saw the big dramatic velvet curtains that separate where you wait in line from where the bouncer stands to let people in, was 'oh hellllll no, this place is already to pretentious for me'. But, the little voice in my head said wait it out, even you like a little swank & pretension every now and then. And I'm glad I listened to that little voice because my girlfriends and I ended up having a great time here. We got there around 9 on a Saturday and I fully expected to have to wait a little bit because I know its a popular spot (the 500+ reviews gave it away!). After about 20 minutes in line though I got fed up and went up to the bouncer and asked what the hold up was. Turns out there were no tables but there was space at the bar which was A-Ok with us. (See, ask and ye shall receive does work every now and again.) I actually liked sitting at the bar because you had direct access to the bartender...and when you like to drink that's a good thing, no waiting! The drinks were really good and by watching the bartender make them I had no doubt they would be. She definitely took her time in making a drink and tasted all of them before serving to make sure they were just right. Love it. The drinks are expensive, I think each of ours were about $12 a pop. But, we all went in to it knowing we'd be paying for the ambiance so it wasn't a shocker when the bill came to $100+ for 10 drinks. Plus, the bartender was super friendly and the bouncer actually stopped by more then once to make sure we were Ok with our spot at the bar. So I have to give the service two thumbs up. I would recommend going early though - when we left around 11 the line was out the door. And I don't expect any amount of flirting could have gotten us in had we been waiting in line at that point!
