Okay I think this place has 175 reviews so taking the time out to write another is a little silly but for what it's worth ... We did the long menu with the wine pairing ...it's too much. I am a big eater and I didn't get through it all I had to pass on a few courses...and they were bit size....I tried! That being said ...it was amazing! It is expensive but if you break it down into a night of world class cuisine and entertainment ...to include drinks for the whole night ...about 4 hours then it's not much worse then dinner and drinks for 2 and good seats at a concert ...For what it's worth.
