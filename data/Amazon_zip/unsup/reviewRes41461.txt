Wow is this place good. Expensive as hell but very good. We got the Greg Norman shiraz based on a recommendation and it was great. Our server was pretty friendly and definitely knew her chit, gave us some suggestions like don't touch that 500 degree plate. We both had the filet, cooked to medium. I was questioning whether to order it medium-rare since it's sitting on a 500 degree plate when it's served to you, but I ordered medium since I'm a scaredy cat. The middle was warm but definitely PINK but cutting off a piece and flipping it cut side down onto the plate (and into all that melted butter) made it perfect. Yummy. Split a baked potato and broccoli au gratin in addition to the crabtini appetizer. Definitely didn't have room but split the hot/cold chocolate dessert anyways and it was sooooo worth it. Bar drinks are ridiculously expensive, I guess probably no more than other nice places but it's still shocking when you see the bill. About $265 for dinner for two, appetizer, dessert, bottle of wine and two drinks before hand. Not something you can do every weekend (at least I can't) but for an anniversary dinner, definitely yummy.
