Very crowded on a Tuesday which means that it's a GOOD place to go anytime! Their fries + garlic aioli is just divine. If that's all I ate, it would be fine by me. There is street parking but if you check the side streets or on parts of Foster, parking is free so you won't have to hurry back to feed the meter. Another major plus is that you have to be 21 to get in. I am personally not much of a beer drinker but had the Kriek and it was delicious. Probably too sweet for the average beer consumer, but just right for me. They are very knowledgeable about all of their beers (and if you look at the menu, you know that's not an easy feat). I had the brisket sandwich and it was pretty good. I only wish I asked for the mustard on the side. Oh and we finished off the meal with the brownie. It was DIVINE. Perfectly crunchy on the outside and warm and delectable on the inside. Can't wait to stop in again.
