I forgot to review this one till I read Jean C's review because we were here together along with Christopher. I agree with Jean that the service was a tad rushed. On the other hand, because we were in and out quickly, we headed up to Outdoor Cafe for dessert. I ordered the Greek combo meal. It was quite good, not great, but better than the similar meal I had at Roditys earlier in the summer. I was amazed at how packed it was on a Thursday night. Thank Zeus for valet parking!
