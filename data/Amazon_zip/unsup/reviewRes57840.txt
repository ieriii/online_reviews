A few months ago, my husband and I took some out of town friends here after driving past a few other nearby places with lines out the door. Boy, did we make the right choice... the food delicious, the service just fine, and the friends left full and impressed at our selection. My husband had the chicken & waffles, and the chicken was honestly some of the best I've had. I had the stuffed french toast (amazing), and one of the out of town friends had a duck dish. She commented to me just the other day that she still thinks of that meal!
