I need to go back and have some more beers and different food but so far it looks pretty good. The "working" ales were pretty much what you expect...Hoppy and American tasting (aka balls) but I did like the porter. That's not to say that those beers were bad, I just don't typically like that hoppy American micro brewed thing. I need to try the Wit. They also have a ton of other beers on tap and in the bottle. The pizza looked pretty good. It appears to be fairly typical fire brick oven type pizza, which is may favorite and had I known that before hand, that's what I would have ordered. I ended up going with the burger as we tried going to Kuma's but wasn't willing to wait 2 1/2hours so we came here and the burger was every bit as good as a Kumas burger. So ya, Kumas can go fuck itself. I don't usually like "hand cut" fries but these were good. So ya, typical (good)bar food; pizza, burgers, some sandwiches and salads, soups, etc. No pasta or anything like that. Service was good, found parking right out front, no wait (it was 3pm on Saturday). There is a membership card you can buy which would probably pay for itself quickly if you live close and can go a lot. I will definitely go back but after I try all the beers and the pizza I probably won't go out of my way (since I live in Andersonville) to get there unless the Pizza and or other beers completely blow me away. You can buy growlers as well. There was absolutely no consistency in the crowd whatsoever. Which, could be a good or bad thing or just make no fucking difference at all. The pizza isn't that good...The sauce was terrible...If you want pizza and you are in Logan Square, go up the street to Ciao Napoli...It's way better.
