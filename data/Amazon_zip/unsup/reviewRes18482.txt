One menu for all their beers and another for food. = Bad ass. Me and Oogie stopped in for a bite late night, lucky for us the kitchen closes at 1am. In some ways Bad apple reminded us of Feed the beast. Knocking back a few Matilda's and Pranqster Belgian whites, we noshed on the ham and Swiss sliders which were effing excellent. The wait for our burgers was a little longer than expected but worth the wait. All of their burger options are half pounders topped with a plethora of different toppings. I had the Texas toast burger with pulled pork topping. YUM! Almost too much food and the accompanying seasoned fries were fried just right in new oil. I hate it when fries are fried in used oil, there is a taste difference you see. Burgers for two, sliders and four beers = Fifty bucks with tip. We'll be back for more burgers and interesting beer tripping.
