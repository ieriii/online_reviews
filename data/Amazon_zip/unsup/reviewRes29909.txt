Take out was meh.. Granted, there are very few sit-down joints that can also pull off great take out. Fried things tend to get steamed in styro, what was once piping hot is now kinda hot, etc.. So you can cut them some slack. As soon as we get a babysitter locked down and my son is a little older, we're back there to check out what the sit-down experience is like. So TBD, but for the $$$, take-out wasn't worth a repeat.
