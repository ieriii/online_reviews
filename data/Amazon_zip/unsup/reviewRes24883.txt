I am a lover of Greek food and any sort of dessert that's not too sweet, so after trying out a friend's birthday cake from Artopolis, I had to make a trip to the actual cafe! Luckily, my boyfriend lives right by Greek town and it was our first date spot! While I do have a sweet tooth, I tend to steer towards light desserts that aren't too heavy or sweet. So my first choice was definitely the yogurt mousse cakes! They are my absolute favorite - light and fluffy with just the right amount of tart and sweet for the various fruit flavors! Other dessert selections I've tried that I would recommend include the Royal White Chocolate (for a sweeter option), fruit tart and pear tart! Oh, and did I forget to mention the Greek coffees? The Ice Frappe is one of my absolute favorites and a must have everytime I stop by! The atmosphere is great for a casual date, hanging out with friends or just to stop by for some food and drinks! I love the service and always have a great time!
