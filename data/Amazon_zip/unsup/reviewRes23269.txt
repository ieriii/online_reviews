I went here after reading the yelpers and what a hot tip that was.  You have to do a it of searching to fnd it, but it's totally worth it.  We were a little overwhelmed by the large menu, so I usually start with the House Specialties.  The Chicken with 3 Chilis was highly recommended so that's what we got. Not the healthiest option on the menu, but a-maze-ing. Very sweet and spicy, just like I like it. The prices are moderate ($8-12) and the portions are huge, so don't be afraid to share with our loved ones.
