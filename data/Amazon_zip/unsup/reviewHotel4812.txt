The Wit is a high priced JOKE!!! The only thing that partly redeemed my total opinion were the HOPS!! No microwaves???? Really??? The cheapest hotels have them, why not the WIT?? I attended a Wedding and stayed at the Wit, I should have stayed somewhere else! I was SOOO, not impressed, and will never stay there again, even if it's free! More like Dim Wits!!!
