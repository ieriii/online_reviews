Indie is an intimate and pleasant restaurant with good food to back it up. I thoroughly enjoyed the Sunny Crunchy (spicy tuna, cream cheese, scallion, asparagus tempura with bbq sauce) and I have craved it every day since I first tried it.  If you're in or around Edgewater and looking for good sushi, I'd highly recommend Indie!
