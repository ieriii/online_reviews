This place is amazing! The food not only is delicious and authentic but it is not too expensive vs. other restaurants that have lower quality. We ordered guacamole, salsa, chips, tinga, beans, rice, cebollitas, tamales and drinks and everything was excellent and tasty. My only room for improvement for this place was half of the dessert I had. I had the dos flanes desserts and the normal flan was delicious but the chocolate flan thought wasn't as good or authentic but you could say it was creative (a flan with mint???). I would love to come back and try the whole menu.
