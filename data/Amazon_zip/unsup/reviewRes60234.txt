If you love seafood, then you need to check out the Baltimore Pizza they make with lump crab....They ad a fish seasoning, called Old Bay, which is great on shrimp and crab. This is now my favorite pizza from my new favorite pizza parlor..Like the Shrimp Scampi as well(nice fresh garlic taste in the wine sauce).. Gotta try them out..I did the 2 pizza deal, one was 50% off, and had 'em delivered this week...I might be hungry, but this cold Chicago weather is killing me.PS..Can you deliver beer?
