Just had breakfast here, and thought it was really awesome. We had the peach pancakes: had whole fruit pieces, light and airy very good! Breakfast burrito...super filling! English muffin sandwich, was simple, but great. The breakfast potatoes were excellent. We also were able to substitute the meat for veggie chorizo, which was really a nice option. I would totally come back again to try the lunch.
