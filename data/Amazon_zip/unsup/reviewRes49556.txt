I'm on tour with a music theatre show so we are always looking for hot spots after shows to unwind and dine late. Bin 36 was a wonderful place to have a plethora of wine choices and dinner. The gougers for appetizer and donut holes for desert are to die for. I also enjoyed the atmosphere and staff was very friendly. I'm not a cheese-person, so I was happy to see the great selection of entrees. You've got to try the pork. Woah. Scrumptious! All of my cast trickled in and we made a huge party. The staff was welcomed to always adding on people and we all had a great time, every time we went. Love Bin 36 and have to visit next time I'm in Chicago.
