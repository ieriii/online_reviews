Most elegant, sophisticated, art-sy, and quite delicious meal of my life. Well worth the greater $500 price tag. We had the 11 plate tasting with the red-wine pairings only. A year later I can still remember every dish clearly. Highlights were the entire tomato garden brought to the table. Hot Potato Cold Potato!!! A super elegant French duck & truffle dish with the most amazing place setting and wine glass. Just one of the most memorable and beautiful nights of my life. Entirely focused on the wonder of the food in front of me.
