This is by far the worst Indian food I have ever encountered. We visited the restaurant with a friend who has a garlic allergy and received the same shoulder shrugging attitude as a previous reviewer with nut allergies. Except, the waiter recommended two dishes that were not supposed to have garlic... Not trusting his flippant response, we conferred with the more helpful young lady at the front counter.  We found that one of the items offered (paneer makhani) did indeed have garlic and could have caused a serious reaction!! The only item they were willing to provide garlic free was okra of some sort. She stuck with the mango lassi. As we had attended the restaurant as a group of 8 with a groupon, the rest of the group gave the food a shot. We generally regretted it as the food was mediocre at best. The naan was somewhat plastic-like and the chicken in the masala was quite dry. The tandoor chicken was bright red but somehow remained flavorless. The mango ice cream and kheer were not bad as they are two items that must be difficult to ruin. The most redeeming moment of the meal was honestly being able to tell our friend that she had dodged a bullet with the food. We were unable to express our disgust with the poor service as the gratuity was automatically applied because of our group size. To top it all off, we were required to pay the balance of the bill in cash after applying the groupon value.
