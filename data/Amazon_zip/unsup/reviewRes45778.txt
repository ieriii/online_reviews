This is a newer restaurant located on Broadway just north of Wellington. The crowd in unassuming and they typically play sports on the several TVs around the restaurant and bar. I love sitting in the "library" where there are only four tables and you truly are able to experience a more intimate and laid-back setting. The first time I went here, I was unimpressed by the salty food. You truly have to choose the right options though because every visit since has been amazing. I highly recommend ordering the chicken pot pie!
