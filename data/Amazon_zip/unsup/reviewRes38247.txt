After trying two other deep dish pizza places, this was my last shot. Boy did I save the best for last! The individual size was so big that I couldn't even finish it. I loved the sauce on the top of the pizza. I am definitely a big red sauce fan and if you are too, I would recommend this place because it is tasty and well proportioned. This WILL be the first place I go back to when I come back to Chicago.
