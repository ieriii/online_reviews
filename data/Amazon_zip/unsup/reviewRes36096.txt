I love the food here, since it's beyond the normal breakfast stuff you can get anywhere. It's well thought out and fresh! My guilty pleasures here are any of their french toast/pancakes/waffles. I feel like I'm having dessert for breakfast! I just hate waiting!!! This place is the KING of waiting for breakfast places since it's so good. But since we figured out the rule of thumb and get to breakfast before 9am, we haven't had a terrible problem. I also hate sitting in the front near the door. Since the people waiting decide its the best idea to wait in between doors and prop the inside door open, it gets so cold! But i guess I'm just nitpicking. I just seriously hate being cold when I'm eating.
