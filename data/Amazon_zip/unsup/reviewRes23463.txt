8 things I love about Icosium: 1) It's this ecclectic Algerian neighborhood gem. 2) Cucumber in water! 3) Sweet, savory, and build-your-own crepes! 4) The sweet crepes come with ice cream. Genius! I got pistachio with my banana nutella crepe. 5) How my crepe was adorned with a cocktail toothpick umbrella. Oh, the little things in life... 6) The music and ambiance made me want to eat my food Indian style cross-legged on a rug. So I sat cross-legged in my booth, but had to leave the rug part to my imagination. 7) Very reasonable prices for jumbo crepes. 8) It's down the street from A Taste of Heaven, Hamburger Mary's, and Swedish Bakery. And even though they used low calorie chocolate syrup to top off my dish, I forgive them.
