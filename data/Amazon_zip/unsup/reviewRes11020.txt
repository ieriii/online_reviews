For some reason I was expecting that this place is overrated. I am so happy I was wrong. This place is always packed for a reason, the food is amazing. The breakfast burrito is unreal. They don't skimp on the avocado and the sour cream that's served on the side is so stinkin perfect. I joke around that I'm going to be banned from this place for creeping out the other diners b/c I can't stop staring at their beautiful plates of food. The pancakes are extremely decadent. Too rich for me, but a pancake lovers heaven. The service is nice and fast. If there is a long wait, no big deal, there are plenty of cute shops just blocks away to burn a few minutes at while you are waiting. The "large" OJ is overpriced and SOOO not large. I'm gonna let that slide b/c I dream about the burrito.
