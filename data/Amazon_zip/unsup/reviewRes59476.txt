Had a 1:30 p.m. Reservation for Mothers Day (12 Persons). We were on time. The lobby was packed people were carring food over their heads into the main restaurant. We were told that they had over-booked and that the 1 p.m. reservations had not been seated . After waiting 20 minutes we left.NEVER AGAIN.
