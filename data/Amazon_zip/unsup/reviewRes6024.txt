Came here on a business trip since it was short walk from our hotel and garnered many rave reviews from Yelp. This place screams steakhouse with the decor drenched in dark wood and the upbeat atmosphere. Towards the back was the open kitchen which slightly threw off the dark decor but leaked out the enticing aroma of charred meat. We were a party of 14 yet the service was just attentive and on point. I know at times, when accommodating a large party, some dishes tend to come out faster than others thus creating an awkward moment between the haves and have nots until all dishes arrived. However all of our entrees came out at the same time piping hot, ready to be eaten. We started off some some of the pizzas which were great to nibble on yet didn't fill you up as you prepared to gorge on the main attraction - the steaks! I chose and devoured the 10" prime rib cooked perfectly medium rare, charred on the outside, buttery and beefy on the inside with bare bones seasoning. The rest of my group either ordered steak or the fish special and were pleased and stuffed. We couldn't leave without sampling a couple of desserts - It's a totally different stomach! A few plates of berry crisps and apple skillet pie were passed around. Simple yet solid dessert, a perfect ending to a great meal and worth the additional calories. Wildfire is not some new gastronomical adventure but your good old fashion steak house, simple but done right.
