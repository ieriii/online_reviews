I've been going to Greek Islands since moving to Chicago more than 10 years ago, and I've never been disappointed. The atmosphere is warm and festive, the service is fast and friendly, and the food? Is incredible. I could recommend just about anything, though the avgolemono soup, the saganaki, and just about any lamb dish are personal favorites. The free parking and convenient location don't hurt either.
