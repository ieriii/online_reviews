This place is amazing! I dream about the duck special in my sleep. Everyone here is so nice. There is nothing else I could ask for.  If you go, get the duck. All the veggies are amazing and the egg rolls are supreme. But you have enough food with just the duck to feed like 4 REALLY hungry people. Now. Theis place is busy b/c it's amazing. If you want a good table, call ahead. People know this term as reservations. Trust me. I work in the industry. So, if you come on a real busy night, w/o a reservation, the host is going to put you any place that's open. And if you don't like it, you can always say something. Just be prepared to learn that they are reserved.  Also note. Duck takes a while to cook. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize a stir fry dish will come out faster than a roast duck dish.  I have a frustration with people who are rude to industry workers, so please take all of my information to heart and be nice to the people who deal with your food. Trust me. Oh, and their delicious food? They've been keeping it up for years now. Thanks!
