GREAT little Vietnamese restaurant. The owner is very hands on (he even brought us water and chairs for our little 10 minute wait for a table!). The food is even better. I HIGHLY recommend the avocado wontons and the pho soup. Also, we ordered delivery from Simply It for our second try and the experience was even better. Not only were they prompt and super friendly, but they gave us complimentary melon with our order! 5 stars from me all around. Great little place with good food and great service.
