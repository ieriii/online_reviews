Great food, great atmosphere, great service. Went on a Sunday night and the place was full of folks enjoying dinner. The bar has a row of vintage, warm bulbs running the length of a very long wood counter top. Our party of five was seated comfortably in a corner next to a wall chock full of wine bottles. The food was really, really tasty -- some hits and some misses too, but mostly hits. The truffle toast and the sea urchin pasta were definitely the highlights. Unbelievably yummy! Was originally considering either this place and one across the street -- based on some other reviews. Had some trouble at the other place and am so thankful we came here for the evening. The difference was night and day.
