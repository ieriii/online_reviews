Shaw's Oyster Bar has been a go to spot in our house for over a dozen years. The selection is huge; it's noisy, a little divey even, as oyster bars should be; plus Carlos and Arturo are so welcoming behind the bar. The board lists the daily oyster selection so you can mix and match to your heart's content, the sourdough bread is an evil temptation and the sushi is better than at a lot of sushi restaurants! Ahoy!
