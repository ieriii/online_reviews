This place is delicious, cheap, and they give great portions! I never thought I would enjoy this place, but I did. The waiter I had was very nice and gave great recommendations which I admire. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but it's a crowded restaurant and people kept bumping into me and the table I sat at felt non-sturdy lol, so I had to knock a star off. Me & my partner order the Calamari Fritti & Bruschetta for our appetizer, it was amazing. For our entree we had the Farelle Pollo which had so much flavor, it was definitely one of the best pastas I've ever tasted. In addition, we ordered the Spaghetti Frutti De Mare which was just as good.
