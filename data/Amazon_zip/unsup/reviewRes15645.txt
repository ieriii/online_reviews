I've been here a handful of times and it's consistently good. The place is HUGE, so it's a great place to come for a big group celebration-- with a reservation, of course. Even with as big as it is, it gets super crowded. The cocktails are very good-- especially the wide variety of mojito and sangria options. And the homemade guacamole is excellent (beware: the homemade chips are on the greasy side), but my favorite starter is definitely the ropa vieja-- braised beef on fried plantains. As for entrees, I have tried something different every time I have been here. The lunchtime fish tacos are very good and the Chuleta (grilled porkchop) was delicious-- and they update the preparation seasonally. My husband, on the other hand, always orders the Arrachera steak and loves it every time.
