Frontera is at the same time amazing as it is challenging. The food is out of this world, but the wait is out of this world as well. Now if you can snag a seat at the bar or don't mind waiting, then this place is for you. In my opinion the food here is well worth the wait. In my 10 years going to this place I have never had a bad meal and it rivals the food I have had all over Mexico or across the country. The Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena will rival any steak you can get at a 5 star steakhouse in the city, their squash blossom quesadillas are top notch, the seasonal tamales are succulent, and their salsa verde has a tang that is unbeatable. I really suggest to first timers to step outside of the traditional "tex-mex" style mexican food and go for some of the more authentic and unique cuisine and you will come away very happy that you did.
