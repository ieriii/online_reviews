BEST PERSIAN FOOD IN ALL OF CHICAGO. Been there a thousand times. Take it from an Iranian this is very good Iranian/Persian food. Service has been excellent every time. I HIGHLY recommend the Tadig, Shirin polo WITH joojeh on the bone OR with chejeh. If you are an adventurist try the doogh, or kashkebademjoon, or any of the stews. This is truly a great place for any occasion.
