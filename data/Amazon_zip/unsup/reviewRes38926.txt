La Villa has a special place in my heart. My parents have been frequent diners since before they were married (and La Villa was strictly takeout/delivery pizza). The dining room needs some serious updating and I could do without the salad bar but I love the food and pizza. My favorites are thin crust cheese and the gnocchi. For my money I can't find a better Italian place. I can't count the number of times I have driven out to La Villa for an awesome dinner or to pick up pizza for my mom and dad. My bridal shower was held here and was wonderful! In addition the staff is always excellent; very attentive and knowledgeable! It isn't the most modern restaurant on earth but the quality food and wonderful staff make up for whatever the place is lacking in decor.
