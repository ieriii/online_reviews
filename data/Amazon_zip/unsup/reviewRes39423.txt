After my first visit here left me feeling unimpressed, I didnt think I would visit this place ever again, but Im glad I went back as I have changed my opinion. This time we decided to be more adventurous and try a few things that we werent really sure about and it turned out to be a really great dinner. We split the Fluke, Pear salad, and an appetizer. Everything was great. They also have Daisycutter on tap which is one of my favorite local beers. While this is not somewhere I would go all the time, overall my second time dining here was a really great experience. Im glad we ventured back in.
