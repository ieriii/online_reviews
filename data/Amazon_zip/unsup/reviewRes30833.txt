Nice place, great food, and kid friendly. We ordered the kids Mac N Cheese for our 2 y/o, and when it comes you can smell the garlic. I was worried my son would turn it away but instead kept saying it was "yummy" and ate about 90% of it. I had the Po' Boy and was extremely satisfied with it. Nice decor and great service. Missing the last star because I thought it might be just a pinch pricey.
