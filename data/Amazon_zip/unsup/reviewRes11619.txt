This is a solid 4 stars. The crowd is a bit ridiculous, but I didn't experience any of the horror stories everyone else had been talking about. We had the White Pizza with Spinach and Goat cheese. The highlight of the meal was my first beer, Festivus. It was dark, full-bodied and delicious. I also had one of their World Beer Cup selections the Golden Arm. A completely different formulation from the Festivus, but I was far less impressed by it. I would go back sometime when I know it isn't so packed.
