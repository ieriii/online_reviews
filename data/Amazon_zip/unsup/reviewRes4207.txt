So, it's a bit difficult to get a reservation. Doesn't matter because when you get there, you'll understand why. Food is always amazing. Service is impeccable. Chef Carlson is a genius....and his staff is awesome. Laid back with fun music, not pretentious at all for the caliber of restaurant this is, and is by far my favorite place to dine. (Alinea's got nothing on Schwa!!!). BYOB is just the icing on the cake....don't miss this place.
