With 444 previous reviews for Grand Lux, what can I possible add? Well, my two cents. See, beyond the burger and the desserts -- which I'll admit are really yummy -- I don't get the appeal of this place. Here's why: 1. It boasts a view of Michigan Ave. Yeah, for about 20 people. The place is cavernous and you often sit and get lost in the middle. It's an issue trying to find and get to the bathroom. 2. The confusion when you walk in. They greet you and you tell them your story, but they don't care, they send you through the wasted space up the escalator. They don't use their walkie headgear thingies to tell anyone you're coming. You may get seated after a bit of disorientation... 3. The wait for attention once you are seated. Hello, bread? Waters? If I'm going to wait an unbearably long time for my meal, sate me, would ya? 4. The tourists. They see the third-floor window views and pour in. They see the Cheesecake Factory-like atmosphere and feel right at home. But they are incapable of functioning in the city, and they really belong at the Sears/Willis Tower, where they can hang out with their mouths agape for as long as they want. 5. The music. It's so -- WHAT DID YOU SAY? -- loud. Turn it down. The place is too loud already. 6. The servers. Take some initiative. Remember my request. Act like you've done this before. Earn your tip. Skip it. There are some amazing restaurants in Chicago that are worth all this trouble.
