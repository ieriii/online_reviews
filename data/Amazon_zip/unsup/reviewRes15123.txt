This place is overrated! The hidden factor, the wait, the curtins, the high back chairs and its so dark i can't read the menu. Buuuut, I really love this place. It's "hidden", the curtins, high back chairs and the drinks are delicious.  It doesn't get 5 stars becuase the darkness really kinda bothered me. I couldn't read the menu that well and i felt like i was going to start a fire when i brought the candle close to the paper menu to pick a drink. Fires aside, I like it here and will return.
