loved this place! Perfect stop for a drink and a snack. I would have loved to have a meal there as other diners' food looked amazing as well. we just had wine and the cheese plate as they were out of the deviled eggs. all of the cheese was stinky and delicious. my only gripe was service was a little slow, even when sitting at the bar. this was especially surprising since it seemed like there were a lot of employees at the time (i think we were there at shift change) and many of them were talking at the end of the bar.
