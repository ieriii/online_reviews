Meh is right. I love, LOVE tapas and was pretty disappointed with Mercat. Walking in I was surprised by the size of the place. My friend and I were seated, ordered a round of drinks and were hustled around from that point on. As is common, we ordered gradually for about 45 minutes and kept the drinks coming. We were enjoying our drinks and conversation when our waitress gave us our bill (we didn't ask for it) and came back to remind us of it every 2 minutes thereafter. This ruined the experience. Too bad.
