Felt like I was in the rabbit hole and on the set of an Alice in Wonderland movie - the decor and fun tall chairs were worth seeing and experiencing. The atmosphere could feel a little rigid to some, but I think having a unique choice like this from time-to-time is great. It's great having a lounge experience so different from the painfully pretentious 'ultra lounges' popping up these days. Per the rules posted outside, in the entrance, and above every toilet: you must enjoy rules. No grey goose, no bud light, no light beer, you must be awesome, etc. No cell phones. Coat hangers along the far wall.
