I was very excited about coming to this place, and wish that I tried something more creative. I had a salty craving though, and the menu was different than what I had seen on the internet. I think that it's probably different from the one downtown, so it's that menu that shows up on the website and not for this location. Anyways, I had a salty craving and went with the two eggs any style. It came with potatoes, a choice of bacon or sausage, and toast. It was way too much food. I only ate half of what I got. They make excellent lattes and cappuccinos here. The prices are reasonable especially for all the food you get. If you have a big enough appetite, this is the place to come to be filled up. Our waitress was nice, and was glad that the place could accommodate our party of 6 on a Tuesday morning. It does get busy, and I can certainly understand why.
