Attention Chocolate Fantasy:Remember me, Chad, it's dreamy chocolate...hold the peanuts! Think about it Chad, another name for the scrumptious, spoon-licking, new Venezuelan dessert is 'dreamy knockout'! Hot, huh,email me(sisdesinicole@yahoo.com),ha,ha,ha! My tastebuds tapdanced after every bite! It really is like a Hallmark card playing music in your mouth!  Hey Shy Town! Just when you think all the Johnny Depp look-alikes are being pirates in the Caribbean for the third time, Chad-the assistant gm, pops up at your table with a charismatic and professional demeanor. He is a mix between the boy next door and 21 Jump Street in the presence of the ladies!Hurry up, quick, somebody needs to email God! I know He is looking for the colors missing out of His rainbow. Guess what? They are all in the dining room of the Carnivale! The decor is popping like Mary-yeah baby!My stomach is growling at just the thought of going back to the Carnivale. OOOh, I can not wait! Viva la Carnivale!!!Oh, did someone mention heavenly? The guacamole and chips are fit for a goddess or a king! Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Where have it been all my life! It serenaded me in each crunch like a Brian McKnight love song.
