food: YUM-O! my friends and i had such a great time at the publican. the food was AMAZING, the ambiance was super fun and the wine was delish. yes yes! i highly recommend getting the mussels (omg yum), yellowtail crudo, summer squash, fried eggplant, ham chop (lots of goodness!), a selection of oysters and a plate of different hams. amaze. service: super fun and very knowledgeable...yet not in your face, you know? final thoughts: i can't wait to go back to chicago and to take my husband here!
