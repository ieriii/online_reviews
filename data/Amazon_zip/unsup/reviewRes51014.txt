Lets do brunch! So I went on a Sunday around noon to get some lazy Sunday brunch and it was a bit overwhelming with the half hour wait and many varieties of small people running around. So despite the crowdedness and wait its very much worth it for the food. Unfortunately they were already out of bignets, however the cheese grits were creamy and rich, the coffee was delicious and never stopped comin, the specialty eggs benedict with roasted red peppers and feta was simply splendid.. although one of my eggs was a bit overdone. Friends also enjoyed some corn cakes and biscuits and gravy that made this place a definite food coma for us all.
