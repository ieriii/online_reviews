I love giordano's but this one just doesn't cut it for me. I came here a couple of month's ago with friends who have never had giordano's before. The waittress was kinda snotty but I really didn't care cuz, I wanted some pizza so her attitude was irrelevent to me. But my friends sure had a problem with her that's why her ass didn't get a tip (hehe) I don't tip rude people ever. But on to the pizza we got half pepperoni, half beef all I have to say about that was what happenened to it? All we got was globs of cheese and the pizza was lukewarm. But it was ok I've had better giordano's it's not how it used to be back in the day, but I like the one by midway airport they never fail me.
