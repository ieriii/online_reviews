We went to Mastro's in a large group for a friends birthday dinner. Service was superb. One of the perks to our visit was that we were able to explore a lot of the menu. Among what we sampled, i would highly recommend the lobster mashed potato, truffle gnocchi, brussels sprouts, bone in rib-eye, and butter cake. Now stating the obvious, the prices are at quite the premium, and that alone is why i ended up giving it a 4-star rather than a 5.  I've been to some of the other local steak houses such as Gibson's - and would rank Mastro's at the top of my list.
