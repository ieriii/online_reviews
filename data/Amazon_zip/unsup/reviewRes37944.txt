5 stars for this deep dish pizza I don't like pizza but this spot rite here delivers and man oh man it is perfect when it is raining and the wind is howling to get it delivered. Main reason this spot gets 5 stars is the portion 1 if not 2 slices is more then enough to put you in a food coma and set you off to lala land. the sauce is not as good as Lou's but the ingridents make up for that. heavy portions, man food, cheesy, saucy, tasty on every bite. anytime I head to Chicago this will be always one of my first if not last places to visit each time. food ***** service **** it was delivered in less then an hour price $$ definite spot I will hit up or have delivered
