i took my friend from out of town there for dinner last night. the lobby/bar area was insanely packed, it was like 6:30, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes, and we pre-ordered our deep dish, so that was awesome too. they were out of the spinach/artichoke dip, which we really wanted, and it wasn't even that late to have run out of it. the pizza was good, we got stuffed sausage/green pepper, and an order of the zucchini, which was amazing. our server was pretty nice too, even though he forgot to bag up some of our leftovers. i'd def take friends back here again, its so convenient because i live right off of chicago, so its super easy to get to.
