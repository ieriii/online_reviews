I've been here a couple of times around happy hour since it's so close to where I work. I wouldn't say I'm a very knowledgeable wino, but I felt very comfortable here asking what may seem stupid questions to our server. Definitely a great spot if you aren't necessarily a sommelier and want to beef up your wine tasting skills! Aside from the very lengthy wine options, they have an equally extensive cheese menu to boot. The cheese portions are small, usually served with some bread or crackers and are adequately priced ($2-$3 per plate). Every cheese on the menu also indicates one or two good wines for pairing. When I went there last night, I was very disappointed to find out that they had changed up their cheese list. They used to have this zamorano cheese that was absolutely to DIE for. Apparently now they are trying to support local farmers by carrying only American cheeses (sadly, zamorano is from Spain). When we asked our waiter, he brought out a complementary sliver of a cheese he thought to be similar to the zamorano. Though it paled in comparison, it was a very nice gesture -- and "free" always tastes good! I would definitely recommend grabbing some friends, getting a wine flight (you can never go wrong with most of the Bin wines) and a couple of cheeses to pair.
