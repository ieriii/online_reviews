I had a wonderful experience at Little Bucharest Bistro. The live music is magnificant and sets a very intimate and lively atmosphere. The owner, Branko, is extremely friendly and personal with all of his customers, in addition to his hard-working staff. Everyone in the restaurant seems to be having a great time everytime I go there. The new menu is delicious - my favorite item on the menu is the vegatarian goulash. I highly recommend going to the Little Bucharest Bistro!
