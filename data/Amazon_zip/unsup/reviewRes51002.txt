Big Jones is very good for a date. The atmosphere is very simple, but clean and modern. The server we had was very well-informed about the menu and was able to give a lot of detail about each dish we asked about. Jeffrey had the pecan catfish that he said was very good. I had shrimp and grits, also very tasty. I chose this place because it advertises as Southern, which the menu is Southern-modern. This isn't the place to get a heapin' pile of Ma's vittles, the presentation is very pretty. If you go, take the time to order one of the cocktails, strong and yummy!
