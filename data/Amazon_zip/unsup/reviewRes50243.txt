Great experience at Big Jones for a late lunch, and I will surely be back to check out brunch and dinner, or just to get drinks and appetizers. The gumbo and red beans dishes were tasty and satisfying. My gumbo came with a side of sassafras powder, to thicken the sauce and add complexity... very interesting addition, and somewhat of an education. Speaking of education, get the pickle sampler and enjoy the lecture. Varieties of pickled veggies, fruits, and obscure items such as fiddleheads are lovingly displayed like the most festive sushi dish. Ambience was great, with music centered on 60s soul. Irma Thomas, Wilson Pickett, and Alderman Jerry Butler. Service was friendly, attentive, and informative. We were there mid-afternoon on a weekday, so we had the place almost to ourselves, which made the experience seem extra luxurious.
