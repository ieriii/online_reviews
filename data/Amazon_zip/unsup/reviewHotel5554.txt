A friend and I took a roadtrip to see our Philadelphia Phillies take on the Cubs in Chicago in July and had a hard time finding a place to stay until we found this gem. Good location (near trains and walking distance to a lot of stuff), good price and awesome free breakfast! Liked this place so much, it's made me a firm believer in the LaQuinta chain and I've looked at staying at them in other cities.
