Best restaurant I have ever visited in the United States. Creative food, great service and comfortable decor. As an artist, I am impressed by the plating of the food. Where else can you eat a helium balloon in the States? Different from other restaurants, the food is also great! As a vegetarian, I appreciate the thoughts that the chef put behind the food. While the bomb dessert is very similar to that in Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong, it nonetheless still makes me feels like a little child again. My friends and I had a amazing time here! MUST GO!
