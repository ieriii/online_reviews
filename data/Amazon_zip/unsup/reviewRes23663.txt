My son and I were stolling through the neighborhood doing a power walk and it was sweltering outside. We were both getting a little hungry so we stopped in and ordered some food. My son is almost 2 so I thought we might try the empanadas. I ordered 3 empanadas, rice and plantains. I thought their empanadas were excellent and so did my son. I liked the fact that you could get different fillings for each empananda. I ordered a spinach and cheese, beef and potato, and a chicken. My son loved the beef and potato. I was surprised, their chicken ones were not dry. The salsa they give you was very spicy. I passed by a few days later and ordered a Costa Rica Coffee. It is a blend of two of my favorite drinks, horchata and coffee. Yummy!
