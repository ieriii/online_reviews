UPDATE: 05/03/10 Back again. I ordered an iced green tea but was told they have green tea, its just mixed. I said sure... apparently its just peppermint tea. LOL. Oh boy... then as I head into the "lounge" no outlet around the couch works. Now I know why this place smells. They have a plug-in air freshener but its plugged into a non-working outlet! DUH! I've removed one star for lack of green tea and working power outlets!
