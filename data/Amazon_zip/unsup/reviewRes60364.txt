Thank God for the Midwest...and Italians. ;) Only here would this sort of pizza chain have the appetite to down slice after slice of the stuffed goodness known as Giardano's world-famous. (In LA, for example, people would be more likely to vomit afterward--not necessarily due to bulimia, but because their bodies aren't used to being abused by the elements and self-indulgence like here. And frankly, the value for sinly delecacies is not the same...so I digress.)My favorite/standard pick is the Special with garlic (extra), not to outshine, however, the 3-cheese or even the shrimp (albeit an unusual experience the first go around). Whatever your pleasure--pizza, pasta or otherwise, Giardano's is a rare American treat.I will certainly be back. Hope you come to your senses too. ;)
