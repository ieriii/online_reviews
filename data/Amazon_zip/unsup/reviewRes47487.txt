I've stopped in a couple of times now with my wife. Definitely a great place to get a beer, a burger and watch some metal concerts on the big flat screens around the bar. Are there similarities to Kumas? Yes, but that doesn't mean the burgers aren't just as absolutely delicious! The fresh made potato chips are fantastic; great fries too. The mac and cheese was so-so, but was told that's not usually the case. We'll give it another shot next time we're in. One really nice thing about Lockdown is not having to wait 1 1/2 hours to get a table... well, so far at least!
