OH LORDY!!! They DEFINITELY NEED TO UPGRADE THEIR WAIT LIST SYSTEM! Solid 5 stars for food and service, but minus one star for their outdated seating system. SERIOUSLY, who the hell walks around the entire restaurant screaming out ppl's name? How inefficient and chaotic is that? What if someone claim to be someone they are not--stolen identity? Haven't their management heard of a buzzer? Our group was very irritated with this and was in shock at how the hostess and host still have their voices at the end of their shift.  We came in around 7pm, and we waited for 1.5 hours before we were seated. By the time we were seated, we were famished. We ordered two pizzas-- the red and white sauce. The white sauce was absolutely delicious with truffle garlic oil!!!! I would be back, but will definitely avoid peak hours and weekends! Their specially brewed Top Heavy Hefeweizen beer was delicious too, but we thought it was on the lighter/diluted side.
