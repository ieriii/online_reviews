This place is like an upscale version of cheesecake factory. The food and interior is similiar to cheesecake since i guess it's owned by the same company. The food is always good and with large portions and their lava chocolate raspberry cake is so rich and good. The service is always great they always have awesome recommendations. The place is pretty big and the grand staircase/ escalador is a nice touch. The view of michigan ave is awesome esp during the night. Overall this place is always a safe bet.
