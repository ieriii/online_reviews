Absolutely acceptable for the type of property. Wish the windows were more soundproof, but the room was clean, the halls smelled of fresh paint smell, and the hotel has been cleaning rugs and drapes in each room (warnings are posted). near all kinds of good stuff. free wifi that mostly seems to work. ac works well (which is good because it's hot-n-sweaty season here in chicago).
