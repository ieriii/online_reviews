I went here last night for a friend's birthday party. The food was good, but I only give this place a two rating because the service starting with the hostesses was awful. I would even say incompetent.  The hostesses were rude and seemed to have no sense of organization. We had reserved an area in the lounge and in the dining area. It took forever for us to be seated in the dining area (way past the actual reservation time), and at one point, we asked if they had seated our party since the group has dispersed because they were taking so long. The hostess took us to a table that was supposedly our party; a bunch of Asian people seated there(we were also Asian) and these people had no idea who we were. I could not believe that the hostess mistakenly thought our table had been seated and then maybe thought we were supposed to be seated at the table because we were all Asian. I asked her if she thought "we all looked alike." Once we got seated, we ordered some sake, and it took the waiter about twenty minutes to come back and tell us that the sake we ordered was out. We asked why it took him so long to report that to us. The waiter offered no apology nor did he attempt to make any suggestions for what to drink. Then the waiter brought us our food. We ordered a lot of food; he hurriedly announced the dishes he was putting down on the table that we could not understand him. As it turns out, they gave us a wrong dish. What was the worst was since we were a party of eight, the bill automatically figured in the tip of 20%, which, in my opinion, the wait staff and hostesses deserved zero. I am starting to think that the service was so poor because they knew they were going to get a 20% tip and didn't bother trying to do their competently. The quality of the food is very good but the incompetent service renders Sunda a poor rating in my book. A great restaurant doesn't get sloppy with service just because they have been around for awhile.
