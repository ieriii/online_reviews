I gotta say, I was skeptical of the Violet Hour when I walked in. Wait. Let's back up. The first time I saw the Violet Hour, I walked right past it because there's no signage for it. I looped around, realized that the inconspicuous red building WAS the Violet Hour, then went in. Now, where was I? Oh yes. When I walked in to the Violet Hour, I was skeptical. It's DARK OH MY GOD MY NIGHT VISION IS HORRIBLE AND I'M GOING TO TRIP OVER AN OTTOMAN. Luckily, I didn't, and I was seated in a chair that was made for a 9 foot tall person. This pleased me. It took a few minutes for my eyes to adjust, but they did and I scanned the menu. My husband arrived a few minutes after I did. "IT'S SO DARK!" "I know." Despite the darkness, we started off with a Trick Pony and a Old Fashioned. I got the Trick Pony, because I love citrusy vodka based drinks. Oh boy, it was delicious. I will admit that I don't know what half the ingredients in these drinks are, but everything I had was super tasty. We ordered some spiced beer nuts (OMG, YOU GET SO MANY NUTS) and another round once we finished our first drinks. My husband got a mix of whiskeys (not on the menu) and I got a Pimms Cup #4, because I have a soft spot for Pimm's Cups. It was excellent. Yes, they do have a dress code (you can't walk in looking like a hobo) and you can't use cell phones. Deal with it. I embraced their rules, and it's definitely refreshing not to see groups of people staring at their phones, not talking to one another. This place is pricey - 12 bucks a drink. It IS top notch (probably my favorite spot for drinks now, in Chicago) and I would recommend it to anyone seeking out delicious cocktails.
