I really liked this place. Yes, it's a little pricey for the seafood... But it's seafood. And well cooked. I had the scottish salmon and it was lovely. The veggies and potato pancake that came with it were also amazing. I really liked the feel of the restaurant and the staff was incredibly friendly. I'll be back!
