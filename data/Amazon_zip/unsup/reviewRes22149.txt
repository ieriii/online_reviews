Had not been here prior. Was guided here today via Atlantic Aviation at PWK. I had the standard Superdawg and strawberry malt (don't see a malt avail but rarely anymore), and a Whoopskidawg, which was...amazingly good. I will sure return...and tell everyone about this place. Thanks folks. Very well done.
