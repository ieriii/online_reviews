We came here for brunch and found it to be just OK. We arrived around 9:30am and got a table relatively quickly for a Sunday. My boyfriend ordered a breakfast burrito, which was just egg and cheese with salsa on the side. He barely ate half. I had the spinach red pepper eggs benedict and found it to be just average. We then shared the Red Velvet pancakes for something sweet. It was relatively bland, nothing spectacular . I wouldn't go out of my way to return here. We much prefer M. Henry despite the usual 40 minute wait.
