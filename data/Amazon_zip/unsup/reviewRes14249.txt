Glen's Crabfest on Tuesdays is AMAZING. Although was not so impressed with the host (Jim) or our server, the food was excellent! They serve the "real deal" in terms of King Crab legs - huge,delicious and hot. The mussels had too much garlic but overall were good quality. Our busboy was actually the best "server" we had - attentive, helpful and very nice. Would definitely add this to my list of places to return and frequent often!
