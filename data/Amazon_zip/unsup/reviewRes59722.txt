This is a great date or business mean restaurant. We went here on a Saturday night for my birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. Everyone at our table ordered steak and it was nicely done. In my case, I had the twin fillets with shrimp stuffed with crabmeat and it was delicious. I had the side of the butternut squash and it was tasty. I tasted the sweet potato casserole and the mushrooms - to die for, just wonderful. This is the kind of place that you make a destination for a great evening out eating.Bring money, they aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for, as you know.I thoroughly recommend Ruth's Chris Steak house as a great restaurant in Chicago.
