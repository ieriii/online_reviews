We usually order their bbq takeout - duck, chicken, and pork, and they're all tasty. However, we had our first sit down dinner recently, and it was slightly disappointing. Granted, the disappointment was likely due to the high expectations. They had good bbq takeouts and very good selection on the menu, so I automatically assumed the food would be as good as any restaurants in China Town. Well, it was good, but not great. Being Chinese myself, I think I'd still go to China Town if I want really good Chinese, but on less picky days, Sun Wah will do.
