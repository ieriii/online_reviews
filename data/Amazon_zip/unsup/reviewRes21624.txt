the best hotdogs I've ever had in my entire life!!! with that being said it is also a super fun place to go eat and hang out. we were coming back from the shedd and could not agree on one place to eat...that is until Superdawg was brought up and we all screamed YES!!!!! when you get there you pull up to the order station, place your order, and the food is brought out to you in like 2 mins.....SUPERFAST and always hot!!! **CASH ONLY for right now. Our waitress said they will be excepting debit cards soon though: )
