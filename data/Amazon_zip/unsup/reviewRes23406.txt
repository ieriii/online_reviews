After a maiden trip to Tico-land, we wanted to visit Irazu to see what the hype was all about. Service: Very friendly and it felt genuine, and not simply for money. Food: I swear it was imported. The smell, look and taste reminded us of the lovely dishes we enjoyed on the wayside of Costa Rica. It's a BYOB: Store across the street has Imperial, fyi. So go all out. Make it a Costa Rican night.
