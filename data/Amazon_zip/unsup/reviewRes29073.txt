after hearing that this was the favorite deep dish pizza place of many friends and acquaintances, i expected a little more. i am a big crust person, and i didn't really love the crust here. from what i understand, if you don't really like the buttery crusts of other deep dish pizza proprieters, then that's a reason to love pequod's. it was good but not the best i've ever had.
