this place is like home. it's cheap, i can drink a lot of wine (that i bring from home!), and it's good to have a good time and share dishes with friends. service is friendly (and they speak with me in vietnamese!) and fast. appetizer go-tos are the spring rolls, egg rolls, and the vietnamese crepe. pho is amazing! if you want to venture out and try other things similar - mi is egg noodles, which are just as good! the broth here is so good, you smell like authentic pho when you leave. which for me, i like that as my musk. grab some bubble tea when you leave, or maybe a banh mi sandwhich to toast for lunch tomorrow. there's always a crowd at anytime so expect to wait a bit or share your table. there's people of all kinds that venture here so it's fun to make friends too!
