I have been to Chicago three times in the last 4 months and have hit Mercat everytime! The food and service are both amazing. The restaurant has a tapas-style menu, but the gem there is the chef's selection where they bring out plate after plate of amazing food. On this last visit, we had someone who doesn't eat red meat, and the chefs went out of their way to make sure that there was plenty for him as a part of the chef's selection. So while some of us were enjoying a great lamb chop, he was feasting on an amazing half lobster. Ah... and the red sangria... Don't miss this place.
