The bouncer outside may be rude and cranky but the atmosphere inside is anything but. The music engages the locals and the singer chats with the crowd in between improvised songs. The place wasn't crowded on a late Sunday night but it wasn't strikingly empty either. Everyone was really into the music and sometimes, they would clap along with the beats and dance in their chairs.
