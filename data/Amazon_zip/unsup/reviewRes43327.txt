Oh how I wish this place was a bit more efficient... I think it has really good food, I think it's a bit expensive and when Jerry's opens it's sandwich shop a few doors down it could be interesting. This morning I was so frustrated, as I stopped in for ice coffee on the go...there was only one girl working, she was serving the table, working the register and multiple other tasks...she looks totally sweet and as if she totally loves her job...but after standing there 10 minutes with only one person ahead of me, watching multiple bus's go by - I had to leave and ran into Alliance. Sorry Milk & Honey...
