The Amalfi Hotel is a fantastic choice when staying in Chicago. There are a lot of options in this city, high end to more economical but what makes the Amalfi Hotel stand out are the people, convenience and little "extras" that make a hotel stay an experience.  1. The people are beyond amazing. So nice, helpful and always happy to see you. 2. The rooms are well maintained, comfy, spacious 3. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. This hotel is in the center of it all. Located within a few blocks of the subway, this made the hotel easy to find and easy to leave when needing to get to the airport. In the theater district with the House of Blues right around the corner and the good old land mark of the Chicago Marquee Theater. Restaurants abound, with Keefer attached to the hotel and Public House as you walk out the door. Round the corner and you have a true taste of Chicago with some of the best best pizza, (Rossi's pizza by the slice) Mother Hubbard's local bar and etc. 4. There is a complimentary breakfast served each morning on each floor.  5. Happy Hour, open bar (definitely try the Amalfitini) and snacks (great selection of cheese, olives, finger foods, bread, cold cuts etc) ...this place is so wonderful, why the 4 stars?  While during our stay, we noticed there is a bar/club right next to the hotel that played music until 4:30a.m and we could hear the loud people and music ONLY on Saturday night. All other nights it was quiet. Also, we stayed on the 4th floor and had a splendid view of a brick wall. :(
