Best fried chicken I've ever had. Who comes here and eats a bowl of rice and vegetables on their first visit? Really? It's all about the chicken. It's hot, it's really crunchy, it's succulent (the wings and legs more so than the breast), and it's coated in a delicious sweet soy/garlic/ginger sauce (if you go for the Seoul Sassy). The half chicken is more than enough for one. I went today for lunch, and it was packed. I ordered, waited for my food, filled a large cup with water from the cooler, and grabbed an empty spot at a big table. I then found myself surrounded by a group who all arrived together. They were ridiculously friendly: I met an optometrist, a dermatologist, and a NASA engineer while eating my chicken. Highly qualified, well educated, gainfully employed people, all getting their hands sticky and stuffing their faces with deliciousness. Nice.
