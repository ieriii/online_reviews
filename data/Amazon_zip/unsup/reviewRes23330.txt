I had the Veggie Tajine here, it was so freaking tasty. Served in a steaming hot clay pot and so freaky tasty.Fresh pita on the side,did i mention that it was tasty? Vegetable soup was also to die for. The ingredients pop! And now a word about the bible- The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.   Dawkins, Richard
