This place has lots of seitan and tofu dishes that mock meat entrees. They have lots of filling salads and good deserts and it is very vegan friendly. I just had a bbq bacon cheeseburger tonight. The price seems a bit steep. The service is good and friendly, but there can be a long wait. It is not a good place for large groups because of the seating arrangements.
