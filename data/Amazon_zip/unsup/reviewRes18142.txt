Either this place has gotten better in the year since I've been or I finally just ordered the right thing. Previously I found dishes were too salty or, in the case of the cream sauces, a bit bland. I felt like Goldilocks ordering the Vitello Arrabiata--just right, with the light tomato sauce allowing the flavors of the white wine, jalapenos (with no seeds) and eggplant to shine through. My coworkers probably hate me now (*belch*) but i was completely satisfied. Ravenswood folks are lucky to have a BYO restaurant this reliable to walk to.
