convenient location, SUPER COMFY beds (better than the W Lakeshore), and nice river/city views. a little old and bathrooms need work. unfortunately it was really expensive when i stayed here in late october - about $210 before tax even with my corp discount. strangely, i stayed here in march a year and a half ago, and i got a much huger room for only $79 on priceline!
