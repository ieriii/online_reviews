There's more to Hispanic cuisine than Mexican food. Irazu's an oldie and goodie joint. The decor is down and dirty. The location is sketchy-chic. Parking is okay. The food does bring it. COSTA RICA! Must love bananas. The attitude is take it or leave it. Great place to bring a foodie but not a first date.
