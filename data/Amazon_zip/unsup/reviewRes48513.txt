The cow herding into pens....weird Food....pricey but good if you like offal-type dining Beer....selections are vast but also pricey Service.....knowledgeable staff on the menu and beer selections Seating......reminded me of Hofbrauhaus in Vegas with the dining hall seating but I'm still not sure why we sat between two couples when other seats were empty.  Bathroom - no sink inside. just a fountain of faucets just outside the individual bathrooms. A bit weird but sure make the people wash their hands afterwards. What really puts this restaurant at a 5 star caliber for me is that Paul Kahan (executive chef...watch Anthony Bourdain Chicago episode) is visibly working at the restaurant. The guy's got a Michlin star to his name and is still working! This is a true testament to his passion for cooking and his restaurants. This type of attention from the talented chef is what keeps the quality so high at Publican and I'm always willing to pay a bit more for quality. Mr. Kahan, I applaud you as I have seen first hand what happens to great restaurants when celebrity chefs become more celebrity than chef (see my Topolobampo review).
