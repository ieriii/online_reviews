Let's just start with there are a lot of Sushi places in Chicago now. The vast majority are terrible. When I see a place that is a combo of Sushi and other Asian food I follow the rule...NO SUSHI.  Wakamono falls into the acceptable but not great sushi houses. Nice looking resturaunt, great location, terrible parking, decent selection of saki. Highly recommend the tasting saki option as they give you great pours of solid saki. Sushi is solid, not my top tier locations but a solid nearby location that I do frequent fairly regularly. I have seen some poor reviews on service however I cannot state my service has ever been bad, not incredible but again solid. Kani Chung, Mexican, Godzilla, and Snow White are the best choices. Some interesting soy bean snacks are often provided. So if you are in the area and want a decent experience.... little loud but many of these sushi places are I would recommend this place. If you are looking for top tier Sushi I would recommend Sushi Wabi... rolls, Mirai sashimi, Tank interesting rolls, Sushi Loop....Hidden Gem.. best spicy Tuna in the city and you would never guess great Sushi, Bob San.... nice ambiance... solid sushi... Meiji High end excellent fish...limited selection but very good. All in different neighborhoods all very good. Tier 2... Coast but BYOB, Naniawa on Ohio...ugly but same owners as Bob San, Shine Lincoln Park, Sai Lincoln Park... better than Shine but Shine has plenty of food options for non-Sushi lovers.
