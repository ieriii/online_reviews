Bacon? Prosciutto? Bone Marrow? Deep Fried Everything? What a pleasure this place turned out to be. It's got an Avec vibe but in a bigger, wooden box and set to the soundtrack of some face-melting jams. There's so much going right about this place that this text box really can't contain it. My advice, try everything. If you don't have the budget? Try the chicken thighs, the mint dressing salad, and the deep-fried deviled egg. Oh and dessert, can't forget that. Try the olive oil soft serve paired with the brioche. Nicely diverse wine list, cheerful wait staff and (if you can handle it) communal seating. All hail the Pig.
