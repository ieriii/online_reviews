This place is the epitome of a perfect restaurant. The food is sourced from local farmers. The ingredients used in the food are of exceptional quality and prepared with high standards. The service is always punctual and friendly. The prices are excellent for the quality of food and service one receives. I love the quesadillas and soups. The only bad food experience I had was with the dumplings. I felt that the dumplings' dough was far too thick and tasted raw. The stuffing in the dumplings is so bland and boring that no dipping sauce could redeem them. The waitress very kindly exchanged it for me which I really appreciated. In addition, I did not like the coconut cake. It was so heavy in my stomach I felt pretty sick afterwards. It looks so soft and fluffy I thought it was be like sweet air but it tasted more like a sweet tub of margarine. My suggestion is to cull that coconut cake and replace it with a mixed berry tart (no cream) just a mix of seasonal berried in a nice pie crust sprinkled with some stevia or drizzled with a bit of honey. Thanks Chicago Diner!
