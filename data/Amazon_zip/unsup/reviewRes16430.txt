Let me start by saying I'd have given this a four-star review, but I'm docking India House one full star solely because of price. The food was absolutely delicious. They have a very extensive menu with both northern and southern Indian dishes. The food wasn't overly greasy like many American Indian restaurants are. The spice level in the food was enough to be flavorful and leave your mouth tingling for a few minutes, but not so hot that you couldn't enjoy your food. I think that this place is so expensive because they are paying such high rent to be in River North. I ordered the papdi chat, butter chicken, channa masala and aloo gobi plus and order of naan, and that ran me $66. All of the food was absolutely delicious and they were pretty generous size portions. Another annoyance is that India House doesn't do it's own delivery - they use an outside delivery company that charges $7 for delivery, plus automatic 10% gratuity on orders over $50. Fortunately I live close enough that I was able to go pick it up myself. I'd definitely go back, especially since there aren't too many other good options in this area for Indian food, but it's definitely expensive.
