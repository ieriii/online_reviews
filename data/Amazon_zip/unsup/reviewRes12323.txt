My mouth waters, thinking about the baked goat cheese appetizer. (Thanks to Scott for recommending it) Good thing there were four of us at dinner, or I would have been too full for the main course. I always get roast pork in Cuban places, so I had to try it here. I wish they gave plantains instead of yuca, but it was good, although a little dry. They used vinegar in the recipe, which I didn't think was typical, at least from other Cuban places I've been too, but I may be mistaken. Perhaps it's a nuevo Cuban touch.   The sangria was very good - not too sugary.  The wait was long, but the bar area was not crowded or too loud to have drinks and chat while waiting for the table. I don't remember anything exceptionally positive or negative about the service. Overall, it was only $30-$35/person including appetizers and sangria. However, the bar charged my bf twice for the pre-dinner drinks, which he didn't find out until it showed up on his credit card bill. Fortunately, he kept the receipt, and the restaurant kindly reversed the charge.
