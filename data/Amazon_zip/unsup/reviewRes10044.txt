The pizza's pretty good... Came here for Valentine's Day late dinner(wife had school, I had work) about 9pm and waited a half hour for a table, which was fine because there was a live "Dating Game" going on on-stage for our viewing entertainment.  Started with the warm spinach and tomato dip, which on the menu is described as having "shredded spinach and diced tomatoes in a mozzarella alfredo served with tortilla chips" It should have said "mozzarella alfredo sauce with a couple leaves of shredded spinach and one solid cherry tomato in the center served with ranch Doritos. For realsies. I love Doritos, I just wasn't expecting them to be served in a restaurant. I guess if graham elliot can get away with Cheez-its in risotto....Piece can serve Doritos. We both ordered our own small, hers with red sauce, spinach, tomato and artichoke, mine was plain with sausage,mushrooms and black olives. It comes on a full sheet pan with your condiments, oregano, red chili flakes, and parmesan.  As far as styles go, I guess plain is New Haven style, which since I've never been to New Haven before, I can't really compare it to anything, but it was a refreshing change of course. Tomato sauce, garlic and parmesan cheese versus tomato sauce and mozzarella on the red style. The pizzas came out piping hot, and we couldn't wait to get our hands on them!  The crusts cooked up chewy and crispy at the same time, it was like a culinary anomaly. My only minor complaint was that the center of the pizza's crust did not crisp up, so the first slice I picked up sagged, and all my toppings fell off that slice. Otherwise, the ingredients were fresh and the pizza was seasoned well. The only beer I tried, the Golden Arm, was very good, unfortunately, I didn't have the space to try the Cameltoe(half the fun is ordering it), or to get dessert.  Next time we visit, I'll be having a white pizza with Clams, the Cameltoe and the Carrot Cake. C u later!
