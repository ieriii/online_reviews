Many people will tell you Kuma's Corner has the best burger in Chicago. Whether or not Kuma's makes better burgers than Bad Apple is up for debate, but the Bad Apple trumps Kuma's in EVERY factor surrounding those burgers. Bad Apple is easier to get a table at, easier to get to, more spacious, better priced, and on top of all that... in my opinion, just a better burger. Comparisons to Kuma's aside, the plethora of seasonings available on the fries is awesome (Old Bay is my favorite, but skip the minced garlic). The burger recipes are all incredible as well (favorite so far is the Chupacabra). I'm working my way through the burger list and fry seasoning list with every new visit. Additionally, their beer menu (or more accurately, beer book) is extensive, impressive, and informative. I've lived in Chicago for six years now, and I can truthfully say this is my favorite eatery in the city.
