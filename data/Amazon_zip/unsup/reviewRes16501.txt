Great experience...eye popping decor, terrific food, attentive (maybe overly) staff and just plain fun.  Stuck with several rounds of appetizers and soup rather than entrees so we could enjoy more of the experience. Great guac, fun cheese & meat platter that was identical those those we enjoyed in BA...great corn soup...spicier than we had anticipated, but very flavorful. Empanada was good, not great. Pastry was a bit dry, beef inside had a great, mildly spicy flavor. Very good server...but as a Yelper mentioned earlier, the stakerazzi bus guy was way too eager to grab our plates.  Drinks & wine list were very good, lots of staff everywhere to help out.  Private rooms looked like great fun. Going back again soon.
