After hearing so much hype and wanting to go here forever, finally visited on a Monday evening. I was surpirsed at how packed it was for a Monday. It took a while for our waiter to come to us and as soon as she arrived, she apologized for being late and complained that one of her tables was being ridiculous and didn't know what they were doing. Here's a tip, never talk bad about your other customers, especially at a place as esteemed as Purple Pig. We ordered roasted bone marrow smear, fried chorizo stuffed olives, milk braised pork shoulder, octopus with salsa verde and potatoes.  Everything was pretty good. It was my first time trying bone marrow so I can't compare to other places, but the smear was pretty good. It wasn't offputting in any way, just tasted like extra oily butter. The bread that came with the smear was really good and they bring you more if you ask! The fried olives were good, the batter covered the olives consistently and had a nice crunch. The octopus was refreshing and didn't have that briny taste that you get if the seafood isn't cooked properly. There wasn't anything bad about the pork shoulder but there wasn't anything memorable. You can pass on this dish and it's difficult to share anyways because it is just one chunk of meat. Not sure how this fits in the menu as their philosophy seems to be more sharing style. Overall the food was pretty good, the service not so much. I don't know if we were biased because our waiter talked bad about one of her other tables but she just didn't check in on us, we had to wave down a different waiter for water and for our check. When she was present, she just wasn't very nice. Yeah, I get that you're super busy but so are most other restaurants in Chicago and they still manage to have good service.
