I read a lot of the yelp reviews before going here, and I was a little concerned by some of the negative comments. To be sure, Graham Elliot is not the kind of place you would go for a cheap bite to eat, but if you are willing to spend the money, it is absolutely worth it.  My wife and I went for our anniversary, and knew that it was going to be a splurge from the getgo. We opted for the 10 course experience, the choice I would recommend. We got a great taste of almost everything and my wife was able to substitute out the Bison for the pork belly. The portion sizes were small but considering there were 10 of them, leaving hungry at the end of the meal was not a problem.  Service was stellar! Our server was very knowledgeable on everything being served, and the host wished us a happy anniversary on the way out! It was a nice touch all around. Oh yeah, did I mention they were very willing to oblige my request to have a small "happy anniversary note" on the top of our menu. On the way, out, they gave us the menus to keep. In the end, it was not a cheap meal. I think a lot of the negative reviews came from those not willing to drop enough money for the true Graham Elliot experience. $300 is probably the base for what one should spend for two people here, and if you can't manage that, then your money may be better spent elsewhere. I'll admit, I spent more than I intended, but do not regret it in the least, though I might have to save for a few months before going back.
