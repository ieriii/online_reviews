I'm kind of embarrassed to say as a New Yorker that I've found my favorite pizza place in Chicago. Their crust is amazing. Caramelized chewy crust, beautifully cupping a sinkhole filled with sauce, cheese, and toppings. It's so flavorful. The appetizers were ordered were pretty forgettable - in fact, I don't even remember what we got. Just come here for the pizza. I came here with a group of more than 10 people and they were pretty accommodating. At first they tried to squish us into some tables put together, but then moved us upstairs where there was more space. Overall, the service was pretty good. So to sum up: good service, amazing pizza.
