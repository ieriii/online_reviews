We ate here for dinner on New Years Day. The food was very good but seating is very limited so be prepared either to wait, or to be seated cheek by jowl with strangers. The food was very good; I had the pan fried sea scallops with bacon, mushroom and sherry sauce, w/vegetables and red potatoes and I thought they were excellent (about $23). My partner had the shrimp po-boy sandwich which he enjoyed. Total bill came to $55 with tip. We skipped dessert (they were out of almost all the dessert offerings anyway). Also, rule of thumb, if the dessert isn't made on the premises, skip it. Would you buy an entree that was made somewhere else? The food is good here, but I don't like being sandwiched between a bunch of strangers at Glenn's prices. Oh, it's the European way you say? Well, that hasn't been my experience. Comparably priced restaurants in Europe are quite spacious actually.
