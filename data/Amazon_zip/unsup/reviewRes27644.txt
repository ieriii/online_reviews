This is place you come to when you want pizza. Why you ask? Because that's the business they are in. They make pizzas. Mozzy stix were great, Bruschetta was bangin', the pizza was amazing. Lou's still tops my list, but this is 2nd in the Deep Dish game. Kinda how Biggie is 2nd in the rap game in my eye. 1st being that playa Pac. I like the atmosphere too, was cozy to me for some reason. It's the type of place you can come to after you Graduate from The Art Institute in the year 2005, instead of going to Weber Grill. Not one slice of pizza was left, cuz we couldn't get enough of that sauce and crust. "Do you know how to make sauce" --C from Bronx Tale
