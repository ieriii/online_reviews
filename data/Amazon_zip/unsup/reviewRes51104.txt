This is a pretty good place to stop in for breakfast. I agree with the reviewer below saying why the hell it is so hard to find a good breakfast in Chicago? I wouldn't say this is the best place I've ever eaten, but it's definitely ok to stop in. My server was very nice and I recommend the breakfast burrito and the homestyle potatoes.
