The Chicago style deep dish is among the best in the city. The crust is dense and bready. The sauce is chunky and pleasantly sweet. Their pepperoni is spicy. The cheese thick and chewy. In addition, the pizza is available by the slice - and makes a satisfying, cheap lunch. One tip - when going for a slice - make sure its fresh. It is not as good after a while. Another thing - there is a difference between stuffed pizza and deep dish. Go for the stuffed. The deep dish is good - but the stuffed is the stuff. Art of Pizza's weakness is its thin crust is not not bad - but not great.
