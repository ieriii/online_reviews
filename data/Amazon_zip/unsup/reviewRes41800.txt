Been wanting to come here for some time now and we were not disappointed! My husband and I came here for a late Friday night dinner and the place had a very romantic vibe with minimal lighting and tables that were spaced out enough while still cozy. I appreciated the minimalist menu with quality items instead of an overwhelming offering of everything but the kitchen sink. We chose the cobia crudo (fresh, firm, and delicately seasoned to complement the refreshing taste of the fish), the mussels (very tasty sauce), the gnocchi with porkbelly and peas (our favorite dish), and bread with some roasted garlic and balsamic oil which was just ok. For dessert, we had the chocolate creme pie which would undoubtedly satisfy the whim of any chocolate lover and the best homemade mint chocolate chip ice cream I've ever had in my life. Service was attentive without being obtrusive and we cannot wait to return!
