Glenn's is great stuff. I can't say much that hasn't been said already. I'm right on the verge of giving it 5 stars, but I try to reserve that rare honor for places that are truly exceptional. Glenn's is almost there. I've been here a number of times. I've done breakfast, I've done lunch, and I've done dinner. Glenn's covers all the bases really well. The specialize in seafood and don't charge an arm and a leg for it. Especially if you can get there before 6PM during the week, they have a $13 seafood deal. Great price. Nice atmosphere, outdoor seating (we love to bring the dogs here), friendly staff, very generous portions and delicious flavorful food. Check them out and don't be surprised or turned off by the 'diner' billing. There is nothing dinerish about this place.  Make sure you get the potato pancakes as your side. Delicious! Oh and even if you don't want any of their very good deserts, Margies is right across the street. A perfect combo for a nice evening out.
