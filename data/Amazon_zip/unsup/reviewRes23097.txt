This restaurant is excellent. First, I love that they have free valet. That seems to be very rare in Chicago. Then, as soon as you enter the place, the decor of each of the rooms made me feel as if I am in a little Greek village. On top of this, the food is authentic and the service is great! We were seated in the main room, on the loft area. We had a nice view of the entire restaurant from where we sat and the crowd is a great mix of locals. But what impressed me was that a large part of the clientele are Greek. We heard them conversing in Greek and speaking to the waiters in Greek, so the staff is Greek. This is a big plus in my book as far as how good the food will be. We started with a couple of appetizers, the Flaming Saganaki Cheese and the Cold Plate Sampler. The cheese was delivered to the table on a small skillet, then flamed table side. It was very tasty.The Cold Plate is a must. It's a plate with samples of traditional spreads, delicious! For the main course, my mom had Shrimp Tourkolimano, and I had the Broiled Octopus. Both were very delicious and large. The octopus was tender with a great lemon flavor. I really love eating octopus, especially when done right. This restaurant cooked it to perfection. We ended our meal with Galaktoburiko, a lemon custard in Phyllo and a couple of Greek coffees. The desert was okay, but make sure to order the coffee. Its a great way to end the meal, and it doesn't have that bitter taste most espresso-like coffees have. The service was also very attentive, and what I love most was that they made sure to clean our table of crumbs before desert came. Didn't expect that from this place, so it went above and beyond. Excellent place, great food and experience-would definitely go again.
