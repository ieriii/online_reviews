Sometimes you just want to feel like an Art Deco era flapper girl - and when I have that feeling I go to the Green Mill. Right down the block from the Red Line stop, the flashing sign beckons you to come and bootleg some gin. Once inside the fabulous old-timey feel continues. They have a gorgeous dark wooden bar that's the size of Rhode Island and several comfy booths to lounge in and listen to some sweet jazz music. The only thing that stops me from coming here every night is my attempt not to become a raging alcoholic and the fact that they have a cover charge every night. Beside that, it's on my Top 5 list, which is fitting as it also had a cameo in "High Fidelity".
