I really liked this place, pizza is good and ambiance is great We went on a Saturday and it was pretty busy, so we had to wait a bit, but tables rotate pretty fast so I think we were seated within half an hour or so. We had appetizers and pizza and dessert and liquors. I shared the antipasto misto with BF and the cured meats were pretty good, but just cured meat after all. The sausage and mushroom pizza was really good, one of the best I ever tried and looked like everyone enjoyed it. For dessert I had a tartufo and washed it down with some grappa. Tartufo is a ball of chocolate mousse filled with zabaglione gelato and was really good. Grappa was good, but not exceptional, anyway the selection of liquors was pretty extensive so everyone can find something his/her favorite drink. The whole meal costed about $40 including tip per person, not super cheap but we had a lot of food and relatively expensive drinks. My favorite part was the experience. This place is not just about pizza, you can come here with friends have good pizza, drink and chat away the night with friends. And all at a moderate price if you are a bit careful. I wish there was something similar in Minneapolis....
