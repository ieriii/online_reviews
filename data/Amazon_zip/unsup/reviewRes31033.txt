This place is fantabulous! I have been passing by it at least once a week but always seemed I wouldn't be able to get a table w/out reservations. Finally went for it and I was right. You can't get a table right away w/out reservations BUT I (+2) sat by the bar which was more than fine be my. The food was so amazingly delicious! Appetizers: shrimp cocktail, oysters, snow crab claw and sauteed seas scallops. Salad: chopped salad (get this!) Steaks: bone-in filet (get this!) and NY Strip. Sides: Gorgonzola mac & cheese, lobster mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms (get this!) and Brussels sprouts. Dessert: Butter Cake Wine: friends got Earthquake Cab and loved it. My favorite part is probably the...whole thing! Service by Danielle was phenomenal! Super nice, the right amount of attentive and very knowledgeable!
