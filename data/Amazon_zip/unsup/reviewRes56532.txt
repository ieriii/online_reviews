We have eaten here several times. We always love it. If you want a table without waiting forever at the bar, you have to wait outside. I suggest showing up before 4:30 if the door opens at 5:00. You should really be there by 4:15. But, waiting at the bar isn't so bad if you don't have kids. The topolo margaritas are fabulous.I don't think you can go wrong with the menu. We always get the Sopes rancheras to start. Just get enough plates of these for your party. They go down like candy... candy with braised meat on it! I can't remember all the entrees we have had, but my favorite was definitely the roasted goat special that is served on Mondays or something. The steaks are also fantastic. Its not that the sear is special or the beef to die for--I couldn't tell because the seasoning was so bold. But my brother said his Asada Brava was the best steak he's ever had. The tacos al pastor would be a good safe bet.We have also been for brunch, which my wife and I loved. My mom wasn't so thrilled. She's not as adventurous, and the brunch menus is not just American dishes with chipotle on the side. Rick keeps to the traditional Mexican stuff, and the flavors are just as exciting as at dinner.If you can't handle the wait, go next door to Xoco. There is still a wait, but less, and the sandwiches are great. Once, we had sandwiches at Xoco, and then our table was ready at Frontera, so we sat down to margaritas and appetizers.
