Loud! This is southern cooking on acid without the colesterol problem. It's good old fashion home cooked food with a crazy bright environment painted in a New Orleans style. I met my brother and parents here for dinner. They didn't care for it because it was nothing special to them. For me it brought back memories of my grandmothers Alabama cookin'.
