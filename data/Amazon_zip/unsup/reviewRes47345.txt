Bravo, Lockdown. Bra. Vo. I'm excited when I can give a place 5-stars. And this place totally deserves it. I won't talk about the food just yet, which is divine. I want to address their hospitality.  My boyfriend and I decided to head over to Lockdown for burgers on Saturday night. What we didn't know was that Lockdown was totally reservation only on UFC fight nights, which the door man completely and carefully explained to us as if it was the only time he would have to deliver that speech that night. We were welcome to sit at the bar, though, but it was packed. We decided on taking our burgers home, because after all, that's all we'd really wanted. The door man flagged down the manager, who was equally as knowledgeable about the menu and patient with us, even though it was complete pandemonium on the floor. Nobody can say UKV doesn't love some UFC. The manager sent us to wait for our food with a few waters and we stood on the sidewalk wondering how we were going to carry the presumably large to go bag home while biking. A little while later, the door man got our attention and directed us to a table that had opened up on their patio. Excellent. We waited, and our food came out, still in To Go packaging. No problem.  We ate. And it was fabulous. Perfect hand cut fries, creamy-cheesy mac n cheese, The Death Sentence and the Lockdown Warden. A touch heavy on the pockets, so expect a $25 tab without drinks.  We had a totally take out meal at restaurant. To go containers and condiment packets. Sine we were seated after we ordered our food, we didn't have a server so there was no easy way to get the things we needed like silverware and mayo. Despite all that, I HAVE to give these guys 5 stars for trying their best accommodate us.
