(3.5) I went to the 3rd Coast last night for a quiet dinner, and I got it. It's pretty well hidden on a residential block, lower level. It has a diner feel, but a pretty good (and reasonable) beer/wine list. I was looking forward to seeing the featured artist's work, but there was nothing but blank walls with "more artwork up on Friday". I had the "Dutch club" and a Caesar salad with a Victory Golden Monkey followed by a Lagunitas Lil Sumpin Ale (on special)....my date had the cajun chicken penne with a house salad and a Metropolitain Krankshaft. The food was good. Nothing blew me away, though. The service was also "ok". I had to TRY to get my waitress' attention 3 times to get another beer and a water refill. The bus boys were good about taking plates but left the empty beer bottles(?) They played great music throughout my whole dinner, though I have to say. If it were in my neighborhood, I'd be there a lot more often. I think it is a nice little cafe type place......but not a "destination".
