Pequods pizza rocks but their customer service stinks! When you go there to eat, it takes FOREVER, and when you order, it's not much better. I've been waiting over 1:15 for my 1 pizza.....it's crazy! When I called to check on the pizza, the girl snapped at me on the phone. Whatever. I like the pizza a lot, but I'm going to rethink them next time I'm ordering.
