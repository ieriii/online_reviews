I've been going here since I was very little and the food has always been great. Best Pad Thai of them all for me. They are very consistent with the quality of food as well as service though out the years. The ambiance is also beautiful, relaxing and quiet even when it's full of people. They will always be a staple in my childhood, neighborhood, and life.
