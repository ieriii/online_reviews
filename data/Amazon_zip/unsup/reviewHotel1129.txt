Stayed here for a friend's wedding. The rooms were very nice and decent sized, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the location was excellent. The price was high, but I was able to walk or take public transportation anywhere I wanted or needed to go. As long as price is not an issue, I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a place to stay in the heart of Chicago.
