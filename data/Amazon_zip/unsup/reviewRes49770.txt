If you are looking for a great Latin feel yet a modern twist, head over to Las Tablas. They have real great food, a friendly wait staff and a great Latin representation. Great place to bring a date to considering the candle light. I've been frequenting this place ever since it was located next to the Golden Apple. I've loved it ever since.  Several times, I've been treated to live Latin music there. There used to be a huge wait when it was located on the east side of Lincoln but ever since they moved to the new location, wait hasn't been a huge issue. The chorizzo and chorascos there are SO delicious!  Make sure you call in reservations if you are visiting on a Friday or Saturday night.
