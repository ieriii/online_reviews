We got there on Thursday night at 7:00 PM and the line was just about to the door. We were able to order chips and salsa while we waited in line which got rid of the hunger pains. After a half hour we made it to the counter and ordered the Pepito torta (braised short rib) and the Chicken Pasole as well as the churros. Grabbed 2 beers and paid the $40 tab then headed to a table. 15 minutes later the food arrived and it was delicious. Menu is comprised of mostly tortas (sandwiches) and soups. All looked great but was hoping for some tacos as well.
