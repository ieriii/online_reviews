Le Colonial is one of few restaurants I know I can go grab a bite and will not be disappointed. I have been here so many times and have never had a bad meal-EVER. Bad service? Yes. Just bring the food and I'm fine. The restaurant is adorable and cozy. Almost too cozy; the tables are very close together. More than once has our neighbors conversations and/or "actions" made for an uncomfortable dinner. I think a lot of tourists have to be here bc it looks like many have come from a day of shopping in hoodies. I mean hoodies?? Pull it together. But the food is so delicious. 1) Sup Man Cua- soup with crab and asparagus. Get it!!!! 2) Goi Cuon- Basically spring rolls with shrimp. Very good. 3) Bahn Cuon- Vietnamese chicken ravioli with mushrooms. THE best item on the menu. So light, flavorful, unique. 4) Ca Song- Tuna Tartare- very, very good. 5) Goi Bun So- Scallop Salad- I can't even tell you how fresh and delicious this is. 6) Goi Atiso- Artichoke and Crab Salad. I can never decide between this and the Scallop salad. God they're both awesome. 7) Ca Nuong La Chuo- Trout with oyster mushrooms- fab-u-lous. 8) Ca Chien Saigon- Crisp Red Snapper- I'm drooling. 9) Bo Sate- Diced Filet- Better than it sounds on the menu. 10) Mien Xao- a side dish with noodles, crab and mushrooms. Throw in some Pinot Grigio and call it a day. 11) Com Chien- Chicken Fried Rice- Delicious. This place is worth a trip. Nothing like it in Chicago. The French-Vietnamese thing may have been attempted before, but no one does it like Le Colonial.
