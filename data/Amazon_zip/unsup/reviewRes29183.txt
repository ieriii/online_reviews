I used to think Opart was one of the better Thai places in the city. But now it's just hit or miss. Our delivery order came sans utensils, chili sauce, and the pad thai had no bean sprouts. I have to admit the pad thai, crab rangoon, and curry were still very good. I went again last night with some friends and the food was just ok. Nothing stood out and the pad kee mao was just plain bad. I absolutely hate how they charge for rice. Stick to the staples here and you should be ok, but there are just so many other Thai options that are consistently good.
