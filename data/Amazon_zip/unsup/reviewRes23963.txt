Good food... bad bad service. Ordered delivery and they said 40 minutes. Well it ended up taking an HOUR and 40 min. I had to call 3 times and each time the lady just said its coming, its coming, without even asking what order it was or my name?? The last phone call I told her she needed to call her driver and find out where he was because by now the food would be cold. She refused to call and gave me his cell phone number expecting me to call her driver!
