I'm relatively new to Chicago and always on the hunt for a good place to dine. I've had several people suggest Wildfire as a place worth checking out, and finally I did this week.  The place bills itself as a steakhouse, so if you do that in Chicago you better be able to hold your own against the stiff competition. On quality of food I'd have to say that Wildfire is no pushover. For our meal we had the Bone-in Filet Migon and the Lamb Porterhouse. Both of these selections were great. The chef cooked both to near perfection. While the food was definitely worth returning for, the ambience was more casual than I was anticipating, be prepared to talk loud because the energy of the place is more like upscale cafe dining, if there is such a thing. The food was matched by the excellent wait staff who were very responsive and attentive. Finally if the foregoing reasons for visiting are not enough and you are gluten intolerant or an Celiac then I highly recommend this place. Sure its easy for a steakhouse to accommodate a gluten-sensitive diet with its assortment of meat dishes, howeve to have them paired with a variety of savory side dishes...now that a feat worth mentioning and a place worth recommending to my fellow celiacs. P.S. They have toasted gluten-free bread...and it actually tastes good! Enjoy!
