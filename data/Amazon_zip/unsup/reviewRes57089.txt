meh-ybe if there was a place like the new places in wicker park that are out of place in logan square meh-king it even more out of place that would be awesome. there was so little of this place that felt like it was in place, of place, the stained glass windows towards the back were kind of awesome but then there was the rest of the place that just was not working all together. BEER: I tried the cross of gold on this my first visit. When do first impressions end and second thoughts begin? The beer was served in an interesting glass, had four or so hemispheric longitudinal protrusions. A wheaty and hoppy enough picture. This was described as a golden ale I believe. The place was crowded-ish. most of the space felt very designed for something, in the sense that there really didn't seem to be any good just-kind-of-hanging-out-and-having-a-couple-beers-when-there-are-no-seats-at-the-bar kind of area. even though there was an area that looks like it might be intended for that exact purpose (or was that a waiting area for people waiting for a table). Which brings me to the thought that revolution seems very geared towards being more like a restaurant than a bar. which is what it is. With this comes a whole different place than places that are bars that serve food. On this trip I did not try any food. Saw seitan on the menu which is interesting, the only other bar kind of place with food I had seen that at was Chill WInston in Vancouver. That place was sweet if only for the outdoor seating. Does Revolution have the potential for outdoor seating when the weather turns? sure didn't look like it. Will it make it? thats not my decision, my guess is meh-ybe. Feels a little to pretentious for logan square, but what do I know. Is this someones idea of a good time? so long as the beer flows who knows?
