We were there on a Thursday at 1pm and it was a 10 minute line--but when you get to the counter, Doug makes you feel like you're the only person in the joint. Great food, amazing prices--and Doug is just awesome--no wonder he's been featured on so many Food Channel/ Travel Channel shows. If we could eat here everyday we would! It's cash only--so bring the greens.
