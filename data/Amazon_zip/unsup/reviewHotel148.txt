I was kicked out of my condo one night (long story) and had to find a place in the city to stay, so I thought I'd treat myself to a four-star hotel. Despite my better judgment, I went to HotWire and selected a "blind" 4-star at $159/night in the Streeterville area, which turned out to be the Whitehall. As other reviewers have noted, this is a clean hotel with friendly service and I have no doubt that 70 years ago it was one of the top hotels in the city. Unfortunately it has remained largely in its original state. The beds are comfy, the pillows are fluffy, but the place is extremely out-dated; almost as if you'd walked into a time machine. The elevators are tiny, bordering on claustrophobic, and if more than two people are attempting a ride, they will all become much better acquainted than they might have liked. The hallways are equally confining; narrow, dark, a little depressing. The rooms aren't large, there's no wireless Internet, the lamps are original fixtures with unchanged (and probably untested) circuitry-- as confirmed by a quirky switch on one in my room, that refused to turn on without some coaxing. Similarly, the bathroom telephone had a poor connection. Worst of all, my room smelled of decades of cigarette smoke. Horrible. The decor is somewhat dreary, definitely not warm. All of these are symptoms of a hotel begging to be upgraded. On the plus side, the location is great, my room was quiet, the staff was friendly, and the price was right-- although next time, I'll select the hotel myself, pay the additional premium for the privilege, and enjoy it perhaps a little more. This is definitely not the place to stay if you want something light, modern, and cheerful.
