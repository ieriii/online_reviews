This is a great place for a date! I went here last night with my date, and we were both very pleased. For him, it was a bit of a trip down memory lane - he told me when he was in high school, he and his buddies used to go here so they could drink because they never got carded (Oops! Dont' fret, owners - this was a very long time ago!).  We opted to sit and the bar and try some appetizers. After much deliberation, we went with the Tirokafteri (feta cheese spread with red pepper), Pan Fried Calamari and Shrimp Tourkolimano. All 3 apps came to us in a very timely manner with good presentation on all. The Calamari only came with a small Solo cup of cocktail sauce which wasn't enough for the portion size. The tomato-garlic sauce on the shrimp was AMAZE! Both my date and I thought the shrimp shouldn't have had the tails on them, though. The sauce is dark, so you run the risk of biting into the shell - yuck! My personal favorite was the Tirokafteri, which neither my date not myself could pronounce! With the help of our entertaining bartender, we did learn by the end of the night (although I butchered the pronunciation - much to the enjoyment of my date and the bartender! haha!) The dish was creamy, spicy yet not over powering... mmmmm........ Service was attentive but not overpowering. We were well attended to, but weren't interrupted. I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic setting.
