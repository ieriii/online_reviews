Ha! You're kidding, right? Never had a better meal in six years I've lived in the city of Chicago. Pricey? Yeah. A little snobby? Sure. Will you see at least one guy being accompanied by a "professional" date? Probably. All that makes for good food and good fun. Been there more than ten times, and it's never disappointed me.
