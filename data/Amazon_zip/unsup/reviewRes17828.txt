The first trip here they were closed between lunch and dinner so we came back the next day on schedule. Very fancy looking, attentive staff and lots of seating. I waste no time at buffets so I let the waiter show us to the table, order drinks and quickly grab my personal belongings and march to the starting line. Plates! Where are the plates! Oh, there's a dispenser with a few laying on top. Skip the salad/veggies go straight to the rice. Hmm, why is the rice glistening? Is this traditional? Ok whatever, I'm asian I AM rice. It's curry time. The curry fiend I am I fill my plate with whatever grabs my attention. Hmm this spinach looks good, I'll eat it with my naan. Something else familiar appears, the chicken tikka masala but where are the chunks of chicken?! It looks like its all sauce! Who took all the chicken?! I grab the serving spoon, stir it up and sure enough the chunks resurface. Ok, plate looks nicely rounded and colorful. Oh wait I need some chutney, the spicey one so I can add heat to my bites as necessary. We sit and it bothers me there's no chicken tandoori in the buffet line. I think too soon. The happy/friendly waiter shows up no more than 30 seconds later with a sizzling cast iron plate with chicken tandoori on a bed of white onions accompanied with a basket of fresh, hot plain naan. Oh hot damn, I'm set! Everything tastes as expected, no surprises. This is one of the fancier Indian buffets I've been to which makes it a bit on the expensive side. I think it was $17 per person. The food was great but I don't think it should cost that much. The highlight was the chicken tandoori surprise appearance because I was getting worried..
