So my wife took me here for my birthday and I am/was simply WOWED! I had done my research first and wanted to recommend a nice romantic place for the two of us. Geja's supposedly one of the most understandably romantic restaurants in Chicago. The Fondu was Fontastic! Anyhow food was great. For App: we had a plate of 6 cheeses and a bottle of the house wine...extremely reasonable considering...cheeses were delicious! And we even talked about coming back simply for a cheese and wine outing sometime. For dinner, I ordered "the connoisseur" which translated into surf and turf. Pure awesomeness...the veggies were great...and we both loved the idea of cooking our own food in minutes. I think that is the primary reason it was such a neat place for us...the simple idea of a unique dining experience with a romantic atmosphere... That said, I would recommend bringing glow sticks or a phone with a good reading light because the menu is extremely difficult to read with the lighting. In addition, my wife freaks out about meat that is undercooked so when the waitress (who was extremely sweet) said, "chicken is about 3 minutes, steak is 2, shrimp and lobster 1, give or take" we kind of just looked at one another... the whole give or take comment meant add at least one minute to make sure...ease her mind more or less. But the experience was awesome nonetheless...I'm happy we did it...Looking forward to sharing another romantic evening for a possible special occasion.
