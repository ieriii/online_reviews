Do you like house music, IKEA furniture, eastern European waitresses with borderline-rude attitudes, AND breakfast food? Then Yolk is for you. Fortunately, all of the above jived with me as well. + Trendy atmosphere to remind you of the club you passed out in last night, while you eat your breakfast + Some great, hearty breakfast options like the "El Torero Scrambler" which is eggs, chorizo, avocado. Ask for the chipotle sauce that they have for another dish, good stuff. - The waitress was overly pushy when it came time for us to get our bill. I dunno if it was because we were finishing up at closing time, or she was having a bad day. Come here with your friends for some good breakfast food, even when it's in the afternoon. They have more options than Bongo Room and have *some* comparable options.
