This place is GREAT! We got there and were a bit unsure because we were told it would be an hour wait, but grant it , it was a Friday evening ... it's just that we were starving. However Sam, the bartender, made some kick-butt drinks that held us over nicely! :) The place is a bit loud but but the staff was very nice, personable and accommodating; the food was very very tasty considering we weren't sure what to expect and thought it would just be your standard "bar food"...so not the case. It was a friend's birthday, so they brought out this chocolate brown (so rich and delicious) topped with a coffee ice cream, my friend protested that she would not be eating the whole thing....until the first bite...next thing we knew it was the last bite. The drinks are super reasonably priced too! Can't wait to go back and experience it all again!
