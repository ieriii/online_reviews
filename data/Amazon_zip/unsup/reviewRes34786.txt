Went there with friends who live around the corner. We arrived about 6:30 on a Saturday. There was one other couple in the place. It's BYOB so, we bought in a couple bottles of wine. They had no ice in the house, so they could not chill our bottle of white. The water had no ice either so flat tap was all that was available. The menu is small as are the rolls. It seems kinda like the crap you get in a grocery deli. Miso soup was waaay too salty. The music was this cheesy techno pop shit. Not good for 6:30 on a Sat. They have battery operated fake candles on the table, how romantic. The bathroom was not clean. It's coed and has nowhere for a coat or purse to sit. I suspect it hadn't been mopped in a while. It has a dank dingy decor. I can't believe the rating most yelper's give it. It is the worst, I've had. Period I recommend going there just to see how bad it is. Un-fucking-believable.
