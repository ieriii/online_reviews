Irazu is amazing and represents what a great Chicago neighborhood restaurant ought to be. I took my mom here when she was visiting, and it was a wonderful experience. My mom ordered the veggie burrito with all the fixings and I got a steak sandwich with a side of plantains. I was also able to convince my mom to try the oatmeal shake, which I had wanted to sample for a while now. Talk about a simple but decadent dessert! Next time I will try mixing the oatmeal with one of their other flavors, because I will be back as soon as I get the chance!!
