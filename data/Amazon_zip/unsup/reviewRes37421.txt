Love Hopleaf... but go with friends. It's hard to meet people in this place. Even on Friday and Saturday night when the place is packed, it still has a 'dance with the one who brought you' feel. That said, it is a GREAT place to go with friends. Beware of the menu prices or you'll wind up ordering an $11 bottle of beer. Excellent selection of Belgians, if you're into them. Though I love Hopleaf, I would probably opt for the Map Room when it comes to best overall beer haven due to service alone. I've never experienced above average service from the place. The nicest staff are the doormen by far. (And they're actually pretty great.) 9/4/07 UPDATE: Not sure what I was on when I wrote the previous review. The Hopleaf is right around the corner from my house and stocked with some of the best beer on the planet. But I would still rather drive to Armitage and drink beer at the Map Room because the staff is so much nicer there. (Doormen aside. Hopleaf doormen are always very nice. Always!) I also had food at Hopleaf for the first time a month ago. They have skinny fries that look like they'd be delicious, but really they're hard and cold about a minute after they arrive. The onion rings or strings or whatever (I LOVE ONION RINGS) are gross... The side salad I ordered cost $5 and was smaller than my fist. I have friends who SWEAR by the food at Hopleaf... I just don't have the guts to spend more than $15 on an entre after such mediocre apps. Sorry, Hopleaf, I really WANT to love you.
