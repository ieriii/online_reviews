Used to like this place. Right now still waiting for my cold burger to come back after waiting an hour to get it in the first place. Several of the beers on tap weren't actually available. The food today seemed to lack the usual flavor and flair. I hope it was just a bad day, but I'm leaving pissed and not sure if I'll return again.
