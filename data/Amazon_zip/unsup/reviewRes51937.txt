If you like your deep dish pizza with lots of cheese and less sauce, then this is the place for you. We ordered the Gino's supreme deep dish with pepperoni and it took about 45 min, but we received it with sausage . Since we waited so long already, we decided to wait to get our correct order. He said it would be made quickly. It was out in about 20 min, I'm thinking they used a half bake and didn't cook it all the way, because I felt really sick and ended up having food poisoning.  It was decent, but I've had better pizza back at home in CA. Zachary's in Northern California has way better deep dish to me.
