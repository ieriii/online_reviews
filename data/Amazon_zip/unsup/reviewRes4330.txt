One of my favorite places for live music in Chicago is the Green Mill. Not only is it a historic entertainment venue but you just can't beat the ambiance and kindred souls you meet there. So last weekend I take my best buddy for her first experience. We're greeted at the door by a bouncer who tells us the cover charge and that there's no talking tonight because the "So and So" band is playing. I call them the "So and So"band because I can't remember the name and it certainly wasn't a big name jazz band. WHAT??? No talking???? At a jazz club??? Jazz music to me at least is a means to an end...to dance, to make love, to chat over cocktails in a smokey room. But oh, no....not this night when the so and so band was playing.........never mind that the drummer was reading music to play his little bit....let's not talk about the fact that everyone in the room looked so uptight and the tension was so high in the room you could cut it with a knife. Yeah, I guess if I was in a band that had previous gigs where people didn't pay attention to them while playing I'd probably request that the proprietor of the bar ask people not to talk!  When the music is good, you stop and listen because you want to. The jazz experience as we know it died at the Green Mill that night, for me at least...that's just not the way jazz was meant to be experienced. Boooooo Green Mill for enforcing a conversation block! I'll be back but hopefully you guys will have foregone this mood-killing directive.
