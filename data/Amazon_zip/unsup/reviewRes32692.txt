Overall not horrible, just not a fantastic experience. The place was really crowded for a Wednesday night which seemed pretty cool. We almost lost our reservation because of traffic, but luckily they were able to accommodate us a few minutes later. The service was really great, but the food/drinks lacked a bit. The drink I originally wanted was no longer being offered since they are changing the menu. I went with another that was pretty good. Everyone raved about the lemongrass beef lollipops. They weren't delicious. Almost reminded me of steak-ums wrapped on an onion. I do have to say that the sushi rolls were delicious. The dragon and dynamite were fantastic. The "mini cookies" dessert was good, but again not amazing. I just moved to Chicago and feel this is not the standard. There must be better places out there!
