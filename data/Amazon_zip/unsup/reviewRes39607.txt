You know what? This place was pretty damned good. The side dishes were tasty- spicy, pickled, sweet and sour- although I didn't know what 85% of them were. The meat was tasty, too- cooking it yourself was a lot of fun. But the service- oy vey. I ordered the marinated pork ribs. The waitress asked "Number 23?" I said yes. She brought me what I thought were ribs and I proceeded to cook them. Suddenly, she was over my shoulder and snatched my plate of raw meat from the table. "These aren't for you, these aren't your order!" Then she disappeared. My friend, Annie, and I stared at each other and tentatively began to eat the side dishes. Annie eyed her plate of meat and guarded it closely. The waitress reappeared with another plate and barked that THIS was my order. For real, lady? They lost some points for taking my freaking food away (I mean, really? Really.), and I sincerely hope they didn't serve it to someone else, but I would not be surprised if they did. And for that, methinks I shall not return.
