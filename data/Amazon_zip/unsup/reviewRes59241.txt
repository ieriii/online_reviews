started off nicely but ended terribly ;-( we got the right soup but menu didn't specify that it had the one ingredient we didn't want. we got another soup which was worse than the first soup and to top it off they won't take it off the bill. it only gets worse... the fillet of sole had a million eggs ....YUK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and we discovered this only because we "tried to communicate" to the innocent waitress to fillet the fish.  only after a few times did she understand what we were asking her to do. bad experience. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time at this place. You're better off going to TANK Noodle right around the corner.
