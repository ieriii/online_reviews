guests! bring your visitors and guests! or take them frozen with you when you travel! the others (gino's east, lou malnati's...) are great, but the convenience of all these locations make it easy to just pop in on a whim while out and about. it's all about expectation - if you're with the company of your friends who just want to try out a chicago pizza pie, relax...service isn't going to be stellar and you're going to have to wait. probably at any similar place, not just giordanos. good service, good vibes, just a good pizza place in general. make sure you head home soon after bc you'll be carrying leftovers.
