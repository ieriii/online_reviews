My boyfriend and I went here last night for our anniversary. I've never written a Yelp review before but this place was so good I was inspired. We had a Groupon for $30 off, but even without it I would go back for a special occasion since the quality of the food and the overall experience were worth the price. I'll admit my favorite food groups are cheese, chocolate, and fruit, so perhaps I'm a bit biased, but if you like fondue, I'd definitely recommend this place. We both ordered the beef and scallop combo, which came with a salad with a nice dressing, cheese fondue (with fresh fruit and bread), meat and veggies, chocolate fondue (includes flames at the beginning for roasting marshmallows for s'mores), and coffee. We also got a bottle of Geja's Chardonnay, which went really well with our meal. I only ate half of the salad to save room for the other three courses, but in the future I would only have a couple bites, since I was borderline uncomfortably full after finishing dessert. The quality of all the ingredients was top-notch, the service was excellent (fast, helpful, but not overbearing), the ambiance was romantic and cozy with pleasant music in the background and mood lighting (but not too dark in my opinion). I really enjoyed having 8 different dipping sauces with our main course. It was such fun to try out every conceivable combination of veggies/scallops/steak and sauce. Every bite was a delicious gustatory adventure. I'm glad we decided to go with a combo instead of just the cheese/chocolate deal, since the cheese was more of an appetizer and not really a main dinner course. They also had a Happy Anniversary card waiting on our table for us when we arrived. Such a sweet gesture. As other reviewers have noted, the place does have a slight aroma of oil when you first walk in, but we got used to it quickly and no longer noticed it or cared since the food and wine were so good. It's no wonder this restaurant has been around more than 40 years. Check it out!
