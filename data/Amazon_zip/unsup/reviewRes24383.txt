Who doesn't love dates wrapped in bacon? This Spanish tapas place on the second floor of the Blackstone hotel was a fun place to reconnect with my old college roommate. My only complaint: the noise level is deafening. My friend and I were 18 inches apart and had to lean close to hear each other. Not much fun when you're trying to talk. The service was great and it was packed on a Tuesday night at 7 pm. I recommend you order the meat or flatbread dishes, because the veggie options were boring (Catalan spinach and some cauliflower tapas were "meh.") Anything with chorizo - spicy sausage -- was great. Flatbread with shrimp and chorizo, and flatbread spare ribs with chorizo were delish. Don't skip dessert. We got some kind of chocolate mouse with ice cream that was so good, we ordered a second dessert -- milk chocolate croquettes. Without alcohol, but including tip, it came to $100.
