RUTH'S CHRIS' (All Scores Out Of 5) Food: ** Selection/Variety: *** Atmosphere: ***1/2 Presentation: **** Portion: **** Service: **** Price: ** OVERALL: **1/2. Well, let's start with the atmosphere. First off, it's kinda hard to find this place. The sign just kinda blends in with the city. But that's not supposed to count in these ratings. What does count is the inside. And really, it's your typical expensive restaurant in the city. Dim (extra dim, actually), and a bit crowded. We had our table next to the bathroom, which was ok by me, since the little hallway for the bathrooms shed some extra light on what we were eating. What gave this the extra 1/2 star was the sound of the food. Yes, I said SOUND. I'll explain it later, but the sizzling just makes you hungry and the scent of butter breaks the water main in your mouth. I was also pleased with the service. Once walking in, even though our whole party wasn't there, which some places are sticklers about, he gladly found someone to bring us to our table and seat us. Our server seemed to have a pretty good knowledge of the food there, and wasn't too shy about making recommendations. He was a fairly lively fellow and it was nice of him to take a picture of us...and with us. Maybe it was the persistance that he had or the sense of humor that he had, but whatever the case, when I think about my Ruth's Chris' experience, I can actually recall just a little bit about our server. For that to happen anywhere, means that he did something extra for us. Those were the key things that were above your average 3-star service. So he brings the menu. According to their menu, everything's the tenderest and juiciest. There's not too much for non-meat lovers, but if that's the case...then why did you come to Ruth's Chris'? It was hard to choose because the descriptions were a bit vague, but I went ahead with the Cowboy Ribeye. From what I know, ribeyes are fairly tender, but usually pretty juicy, and that's what I wanted. So...atmosphere's decent, service is good...now the food. About that SIZZLE...All steaks come on a hot plate that they claim was 300 degrees. Either way, the dish comes with a pool of butter sizzling around the steak. And believe me, that sizzle of butter and smell just makes you go nuts waiting for yours. It's my opinion that the steak is best at Medium Rare. Cooked, but JUICY! I HATE DRY MEAT! That's why I'm so racist against chickens. They're usually always dry, unless they've been drenched in oil for 24 hours...in which case I love chicken. Now, when you think about a plate delivered to you with a big hunk of meat served in a pool of butter....I've already got 15 different tastes going through my head. I was so excited when my sizzling plate had arrived. It was as the server said, a "Meat Popsicle." I don't know how to explain this part, but this is like finding gold. I've had "Medium Rare" in so many places, but never had I seen someone do medium rare so perfect. It was red in the middle, and it was like juice was suspended in air. It LOOKED fantastic! Imagine just cutting into a perfectly cooked medium rare ribeye. 20 ounces. The thickness of the meat and the feeling and the sound as your steak knife glides across the surface and a piece is headed toward your mouth for a sensory overload. Imagine biting into the soft juicy center of the piece in your mouth squirting juices while being chewed with the greatest of ease. This is textbook steak folks! A lot about enjoying steak is the quality of meat. And you better believe Ruth uses the best quality meat. A lot about enjoying steak is the quality of meat....but not ALL of it! This is where art comes in. Grilling a steak is purely technical. A robot would be able, if programmed correctly, to give me a perfectly cooked medium rare steak. An artist would know how to make that 20 ounces of pleasure be pleasurable for the whole 20 ounces. The first bite may have been good, but the rest of the flavor of my steak was a bore. I wanted a seared flavor. I want some salt on my steak. I want to be something in addition to the meat flavor. I almost was ready to ask for the A1...but I kept my manners. I did have some of the filet, which I really wanted to try, since that's what they're known for. That filet felt so good to chew on. Certainly no Kobe, but Kobe's a bit dry anyway. But it suffered the same problem as my Cowboy Ribeye...just meat. You know all that hype about the sizzling butter plates? Well, I hardly even tasted the butter. That made me real sad. Finally, we come to price. I had two 22 oz Fat Tire's, a Cowboy Ribeye, split some for sides, and my total came out to be $85 Running outta space..I don't like Ruth's Chris at all!
