This place is absolutely delicious! I happened upon this place for lunch with my boyfriend and wasn't sure about it (kind of weird neighborhood?) until I looked it up on Yelp and saw the great reviews of the food. There are a LOT of vegetarian options, and the meals are huge! I had the black bean cakes with the cheese grits (so good. so good.) and the sauteed spinach (nothing special). My boyfriend had the crab cakes, mac and cheese, and fries. Everything was delicious! And the cornbread is yummy too. Great service, and good prices! All around delicious comfort food.
