I haven't been here for dinner, only take out, but my experience was outstanding. We ordered the "empenada combo" and the mixed seafood salad. The flavors and textures of both dishes were exceptional. While I've had plenty of Columbian style empenadas, the grilled seafood salad was a knockout! The calamari was left almost whole, ensuring moist tender yummy meat. The salads that came with both were tasty and fresh. My honey and I can't wait to go back for dinner, this spot is BYO!
