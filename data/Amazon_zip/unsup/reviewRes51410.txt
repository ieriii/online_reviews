Garcia's burrito's have been a staple in my diet for over a decade. (Wow I'm getting old) Great food, good service, generous portions, and good drinks. For lunch, dinner, late-night munchies, whatever the case may be, you'll find something at Garcia's. Parking can be a pain during peak hours and you might have to wait for a table but it is well worth the wait. Some people may say that there are nicer looking places or restaurants that are more "authentic". However, pound for pound and more importantly, dollar for dollar, you won't do better. But don't take my word for it, my friends and I and our less than stellar physiques, will attest to it.
