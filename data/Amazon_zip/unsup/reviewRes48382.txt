Had the good fortune of eating here on a trip to the windy city. This place is a mecca for pork and served me one of the best brunches I've ever had. Maple braised pork belly, red wine poached eggs, great beer, outstanding service and some of the coolest "booths" or should I say "pens" (as in pig pens) to sit in. I would love to go here again someday, but Chicago is a ways a way..bummer.. It is a must try if you're in Chicago. A truly excellent experience. Go there...
