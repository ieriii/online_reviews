I don't tend to be much of a red meat eater, but I would go here just to eat their red meat. My husband ordered the steak medallion trio and it was amazing! Three beautiful 3-oz filet mignon medallions, and you can choose what you want them to be cooked / crusted with (i.e. mushrooms, parmesan, peppercorn, horseradish...)  I tried his mushroom and horseradish medallions and was ready to steal the rest off his plate while he wasn't looking.  I ordered the scallops, and expected to get maybe a few pieces, only to be charged an arm and a leg. But I got a generous serving of about 12-14 juicy, flavorful, nicely seared scallops on a bed of garlic spinach. The butter and oil on the plate were a tad heavy, as I was trying to stay somewhat healthy, but it was good nevertheless. I got the broccoli side order, and it was nicely cooked with herb butter. My husband's sweet potato side order was huge and delicious. My sister had requested her meat to be medium-rare, but it was more like medium-well.  The breads were great, service was decent, prices reasonable for the portions and quality (~$22-$29 a plate). LOVED the ambiance - wood panels, big fireplace, nice smokey (as in wood chips smokey) smell, and great black and white photos of people enjoying life and good wine adorned the walls. Very homey and classy at the same time. Will DEFINITELY come back here next time I'm in Chicago.
