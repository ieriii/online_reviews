Went there after meeting the owner at a River North event and was very impressed. First, the valet parking is easy, and there was a valet there waiting for a customer to pull up. Manager at the door greeting me (I was dining with a baby), and he made sure to place us in a spot with easy access where we would not be in anyone's way. Service was great, and no dirty looks from the staff (those with babies will know what I'm talking about) when we needed more napkins or apple juice. I ordered a Porterhouse, which was great. But order it less cooked then you would like. I like medium rare but ordered rare and it was perfect.I really like eating at a River North/Downtown restaurant with good food where I don't feel I overpaid, and this place fit the ticket.
