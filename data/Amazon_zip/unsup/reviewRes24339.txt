Had lunch here with a friend during the week. Only a few tables were occupied during our time there, and everyone seemed to be relaxing, taking their time. The service was friendly and professional. Our server recommended the $18 Catalan Express option that includes a fountain drink, first course, and second course so we went with that. The Ensalada Verde (mixed greens, asparagus, avocado, green beans, shaved mahon cheese) and Mixto Croquetas (serrano ham and chorizo croquettes with romesco) were our choices for course #1, and both were really tasty. I wouldn't mind having them again. For the second course, my friend chose the Mercat Burger (8oz black angus burger, padron peppers, red wine onion jam), and I ordered the steak which came atop shortrib and potato croquette and was topped with mushrooms. Both were good but unexceptional. The server was correct in stating that the plates are on the petite side and that, alone, one plate (with the exception of the burger) might not be a sufficient lunch. This held true for the steak dish. This might be a good option if you're looking for quiet, less crowded, leisurely lunch in the South Loop, but I feel there are restaurants that put out more delicious, remarkable food for less. I'd be interested to try dinner, but I don't feel the need to return for lunch.
