Yum! I went here for brunch with my girlfriends and their kids and we had a great time. There was a long wait, but once they saw that we had young babies with us, they treated us like we were family and sat us quickly. (Although, that was probably annoying for the others in line!) The food is great. They have a huge selection of breakfast and lunch options, so everyone in our big group was happy. They have quite a few health-ish options, too.
