Definitely not your average Irish pub. This is what I would call an upscale version of an Irish pub, but it's still unpretentious and approachable. It's a great place for after work/class on a weekday or for going out on the weekend. I met up with some friends here on a Saturday night, and we stayed in a cozy little booth the entire night. Drinks were reasonably priced, and the music was great. We were definitely feeling the DJ. Definitely would like to find a spot by the fireplace/library section next time.
