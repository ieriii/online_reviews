I love their empanada selection, they have so many different favors from pineapple, traditional, to black bean. You cannot go wrong with the Casado but everything is i great too. They have a great selection for veggie too. I usually get the potatoes tacos. I also really like the oatmeal milkshake too. I just wish the wait was shorter but it is worth it, plus it is so cheap for such a great meal.
