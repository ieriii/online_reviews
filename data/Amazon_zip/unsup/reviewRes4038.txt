Last Friday was my lucky day...I was invited as a last minute replacement for Rob L's and Katie and Dan's Schwa adventure. I had been looking forward to trying it forever. I love the space. It walks the fine line between home-y and restaurant beautifully. I was a little surprised by the decor at first, but as the meal started, I realized just how perfect it was for the space and the food.  Unlike some people, I loved the music...I admit, it was a little surprising at first, but again, it really added to the experience in a way. Everything really came together in the end. I wont go into too much detail about the food since everyone else is doing that but I was pleasantly surprised by a few dishes in particular. I was in love with our salad course (the Hendricks gin/cucumber/rose/ coriander jelly thing) I'm a big fan of textures/temperatures and I really thought this dish really worked. A lot of the textures were surprising (like the white chocolate chard) and I really enjoyed it. I also learned that I love brains...they are like the most perfectly poached egg yolk...when it hovers between solid and liquid. I'm not sure if its because I've been to a few restaurants of this type now, but I wasn't as wowed by the experience as my fellow diners. Everything was excellent, but something was missing for me and I cant quite put my finger on it. Maybe I'm just culinar-ily jaded. Also, while my pocketbook really loved the BYOB, I think i missed having professional wine service. And while all the chefs were very nice, I like a little more explanation with my food when I am unfamiliar with it...some of them were happy to oblige - others not so much (he said he didn't feel very talkative today). Overall, it was a wonderful experience...I think it is better for smaller groups rather than bigger ones and if i came back I'd come back in a 2 some not a 4 some.
