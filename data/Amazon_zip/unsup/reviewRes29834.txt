Yum! In town for business and a friend took me here as a dinner suggestion. It was awesome. Hopping on a Tuesday night - we ended up eating at the bar, however it would have been a 45 minute wait. Had the chicken mole enchiladas which were quite filling. They were no overly spicy, as the sauce was quite savory. Would definitely recommend to those staying in the area.
