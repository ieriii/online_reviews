i hadn't been to this place since 2002, when i last lived in chicago. i have been staying here now for 2 weeks. last night, i went for a late run on the beach followed by a swim. then i thought i'd go out for a coffee. i was on the northside, about to go to Kafein in evanston, when i reconsidered - perhaps i'd want an alcoholic drink. i wanted options. i wanted the 3rd coast. i texted a friend who lives in california now to get the location, since i had forgotten exactly where it was. on lake shore drive, a dashboard indicator light came on; i wouldn't be deterred. i arrive, there is open parking directly across the street, probably not a common occurrence. the proprietor was there, uncommon again, late as it was (about 11:30 pm), and she and i got to talking over wine - delicious, by the glass, her treat - again, probably not common, but who knows. now she and i are friends and i'm writing my first ever, and maybe last ever, yelp review. in 2002 this place remained open later, but it closes at 12 AM now. however, they were cool and kept the place open later for me as i went on to eat a piece of flourless choc. cake - wonderful. i remember the standard food being excellent also. the ambiance certainly is. as are the workers. and though i depart chicago tomorrow, when i return next, i plan to spend more time there. enjoy people, enjoy!
