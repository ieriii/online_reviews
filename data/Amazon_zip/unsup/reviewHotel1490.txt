Very disappointing price/value ratio. Have stayed at Westin River North numerous times and chose Omni expecting even greater luxury and service proportionate to the significantly higher cost. Room was nice but no more special. Internet access was additional $10 per day. We requested a room with a view which they honored but the windows were high on the wall and the view was, well, Michigan Avenue. Business Center computers were $16 per 15 minutes. Staff was very professional and bar was nice. But overall we didn't have the 4-diamond experience we expected. We will return next time to the Westin and know that we will have a very luxurious stay. And our view will likely be over the river, Michigan Avenue and Chicago City Center. Always fascinating.
