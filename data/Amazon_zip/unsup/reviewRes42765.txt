I have been meaning to order Fogo for months, but because I live outside of the delivery zone, the drive for pickup has always been prohibitive. But, last weekend a perfect opportunity arose when I was hanging out with some friends who live in Fogo's neighborhood. Fogo was well worth the wait, and my friends and I enjoyed every last slice of our two extra-large pizzas! I had the 6 Quejos pizza. Each element of the pizza was perfectly prepared, and tasted amazing! Because these are Brazilian pizzas they are a little more exotic, but in a good way.  I LOVED Fogo, and hope to have it again soon! :)
