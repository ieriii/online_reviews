Mercat is phenomenal. To die for really, but not really because in reality if someone told me I'd have to die in order to eat at a place, I probably wouldn't go there. That's just bad for business. But! This restaurant is incredible. It opened back in March 08, I've been there twice and I haven't had a bad...or even mediocre...plate yet. It's my favorite place in Chicago to go. The menu is tapas and small bites, done so so well. The chef does a great job of pairing a variety of flavors and textures, which makes everything really enjoyable. Some items I'd suggest: bacon wrapped dates, baby squid and angel hair pasta, shellfish croquettes, beef short-rib flatbread, jamon serrano, any of the cheese plates, the catalan sausage...ahh, everything is DELICIOUS! Great atmosphere too, the space is really open and contemporary. Lots of activity depending on the night you go...and the wait staff is on top of things. Really attentive and friendly. I would definitely go back and you should go too!
