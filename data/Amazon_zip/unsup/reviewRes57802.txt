I had to sign up on yelp to write this review for Nana... I am in love with this place, food and family. It is great from the moment you walk in. Sorry for those who had a bad experience waiting for good food. The place is beautiful. Food is excellent. My server was awesome. Thanks for opening up a great tasting organic restaurant... Can someone say Chilaquiles!!!! yummo
