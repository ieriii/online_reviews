I have heard nothing but great reviews about XOCO and I have been dying to try it for awhile now. Maybe it was just what I ordered, but I must say I was pretty disappointed in my meal. I ordered the Chicken Tinga Torta and my girlfriend ordered the Cubana Torta. (Both splitting 1/2 of each) I would suggest overlooking the Chicken Tinga when ordering since it was pretty bad. The Cubana was alright but not as good as something I would expect from a place surround by so much hype. I did like their chips and guacamole but they were a pretty small order for costing $7. I do want to give XOCO a second chance, preferably on a Wednesday so I can try the Pork Belly Special.
