I dunno... I just am having a hard time with this place. I had a good time and spent more money than I wanted to. Longman and Eagle is in the space once occupied by The Winds Cafe... which was terrible. But, The Winds kept the neighborhood pegged as a place Lincoln Parkers wouldn't come to. when I arrived, blonde girls with heels were getting out of cabs complaining that they were cold. Cabs are very un-Logan Square. I hope they were just there because they read about it on Metromix. This place will be wildly popular while not being "the best" at anything. For example-- the Kobe burger? Delicious but not a Kuma's burger. The cocktails? Wonderful, but not as good as The Whistlers. The Beef fat fries? Superb, but not as tasty as Hot Doug's Duck fat fries. Get my drift? One more gripe-- the lights are super dim, which is great for ambiance. However, their menu is in about 8pt font and on a natural tone paper, making it nearly impossible to read. I looked around the room and everyone was holding their menus to the candle light and squinting to read. That said, it's nice to have a classy joint in the neighborhood with good food and tasty drinks. I just hope it doesn't come with a side of douchebag. I was just starting to like this neighborhood.
