UNLIMITED MEAT! is always a good thing...... I went to Brazzaz with my wife for two reasons. 1. Ozzie Guillen holding a stick of meat in ads for this joint..three years ago....and 2. Restaurant Week. We were able to have the $48 dinner package for $32 each. My wife was a bit hesitant, as she didnt know if they would have stuff for her(she's not a fan of red meat or pork.) Luckily, they gave her so much shrimp, Forest Gump would be proud. And she loved the chicken legs. ME? I loved the endless array of grilled meat. Wasnt a huge fan of the lamb, but thier beef options were insane. Sadly, i didnt try the pork(they never got to me) or the shrimp(allergies), but they looke dgood. We only had to request a certain menu item once, as they were pretty good with walking around and making sure we were stuffed. I'm coming back. p.s. the Salad bar is of fthe hook. I only went once, as I wanted lots of grilled meat. Ozzie? good call....idiot
