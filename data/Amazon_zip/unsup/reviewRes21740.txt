I love this place. Go off hours to avoid the lines. A hour before closing is perfect. I won't waste your time talking about the food. It's awesome and while not super cheap, it is a super value for the quality.Some of the rustic items are impossible to find anywhere else. We all agreed the Barcelona style (super thick!) hot chocolate was the best.
