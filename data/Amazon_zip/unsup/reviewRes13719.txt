I used to consider Glenn's a solid four stars. However, a few things have tarnished my image of Glenn's over the past year. First, the waitstaff tend to be either very good or bad (bordering on rude.) This is unacceptable. Mgmt should really work on having all staff be friendly. Second, if you order food for pick-up, staff act offended if you do not tip them for simply handing you the bag and taking your $$ (this has happened twice and it is annoying.) Finally, I do not like the need to have to make a reservation to come here. While I am happy for them that business is good, it ruins both the diner feel and the neighborhood feel of the restaurant. While I think the food here is good, I am shying away from Glenn's for these reasons. It is just not much fun to go here anymore and I had been a frequent customer since Glenn's first opened. Unfortunate.
