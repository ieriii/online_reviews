I recently came to The Purple Pig with Carlos, who is a big lover of Pork. It was a cold Saturday night, but it was worth it. It was around 6:35pm when we got there (FYI: Call to make reservations), it was extremely packed and it was an hour wait. Luckily for us the waitress gave us seats because it was only two of us (BTW the seating there is a family style sitting, which means you get to sit next to strangers). So we started off with a smear which was Bone Marrow braised in Rosemary...OMG! It was amazing that was $6. After that we got the famous Pork ear and Fried egg, which was also good and that was $8. We also had Jamon Serrano braised in duck sauce and it was delish that was $8. Finally we had dessert, which was awesome. We had the sillican Irish and it was great, that was $6. Our total bill was $32. 90 and it was worth each penny. I will definitely go there again. I enjoy everything I had and want to try more of there smears. I really recommend this place if you enjoy and love pork. YUMMY, YUMMY!
