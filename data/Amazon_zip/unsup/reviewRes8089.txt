I went with a large group for a combined birthday / bachelor party. Our table was a bit unruly, but the staff didn't bat an eyelash. We went for the $125 all-you-can-eat-and-drink package. I'm probably too small to get my money's worth, but I tried (and impressed one drunken stranger with how much I could put away) and maximized my appetite by skipping lunch. Awesome: Caipirinhas, Lamb chops, bacon-wrapped lamb. I did not like lamb until I ate here. Now I even make it at home. Awesomest: servers running around with meat on huge forks, and a downward-pointing machete gripped high in the hand that holds up the meat.
