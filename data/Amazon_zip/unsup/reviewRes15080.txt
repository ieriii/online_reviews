HOUSE RULES: No cell phone use inside Proper attire requested No baseball hats No reservations... Don't bring anyone that you wouldn't bring to your mother's house for sunday dinner We made an impromptu visit on a Thursday night through a door camouflaged within a graffiti'd wall. The "waiting area" was a dim corridor to a dark. heavy curtain. For the next fifteen to twenty minutes, we stood there waiting for confirmation of our exisitence. Oh, the anticipation! We finally made it through and it seemed as if I'd entered into a secret society of fabulous cocktail sippers. The high-back chairs created an intimate space for two. I felt as if I had to walk around with my hands stretched out and once seated, the menu was only semi-visible by candlelight. My Spring Negroni was everything that I'd imagined a superb cocktail would be: beautiful, strong, delicate, and complex. After a few sips I already felt the twinge of incapacitation. My ridiculous low tolerance prevents me from a full appreciation of the cocktail experience, but for Violet Hour, I'd gladly make that exception.
