I hesitated to write this since I know Spacca Napoli is everyone's favorite. And, I actually love their pizza and sides. However, I had a weird experience that I have to share because that's what Yelp is for, right? Early on, I was having dinner with Wilma. We ordered our pizza. You know, they pride themselves on serving uncut pizza so diners can cut their own. The place was really bizzy. The table next to us received their pizza and the woman cut it into slices before she realized that it wasn't what she had ordered. You can see it coming, can't you. The server took it back t the kitchen and a few minutes later, that very same cut pizza arrived at my table and placed before me. I complained to the server and then to the owner. His response was kind of like, oh well, no sorry, no attempt to make things better. He didn't take it back, he just left it their for me to eat. It was a big turnoff. Just wanted to share. I actually hate to be so negative. It isn't my style. I wish them well. But, geeeeez, it was really disgusting and need-less-to-say, I won't be back. Which is really too bad because I like the pizza but I don't trust them.
