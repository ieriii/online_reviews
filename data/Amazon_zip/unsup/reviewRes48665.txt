This meets all the marks for a Chicago foodie - which can be a very tricky thing to achieve. And this is perhaps mostly because it is not pretentious, it's food at face value. -Sunday is an excellent time to visit, we arrived before they opened and they still allowed us to sit, we didn't end up leaving for a good four hours. -Sunday is a prefix menu not the standard weekday menu, which could be something to keep in mind... -Leaving all of my drink selections up to our server was the best thing I could have done, it introduced me to things I would not have naturally gone for.
