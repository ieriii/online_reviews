I work in the neighborhood and noticed this place had just opened. For Ukrainian Village it is definitely different. Most of the bars close by are dives with low grade bar food. This place has a hard rock/prison theme to it, and it looks like they put a ton of time and effort to make it look the part.The beer list is huge. They have a great selection. I also tried one of their burgers (it had prosciutto and apple slices,very unusual). This thing was huge, juicy, messy, and great. They also have wall to wall plasma screens playing a live concert. There was a schedule with that shows are on what days so I think I'll be back to watch Peal Jam and try another burger.This is a great addition to the neighborhood.
