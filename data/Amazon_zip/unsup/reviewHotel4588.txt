I read all the reviews and thought, "hey, I'm a New Yorker, it can't be THAT small" but it was. Also the front desk staff on check-in (after our 13+hour drive from NY) were so completely rude and un-welcoming. We entered our room to find the TV on and no remote at all to turn it off. I found random hairs on the white bed cover and the q-tip package in the bathroom was open. Weird. Seemed like someone was hangin' in there before we got in. We ordered a new remote sent up and it came quickly, all the other staff was so, so friendly including the valet. But the ridiculous room size (only stay here alone, not with someone, no matter how much you love them!) makes this place a total rip-off. The h20 products are nice but there is no space in the rest room for a lady to put out her "stuff" without knocking a toothbrush into the trash.
