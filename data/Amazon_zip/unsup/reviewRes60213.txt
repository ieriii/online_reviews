The granola is the only thing this place has going for itself. The hot food is pre-made and heated up, the staff is rude, and the atmosphere is chaotic. Everything that makes a good brunch--a nice conversation with my friends, a mimosa, some good food...this place lacks. With so many GREAT brunch places in the area, there's really no need to brave this place.
