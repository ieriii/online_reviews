Guess it must be the Western sounding cool name, the big corner location on Broadway and the safety in numbers that brings in the big crowds and lines at this place. Whilst the food is not bad, there are better places on Argyle (see Hai Yen and Viet Nam). I had the Bun bo Hue which was light on the lemongrass and spice. Good service.
