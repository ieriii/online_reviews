I didn't love what I got the one time I went here, but it is definitely a great place, with lots of good vegan food. If you're like me and you want to compare buffalo wings to those at Food Swings in Brooklyn, don't bother. Chicago Diner's buffalo wings are terrible in comparison. No offense, I just think they're bad. Don't let that deter you, though.
