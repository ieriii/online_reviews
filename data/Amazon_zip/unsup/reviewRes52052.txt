Went to Gino's after trying Lou Malnatis in my quest to find the best Chicago Pizza! Got the sausage pie(crumbled). Great service, pizza came out quicker than expected (it was a really slow night). Also got a nice cheap bottle of Mondavi Merlot to whet the palate. I really liked this pizza. WAY more "saucy" then the Malnati's pie, it had a nice acidic bite to it. Also "cheesier" as well, but laking in the quantity of sausage. If I could have one slice of this pie and one slice of the Malnati's Delux pie together on the same plate, and kind of make a "pizza scramble" of the two, I think my brain would explode in extacy. But if push came to shove and I have to choose one, I think I'd go with Gino's. I will dream about this pizza!
