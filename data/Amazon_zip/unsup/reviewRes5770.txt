Owners of DE also own the famous and popular Francesca's around the city. But, DE is nothing like the well-loved italiano resto. It's tapas italiano style. Yum. Such a quaint space with a longish bar area and high cocktail tables set next to the almost floor to ceiling doors that open out to the sidewalk. Definitely nice during our beautiful, though short-lived weather we have in Chi-town. Like rooftops? They got one though the view isn't it's big selling point. Now, on to the good stuff. The plates at DE are oh-so-delish. I have to resist from getting one of everything! Their perfectly grilled octopus (polpo con rafano) is paired with this bed of marcona almonds, finnochiona, fingerling potato salad with horseradish aioli. Nice departure from the usual stand-alone octopus. The pizze is basically super thin crust pizza that can be a bit salty and a tad thin and saugy, but has a good balance of ingredients overall and is flavorful. You must get the pizza della terra - mushroom, braised leeks, taleggio, topped with truffle oil. The DE bruschette is tasty too - thick italian bread slices topped with pork, arugula, and burrata. The toppings change daily so you might be pleasantly surprised with some other tasty bruschette. Keeps things exciting. Specials are a plenty at DE that I really need to take advantage of more! And you too could get 3 formaggi/salumi for $12, burger and a Peroni, or pasta, salad, and bottle of wine for a super dealio $$! I usually dine at the grandpa hour here because it can get pretty busy here otherwise. That sometimes has its downsides because getting service started once you're seated could be slower. But, overall everyone is usually pretty friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable about the menu. In fact, you can tell they like DE as much as the regulars do! Always a plus. Valet is the way to go if you drive here because parking is limited to the metered kind on Taylor St.
