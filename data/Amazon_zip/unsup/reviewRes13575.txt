Glenn's = Good. Thus far, I have only been to Glenn's for breakfast/brunch so far, but I am looking forward to trying their seafood options for dinner (Tilapia, King Crab...). Back to breakfast. I have had the Glenn's Dad's French Toast and the Corned Beef Hash. Both were very tasty. The coffee is also very good as well. Both times I've sat at the counter and the service has been great. My only complaint about Glenn's is there isn't really any space to wait for seating. In the summer or if the weather is acceptable, waiting outside isn't a big deal. In the winter or rain, it sucks. Other than this minor point, I love Glenn's!
