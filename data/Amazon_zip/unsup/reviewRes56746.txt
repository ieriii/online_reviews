the food here is awful. i would never go back, even if living social offered be another voucher for 5 bucks for 30 dollars worth of food. 30 dollars only feeds one person at this pricey restaurant.the stuffed chicken was bland, no flavor, needed salt, the lasanga was more romanian than italian, the best thing was the chocolate ganache cake with red raspberry sauce. the service was fair and freindly. in the end you don't save any money on these restaurant deals unless you go by yourself. i don't think you should have to tip (18%) on the total meal before voucher because that is why you buy the deal in the first place. too save a little money.
