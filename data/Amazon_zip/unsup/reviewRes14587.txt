If this is the revolution, than we're all in trouble. I tried. I really did. I've gone over the months, several times and really tried to cozy up to such a cool spot in my neighborhood. Alas, revolution, I'm just not that into you. It's big, noisy and lacks the aesthetic of a space with a red fist as its logo. First downfall. Second, as a vegetarian I've tried several options. Polenta finger appetizer-mushy and flavourless. Quinoa and lentil dish should be a win, but low on veggies and flavor as well. The veggie pizza with fake seitan is a solid pub grub choice. Third, beer. The mainstays on the menu (especially the lighter beers) are not my favorites, but some of the rotating ales do a fantastic job. However the level of predictability is not worth placing bets on. Like voting for change in a presidential election, it's worth getting out, just don't get your hopes too high.
