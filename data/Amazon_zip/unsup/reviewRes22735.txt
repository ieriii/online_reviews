Having just moved back to Chicago from Louisiana I had grown accustomed to the "drive-in" concept which seems to have been lost for the most part up north. But even places such as Sonic have lost some of the classic touches. Along with Carhops delivering your food on trays that will sit nicely on your window, the food is phenominal. The fries are thicker cut and salted with what I believe was celery salt. You receive plenty of fix-ins for your "Superdawg" or "Whoopercheesie," some of the goofy names they give their items. As well, if you are a fan of malts, they have malts so thick you can barely stick a straw in it. Overall a wonderful experience for just going to eat drive-in food.
