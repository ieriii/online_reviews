I remember when Wilde opened in Lakeview close to 2 years ago with lots of pomp and fanfare. I recall the stories of people being excited about the place, but sorely disappointed about how Wilde just didn't know what it wanted to be. That probably prevented me from coming here even though it's in close proximity. I ended here on the eve of one of the last days of 2009 and I'm glad I finally graced their halls. I could see how people may be frustrated with Wilde's identity crisis, but it made me love the place more - 2 bars complete with barstools? Check. Booth seating? Check. Fireplace? Check! Little tables with easy chairs? Check! Wilde aims to be a jack of all trades, and who couldn't love that how it welcomes any and all. My party of three had the mac and cheese (yummy! Loved the crunchy topping), curry chips (Which were really fries, not chips and Omg! Best I've ever had, and I've had alot!), a beet salad (wonderful!), and the Arugula and grape tomato salad sans egg (Loved it!). We wanted to top off our dinner with the Oscar and Bosie's Blackberry Storm - it came with Honey Lavender Ice cream (so yummy!!!!!!!!), but they were out. (sad face). But we settled for the apple crumble, which really wasn't settling since it was great! I really like this place, it has a down home, relaxing feel. And I'm still thinking about those curry fries!
