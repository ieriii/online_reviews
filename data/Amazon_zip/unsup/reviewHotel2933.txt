My husband and I treated my brother and his new bride to a weekend in Chicago and chose to stay at this hotel. It was an excellent decision. From the time of making the reservation to departing from the hotel we were very pleased. The hotel staff was accomodating in providing corner rooms that were adjacent to each other - both had reasonably nice views. The only complaint about the rooms would be that it was difficult to control the temperature gauge - we were either very cold, or warm. Otherwise the rooms were comfortable and clean. Guest Services was very helpful in arranging dinner reservations, and providing directions to the restaurant for Saturday night. We had Sunday breakfast in Shula's, and that was an EXCELLENT meal. Bottom-line: I would (and have) recommend this hotel to any who are looking for a reasonably priced and very comfortable stay, in Chicago. Bottom
