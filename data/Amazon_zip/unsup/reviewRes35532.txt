Peking duck. Nuff said. Since my trip to Hong Kong, my palate continuously has a craving for a taste of the East that usually goes unsatisfied. After finally discovering Sun-Wah, I know I can't give up on my quest. While not a perfect 10/10, this place SCREAMS an authentic chinese dining experience. Large noisy crowds, somewhat tight eating quarters, and tasty food. Obviously you are going to get the duck, but I would also try some other things on the menu. The vegatable dishes are on par with what I was accustomed to across the Pacific, and the other bbq menu items were better than what I have in Chinatown. The duck is awesome (just be sure you aren't on a diet). They leave juicy pieces of fat and skin on the meat slices, which go well with the freshly steamed gua bao (love the bread) and condiments. Be sure to go with at least 2 others, as the duck can get salty after awhile but can be avoided if you have enough mouths. Try to be one of those that claim one of the leg pieces. The duck fried rice and duck soup is pretty good too, not nothing to drool over but a nice schtick for a duck-based meal. If they give you the choice between rice and noodles, go with the rice unless you want salt-induced high blood pressure from duck noodles. 4 stars because the noisy crowded atmosphere reminds me of HK, 3.5 based on food alone. Also, there always seems to be a group of white ppl that order the suckling pig (go big or go home?) every night. Props to them.
