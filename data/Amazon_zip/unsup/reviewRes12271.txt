I have nothing but praise for Piece. Their beer is terrific, especially the Golden Arm, while their pizza is the best I've ever had. The Sunday night special is their strongest offering (large pizza and growler of beer for $25), and for the record I consider PieceOut to be Piece, nonetheless. Of course, as with all establishments in Wicker Park/Bucktown, it's busy. So, if you want to go in for a quiet slice and pint, go to Santullo's. Piece is worth their prices and an exciting event, whether ordering our or braving it in. Highest praise!
