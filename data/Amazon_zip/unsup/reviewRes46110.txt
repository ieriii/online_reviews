Grand Lux is my go to lunch hot spot. I love all of their dishes and am never disappointed. They not only have sandwiches and other lunch favorites, they serve dinner entrees in lunch portions.  Grand Lux does not take reservations, which sometimes can be a pain. However, it is one of the biggest restaurants downtown and the wait is never too long. Also, make sure to try their deserts. The chocolate cookies and beignets are to-die-for. Make sure to order them at the beginning of your meal as they are freshly made.
