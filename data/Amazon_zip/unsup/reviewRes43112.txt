stuffed or thin...you can't go wrong with the art of pizza. it was one of my first loves when i moved here nearly five years ago.  i fell hard for the thin sausage, onion, green pepper and mushroom and later lusted after the stuffed spinach. good for your figure? hell no. good for your taste buds? better believe it.  yummmmmmm and they deliver :)
