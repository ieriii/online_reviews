Their pizza by the slice isn't the best but it will sure do when you don't feel like waiting 40 minutes at Gino's East! The pizza was good, the sauce was very delicious and seasoned well. I also ordered the mostaccioli dinner and that did take a while but we had the pizza to eat before then so the wait was tolerable. They brought us out soup and salad before the mastaccioli and my friend said the soup was pretty good. The salad I can't complain about, nothing special. I must say though that their dinner specials are a darn good deal. You get a lot of good food for your money. The mastaciolli was hot and fresh out of the oven. The cheese was mmm delicious and seemed like it was of great quality. I wish I could have gone back again before leaving Illinois.
