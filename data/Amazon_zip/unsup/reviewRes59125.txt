So I went to Yolk for breakfast had steak n eggs n pancakes the food was great once again the service was horrible I waited about 15minsthe to get a refill of coffee once my waitress decided to give me more coffee I told her, I was about to reach over n serve myself more coffee being that you took a long time to give more coffee. I sat at the bar area that's the reason I could've reached over for some coffee but I didn't do it. I don't think ill go there again first impression is the last impression wit me good job Natasha, so never again.
