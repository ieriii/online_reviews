My party of four enjoyed a special (ehhem.. pricey) dinner here last night.  We started out with fancy drinks at the bar - I ordered a strawberry gimlet with pureed berries and a basil leaf. The $14 price tag pained me, but it was good.  I really liked the dining room. It was much smaller and more intimate than I would have thought (a good thing.) and service was fantastic throughout the whole meal. Everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome and taken care of, and I always appreciate that.  We all ordered the "Ruth's Classics" meals, which come with a starter, an entree, a personal side and dessert. I was the only one who strayed from a steak, and I went with the 'fresh fish' entree (salmon + tiny scallops + veggies). My starter was lobster bisque, my side was garlic mashed potatoes, and the non-optional dessert was a cute little chocolate cheesecake served with fresh berries.  The soup was amazing..... probably the best lobby bisque I've ever had. It wasn't super heavy, and it had a lot of meat in it. Scrumptious.  The salmon was cooked perfectly. I did think there was too much butter/liquid in the bottom of the plate - everything was swimming in it, and at points I got way too buttery bites. The scallops were the tiniest I've ever seen, but I did enjoy them, and the diced veggie mix of squash, broccoli, onion and tomato was a nice addition too. Mashed potatoes were pretty basic, nothing that amazing, but they're mashed potatoes and mashed potatoes are good. Dessert was delicious and the right smallish size after a big meaty meal.  The steak-eaters all loved their meals, and the steaks did look impressive. With all the nice steakhouses in Chicago, I don't know how one can separate itself from the pack. I enjoyed our meal here, but I'm curious how other big steakhouses compare. I do know that dining at any place like this, you must be prepared to open your wallet and let the money flow.
