I went a few weeks ago and it was great :) First time with Ethiopian food, but I definitely liked it. We ordered a regular size of a salmon entry (I can't remember the names of anything.. ahh!) and one of the meat combos. The food was great, and they gave us more of the flat bread (which I liked but then also not? It's quite sourdough-y, which I don't necessarily like--but I did like eating it) after we ate all of the stuff they gave us. We also had beef sambussas as an appetizer, which is seriously the BEST thing I've eaten in a loonnng time. I've been having serious sambussa cravings ever since. Our waitress was veryyy nice, and explained all the dishes to us when we admitted we were newbies. Parking wasn't bad, we were able to find a spot within a block on Broadway when we went a bit early (~5-6 pm for dinner).
