I've been driving by Spacca Napoli for years...YEARS and I finally went tonight. Now maybe it was the years of aniticipation, but I wasn't very impressed. The servers are very nice and fun, they have a killer outdoor patio (no wait at 6 on a Wednesday by the way), and a super cute neighborhood location, but the pizza just didn't do it for me. Maybe it's cause I went with an olive oil instead of tomato base, but my pizza was just eh. I'll have to give it another whirl.
