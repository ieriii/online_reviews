Incredible joint, incredible staff... I just wish the place would turf out on the crowd already. Not that Doug and Co. don't deserve the money... the only thing annoying about it are the throngs of idiots that just caught on to this place. Here's a thought... if you're "just there to get a chicago dog" then go to say the 1838230320 other places you can get a chicago dog; you're blocking the food and you're baby is way too damn loud as it is...sorry boutcha.
