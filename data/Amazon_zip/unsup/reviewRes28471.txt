Good stuff. Large quantities while being relatively cost effective. Our table shared the garlic bread appetizer, which was very garlic-y and therefore delicious. I ordered the pesto linguini with added chicken, and it was pretty good. It had a good flavor and the chicken was moist (albeit thin). The bread roll was really boring, though. Bottom line: come by for affordable and decent pasta eats!
