I was really looking forward to visiting Cafe 28, it's been on my list of places to try for ages. Unfortunately, it fell a bit short of my expectations. Maybe the expectations were the problem. Either way, everything was fine. Not great, just fine. We were there for sunday brunch and granted, we didn't order anything really Cuban, but I just felt like our food called for more flavor. The french toast with berries were okay, the chilaquiles were pretty tasty, and the spinach benedict seemed a bit bland (although the side of potatoes were really good). Most disappointing, however, was the hot chocolate, which wasn't even instant powdered mix, but Hershey's syrup in tepid milk. Call me a hot chocolate snob, but that's just wrong.
