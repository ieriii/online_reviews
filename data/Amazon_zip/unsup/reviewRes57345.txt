Welcome to http://match.com central. Or maybe its eharmony central. hard to tell. But its all 2-top tables and pairs of singles getting to know themselves over very fine but small portions of miso soup. Still, we had a super-attentive waiter who knew all about the food so that was nice, and it was delish. Dragon roll rocks.
