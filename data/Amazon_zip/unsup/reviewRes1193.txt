I'm not normally one to fall prey to mass hysteria, but in the case of Hot Doug's--believe the hype. Once you've put one of Doug's succulent wieners in your mouth, your life will change. With all honesty, if I had to choose how I was going to die, I would choose to choke to death on a Hot Doug's Wild Boar sausage. (Or possibly be stoned to death by the Polish.) The sh!t is that good.
