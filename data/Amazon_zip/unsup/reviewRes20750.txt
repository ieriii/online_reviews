i visit the loop at least twice a week for job related errands, and visit the usual suspects for take out: cosi's, baci's, corner bakery, and a coupla asian fast food places. i needed something special to help celebrate my co-workers birthday, so i stopped in at the gage. what a great departure from chain mediocrity and madness! great ambiance; dark wood, gorgeous bar with a great bartender. ordered beet salad with grapefruit and cheese: delish, a great open face brisket sandwich accented with apples, and a roast turkey sandwich that seemed to have actually been cut off a bird, not created in the back room of a packing company. the fries were good as well, but i really didn't like the curry sauce. maybe it's the sort of dish that doesn't translate well to take out. same goes for the french toast dessert, but the chocolate mousse cake was wonderful; light but richly flavored, though i didn't get the pretzel accompaniment. all in all, it was very tasty fare, great service, and i'm dying to go back after hours to try a martini or two. seems like the sort of place that would give a good one.
