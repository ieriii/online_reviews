Well what can one say. Hopleaf is the best beer bar in Chicago. Had some of my all time favorites on tap at this place. Best selection of Belgians I've ever seen. Try the mussels and frites... amazing.  One thing to note. You have to get there EARLY if you want to get a table. This is especially true on Fri and Sat. Otherwise... simply the best
