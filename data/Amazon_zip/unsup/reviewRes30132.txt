Everything from the chips and guac, my enchiladas with chicken and the oh-so-money mole', to my friends' dishes (tamales and steak) were all great. The Cucapa' beer brought all the flavors together. The only bummer is that the special hot-sauce bottle flavor that is on the table is not available for purchase, though they have a few other options that are.
