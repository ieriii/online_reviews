Been here for dinner twice. Impressed with the Gyro and Reuben sandwiches and have tried a few of the appetizers. The soy-shakes are really nice. The staff are friendly. It is a popular place so there is often a wait (and nowhere to wait but outside). Parking is handy with free spaces in the alley right beside the restaurant.I wouldn't recommend the brunch menu. Food was bland and served colder than it should have been. So, two times out of three I've been impressed.
