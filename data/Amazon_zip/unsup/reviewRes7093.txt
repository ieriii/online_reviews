This is most certainly my crew's favorite place for a nice Italian dinner. Chef Tony is one of the coolest chefs/owners we've come across. He always comes around and makes sure we enjoyed ourselves. The best part is, he's flexible. There have been times when he's made the most amazing adjustment to dishes when someone has special food needs. The restaurant itself is uber cozy, with it's exposed brick and patron art all over the walls. In the warmer months, sit outside and enjoy the neighborhood. As for the food, que Bella! My personal recommendation, the gnocchi, I think it's the best in the city, with its pesto base, sun dried tomatoes, chicken and toasted pine nuts. This is definitely a place to grab dessert, the rice pudding is to die for! It's warm and gooey and just perfect. The wine list is incredible and you'll definitely have leftovers for the next day (not of the wine, of course). P.S. When you go, sign up for the mailers, only if you are interested in receiving coupons, though. Sometimes the coupons are really good. They also serve a Family style dinner on Mondays for $19.95. My girlfriends and I ate there last night and one of my girlfriends did it by herself (no judgment there... she had plenty of food to take home). The portions they bring out directly reflect the number of people who go in on it--from one person to the whole table. The choices are from the more popular dishes on the menu, which is awesome. It's a great way to sample the restaurant's menu..
