Very nice BYOB place, with reasonably priced fixed price menus. I brought a friend here last week for a birthday dinner.  The first courses were wonderful--a savory scallop amuse-bouche, a crisp and tart endive salad, and a completely amazing (and fun to eat) "fish sandwich" on a crumbly southern-style biscuit.  The main course and dessert were very good, but a bit less eye-poppingly super good. The main was a turkey pot pie, and while the turkey was nicely prepared and the corn bread was creative, it wanted a richness that I think just couldn't be achieved with turkey. It was just kind of pedestrian--and four days before Thanksgiving, not the most interesting choice out there. Dessert was a "deconstructed" apple pie a la mode.. I honestly thought this would have been more delicious pre-deconstruction and felt a little peeved at how chefs tend to fancify perfectly good food by dividing it up into its components. The components were, however, tasty. The service was first-rate: prompt, friendly but not cloying, good explanations without over-intellectualizing, and they did the candle-in-the-dessert thing very charmingly, which made my friend happy.  As for ambiance, as everyone has observed it's a tiny space. This provides a homey, intimate feel, but I have one major objection. We were seated at a 2-person table near the kitchen. I didn't notice at the time, but the ventilation was very poor, and the cooking smells from the kitchen had nowhere to go but my clothes and hair--not to mention there's a very convenient coat rack which is unfortunately located adjacent to the kitchen, so my winter coat was also saturated. When I returned home, my husband told me that I smelled like I had been deep fried--I took a whiff of my hair and immediately agreed with him. Kinda put a damper on things.
