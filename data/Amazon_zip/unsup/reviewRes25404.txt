The atmosphere was great for a date. Very romantic, especially if you get put in a booth. Although for as romantic as the place is supposed to be, the tables are very wide so you feel like you're very far away from the other person (and I'm not one of those ultra-pda sit on the same side of the booth type people either). The food was good but I've definitely had better fondue. Their famous cheese fondue tasted a lot like alfredo sauce, and some of the fruit dippers weren't that fresh. The entree portion was good, but I prefer fondue made in a broth other than the pure oil they use. Also, the chocolate fondue tasted a lot more like the alcohol they put on top than the chocolate. Overall the food was decent and the servers were very attentive. I've had better fondue so I probably won't return but it wasn't a bad experience by any means.
