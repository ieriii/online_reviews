I admit that since I've tried it, I've come back to laosichuan a bit. I love their mapo doufu. Their jia chang doufu is pretty good too(although I've had it better at other places). I love how, menu aside, you can ask to have things tweaked according to spice. In some of their dishes, they keep a massive amount of sichuan peppers in them; I love it when they do this. It tastes so much better with sichuan peppers! Although, you have to hunt for the dishes that have them in it. I love their hotpot, too. It's been over a year since I went here for hot pot but its a spicy oil-based hot pot. I love spicy hot-pot! Their chicken dishes are really good, too(as mentioned by someone else). Too bad they don't have a few popular dishes like san bei ji. Either way, I recommend lao sichuan. Its not that bad, don't let other downers lead you away from here.
