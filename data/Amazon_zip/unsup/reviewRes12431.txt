A seemingly energenic and somewhat trendy, not so ordinary Chicago pizza joint.  Fantastic flavors and the pizza is prepared and cooked just right! - NOT that soggy New York fold me garbage.  Try the BBQ chicken with red onion - its good!  Cons: Seating is a little cramped and as with any city destination, parking can be a problem - and that proves true here.  Give this place a try, you'll walk away happy, full, and with a few dollars still in your wallet!
