During our visit to Chicago, we had breakfast at Fox & Obel after reading all the positive reviews . . . and we were so disappointed! We ordered our breakfasts at the counter and got our coffee, then waited and waited and waited for our food to arrive. It came from outside the cafe, so I'm guessing it is cooked in the restaurant across the store, then carried to the cafe. My husband and I were astonished at the enormous piles of glistening food in front of us. My bacon, eggs, toast and hash browns was enough food to feed a third world country. The same with my husband's ham and egg panini with hash browns. His food was so hot, that when I took a bite five minutes into the meal, it burned the roof of my mouth. My food was tepid. I asked the lady at the counter to microwave it for 20 seconds, and it still wasn't hot. The panini was very tasty, but every time I picked up my half, grease coated my fingers and dripped onto the plate. My bacon and eggs had no flavor. The onions and peppers in the hash browns were tasty but swimming in oil. Of the four urns of coffee, two were cold. We ate only a fraction of our food, but it was so rich it was six hours before we could even think about lunch.
