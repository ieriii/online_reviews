I've eaten here a few times, most recently this past weekend. The quality of food of service is consistent - which is nice. The food is somewhat bland, in my opinion (perhaps that's just the cuisine?). Bottom line: I'd stop by if you are in the neighborhood, but don't make a special trip to visit this place.
