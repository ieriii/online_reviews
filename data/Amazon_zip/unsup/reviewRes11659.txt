Eaten breakfast here 3 times. The sweet side of breakfast is definitely sweet -- almost too much. The pumpkin pancakes are my fave out of all the ones I've tried. Fun to go with a group and order one of the sweet offering as a "dessert" for the table to share at the end. Their breakfast burritos are v filling. Portion size is massive on all, so i guess that explains the high price of breakfast.
