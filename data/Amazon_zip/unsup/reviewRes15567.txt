This place is wonderful! It has the total package....amazing food, sexy ambiance, great drinks, and efficient service. Hubby and I first went here for date night and we had an amazing experience. We had never tried real Latin food and Carnivale was the perfect place to experience it. The ambiance in that place is the perfect backdrop for the wonderful food. Carnivale only uses fresh ingredients from local farms and you can definitely taste the freshness in their dishes.  We've tried the New York strip steak, spice rubbed chicken wood grilled beef tenderloin, and the paella all of which are OUTSTANDING dishes. The steaks are always seasoned & cooked to perfection. The fish tacos are really good as well. I wouldn't recommend Carnivale for small children. We saw one kid that was around 12 years old, but any younger wouldn't be a good idea.
