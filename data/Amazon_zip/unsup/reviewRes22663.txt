Finally made my way over to Greektown after 5 years of living in the city. I know, I'm ashamed of myself. But did I pick the right spot to hit or what! What I love about the place: 1. Fried Zucchini 2. Fried Zucchini 3. Fried Zucchini Would have liked to have some more vegetarian entree options on the menu, but whatever I had was really good. Loved the small spaghetti side. Delicious. Really want to give it 3.5 stars, but what the heck. P.S. They have free valet. Don't drive around the block a couple of times and miss the sign like we did!
