Wow - where do I start? Let's start with the sweet crepes. I had the strawberry-kiwi-nutella confection my first morning living in Chicago and I was pleased. It was about as good as the crepes I'd had in San Francisco. The Chicago crepe was okay (nothing to write home about, but that's because I don't like big hunks of cooked peppers), but the Roma Crepe was simply amazing. Not too much cheese, but packed with enough veggies so you feel like you're eating something healthy. The vegetarian soup is an epic win, too. Plus, you can build your own crepe, which is a plus when you don't feel like eating the other crepes on the menu, but you're in a mood for crepes nonetheless.
