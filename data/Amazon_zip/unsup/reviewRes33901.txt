Not really much I can add on to all the other reviews of this place. I can say I miss it terribly. Best food for the price, most definitely. Some of the best falafel and only my Mum makes better dolma. I loved living close enough to here to make it a stop a couple of times every week when coming home off the blue line. Really great veg selections, staff is friendly and funny, good place to pick up supplies for meals at home. Salad bar is fantastic- I'm getting hungry for it right now.... When oh when will someone invent teleportation?!
