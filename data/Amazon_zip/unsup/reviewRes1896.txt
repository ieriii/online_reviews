Hot Doug's really doesn't need another glowing review but oh well! We lived a couple miles from the place so we had the luxury of going when it wasn't busy. It's definitely nice being able to walk right up and order but it is also a little fun to wait in the line out the door with your friends. However, I would say that fun ends after about 20-30 minutes. My best advice is to go on a weekday around 2 or 3 PM. I have a little crush on Hot Doug. He is smart, patient and nice. No hot dog nazi here, he will help you with the menu and does it with a smile. Even though he has a line out the door, he is always nice and will not rush you. I am also very impressed with his mad adding skills. He can write down several different items and add it up so quickly without needing anything. I love the chili cheese fries and getting the chicago dog with chili added. Kinda like bacon...chili goes with everything! I have gone to the other Chicago hot dog landmarks and this one tops them all.
