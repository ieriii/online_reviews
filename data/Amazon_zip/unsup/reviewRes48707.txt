Brunch @ The Publican Must Eats_ 1/ Red Wine Poached Eggs Like yolky yellow Cabernet Merlot in a glass, these eggs are uncomparable to any style of eggs I've ever tasted. http://bit.ly/b0BWT9 Simple. Authentic. A pleasant, yet trippy experience to taste red wine and soft, runny eggs in the same bite. 2/ Fresh Ricotta & Honey_ http://bit.ly/acoovg The texture of this ricotta is just so pillow-y. You may just feel like you're eating a cloud. Light. Refreshing. Sweet and sorta sour cherries the time I had 'em... balanced well with chopped pistachios.
