I came here on a Thursday, and Crisp left me thirsty! I think the food was a bit too salty, my dinner dates and I ended up chugging water the rest of the night! I ordered the seoul sassy wings, which were great but didn't seem very authentic to me. There was a lot of fried goopy exterior, and not enough savory chicken. The Baby Bhudda bowl was a good dish, but I was left wishing I had more hot pepper paste to put into the dish. (more spice, more flavor please!) Portions are big! I shared these two items with my sister, and it was definitely enough to keep us both satisfied! To be honest, I'm not sure how quickly i'd be back, especially with del seoul opening up down the street and what appears to have a dolsot (hot stone bowl) option....
