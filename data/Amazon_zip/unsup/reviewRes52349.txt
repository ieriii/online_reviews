Thank you Gino's for introducing us to deep dish pizza on our first day in Chicago. Awesome sauce, cheese and sausage. Not so awesome cornbread crust. Maybe I'm just not a fan, but this crust was dry and flavorless. We also went to Lou Malnati's and Pizziaria Uno and Lou's was our favorite. We also found that Gino's was the most expensive and took the longest to wait/get our food.
