It's late and I don't want to write out an actual review so instead I'm going to post conversational snippets that have taken place on my two brunch-themed visits to Longman & Eagle. "I want to live here." "I don't think you can." "I want to steal all the furniture and whiskey from here and set it up in my own house and make believe like I live here." "I don't think you can do that either." "Goddammit. I can't do anything I wanna do." "That's a really inappropriate sound you're making in public." "IT'S OLD BAY HOLLENDAISE ON MY CRABCAKE BENEDICT. SHUT UP AND LET ME BE HAPPY." "I'm super uncomfortable just listening to you." "UUUNNNGGGGHHHHHHHHH." "Stop drinking the dressing." "It's black truffle vinaigrette." "YOU ARE DRINKING DRESSING!" "IT'S BLACK TRUFFLE! VINAIGRETTE!" "This duck hash is how I'd imagine Jesus to taste if he weren't made out of communion." "You are going to hell in the express lane." "That's a big glass of vodka with some tomato juice splashed in." "Do you make Bloody Marys a different way?" "...Not really, no." "Then shut up and get drunk." I love you Longman & Eagle. One day I'll come back for dinner-type things.
