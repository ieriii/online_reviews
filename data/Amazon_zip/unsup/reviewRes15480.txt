Had brunch on a Saturday, which was okay. Pork Belly Confit was very good, Egg in a Hole was so-so. It was the bartender who makes me doubt I'll go back. Asked for a spicy Bloody Mary with Worcestershire sauce, as I saw he wasn't using any. He told me he doesn't have any, pause, he'll have to get it from the kitchen, pause, it could take a while, pause, pause, pause, as in "I don't really want to go to the trouble but will do it if I really have to." I told him no problem, I'll wait. It wasn't all that long when I got the Bloody with Worcestershire sauce making up around half the drink. I don't think he was incompetent, just pissed that he had to go the 20 feet to the kitchen to get the Lea & Perrins. I switched to root beer, something he couldn't mess with.
