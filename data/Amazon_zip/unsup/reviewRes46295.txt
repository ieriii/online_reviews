We went here during the first weekend of August, one of the hottest, if not THE hottest weekend in Chicago.  There was no AC in Grand Lux.  They did not warn us about there being no AC on the hottest day of the 2009 Chicago summer when we entered on the ground floor. They did not warn us about there being no AC on the hottest day of the 2009 Chicago summer before seating us. They did not warn us about there being no AC on the hottest day of the 2009 Chicago summer when we were seated. They did not warn us about there being no AC on the hottest day of the 2009 Chicago summer when they gave us water once and never re-filled it. And our server did not warn us about there being no AC on the hottest day of the 2009 Chicago summer when she first came by to take our order.  It was hot in Grand Lux that the floor was sweating.  The floor all over the dining area and otherwise was slippery like ice.  It was ridiculous.  The menu was missing a number of items that were previously offered as well... That will be the last time I ever visit this Grand Lux.
