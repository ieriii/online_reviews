It's just OK. I have been here before, and remembered the service was good.  Same on this visit. However, as for the food? The menu is ambitious, but the food is not great.  Maybe they try to do to much, and need to focus on improving their flavors.  I had the arctic char (pink) with shrimp diablo sauce.  Sounded good, but the taste was one-dimensional. Calamari had great texture, no rubber, but needed salt. Fellow eater had a pretzel-crusted fish that was bland.  Atmosphere and wine list is great. Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese is tasty but also suffered lack of salt. I just wasn't wowed, and I think my expectations were too high. And there are sooo many other places to eat that are simply better. The decor and ambiance are comforting, like you are in a resort-lake town.
