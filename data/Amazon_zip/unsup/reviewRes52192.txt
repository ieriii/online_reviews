Visited this spot because the friends we were with said that they saw this place on Man vs. Food. So we thought we would give Chicago Deep Dish pizza a try. We ordered a Half Supreme and Half Meaty something or other. The Meaty side was way better. The veggies in the Supreme were diced super small and the marinara sauce lacked taste and salt. Also...I wasn't a huge fan of the almost corn bread crust. Plus its pretty expensive for what it really is.  However, the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant is pretty cool. I think I am going to give another pizzeria a shot at winning me over with deep dish.
