Mayan Palace is a fabulous restaurant. I went last year for my birthday and everyone had a wonderful time. The staff was very attentive and friendly. They had no problems with our group of 10-15 and our orders came quickly. The chips and salsa before dinner were delicious and the margaritas are to DIE for! I definitely recommend this place for a great meal and a fun time. I am even considering going back again for this years birthday!
