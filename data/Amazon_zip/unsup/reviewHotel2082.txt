Pros - Good view, very close to the blue line Merchandise Mart CTA stop, good service, clean, swanky, Bath and Body Shop coconut lime toiletries, firm beds, choice of soft or firm pillows.  Cons - High parking rates, deserted and far from most bars/attractions, rooms (although comfortable) are typical boring Holiday Inn rooms for the expensive price tag.
