We went to a restaurant in Vancouver by the same name so we thought we would try this one to see how it compares. We so enjoyed our meal and our server was so helpful in making our choices. Would not change a thing we ate. Everything so fresh, so unusual and cannot wait to go back. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys sushi and to anyone who wants to try it.
