I love their steak torta sandwich (excellent bread) and ground beef empanada. It's the BEST steak torta I've ever had! I won't order their pineapple/spinach empanadas and plantain again. We also ordered cheese empanada but the cheese was missing. I would go back just to have their steak torta, ground beef empanada and flan!
