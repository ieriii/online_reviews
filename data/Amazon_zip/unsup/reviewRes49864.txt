I'M IN HEAVEN! Really though, I order the Heaven Burger here and I don't think I'll ever even try something else because I love this burger and how unique it is. I've never really had anything quite like it other than my own concoction at McDonald's (when I used to eat there, haven't ate there in 4 years) but I used to get a Sausage McMuffin and put strawberry jelly on it. Best. Thing. Ever. I'm giving away all of my secrets here. Back to the Heaven Burger. A burger with brie, pears, and berry jam?! So good. Did I mention it comes on an oatmeal bun? A classy play on my beloved fast food bfast sandwhich. Definitely a sweet treat, but you still get the meat! The Fifty/50 has a bunch of other options that my friends enjoyed, no one complained about anything they had ordered. We all tried the corn fried calamari for starters and it was pretty good. Bonus points: they have a Mary Poppins shot that comes with pixi sticks on the rim!
