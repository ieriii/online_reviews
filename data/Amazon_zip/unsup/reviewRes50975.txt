The service here is the only reason I wouldn't give it a full five stars. The service is definitely friendly, but servers consistently forget portions of my or my friends' orders and don't check in enough in order to remedy the mistakes they make on orders. As far as the food goes, you can get a quality meal, whether it's breakfast/brunch, lunch, or dinner. My favorite thing? The menu features a late breakfast, so if you're like me and occasionally like to indulge in brunch at 7pm, you can! Another favorite menu feature: they have "on the lighter side" options that still taste good; you won't have to sacrifice flavor for health here. Favorites so far: collard greens, black bean cakes, any of the omelettes, sweet potatoes (whipped and with pecans in them!), and the fruit pancakes. The most important thing about this place though? They have fresh squeezed juices, and you can mix and match for delicious combinations. I highly recommend apple and ginger. As far as the atmosphere goes, the decorating/lighting is quirky and pleasant; there are creative and fun art pieces throughout. Keep in mind, it is in Lakeview, so be prepared to hear a screaming child once in awhile. But -and this is coming from someone who has a low tolerance for other people's loud/misbehaved children-- I have never felt bothered by it; if you're concerned, just grab a booth for a little extra privacy.
