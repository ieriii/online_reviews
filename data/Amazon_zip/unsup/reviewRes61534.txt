I truly love this place! Just like everyone states on their reviews great cafe with latin flare! Their menu has tons to offer at great prices. They have your normal breakfast choices of pancakes, eggs, toast.... to your more mexican breakfast like chilaquiles, huevos con chorizo, and much more. I have only tried their sandwiches and salads. But must say you will not be disappointed. My favorite is their chicken sandwich with house potatoes which are potatoes seasoned to perfection. I also love their lattes and cappuccinos.... very delicious. This place is great for ordering out or eating inside. The restaurant is very clean and well maintained and their staff is just wonderful. If you're eating by yourself they have newspapers and magazines to enjoy while on your lunch hour!
