Great chirashi, which is actually all I tried, I got carryout. Food came very quickly and there was a lot of fresh fish, with lots of variety! Food was reasonably priced, chirashi is never cheap- usually around $21 for a bowl. Atmosphere looked really nice, again didn't eat in there. There is also a bar connected, so you can go get drinks from there if you'd like!
