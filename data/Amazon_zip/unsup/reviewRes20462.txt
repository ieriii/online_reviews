churros! were nothing special. great texture and done proper thats for sure. but you have to order the two dipping sauces separately. whateva. we also got the aztec hot chocolate, which essentially hot dark chocolate in liquid form, literally. i couldnt handle it ! perhaps if u really really like dark chocolate this may be your kryptonite, superchocolateeater had to take little sips, i wish i could have tried the other stuff but i was too full from dinner, maybe next time
