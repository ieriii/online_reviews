First off, the drink selection is wonderfully diverse and of excellent quality. Anyone that enjoys quality alcoholic beverages will find something they'll love here. The food is excellent and portions were relatively large for the price and quality. I had the gnocchi with ramps and the brussel sprouts with pork belly. Both were very well designed dishes and prepared perfectly. I'll definitely be coming back to try the truffle pasta. The lighting was much darker than most places but after a few minutes my eyes adjusted. The live music was very good and really added to the ambiance. Noise level was loud enough that I felt like the place with very alive but quiet enough to hold a conversation easily. It might be a little too loud for a group larger than 4 to talk easily, but that's par for the course.
