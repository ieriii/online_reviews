I was so happy to finally try this place - I see Jelena Z. checks in all the time! I stayed safe and ordered the falafel sammy and baba ganuj and they were delicious, light, filling and super cheap! I hope to go back - I'm not in Wicker Park often - and have chicken shawerma, egg & cheese pie and maybe the salad bar. Perfect! But super hot in there in the summer ... I enjoy the outdoor dining, for sure.
