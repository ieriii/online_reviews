I had heard so many great things about this place and when I finally got a chance to go, I could not have been MORE disappointed. This is one of those places where the food looks pretty, but I don't really recommend eating it. Even if you did eat the food, don't blink as you might miss it. I think the crab cake had two edible bites to it. The foie gras was cold and tasteless (for $35 mind you). The entrees: the swordfish was barely cooked and I genuinely felt like the veal had been cooked and then sat out to get cold for 20 min. Finally, I appreciate good service but good god you couldn't even have a conversation because if you took a drink of water they refilled the glass as it was still up to your face. save your money
