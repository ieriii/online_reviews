People are going to hate me for this, and I kinda hate myself for this, too.....but 90 Miles Cuban Cafe doesn't live up to the hype for me. Granted I've only tried a few things so I'm definitely willing to come back and give it another try. Media Noche and Cubano - the meat is soo skimpy and thin in these sandwiches! Also not particularly flavorful..... Tostones were good but they needed more garlic sauce! I always have fond memories of some of my fav cuban places in NYC where they give you a full jar of sauce on the table - I needed more of that! Will come back and try some of the other platters to see if it will change my feelings.
