I am hesitant to review this place--especially since I know I'll be back very soon--but I feel confident that my feelings aren't going to change any time soon. I was lucky enough to have sampled their beer and the Flemish beef stew at the Chicago Beer Society brewpub shootout a few weeks ago. I voted for their food as my favorite. It paired excellently with the porter, the beef was perfectly cooked, and the mashed potatoes were crazy creamy.  Needless to say, I've been stalking them, trying to figure out when their permits would clear and they could actually open. Yesterday was the day! Between the table, we tried all the beers; we also took home a growler (full to the brim) of the pale ale. While not mind-blowing, the beer was very good. The IPA and pale ales are both lovely and hoppy, but not so much that they smack you in the face. The porter was also a crowd-pleaser.  The food was quite good. I do not hesitate when I say the wings were some of the best I've had--spicy and smoky and kind of bacony-tasting because of the applewood. I had the pork sandwich, and it was quite good; the spicy slaw on top definitely of kicks it up a notch.  The service was great (maybe a little too great--our waitress was a little too concerned about us, but it was also the first night, so slightly too much service was a nice surprise), and the ambiance was... well, a little too bourgeois to be revolutionary, which probably isn't a bad thing. However, the space does manage to seem cozy despite being pretty large, and I did appreciate the stained glass and funky cask lighting fixtures. Welcome to the neighborhood, Revolution!...it is unfortunate that you will probably be crowded constantly since you are so delicious and so conveniently located.
