After hearing great things from quite a few friends, I took my girlfriend a couple of nights ago. I was very impressed. Excellent sushi, and excellent service. Apparently you can only bring one bottle of wine per two people, but that was fine with us as we focused more on the sushi than our drinks (plus we had just had a couple of fairly filling brews over at Map Room). I would definitely go to Coast again, but not too often...those rolls do add up.
