The Peking Duck dinner is the star here. Delectable broiled duck is carved tableside - meat is cooked to perfection and not remotely greasy, skin is crisp, and is served with steamed buns, veggies, plum sauce, and very authentic Chinese chili paste. What remains of the duck is carried back to the kitchen, where it is transformed into duck fried rice and duck soup. I'd never had peking duck before dining at Sun Wah, so I can't gauge it against others, but it is pretty excellent. In addition, bok choy is a pleasant accompaniment, and egg rolls are meaty and deliciously crisp. The roast pork appetizer is pretty bad, however; pork is overcooked, and the sauce is far too sweet. The pricing here is also unbelievable - said duck dinner fed 5 of us easily, and cost around $40 in total. I highly recommend it!
