Rick Bayless, you are a genius! I can truly say one of the best mexican eateries I have ever had the chance to savor. What sets Xoco apart is that the flavors are authentically Mexican, no Americanized dishes here! Layers and layers of taste complexity is what you pay for and get here at this joint. All the ingredients taste like they are supposed to: super fresh, expertly used. I ordered the following for dinner Tuesday evening. Seafood caldos: superb! Loads of seafood, potatoe bites, and cilantro onion lime as garnish. Not salty, perfectly balanced. Perfect for a cold evening. Carnitas tortas: excellent blend of carmelized red onion and roasted meat. Just the right amount of guac. Very savory. Choco-flan: mexican chocolate cake with a flan topping. heaven... Come to this place, you will not be disappointed!
