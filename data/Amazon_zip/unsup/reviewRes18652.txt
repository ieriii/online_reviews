Great little BYOB Italian joint. The food was amazing - the bruschetta had the biggest piece of wet mozz on it that just melted in your mouth. The server was knowledgable and personable. It's a quaint little place, and it wasn't too crowded for a Thursday night. I would definitely go back again. I just wish it was closer to my hood! :)
