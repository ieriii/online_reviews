Service was excellent, food was good, ambiance was mediocre. The bar area was packed and crazy loud with an off key singer blaring lounge-y cover tunes and a better than average pianist trying to keep up with her. The drinks were good, and the pours were large, and strong. The filet was delicious, as was the tuna, and sea bass. The mac and cheese was good too. The butter cake was great, but not quite the heavenly experience others are describing. Now, I know that none of you would walk in here expecting an inexpensive evening of food and drinks, and you would be correct in your assumption. It's very pricey, bordering on obnoxious. Is it worth it? The jury is still out.
