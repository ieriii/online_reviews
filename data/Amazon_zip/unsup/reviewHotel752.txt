Great location..right across the street from a funky looking Cheesecake Factory.  Parking: Overpriced..try parking elsewhere or don't bother renting a car if you're staying in the central vicinity. When it's nice outside, the walk around that area is nice. Rooms: Bed are comfy but I agree with other yelpers that they need some refurbishing. Could be more updated for the price you pay. Friendly staff and front desk. Concierge gave us some passes for local nightlife around the area and the suggested places were fun. Although the crowd was a bit random, I would still go back. Location: Prime location with lots of things nearby and local transportation. Near many of the shops and a quick 15 minute walk to Garrett's Popcorn. What can I say...a definitely PLUS!
