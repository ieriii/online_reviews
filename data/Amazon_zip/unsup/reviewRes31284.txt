I'm always skeptical of eateries with descriptions like "New Asian" or "Fusion Asian," because it usually means you are overpaying for decor and getting bite-sized potions. Thankfully Sunda avoids the usual pitfalls and does a lot of pan-Asian dishes well. Lucky for me, I got to try this place on the company dime, and they way overordered so I didn't feel bad stealing bites of a lot of little things. The sushi is decent. I wouldn't make this a destination when I'm craving it, but they were creative and made for a good conversation starter. I would pass on the veggie roll - it's like crudo wrapped around rice. Too healthy for my needs. Throw in some avocado or cream cheese and we'll talk. The shiitake mushroom roll was tasty, as was the spicy tuna. Also tried the seaweed and mushroom salads. The seaweed salad was actually awesome. It looked like a big bowl of stringy slim but tasted light and refreshing. The mushroom salad was a bit boring, and could have used a more flavorful dressing. Oddly enough, I ended up not liking the shrimp and wasabi appetizer, which is apparently what Sunda is known for. All I could taste was guacamole on top of fried nothing. On the other hand, the corn fritters were fried but pouring with flavor. I wanted to dump the sweet dipping sauce on everything. There were lots of meat dish that looked great. The one vegetarian dish appeared to be a kind of wet crouton salad, but that was just a cover for the garlic noodles laying beneith. They were really, really good, but I had dragon breath for the rest of the afternoon (even after two rounds of listerine). Not a good dish for date night. Last but not least was...mochi! A/k/a Japanses ice cream balls. I'd never tried them before, and was positive they couldn't be as good as "real" ice cream, but they were awesome. Plus, they came in weird (but good) flavors like red bean and green tea.
