This was the first place I wanted to go to when I arrived in Chicago! We went during lunch time on a Saturday and there was a long line out the door. I think we were in line for like an hour in the freezing cold. The place was pretty small and cramped in my opinion.  When we got to the counter we order like 8 different "hot dogs" and some duck-fat fries and cheesy fries to share among 4 people. There were so many varieties so we just wanted a taste. All of the hot dogs we got were pretty good, but the best one was the "Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel" This sucker was $10 but it was ohhhhh so worth it. The duck-fat fries was nothing to really rave about. Not much difference from the regular fries. I would definitely want to take a trip back to Chicago and eat here again.
