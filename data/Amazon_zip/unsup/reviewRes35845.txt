I've been going to Sun wah for many many years. It's a typical chinese restaurant in the heart of Argyle in Chicago. Prices are reasonably low and affordable. Food portions are huge. Our favorite dish is the Peking Duck. Must have dish when you go here. Plus its BYOB with $3 corkage fee. I highly recommend this place. Will definitely come back for more.
