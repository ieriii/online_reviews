This is probably my favorite Korean restaurant so far in the city. The best thing about things about this place is it's open 24 hours, so you can eat Korean food at 5 am if you want :) and they give you a good amount of pan chan (side dishes), and the service is attentive and mostly pretty friendly, though somewhat harried as it gets busy. Almost anything off their menu is good. They have great kalbi, which I usually get, which is cooked over wood soot, so you get that charcoal flavor in the meat. Also try the kim chee chega (kimchee stew) if you want something spicy or the ten gang chiga (bean paste stew) if you want something hearty to warm you up. In the summer, kalbi and mul nemang (water noodles) are really good. My Korean is really bad, and so is my spelling, but the waitresses will help you order.
