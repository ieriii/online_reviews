After going to Fogo De Chao a few times, as well as Sal & Carvao (no longer around), we decided to try out Brazzaz. The cuts of meat were similar to Fogo, with slight differences in the salad bar and meat choices. The salad bar had a little bit of everything - traditional salad fixings, cured meats, cheeses, as well as seafood, and warm dishes like risotto and rice & beans. I really enjoyed everything from their salad bar. I think it had more variety than Fogo's. They had a nice selection of meats to choose from. About 9 different cuts of beef, lamb, pork, chicken, sausage, and shrimp. Although we didn't try it the last time we went, they offer lobster a la carte. The one thing that made Brazzaz unique from the other Brazilian steakhouses was the grilled pineapple. I loved the sweetness of the pineapple in combination with the grilled meat.  Overall, we really enjoyed our meal at Brazzaz, and although Fogo is still our favorite, Brazzaz is a very close second. We'll definitely go back.
