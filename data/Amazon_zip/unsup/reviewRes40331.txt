DH and I arrived for an early dinner, and enjoyed watching the restaurant fill in around us. They have Unibroue, with Maudite on tap. Mmmm. Kobe meatballs with polenta, the wild boar sloppy joe, and the roasted cauliflower dish were all made with evident care, and consumed with relish. It's the coziest, friendliest place I can think of in Chicago. I can't wait to go back and try some whisky. p.s. don't miss out on the bread pudding. so. good.
