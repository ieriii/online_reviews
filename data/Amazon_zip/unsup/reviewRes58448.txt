Dont order lobster here. Salads and pastas off the hook. You ask who orders lobster at calos? well all i have to say that i was craving lobster so bad that night, that the menu only read lobster tail. Anyway. Calos has been around for years, it was nice to go back next time I wont being eating any seafood.
