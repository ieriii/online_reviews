Milk & Honey is the place to go for breakfast when you want something other than bacon & eggs....and sandwiches with a twist.....and cool side dishes like kale or beet salad......and the most awesome Granola I've ever had! The Granola is so good you can now find it in your nearest Whole Foods market. They should serve all of their entrees with a little side of granola.......or on the table next to the salt n pepper. It does get crowded especially on a nice day, so go early!
