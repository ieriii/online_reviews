Hopleaf is the best beer bar in Chicago, in my opinion -- the beer menu has a table of contents. It's very good, high quality beer from around the world. They usually have about fifteen Belgians on tap. The food is excellent -- I'm not a mussels fan, but that's what everyone loves. The only downside is, it's very busy, so try to go some time off peak.
