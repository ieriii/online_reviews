Yup, what can one say about The Hopleaf at this point? Great bar, great beer, really good food. The duck reuben is one of my favorite things to eat in Chicago: incredibly decadent and tender and juicy and messy and delicious. The only knock, really, is the overwhelming crowds in the evenings, especially on weekends. If you can get a seat at the bar, though, you've got it made. The Hopleaf holds great special events--book readings, improv comedy--in its upstairs rooms. The bartenders are knowledgeable and usually friendly, and I've had only one weird service experience with an extremely rude hostess. I miss living near The Hopleaf.
