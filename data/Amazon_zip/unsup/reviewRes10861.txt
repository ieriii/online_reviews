Brought a NY friend here on a weekday, we both really enjoyed it. We were supposed to be here for breakfast, but one thing, and on, and on....we ended up there around lunchtime. No wait. I was still set on breakfast, so got an omelette with sausage, mushrooms, ??. It was just ok, a bit on the dry side. The potatoes were good. My girlfriend ordered a crab sandwich - now that was killer. I'm ordering *that* next time. Waitress was just ok, a bit on the aloof side, but pretty much got us what we needed after we asked. Good looking place, good atmosphere. Looking forward to returning. Wanna try the sweet breakfast offerings.
