My boyfriend and I tried Frontera Grill last night for date night; we had a reservation and were seated within 2 minutes! Great first impression with the atmosphere - colorful, vibrant Mexican decor, loud/crowded, and amazing aroma of Mexican food. (I'm Mexican so what can I say, I love the smell of frying tortilla chips!) The hostess and wait staff were very attentive. We had at least 3 different waiters take our drink orders, refill water, and take food orders. Drinks were brought out promptly, and may I say the margaritas were fabulous. I'm a no-frills margarita girl, so the Blue Agave was awesome: tequila, lime, a splash of Cointreau. My bf tried the "Yellow Fever" (tecate, tequila, some kind of mango juice...basically a summer special and it was not so good). Stick with the margaritas. The appetizers were awesome - Ceviche Fronteriza (marinated fish with tomatoes, cilantro, lime, and chiles) was very tasty. Chips with guacamole and salsa were just ok. The guac could have used a little more punch and the salsa bowls were so small you couldn't even fit a whole chip in them.  The food was average - pork with adobo marinated rub, bacon, pineapple...it was ok, not the best. I had the skirt steak tacos, which were much better. The steak was cooked to perfection, and rolled up in fresh homemade tortillas and grilled onions and salsa - hard to go wrong! All in all I'd give the food a 3, the margaritas a 4, and the company/atmosphere a 5!
