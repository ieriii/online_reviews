I've been to many Italian restaurants, and this one def takes the cake locally. I went with 6 of my girls to celebrate a promotion. The staff was incredibly friendly, the food was fantastic, and they had a pretty decent wine list. After ordering several bottles, the manager even bought us champagne to celebrate. A TV crew (for some reason!) even showed up to the place, found my friends and I entertaining, and now we're going to be on some food network enjoying Sapori Trattoria. Overall, awesome experience, though pretty loud and a little pricey. I would recommend sharing entries as well- they are huge.
