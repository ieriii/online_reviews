I have to agree with Gwendolyn this place is AWESOME!!!! We were in for our first time last Saturday to celebrate a birthday, and it definitely wont be our last time there. Everything was great starting with the complimentary appetizers that were sent over by the owner to the exceptional service that we were given by our server Cris. He was very patient in explaining to us about the dishes on the menu and had great suggestions. We all had different dishes and we were extremely satisified with them all. We also enjoyed the staff all comming over to our table to sing Happy Birthday. We enjoyed our evening and will returning to La Villa very soon.
