A birthday dinner brought me here over the weekend. Birthdays are supposed to be fun and festive, and that's exactly what this establishment exudes upon entry. We vacation annually on the Pacific Coast of Mexico, and with the slight chill in the air on this October evening, it was nice to fell like I had started my vacation early. The menu was loaded with a wide variety of Cuban/Colombian/Latin American specially prepared meats and seafood that made the decision process quite challenging. We had the Guacamole Appetizer, Camarones Al Ajillo, Arrozo con Mariscos, Churrascos (nicaraguan style wood-grilled beef, malanga goat cheese, arugula chimichurri, spicy beet salsa), and a long look at the Tequila Menu which broght back many memories. This restaurant promotes Tequila like Baskin Robbins does ice cream. I threw up after doing shots of Tequila long ago on a Spring Break to South Padre Island, Ixtapa, Cozumel, or somewhere and I haven't had a taste since. But if that's your drink and you and your crew want to take things to the next level, I can't think of a better place for you to go. In closing, to any gentlemen reading this review, if you are bringing a significant other on a date, I'm telling you up-front you will be bringing sand to the beach in your exotic 3 hour Latin American getaway. The girl to guy ratio was easily 4 to 1 in one of the most bizarre eating experiences I've been a part of. I was actually looking around for cameras thinking that I was candidly starring in a Reality Show. I can only dream as there weren't any to be found. Seating-wise, I had a table with my back to the majority of the restaurant. That was good, it kept me out of trouble. Go to Carnivale, especially if you haven't been and want to try something new.
