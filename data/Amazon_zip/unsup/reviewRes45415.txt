My first time there I had the Reuben and it was awful. They do some sort of Molasses rub to the corned beef and it's just...just...not good. That said, it took some convincing to get me back there but I got back in with a group of friends. I was back on board with the Wilde burger and I munched on a few different salads too. Service is inconsistent though. On my three visits, my servers have been mediocre, terrible, and awesome (respectively). Any negative points for service came from a simple lack of knowledge of the menu. Also, I'm of the true belief that if you're advertising yourself to the public, then don't have a menewe thats ful of spellling and grammer mi?stak!es. Come on!!!! Every computer has a f*cking spell check nowadays! READ WHAT YOU'RE WRITING!  I'm not going to spoil anything, but you absolutely can make a drinking game out of everything messed up on that menu. Go if you want. It fills your belly, at least.
