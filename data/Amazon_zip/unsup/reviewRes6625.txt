Everything was great from beginning to end! Be prepared for a wait for dinner since they don't take reservations. The 6 of us waited about 30 minutes but it was well worth the wait! Warm, intimate setting great for family and friends. I love the rustic feel of this place. Our table was right by the kitchen so we were able to see all the delicious food. It's Italian 'tapas' so everything is meant to be shared. Chicken liver pate (served in a mason jar) that comes with absolutely fresh delicious bread. Don't be afraid to ask for more bread because there's a lot of pate! Pizza Della Terra (mushroom) & Pizza con Salsiccia e Rapini were delicious and fresh. Linguine with crab and unni (sea urchin) - YUM! Never knew that unni would be so good with pasta! They also had big chunks of REAL crab. Strip steak with arugala salad - tender and cooked to perfection. The arugula salad had some lemon based dressing that was real light. Suckling pig (special) - awesome delicious sauce and tender meat and crispy skin! Dessert is a must -- heavenly! Each order of gelato/sorbet had 3 huge scoops - we tried concord grape, vanilla, and chocolate hazelnut - all very creamy and delicious. The carrot cake was surprisingly delicious with a cream cheese frosting - not overly sweet. The chocolate mousse was amazing! The owner actually came by our table to thank us for coming which was nice of him. Another plus is that they comped our dessert :) One of my favorite restaurants ever - will definitely be back soon!
