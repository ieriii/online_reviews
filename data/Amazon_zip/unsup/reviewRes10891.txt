Ceiling fans....sammich? Sammich.....ceiling fans? Ceiling fans...sammich? Oh hell, it's a bloody tie! Welcome to a my brain while eating here. If you've ever been, then you know that they have, what I believe to be, some of the coolest looking propeller ceiling fans I have ever seen. I couldn't take my eyes off of them. Soooo rad! Then there was the to-die-for breakfast sammich croissant that I ordered. Crispy bacon, Munster cheese (yay, Munster!!) and an egg. I asked for the egg scrambled, but they served it to be sunny side up and even with this immense eggly f*ckup, it was still the best breakfast sammich i have ever had. WOw The decor is just absolutely cool, sleek and charming all at the same time (that's rough to do!) and the servers are all cool, hipster types with awesome style and even awesomer (yes, I know that's not a real word) tats. This place is truly just a win win and I can see why there is a ridiculous line on the weekends here...lucky for me, we went at an odd time during the week, so no line for us, la la la la la ;) Check it out! And order that breakfast sammy, dammit!
