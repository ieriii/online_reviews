never been to any other steakhouse before, so not really sure what to expect!i will keep this review simple!For all of you reading reviews here in yelp prior going to Brazzaz to eat for the first time, here is a tip: skip the salad bar! Also, make sure to request the lamb chops! Lamb Chops and Shrimps! Lamb Chops and Shrimps!need to make another reservation... before all the Lamb Chops and Shrimps are gone!!!!
