Graham Elliot is a Top Chef Master? is a Food & Wine Magazine Best New Chef? served ridiculously over-salted Butternut Squash Bisque? charged us $110 a person for underwhelming food? So disappointing on so many levels that I cannot fathom. I walked in to that dining room in a FANTASTIC mood and left completely uninspired to dine out again. The Truffled Popcorn (which is complimentary) and the sommelier's mustache were the highlights of the dining experience IMHO---sad considering that I was attending as part of the Chef's Table for a 30th Birthday celebration. Ball dropped. Game over.
