Me and my husband went here for a date night this past weekend and had a great evening. We made reservations online, which has not always worked in the past for me. However, we were seated exactly when we made a reservation for. We got there a little early for a drink, and after having my first drink the bartender suggested a pomegranate martini, which I was a little unsure of. The bartender made me one and let me have it on the house. The food was great - we had baked clams and shrimp cocktail for appetizers. My husband loved the extra spicy horseradish in his shrimp cocktail sauce. We both had some sushi which wasn't the greatest that I have ever had, but didn't dissapoint either. The yellow-fin tuna was excellent and had a great sauce. They had this neat little dessert platter that had mini versions of several of their full-size desserts that looked great, but we had to skip it as we were stuffed! We would definately go again
