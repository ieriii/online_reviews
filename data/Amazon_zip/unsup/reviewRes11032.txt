Loved it. The pizza is fabulous. The beer is amazing. The danger of build-it-yourself pizza is that you can sometimes pick ingredient combinations that are sort of meh. But the ingredients at Piece are of a high enough quality that every combination is good - and some are phenomenal. We had one with Ricotta, Garlic and Artichoke was totally fabulous. Surprisingly, I've almost been more impressed with the appetizers and salads - they make a GREAT caesar salad that reminds me that despite my squeamishness about anchovies, they are actually what I LIKE about caesar salad. The guac is also very good. And the beer, of course, is the award winner here. The Whitbeer I had last time was particularly good, as was one of their Stouts - and I rarely like either Whitbeers OR Stouts. Docked a star just because it is quite loud and busy. Definitely not somewhere to go for a dinner that is quiet, or even one where you want to have a conversation below shouting level, particularly in a group over 4 people - the tables are long, and you can't hear the people at the other end of the table at all. But all that doesn't mean that Piece isn't awesome.
