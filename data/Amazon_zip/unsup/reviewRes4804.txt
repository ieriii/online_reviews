Awesome place! Tried it for the first time today. Dish sizes are small but gives an opportunity to try many dishes. We tried 9 different plates amongst the 3 of us. Love the "jlt" sandwich (jaw sandwich), the braised pork shoulders, and the foie gras spread. Review Written 12/31/11 but didn't complete till march
