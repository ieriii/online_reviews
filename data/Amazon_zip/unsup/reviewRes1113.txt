A few weeks ago the BF and I happened to be off of work during the week and we thought, "Hey, Let's check out that Hot Dougs place". It was a Wednesday around noon, so sadly, no duck fat fries. I had Antelope Sausage with 4-Cheese Dijonnaise and Roasted Red-Spicy Cherry Peppers and he had the Rabbit with Brie. I was also delighted to find that they had bottles of Sioux City Birch Beer, my favorite soda. (I kinda wanted to try the chocolate mint soda, but decided to save that for next time, when we go back for the duck fat fries.) Still the wait wasn't too bad (25min) and I'd definitely go back there again, dragging some friends. What also impressed me is that the plain ol' hotdogs were VERY reasonable, so if you don't dig oddball stuff in your tubesteak, you can still enjoy the food. Word to the wise...they don't take credit cards!
