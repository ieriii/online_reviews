Tried this place after a recommendation from a friend who said the sushi is good and the place is the best. Well this place is good and the sushi is quite good too...What I did not expect was the really long wait late on a late Thursday night. Came here and we were seated right away. Decor was the usual dark and trendy looking atmosphere.. Nothing really original there.. As far the sushi goes, I thought the quality was pretty good. I liked the coast crab maki and the volcano roll. The Po' boy maki had lots of fish in it, but it kind of felt like House of Sushi in taste.. So the food was good. I wouldn't say it' is as good as some of my favorite places, but it's definitely better than most. What sucked was the wait to be served. It was excessive and since we were dining so late we were absolutely starving by the time the food came. The waitress was nice and did refill our drinks promptly and apologized for the wait so that was a saving grace.. Didn't bring anything to drink as we didn't expect to dine here, but I think this is the essence on why this place is so popular. It's in a trendy neighborhood and it offers BYOB sushi. Coast still dinged my wallet and for the price you can get a better value elsewhere, but it's not too bad.. Will have to try this place again in the future and bring some booze.. For now it's a 3.5 star place to me.. Better than just okay, but not a fan of this place.. At least until I take advantage of their BYOB...
