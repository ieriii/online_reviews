This place is worth the hype. i only waited about 35 minutes for a table which, i expecting to wait longer. I loved everything about the place including the wallpaper in the bathroom.The wait staff was super friendly and personable. The kobe meatballs & wild boar sloppy Joe were excellent..I will def be back.
