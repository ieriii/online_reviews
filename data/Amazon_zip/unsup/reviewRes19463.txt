The bf took me here for dinner last week to celebrate V-day, I was pretty excited since I'm a major sushi fiend. Coast is a little more schmancy of a dining experience & when you browse through the menu it's clear that many of the items are not for sushi novices (meaning they don't have 20 maki options that are rolled with cream cheese). For V-day they had a special menu so for starters we ordered from the "Aphrodisiac Menu" and got the "Super White Uni." The uni was wrapped in white fish and topped with a little bit of fresh roe. It was super oishi and the uni was very fresh..melts in your mouth. If you've never tried uni before I recommend trying it here because it's served very fresh. UNI =LOVE For my entree I ordered the seared tuna...fresh tuna lightly seared served with slices of Japanese sweet potato and warm soba noodles tossed in a sesame dressing. It was a nicely sized portion & not too heavy. The bf ordered the Chirashi entree...an assortment of fresh sashimi over sushi rice. Overall we had a nice dining experience, when I was unsure whether or not they put peanut sauce in the soba noodles (b/c I'm allergic to nuts) our server made sure that there were no nuts in the sauce. We were seated quickly & we didn't have to wait long for our food either which was nice. Ooh and another thing I like about this place is that they have roasted rice Green Tea. =)
