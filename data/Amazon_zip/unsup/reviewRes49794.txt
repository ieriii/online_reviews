I came here for the first time since they revamped their menu and became more cheese-centric. I was excited since I enjoyed my last visit. This one was not nearly as consistent. I was very excited to try the cheese flights, however, it was hard to supplement the flights with other offerings, the small selection of entrees are very heavy, and the other appetizers offered are also very cheese-focused, and one can only have so much cheese. My sister and I split two cheese flights, and they were both very good. The wine flights were also delicious, we both decided that the Syrah flight my sister ordered was the best. However, I do have to say when we were very disappointed when the waiter, after we asked for his opinion on pairings, said, "well, I mean they are all great". This was a very generic comment, conveying to us the impression he had no idea what he was talking about, which was surprising considering the whole concept of the restaurant is based around wine and cheese. The service was also very disappointing. Aside from our original less than knowledgeable waiter, we also were approached by another waitress in the middle of our time there introducing herself and telling us she would be taking care of us the rest of the evening. She barely said boo to us for the rest of the evening, and our original waiter also came by to take our orders. They both were inattentive, so we found ourselves ordering from anyone we could grab, something that was not the case for the larger groups surrounding us. The bus staff, however, was excellent, very attentive, and the people who delivered both our cheese and wine flights were very knowledgeable and took great detail in outlining our cheese flights. We both said we wished they were our waiters. Overall, we had a very nice, relaxing dinner (we were there three hours), we were just disappointed in the service. I think the restaurant really needs to figure out its focus, it was trying to be too many things at once.
