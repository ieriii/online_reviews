It's not hard to be "the best fondue" place in Chicago - since there really is NO competition (Fondue Stube doesn't really count.) I loved the place about 10 years ago - but now I find everything about the place to be disappointing. I know some people swoon over it - but to me - the cheese fondue taste like melted processed "Swiss" cheese spread. Cooking the meat is a hassle and too hit or miss. And making a chocolate fondue at home is a piece of cake if you have a microwave. I think Mark S. says it best - worth a try for a special date and decide for yourself if Gejas is your idea of romantic. And definitely try to get a booth!
