(I'm Latino.. all communication was done in Spanish) I wanted to try this place since hearing buzz about it. This place was the worst. First we sit down and the waitress gives us our menus and the bus boy brings us the appetizers and water. The guy was holding all the water by the rim!!!. Then we order. I ordered the Bistec Ranchero and my daughter ordered the cheese Flautas. When the waitress passed out the meals she did not even ask who had what she just placed the plates down. I would understand if you forgot, but at least ask! Then my wife told her that the plate in front of her was not hers, The waitress just said OK and did not even bother to give it to the correct person. My Bistec was full of fat and not good at all. My daughters cheese Flautas were not cooked fully It looked like a stick of string cheese in the tortilla and was not melted. Here's the kicker!. Then my daughter was about to take a sip of her drink when she noticed a LIPSTICK mark on the glass. Gross!. No apology nothing from them. They just gave her a bigger glass. When we were leaving (Thank GOD) the old man at the register just looked at us and took the bill and charged us. No thank you. Nothing. Not even what was the total. We had to look at the register. The only good part was the parking lot guys who greeted and answered our questions.  Never in a million years will I return to this place. Save yourself the hassle. There are far better places that are in the 21 century and not stuck in past (no credit cards)..
