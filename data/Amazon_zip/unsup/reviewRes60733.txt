My girlfriend and I had to wait a half an hour to get in. We watched several people who showed up after us get seated first. The premise the restaurant is set upon is a jail theme with heavy metal music playing constantly (and loudly). There are something like 13 TVs set up in the restaurant and all of them play a slide show that would be put to better use as a 14 year old's screen saver. Some of the slides include pictures that may put off your appetite, such as stills of singers spitting. The atmosphere seems a little insincere considering the restaurant is full of hipsters, who probably couldn't name any of the songs they listened to whilst dining. The staff is metal though, our waitress proved it by dressing ridiculously (mesh shirt with a bikini top, personally I prefer my servers to appear clean). After getting our waters and order we did not see her again for around 25 minutes, so my girlfriend could finally order a beer. I asked if she had an idea of how much longer our food would be. Instead of offering a "I'm not sure, but I could find out for you" or a "I'm sorry for the wait" instead she said, condescendingly, "Look, it's half off burger day and everybody's here..." at which point I cut her off to restate that I simply wished to have an idea when I might get to eat. Twenty minutes later we finally got our food, which was cold and both of our burgers overcooked. The waitress forgot some sides we ordered, I mean how could she possibly remember when it was over an hour ago that we had ordered our food. The food was decent but it would have been better had it been served hot.Long story short, horrible service, irritating atmosphere and decent food. I would not suggest it to anyone and I certainly won't go back. There are too many good burger joints in Chicago to waste your time on this one.
