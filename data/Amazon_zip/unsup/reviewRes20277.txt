Hubby and I had high expectations for XOCO and had been anticipating this visit for some time, as we are fans of Rick Bayless and also try to practice a locavorian and mainly organic lifestyle. I completely agree with Larah K. on the time-consuming order-taking/seating frustration; there has to be a better way to accomplish this process. 45 minutes from sidewalk to bar stool - with a 5 year old and 4 month old in tow, that's a freakin' eternity. After hatin' on the waitin', I have to say the food was outstanding. Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious: Pepito, guac & chips, Limonada, Victoria beers, churros, Mexican soft serve w/salted caramel & maple bacon topping. Can't say the same for the Milanesa, which was much too heavy to enjoy. People really eat that entire sandwich in one sitting? The prices are reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food, coupled by the fact you don't have to leave a tip. We'd definitely eat here more often if the wait weren't so long, and the ability to carry-out so limited.
