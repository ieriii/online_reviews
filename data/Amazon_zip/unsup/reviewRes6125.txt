Dear Davanti Enoteca, Nom Nom NOM! Please feed me every day.  I went last night with a girlfriend and we got there plenty early on a Thursday and had no trouble securing a table. By the time we left, the place had filled up, but it's definitely worth your wait.  The play by play: Wine was reasonable and delicious. I ordered the 2006 Chianti Colle Senesi. Yum. Tuscan toast with whipped ricotta and honey comb. Holy smokes, get in my belly.  Roasted squash with farro, goat cheese and watercress. Mmmm, drool. Thin crust pizza with foraged mushrooms, braised leeks, taleggio and truffle oil. What ISN'T good when it includes truffle oil?  I would have ordered 15 more things from the delicious looking rest of the menu had I not been incredibly full at this point. Stomach, fail. Guess I'll just have to go back... :) Oh, and did I mention it was only $46 for the two of us? Bargain.
