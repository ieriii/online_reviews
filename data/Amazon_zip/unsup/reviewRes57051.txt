Piece Pizza on North Avenue is one of the best places I've found in Chicago to get a microbrew and one heckuva good tasting pizza. They've got all types of unique offerings, including mashed potatos on pizza (although it's not the best in their arsenal). There Camel Toe beer is amazingly good. I definitely recommend this Bucktown institution.
