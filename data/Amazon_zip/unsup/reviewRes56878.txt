piece out should be called piece of sh..............I have never been so disgusted and offended in all my dining experience in my life. Not only by the general manager bob, but also by the owner bill jacobs.......I was there having lunch with my family, mind you this place is a sports bar, not fine dining..it was loud , that we could barely hear ourselves, with the soccer games playing and people eating and drinking , when the gm came up to our table and asked us to keep our baby quiet because he was making too much noise..My bay is 1 and a half yrs. I was so offended by thier rudeness. not only are they not kid friendly, they are rude as hell and the food is horrible....they will never get my business and will pass the word on. not to mention me and my fiance both work in the restaurant industry, and we are both familiar with restaurant protocol, and this was beyond unacceptable and disrespectful.
