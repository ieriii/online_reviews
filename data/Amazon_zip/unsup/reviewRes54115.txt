Oh my goodness.Make no mistake, this is not a fine dining restaurant, this is not even a casual restaurant. It shares more in common with a Quiznos than with the former two categories. That said, it is phenomenal.If you go when it's busy, you're asked to wait in line for a table allocation before ordering. It's worth it. You then order at the counter and get your food in 15 minutes or so at your table. Everything is super fresh and made to order. I can recommend both the Pepito and the Woodland Mushroom. It's interesting to have something on a yeasted bread that tastes Mexican, but it makes me want to go to Mexico again.After our delicious dinner, we had some churros, ice cream (with a delicious praline that included bacon, yes, bacon), caf con leche, and melted chocolate mixed with almond milk. Rick Bayless may be a celebrity chef, but he's still working the details in his restaurants. He was working on the ice cream machine when we were there. Super impressed that someone of his caliber is still making sure every little thing is perfect.In summary, go here. You may have to share a table with people you've never met, but enjoy it, make some friends with both the people and the food.
