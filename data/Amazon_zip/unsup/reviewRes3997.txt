How awesome is this place you ask? Well to simply say it....It's out of this world. It's one of those things where it's like OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M EATING THIS!! Trying to get a seat at this place is almost impossible. It takes time and a certain love for food. It took me about 3 months of calling a few times a week for about 5-10 mins to even get though. At first I was scared that it wasn't going to be worth it, but I'm glad I was proven wrong, very wrong. It was a 9 course meal and then they give your some more. The menu changes pretty often from what I hear. Every dish to us was a suprise and the experience was unlike any other. The chefs made it an experience. I've never been at a place where the chefs come out and talk to you and joke around with you. That in it self was awesome. You look into the kitchen and you know they're having the time of their lives. One of the most memorable dish had hamachi fish sashimi and maple whip cream with bacon. AMAZING!!! It was the prefect compliment to each other. Something that was out of this world. It's just not right that something tastes that good. Even though everyone talks about the quail egg ravioli. I'm going to have to say it again....that's it's AMAZING! That burst of favor in your mouth.....one of the best dishes of the night. At the end of the meal, I was pretty sad that it ended. I wanted to keep eating, and it's a place that I would love to go again. If I can get lucky again and get reservations..... -Newbs-
