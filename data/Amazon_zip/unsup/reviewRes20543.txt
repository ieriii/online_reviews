my friends and i paid a visit to the gage after realizing that valentine's day is a big restaurant holiday, and getting reservations at any restaurant is impossible. so needless to say, the gage was not our top choice, but i was pleasantly surprised. i know what you're thinking..."but it's on by millennium park/it's a tourist trap." i thought the same thing, but from the minute we walked in, my friends and i were greeted warmly, seated at our booth promptly, and given warm bread. warm bread is definitely the way to my heart. i was also really surprised by their music selection---the xx, ratatat, arcade fire, and yeah yeah yeahs. definitely not what i expected. our waitress was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions without the slightest hint of pretension or impatience, even when we were waiting for the other half of our party to arrive. she, along with several other bussers, came by frequently to refill water and offer drinks while we waited.  i ordered the locally crafted sausages, which came with crispy potatoes with melted brie. oh, my. there were 3 different types of sausage, all with a really nice snap, and the potatoes. ohhh, the potatoes. they are prepared in a small cast iron pot, so every piece of potato that touched the sides were perfectly crispy while still soft and starchy in the middle. the brie was a perfect complement. i also shared bites of food off my friends plate--roasted chicken, poutine, fondue, and scallops. all of which were yummy.  so while i'm not sure that the gage will make it on my regular rotation of restaurants, i am definitely glad that i tried it. i'll definitely be back when the occasion calls for it.
