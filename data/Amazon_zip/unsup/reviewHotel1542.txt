My husband and I stayed at this hotel last week. Overall, this hotel was just ok. I give it three starts because it did the job, but I probably wouldn't stay there again when I go back to Chicago. The room was big, it is in a great location, the view was nice, there were plenty of pillows, a spacious bathroom, and the staff was very friendly. What I wasn't too crazy about was of course, like most reviewers mentioned, the elevator. I mean, come on!!! There are two sets of two elevators; one set for the bottom half of the hotel and the other of course, for the top half. You'd think that this would help the situation, but it actually didn't. I mean, one of our two elevators was out of service the entire time we were there. Between pressing the button to call for the elevator and getting off at whatever floor we wanted took literally about 8-10 minutes each time!!! Holy crap, invest some money and get those things fixed. Did I mention that each elevator can only hold 7-8 people WITHOUT luggage??? Ok, that said, there were just a couple other things that I would have liked different. For example, they had a coffee maker in the room and gave us coffee packets but no sugar or cream, not even powdered. The shower had absolutely no water pressure, so it took forever to wash the shampoo out of my hair. And the hallways were really dismal and depressing looking. There is also a huge gap between the room door and the hallway, so you might want to put a towel or something down to block out some of the voices, because you can hear every word spoken. I was also disappointed that there was no restaurant/bar in the lobby. It is actually being renovated, but I knew that before we went on the trip by reading yelp reviews. :) They made up for it however, by rolling out a large cart (not as tacky as it sounds) and serving drinks in the lobby. We had a great time in Chicago, and like I said the location was great and we didn't spend much time in the room so the stay was bearable...
