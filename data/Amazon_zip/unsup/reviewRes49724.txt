I came to Bin 36 with my boyfriend from a recommendation from a close friend- since we only had 1 night in Chicago, we hoped this would be a worthwhile dinner. We were here early on a week night so it wasn't particularly crowded which I preferred, and honestly the atmosphere and unpretentious attitude made me like our dinner even more. We started with the hummus (AMAZING) and I had the salmon, while my boyfriend chose the pork belly with cod. We matched our dinners with wine pairings recommended from the restaurant (there are lots of options, but it's surprisingly not confusing) and both entrees were five stars. Coming from New York we are picky....but this food is fresh, smart and tasty. We thankfully over indulged and also tried the banana dessert (I forget the name now) and apple cider donuts which were well worth it. On top of all this, our waitress was sweet and super attentive. Honestly, this place is awesome.
