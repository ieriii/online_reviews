Meh.. I've been to revolution a few times and have never been impressed on anything food-wise.. So its not exactly my go to, my boyfriend likes it for some reason though he actually had to trick me by ordering take out and refusing to tell me where it came from into having their duck confit salad which was the only super tasty dish i've had there. The staff is nice. I just saw they had a brunch menu so maybe after that salad i had perhaps i'll try again.
