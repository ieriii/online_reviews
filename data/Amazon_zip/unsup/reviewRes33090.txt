True, the food here isn't lovingly made to order. It isn't the highest quality middle eastern food in Chicago by any stretch.  Yet I love Sultan's Market for what it is. I love the cafeteria vibe and the plates with separations on them. I love that the food is ready in seconds. The food is not only always good - it's always the SAME. I love that the people who work here are always friendly but focused. And I sort of love how they casually throw the food onto the plates. I even love how dark and sort of creepy it feels in there. Sultan's Market is one my favorite places to eat in this area. It's real food that fills your belly, and you can have a big lunch here without feeling sleepy when you head back to work (of course I always substitute the rice with salad). They make the food on the bland side, but there's a full selection of hot sauce and salt and extra tahini. The delivery, which I ordered often when I lived in Bucktown, is fast.  And even though I live in Albany Park, well known for having the best middle eastern food in Chicago - rightly so - I still find myself looking forward to days when I'm in Wicker Park and I can stop at Sultan's Market. I don't wholly understand why.
