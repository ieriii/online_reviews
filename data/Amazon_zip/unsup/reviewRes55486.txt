Well, I can't agree with Bruce A. that this place is the best italian in the city but it is up there. The space is nice on the inside but the outside is perfect. What happens in the winter when it's just the indoor space?Our group had the antipasto platter to start and all good flavors, from the fresh proscuitto to the grilled veggies. I had the parpardelle pasta with the veal ragu- and it was DELICIOUS!! My friends had the risotto and the fish special of the night and both said they enjoyed their meal. I truly want to give this place 4.5stars but you have to choose between 4 or 5 and 5 is far to high for any place unless they shine my shoes whiles dining.Give it a try, you'll be happy and leave feeling like you got your monies worth.
