I have eaten quite a bit of pizza in my day, and this comes in 2nd place behind Lou's for deep dish pizza. I have read a couple reviews below of people talking about how deep dish pizza is not very good and not pizza. These people DO NOT know pizza and the variety in which it can be presented for your mouth and taste buds. Pequod's has a very distinct taste. It has definitely set itself apart from Lou's in this fashion which is great because it gives me some variety on great deep dish pizza. The pepperoni was excellent. The crust it not as flavorful as Lou's but the cheese is very good and the sauce is unique and tasty. The reason I gave this location 3 stars only is because the wait and seating was AWFUL. When we got there they told us it would be about 30 minutes. Well we ended up waiting for over an hour to be seated. They do not have a waiting area and therefore if it is cold outside you are forced to stand inside pushing against other peoples tables. Not only is it awkward for you as people are squeezing by, but it also is unpleasant to be eating while people are surrounding you to wait for their table. I will be trying the Morton Grove location. Hopefully the layout will be better
