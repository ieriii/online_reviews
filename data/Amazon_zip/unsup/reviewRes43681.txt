I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday for dinner and we really enjoyed ourselves. After doing some research on all of the top notch steak houses in the city, Kinzie was the most reasonably priced and was much more intimate than the rest. We went on Saturday night and it was packed! Thankfully I made reservations. To make this short and sweet we started off with: Appetizer: Calamari -Fresh, lightly fried w/ an amazing mayo based (spicy) sauce which was to die for!! Sides: Sauteed Spinach & Mushroom -This was great but the only downside to this was that it was mostly mushroom w/ very little spinach. I was expecting spinach not ALL mushroom...still a great side Lyonnaise Potato Gratin -This was so flavorful BUT I was not expecting so many damn onions! I took 3 bites of which all consisted of more onions than potatoes. Again, this was great, but if I would of known it was so many onions I may have thought twice about ordering it. Entree: 16oz Delmonico -I absolutely enjoyed this! It was soo juicy & full of flavor! I chose the Gorgonzola Cream as my sauce & it was delicious. This was worth every bit of $30. 18oz Kansas City -My boyfriend LOVED this, I'm not sure what side he had but it was prepared PERFECTLY. All in all I WILL return here! The waiting staff was prompt and knowledgeable. The only downside was that some of the dishes (Delmonico Gorgonzola cream & lyonnaise potato gratin) were too creamy. I was unaware that they were dairy based & this caused me quit a bit of pain once my dinner was complete (lactose intolerant). It was also my BF birthday & they brought out a cheescake w/ a candle w/ Birthday spell BISHDAY on it. This actually shouldn't even be a downside because it was so hilarious...perfect way to end a beautiful night! lol
