Started with probably the best bread I've ever had...Warm, fresh-baked and fluffy. It was memorable (to say the least.) The waitress was cheerful and on-the-ball. The decor is fun and kitschy / touristy -- feels like you're in a remodeled restaurant in Europe.  Unfortunately the rest left something to be desired. The specialty chicken stuffed with sausage was truly average, and I could live without it for the rest of my life. It tasted like stale chicken from Jewel. It was traumatically 'blah'. And the place isn't cheap. (Even with the yelp deal.) Keep in mind, Romanian wine in general isn't very memorable, either. So I'd go for beer.
