Went to Glenn's for dinner last night with 4 friends. We had all been there many times before. I had made the reso Monday. As we were being seated at our table, we were informed that they are NOT byob on Tuesday. Why wasn't I told this at the time I made the reservation? 4 out of the 5 ordered the crab legs which were great. Our other diner ordered the sturgeon which was bloody. Our waiter took it back to the kitchen and then returned with it and let her know that it was the bloodline. Really? Shouldn't that be removed? Not good. The manager did come over and offer her something else, but our waiter, Bill, made no effort to rectify the situation, nor did he apologize. There was also and 18% gratuity added to our bill, after taxes, for a party of 5. What? Sorry, Glenn, but this was an extremely disappointing outing for our group and this seems to be happening a bit more frequently than not. Also, Wednesday is no longer all you can eat ribs. You need to update your web page.
