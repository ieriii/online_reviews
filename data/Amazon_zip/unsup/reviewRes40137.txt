I just had to put in a little word on the service at San Soo Gab San. I read other yelpers' reviews and assumed I'd be disappointed with the service, but we were impressed. The women stopped by periodically to help us with the grill (we are novices, they could tell) and to refill water, etc. No complaints! Service aside, the food was incredible. Great place for adventurous eaters since you get what looked like 15 side dishes to try along with your main course. Yes - you will smell smoky when you leave, but it builds for a great casual and fun atmosphere, I thought. All in all we loved it and will definitely return!
