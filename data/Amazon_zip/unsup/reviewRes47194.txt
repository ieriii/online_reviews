Best burger & beer of my life!! Everyone at our table (6 total) agreed. Service was extraordinary too. Tall blonde Katie (the only server with no visible tatoos) was as sweet as she is gorgeous - and she is a font of info about craft beers and what kind goes well with what burger & individual preferences. Music was a bit loud, but will not keep us from becoming regulars.
