Just went there this past weekend for my first visit. There was no wait on a Friday night and we had a nice seat in the bar area. The band was great--not too loud or overpowering. Everyone in my party of four had something different and we all loved our meals. I highly recommend the gnocci and gorgenzola! The lobster ravoli was also a hit!!Desserts were a bit small portions compared to the large dinner sizes!
