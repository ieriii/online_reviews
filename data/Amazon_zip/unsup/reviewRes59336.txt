I dont even know what I ordered when I went here the one time I did, but I continued to order. Never have I seen such a huge and delectible menu. I could not stop ordering more sushi once I ate what I had. Ended up spending like $50 dollars on me alone and I felt like a glutton, but I was like a kid on christmas morning who could not stop unwrapping.
