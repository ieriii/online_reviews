My husband and I went there to celebrate our anniversary last night. It was the best night! The atmosphere is beautiful and perfect for a cold, winter night like last night. The service was impeccable (granted it was Monday night). We had a wonderful corner booth seat in the back and were uninterrupted the entire night. We just had the best time. We ordered a fantastic bottle of Pinot Gris and we each ordered a bowl of soup to warm us up from the terribly cold night. He got a spicy soup with ox tail and noodles and I got crab meat and asparagus. Both soups were delicious. Then we shared an appetizer of shrimp lettuce wraps. The shrimp was cooked on sugar cane and the flavors were so fresh. Nothing we ate the whole night was heavy or rich - everything was light and fresh. My husband ordered a beef dish for his entree and really enjoyed it. I had the sea bass and we shared an order of shrimp fried rice. Every single thing we ate was wonderful. To end the night we shared a banana wonton with chocolate ganache and vanilla ice cream - it was out of this world amazing. We ordered a lot and I didn't feel stuffed like I was going to fall into a food coma - everything was so fresh and nothing was heavy or coated with butter or cream sauces. We were able to try many many dishes and we never felt like we over did it..... The atmosphere, the wine, the food, the service all spectacular. We had the best night and felt warm, cozy, relaxed and the staff made us feel welcome. It was fantastic!!!!
