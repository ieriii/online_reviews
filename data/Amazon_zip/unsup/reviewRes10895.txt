Piece is pizza done right. I love the beers that are brewed right there. Three choices for sauce. My preference is the Red sauce with some sort of meat topping and veggie topping. (normally sausage/artichoke heart) If you want to go there, try going on a weekday during slower hours for quality service and quality food. During weekends prime-time hours (7-9PM) it gets packed and is about a hour wait for a table.
