Anteprima is not your traditional Italian red tablecloth establishment but a more charming neighborhood restaurant with a less extensive, but more eclectic, menu. And this is exactly why I like Anteprima - the dishes are unique and well prepared - but if you're craving your grandma's lasagna or spaghetti bolognese, you may want to head down to Topo Gigio in Old Town.  My favorite dish is the orecchiette with lamb sausage, which has a little kick to it. The restaurant itself is small and popular; be sure to make a reservation, especially on the weekend. Also, it's a bit cramped and loud in a way that adds, rather than deters, from the ambience. All in all, Anteprima is one of my go-to Andersonville restaurants.
