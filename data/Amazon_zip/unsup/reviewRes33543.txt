Oh, Yolk . . . how you toy with our emotions. I've been to Yolk twice now with a group of friends and both times have garnered mixed reviews. And, from those reviews, I've come to the conclusion that Yolk does some entrees really well (like the eggs benedict, the stuffed French toast, and the strawberry orange juice) but others not so well (the Hey Ricky omelette, the Irish Benny, and the specialty pancakes). I love the look and concept of this place and they have so many unique menu selections, but you definitely have to order the right thing to have an overall delightful experience. I really wish I liked this place more. Maybe third time will be a charm . . .
