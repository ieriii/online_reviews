Went here for a noon lunch on Thursday based on all the positive reviews, the legendary reputation of Rick Bayless, and all the praises that it gets on shows like Unique Eats. As expected, the place was packed, and it's a pretty small place so there's not much room to move around. However, I commend the staff for putting an ordering and seating system in place that was very efficient and quick considering the large crowd. If you want to send a friend to "save a table" while you order, it ain't happening! So everything on the menu looked appetizing, but I decided to go with the Ahogada, a sandwich containing carnitas, black bean, and pickled onions served in a bowl with a spicy tomato chile broth. Think of it as a Mexican version of the French dip sandwich. For dessert I went with the highly touted churros with chocolate sauce. After waiting for a while, I was seated along a wall mounted ledge right next to some other diners. Needless to say the seating was cramped, but this was no surprise. After waiting for some time, my sandwich came and I was excited to dig in. The Ahogada is served cut in half with the cut sides down in the broth. I went in for my first bite and was shocked at how salty it was. I love salt, I throw salt on everything, but this broth was inedible and overpowered the otherwise delicious flavor of the sandwich itself. Honestly, it was as if they used reduced water from the Dead Sea to make this broth. I ate the rest of the sandwich that wasn't already dipped, and left the rest of the salty liquid alone. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed and considered it a waste of $10 that I would have rather spent at Panera... sad but true. As a consolation prize, the churros and chocolate sauce were phenomenal and helped to get rid of the bad taste in my mouth. I know the staff puts a lot of painstaking effort to deliver a spin on Mexican street food. I hope this bad meal was a fluke and I am willing to give this place one more chance.
