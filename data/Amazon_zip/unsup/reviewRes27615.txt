We arrived there a little after 7 pm on a Thursday night and the place was very crowded.   This was our first time visit and we decided to wait for an hour to get seated.  We ordered trio sampling of ceviche as an appetizer. For the entrees we ordered grilled mahi mahi, red chili marinated pork loin, and red chili grilled rib steak.  The ceviche tasted very fresh . The grilled rib steak was perfectly cooked as we ordered and was very delicious. The grilled mahi mahi had great flavor. Overall, the food was good and the service was excellent. However, there was no entree that was exceptional for us to wait for an hour to dine at this restaurant again.
