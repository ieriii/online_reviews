Very mediocre quality food. There really isn't anything special about this place except the mural outside. I've gone here several times and have never been impressed.To it's credit, the food is authentic, but bland and very greasy. There are much better choices (Milagro, Cucina Mundial)I honestly believe the positive reviews are primarily based on all the hype this place gets. As stated before, the food isn't bad, it just isn't good.  Perhaps it's the atmosphere or the large crowds, I really don't know.
