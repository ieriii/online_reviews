We came early, but it was very busy because people were eating before the Blackhawks game. I was disappointed we were seated so close to the very busy and loud serving area. However, the house Merlot was good and after the first glass I thought it was very entertaining to watch the chefs, especially when they carved the delicious looking gyro meat. My husband's grilled octopus was very good. My sea bass was very good. Our older son loved the salmon dinner. Our younger did not care for the grilled chicken kabob, but he liked the rice and some of his brother's salmon. We tried the flaming cheese appetizer and it was delicious. The bread they serve with dinner was a little disappointing. A side of pita bread might have been better. The waiter Themis was great. He was especially good with our youngest son who is 7. We will likely be back, but since we don't go to Chicago often, we will probably try another Greek Town restaurant for comparison next time we are in that neighborhood.
