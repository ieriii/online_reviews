This place is great! The food is really tasty and fun. I can't wait to return. I ordered the Dakota Seoul Steak which was delicious - twist on the Philly Steak with bulgolgi and spicy sauce. Others in my group ordered the bowls and the chicken sandwich which held their own. We didn't order the chicken wings and by tasting the sandwich alone I know I'll back for more. The service keeps up with the food. This is a fast food style - sandwich/korean restaurant so the decor is not going to be overwhelming. The gentleman behind counter was informative and fun! My only negative is that there isn't one in the city or south side! I think I actually asked if they would deliver to me - knowing well that it was too far. That's how good it is, I already want more!
