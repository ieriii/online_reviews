Just can't give this 4 stars. Some entrees we had were outstanding -- Paris mushroom/truffle pasta, pork belly. Others were below average -- pork meatballs were rubbery and tasteless (comped on our bill), special sea bass was fishy tasting. The bone marrow app was more pomp and circumstance than tasty. Beet salad was same I can get everywhere. Desserts -- chocolate and lemon merigue pie -- were very yummy. Our server barely cracked a smile and left us for long periods of time. We were sitting staring at dirty dishes for 20 minutes and she walzes up to ask if we wanted more drinks -- uh, could you clear the garbage first before you try and get more money out of us? Ambiance was nice but the music was too loud (but we were seated right under the speaker). More of a club/restaurant than a restaurant. Won't be back.
