Four out of five stars with over 350 reviews? You don't need me to tell you this place is great. Got a babysitter and went here on a Saturday night. Had reservations for 7:15, got there about 6:50, checked in, and proceeded to the bar. At 7:16, they came and found us and led us to our table. Our server, Patrick, was probably the coolest server we've ever had at any restaurant, ever. Think Tim Roth from Pulp Fiction, that's who he reminded us of. Anyway, great service aside, the food was amazing. Started with the cheese plate, which was fabulous. Moved on to the scallops, which were amazing. Then I had the sausages and my wife had the Amish chicken, both were absolutely delicious, although I definitely preferred the sausages to the chicken (seriously, some of the best sausage, if not THE best sausage I've ever had). For desert, I had the white chocolate creme brulee and my wife had some sort of chocolate cake thing. Again, both were great. For all that, plus 5 long island iced teas and a glass of pinot gris, we escaped with a total bill of about $160 before tip but after tax. If you ask me, it was absolutely worth it. My only regret is that we didn't try this place sooner, seeing as how we've lived 2 blocks away for about 3 months now.
