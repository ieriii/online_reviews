Hate this hotel. It is basically an old dump that has been dressed up with some snazzy decors. The bathrooms are horrendous in the rooms...barely functional. My room had a horrible perfumey (almost like the car christmas tree smell) scent to it. The location inside the loop is nice, but there is nothing to do down here at night. I always avoid this hotel when I can. The Wit is 1000x better hotel.
