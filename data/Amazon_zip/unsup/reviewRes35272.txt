I don't even like duck. But. I LOVE duck here. I could go on and on about how great the duck is, but the 500 reviews below me seem to cover the bases. But of a group of 10 people, only 2 people entered liking duck, and all 10 left loving duck. I think that's pretty convincing. Other things we tried were some amazing ginger cocktails that tasted like they had no alcohol in them but were super gingery and delicious, some pretty good dumplings (I would just save room for the duck), and some pretty outstanding honey roasted pork. And it came out to about $10 per person. Which is totally ridiculous for the amount of food we consumed and the fact that we had leftovers. Just go here. You won't regret it.
