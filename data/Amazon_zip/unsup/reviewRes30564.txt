The piano lounge area here is lively. You can eat your dinner at a table in this area or at the bar if you want to be in the mix and avoid the stuffy feel of many of Chicago's steak spots. And the people-watching is certainly amusing in this section too. Even though Mastro's is a few blocks removed from the famed Viagra Triangle, my buddy and I did get to play a few rounds of the everyone's favorite guessing game, "Daughter or Date?" (I won.) We order the 48 oz. double cut porterhouse, medium rare, which arrived with a lot of fanfare, sizzling loudly, much to the delight of the onlookers. Shortly after the plate landed, a few other people in the area came by our table and asked to be photographed with our meat. The initial shock at the boldness of such a request abated when I realized they were talking about the steak, which you'll acknowledge was pretty indeed. I've posted the pics here to prove it, so if you haven't hit your drool quotient of the day, check them out. Taste-wise, this steak is securely in the top 5 in Chicago.
