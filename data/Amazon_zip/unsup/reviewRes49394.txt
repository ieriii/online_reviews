This is honestly the best bakery I have come across yet. The outside of the bakery decieves you into thinking it may just be a hole in the wall, but once you come in, you are amazed at all the amazing looking cakes and pastries that are visible. The cakes resemble the kind of cakes that are found on the show, "cake boss." The pastries are unbelievable too as you just dont know which to choose, they all look amazing!!! I am currently on a mission to try each and every one, and so far I have no complaints, they each taste as good as they look! YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE!!
