I am not a deep-dish pizza fan. I'm sorry, I just can't do it. It's like eating pizza-cake. There's too much cheese, the ingredients overwhelm each other...it's just not for me. I do, however, love me some thin crust. And Piece is possibly the greatest place on the planet to get said thin crust. Their New Haven style pizzas are huge, and they have a pretty extensive list of possible toppings (seriously...mashed potatoes are even on there.) I've tried the white and the plain styles, and while I'd be more than willing to try the others, I just can't break away from the plain style. It. Is. AMAZING. You should know, I'm not a huge cheese person, so I don't like globs of mozzarella all over my pizza. The plain showcases the delicious sauce quite well, and the parmesan adds just the right amount of sharpness without being overly cheesy. They are not stingy on their toppings, either (I recommend sausage and spinach, but honestly, everything is good). Piece is also a brewery, and their brew master has won a ton of awards. All of their beers have hilarious names ("full frontal pale ale" anyone?), and generally don't disappoint. Piece gets pretty crowded during weekends, so try to go at odd times or during the week...but you have to go. Like, now. Really. It's delicious.
