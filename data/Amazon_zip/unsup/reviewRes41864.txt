I'm a little late in posting this review, but I figured better late than never. I'd actually give it 3.5 stars, but since we don't have that option, I'd actually prefer to round down on this one. My boyfriend and I went during restaurant week, and the whole experience was just ok. Not bad, not phenomenal (as I was expecting) - just ok. It wasn't the service or the atmosphere - it was the steak. For some reason, it just didn't have a lot of flavor to me. You'd think all that butter and the scorching hot plate would create a flavor explosion, but it didn't. Also, the mashed potatoes weren't that great either. However, the chocolate dessert was amazing. I think we'll give it a shot again, but I wasn't blown away from the first impression.
