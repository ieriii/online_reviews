Ah xoco. Love you in the summer. Think of a cute little restaurant in Italy/ Spain and thats what you have here. Outdoor seating so you can people watch and sandwiches to help you get over the 5pm craving. I tried the Chicken Tinga and it was pretty delish, i loved the dipping sauce that you get to put on it. Couldnt get enough of the stuff! Oh and dont forget the churro at the end.. crunchy and sweet and comes with a little chocolate dipping saucer.. so yum! Atmosphere is cute and has cafe feel to it. The lines are typically long, but once you order, the server brings food to your table.
