OMG!!! Meat heaven is all I can say. I love how they only give you the small portions. This is the perfect way to sample everything. I made the mistake of going to the gorgeous salad bar and my friend had to stop me. Its so appealing and has such a great selection. The meat was all so tender and flavorful. It was hard to let go and stop eating. All of the gouchos were so friendly and nice you can't help but to wanna go back. We had a 5:30pm reservation which seemed to be the right time because it got crowded quick after we were seated. Loved it. Will be back ....
