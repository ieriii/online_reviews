I loved coast!! went there with a few good friends and a few bottles of wine the other night and had a great time!! The atmosphere here is inviting and perfect for conversation. We tried a bunch of different rolls but I highly recommend the Coast crab roll and the White dragon roll. All in all a great experience I can't wait to go back!
