My first time here was last Friday and my second time here will be tonight! 2 Friday nights off in a row, a true delight! GE is THE restaurant to go to for outstanding, gastro-eccentric dishes for GREAT PRICES! 4 start food for 3 star prices! Popcorn instead of bread, lobster corn dogs.. The man is a genius and it shows on every plate.
