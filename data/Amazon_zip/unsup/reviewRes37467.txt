Great ready to eat food selection, but it s also very expensive, we used to spend 60 dollars for to go full dinner + soft drinks for 2 people, which is only 20 dollars less than what you can have at a restaurant But their fine food ( like cheese and cured meat or other hard to find europeans ingredients ) choice is good if you re looking for something specific
