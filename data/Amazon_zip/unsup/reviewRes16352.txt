A feast not just for your stomach but for your eyes as well! The decor and atmosphere in this restaurant are amazing. The drinks and food are also great as well. I recommend the Ropa Vieja/Cuban Braised Beef as a starter. It's an excellent place for a group gathering. Be sure to make reservations ahead of time.
