My family loves this hotel, and always stays here when they come in town. The staff are friendly, and the rooms are nice and clean. We had blocked off some rooms for our wedding guests, and it was fairly easy to set up, and none of our guests had any problems. The hotel is in a great location, it is on a quiet street but very close to Rush St. and Michigan Ave.
