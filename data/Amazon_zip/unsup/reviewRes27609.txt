Just fabulous pizza! Ordered a spinach deep dish with half pepperoni and half sausage. It arrived on time and piping, finger-burning hot. Wonderful tomato-ey sauce, plenty of meat, great carmalized cheese on the crust and good crust base. They'll be my first choice next time I'm looking for deep dish delivery.  Great the next day, too...
