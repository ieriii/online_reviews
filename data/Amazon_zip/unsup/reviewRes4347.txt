I'm still reeling from my experience. I love jazz, and I appreciate live jazz music, which led me here - but who knew this seemingly dark hole in the wall with the garish green lighting outside is full of such Chicago history - mobsters, jazz, and beautiful decor. From the outside, it doesn't seem like much. Walking inside, you're greeted with an imposing man who demands $12 for cover. Not bad for live music (or so I initially think). The place is packed. It's about 9:30 pm on a Saturday night, and the jazz band is about to play their second set. There was no where to stand, either at the bar, or at the front of the stage. No where to sit either. Just lots of elbowing, pushing, and shoving. Finally, my group of five girls huddle in the coat closet area...we start eyeing the patrons in their comfortable booths. Finally, two spots open at the bar, score! Half a booth opens, score! THEN, the whole booth opens, and all five of us girls squeeze. This is after standing tortuously for an hour or so, but after we sat down, the show got considerably more enjoyable. The live jazz was absolutely engaging, warm, lively, and very upbeat. We heard two sets, and stayed til midnight. The music was sooo good. The drinks were also very cheap. The cover was totally worth it for the great conversation, cheap drinks, and AWESOME live music. And for bragging rights to say that I have been to one of the most historic jazz clubs in the US.
