I love apartheid. This is my favorite thai in the city. The prices are great, the portions are perfect, the ambiance is really nice, and the servers are quick and friendly. Excellent Pad Thai, really good Panang Curry. The Tiger Cry appetizer is amazing. I've never had anything bad here, and I've been at least 12 times. Great place for an easy meal or a nice date.
