This place lives up to the hype! Yes, its one of the hardest reservations to get in the country. Yes, they might cancel on you. Once you get there though you are in for a treat. You can tell that the chefs put a ton of work and thought into their original and inventive food. The rabbit and quail egg ravioli were my favorite dishes. the potato soup inspired by Wendys potato bar was off the hook. This isnt your standard upscale eating. Its cool. Dont expect the norm. Leave all expectations in your car and have a fantastic meal.
