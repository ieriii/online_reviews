finally got to check this place out! 40 min wait on a thursday afternoon. a lot faster than i expected. doug was super nice! =) i got the fois gras dog which was pretty bomb. really rich but sooooo good. i also got the keira knightly fire dog with everything on it...also very good. my friends and i got some cheesy fries to share as well. who would have thought that people would be lining up to eat hot dogs? so simple and totally worth it. =)
