This place is a pretty cool place to grab a beer and get some pretty decent pizza and watch sports.  The pizza's are gourmet, but they are are huge, and they have some pretty good options for how you want it made. My cousin and I ordered a medium and we didn't even come close to eating half of it. I sucked down a few of their house brews, and had a good time.  The only complaint would be that the tables are really close to each other and its hard not to bump into the person next to you when trying to get back and forth from the table.
