I been to this place a few times and I always go just before opening and on fridays, the wait is around 20-30mins. Foie Gras Hot Dog is awesome, but lots of fat, very heavy & rich. If you come with a friend, I only recommend that you share one, and try other stuff. Actually I recommend 1/2 foie gras dog per person. The duck fat fries lack in favor, but it is worth trying if you never had it. The portion is large and shareable between 4 people. Hot Doug's also has hot dogs made with exotic meats and their menu always changes. The prices for these special dogs and the foie gras dog is around $7-10. I also recommend that you get one of their regular chicago dogs. It's about $2 and it's the best I've had in the city and I have tried a few highly rated places.
