We've been in here to eat and have gotten delivery a couple times. Meh. Nothing HUGELY impressive. Anytime we've gone, service has been pretty decent. The waitresses are all friendly and nice. Attentive, too. Food is ok. I don't see anything amazing about their burgers, but they do have some great options for the "Triple Secret" where you can pick your own toppings. We ordered delivery from them last night and they sent one of the wrong burgers (boo!). I called, they sent a new one with no hassle (it took about 20 min--like the person I spoke to said it would which kind of stinks when you're hungry and the other person already got their food). Fifty/50 isn't something I'll crave or be DYING to go to more than just occasionally.
