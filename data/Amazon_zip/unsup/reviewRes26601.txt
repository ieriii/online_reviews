Don't know if there's anything I can add that hasn't already been said. This place is absolutely amazing. Went there for the first time a couple months ago and I've been back about 3 times since. The nachos are unreal but filling and hard to stop eating so be careful. They come with I believe either 6 or 12 chips and the chips are covered in beans, cheese, sour cream and guac. They're amazing. I've tried a bunch of different items from tacos to burritos to enchiladas. They're all super tasty. Love that I live near this place, a good spot with good friendly service. Cash only so make sure to hit the ATM prior (they also have one there).
