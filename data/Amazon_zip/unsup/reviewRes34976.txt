Went there for a Sunday brunch. $48 per person. Four different stations - cold one with OYSTERS! and other sushi/seafood stuff; traditional one with brunch things and CRAB cakes (awesome), one with omelette and such, and a desert station. Given the price tag, you need to really like sea food to justify it. I love oysters and I was not disappointed. They also have cold and hot crab legs. Service was good. Attentive, not overwhelming. Other than amazing seafood items, there is really nothing super special about it. Drinks are rather expensive. Bloody was $8. Beer started at $6 I think. I would go back for oysters although shucking got a bit more sloppy as the day went on (maybe they wanted me to stop coming back for them).
