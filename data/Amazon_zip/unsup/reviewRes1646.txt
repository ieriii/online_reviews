You've seen it on the Travel Channel. You've read about it in the Redeye and the Chicago Reader. You've heard about it from co-workers, but you still haven't gone. Why not? Hot Doug's is a quality place to get some good eats. Sure you have to wait in line, but trust me it really isn't all THAT bad, it moves quickly and you make friends with the people who are just as eager as you to try the duck fat fries and foie gras topped sausages. If you go during the week, the duck fat fries aren't an option, but the wait is considerably less. If you do end up venturing to this mecca of meaty goodness, take caution and check the website before you leave. Hot Doug's is owned by, you guessed it, Doug and he does take vacations from time (who can blame him? he works all week, every week) and so the shop can be closed certain holidays. Also, it is CASH ONLY so be sure to hit up an ATM. This isn't your average hot dog joint and they specialize in exotic sausages, not hot dogs. So if you are looking for you classic Chicago style dog, your best bet is your local hot dog stand (Hot Doug's certainly sells Chi style dogs, but they are made with caramelized onions, which in my opinion makes them too soggy). The only reason I give Hot Doug's four stars instead of five is that it isn't the most accessible place to get to, but its worth the trek. So take your taste buds on an epic journey and try the game of the week (especially if its the mountain man sausage) with some duck fat fries. Its worth standing in line for an hour and your mouth will be glad you did (even if you cholesterol levels aren't).
