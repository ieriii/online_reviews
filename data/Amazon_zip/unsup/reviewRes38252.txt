Everyone in the group loved it!!! We waited forever for our food, even though we placed our food order right after we put our names in. That was a cool way of ordering. Their Chicago style deep dish was amazing. Real cheesy, but amazing. At this point though, we were just so freakin hungry we probably would've given anything they brought 5 stars! Still, I'm really glad I took our group here. Good choice.
