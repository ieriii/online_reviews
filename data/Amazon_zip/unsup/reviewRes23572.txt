I've never dined inside, but carry-out is quick and the counter guys are awesome.  I could eat a steak sandwich from here every damn day of the week. EDIT: I've dined-in a few times now and it's just as lovely (albeit crowded). A recent remodel of the place makes it all a bit more polished but still the good ol' Irazu we know and heart.
