Over 2000 reviews and I am doing an update? Well I just have to tell someone about the smoked knockwurst special sausage I had. It was the best sausage I have ever had. Doug also added a 4 cheese Mayo and fried onions rings sprinkles. Every bit was pure heaven. I would hope he makes this one a regular on his menu.
