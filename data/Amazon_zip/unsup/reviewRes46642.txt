I went to RJ Grunt's last Sunday hoping to land a spot for a late brunch. Unfortunately, a little too late, as while we were waiting the brunch buffet was taken down. Persistent, my date and I stuck around for lunch, she having been there before and raving about the burger she ordered on her last visit. We started our meal with Chips, Salsa & Guacamole and really enjoyed the light starter. We also ordered a milkshake each (mine was chocolate-banana, hers was strawberry-banana) and the entire time all I could think of was Daniel Plainfield telling that kid in "There Will Be Blood" that he was going to drink his milkshake. Thank you, Daniel Day-Lewis. For entrees we each had a burger, she had the Bacon Burger (which she loved) served with homemade chips. I had the Works burger which was also really good, but I subbed in Mexican rice as a side. The rice was pretty much bad-- dry, lacking flavor and just sub-par to be honest. The sides, in general, were lacking as far as selection goes and was the only real flaw I found in the entire meal. Not a bad place and if you want to get your name on the list early and come back, I am sure the brunch is fantastic, too. I would definitely go back-- I did enjoy my meal and the atmosphere-- but was not good enough to make me want to frequent the place. (What can I say? I like side dishes.)
