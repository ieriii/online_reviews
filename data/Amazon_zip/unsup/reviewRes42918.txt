I arrived in downtown Chicago after a METRA ride and commute on the EL. I was craving some Chicago-style pizza. My siblings and I went to the Art of Pizza. The pizza was good and reasonable. They had a tv which was nice because we got to watch the end of the Bulls playoff game. It was very reasonable and a nice atmosphere. I would go back again.
