Pleasant place, but slippery floors; nice decor, a very nice waiter for lunch... attentive and cordial; food... good complimentary corn bread and butter. However, I was not impressed, really, with Eggs New Orleans nor the Migas brunch-type selections for lunch. The crab cakes on the ENO nothing to write home about, the brioche was not flaky, the potatoes a bit cold. So, I did like the details of cloth napkins, nice china and silverware but, at least for me, lacking in the food (brunch) department. Perhaps will try for dinner, but I doubt it.
