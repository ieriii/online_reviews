We went to check out this place on a Friday night and it was a lot of fun. We had a reservation, but it still took us a while to get seated. So of course, we entertained ourselves with some drinks. I had the Paloma and my roommate had the Deaths Door Daisy. My drink was strong and to the point, if you want to get tipsy quick, this is your drink. The Daisy was delicious, more on the fruity side. We split the heirloom tomatoes and the blackened cauliflower, both were tasty and filling. The crowd was a bit older and seemed to be trying too hard for my taste, so I don't know if I'd go back, but I did enjoy my time there.
