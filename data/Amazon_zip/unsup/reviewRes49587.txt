I can't believe only one other reviewer (Cassie B) mentioned the outstanding lunch special - soup, entree and 3 sides for $7! I wish I worked in the area so I could take advantage of it more often. Atmosphere: The interior is simple with simple wooden tables and bench seating. They keep the heat blasting during the winter so don't worry about tables near the front. Dress is casual.  Service: Far exceeded my expectations - attentive, sincerely friendly, and helpful. Also didn't rush us at all. Food: As the other reviews have indicated, simply wonderful. I now prefer corn over flour empanadas. But I wouldn't recommend it for vegetarians - meat is the star attraction here. Value: The lunch special I mentioned is an amazing value. In general, entrees range from $13 - $20. Portions are very large.
