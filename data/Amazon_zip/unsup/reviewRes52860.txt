Please visit this restaurant, and I mean that sincerely. The food is fantastic. Like the kind of food that when you take the first bite you close your eyes and cherish every bite.  The service is fantastic! Our server gave us great recommendations, although I already know if I'm having Cuban food; I want ropa vieja & some tostones. Everything was fresh and the flavors of each ingredient was distinct and beautiful.  The atmosphere is vibrant. Whether you are going with a group or on a date, it's a great location. The crowd is extremely diverse and lively. Oh and the best part, it's BYOB but you can order their "sangria mix" which takes it to a whole different level. And I'm not talkin little cherries off the bar and some bottled sangria mix. You need to check it out for yourself.
