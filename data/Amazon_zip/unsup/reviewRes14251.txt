Could have gone 2 or 3 stars here but went with 2 just to temper the overly glowing reviews this place seems to get.  Now, I live about 2 blocks away and was really looking forward to it's opening and I like that RB is close by. I would probably not go out of my way to go here. Just me, I'm sure, as it is obviously very popular. First, the service, which is on the poor side. It's not professional -you know, the kind of place where more times than not you have to ask for plates to share an appetizer, or for water or maybe even silverware. No big deal I suppose, except that's not what they aspire to be.  I've consistently had to flag down waitstaff as they don't really check on you very well at all. The food. Well some of it is good and some of it is not memorable. The pizza is a pretty good bet. I've had a burger and while there was nothing wrong with it, didn't leave me planning my next one. As for the beloved bacon popcorn, it really just falls flat for me, the popcorn itself seeming "tough" for lack of a better description. The beer is good and interesting to try different ones, though I'm sure there are plenty of places in town with more interesting and better beer. Again it's the convenience factor of being in the neighborhood.  I was very excited by the promise and potential of Revolution Brewing, but it sadly has fallen a little short. Do I go back? Yes, as it is a nice looking place and far, far better than Logan which is even closer to me.
