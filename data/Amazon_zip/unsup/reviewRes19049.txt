I love the Bapple's curvy bar, friendly bartenders, and giant selection of beer! Good to see places in my neighborhood are branching out and embracing microbrews. Decor is lovely, and I think there's a patio in the summer. One day I'll plan ahead and come here for dinner, but until then I'm happy just stopping in for a Belgian or three.
