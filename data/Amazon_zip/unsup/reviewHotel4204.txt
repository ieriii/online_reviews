So I ended up staying at this hotel because of Priceline. I think I paid $125 or so for the night. I was kind of worried because I had heard about people getting really crappy rooms off Priceline but was quite happy with the room that I received. It was quite clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was of a good size also. Unfort I did not get a room of a view of the lake but that was ok as the room over all was nice. This is a HUGE hotel that many conventions use to host the events and the guests. It is a bit impersonal compared to the boutique hotels that I have stayed at in Chicago and else where but what it really boils down to is: are the rooms and hotel well maintained and clean and do I feel safe. The answer is yes to both of these and I'd have no complaints if I were to get another room off Priceline or through the hotels website.
