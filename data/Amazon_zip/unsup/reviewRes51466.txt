Solid place for good, cheap Mexican food. Unfortunately, the quality has been slightly compromised now that it's no longer a hidden gem. The complimentary chips and salsa are good, though much less consistent these days. This is still my favorite place to order chicken flautas. Perfectly crispy, served with guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, refried beans, and rice. I usually also order a large horchata (which is humongous and I end up walking out with it). In fact, their portions are generally huge, which says a lot because I eat like a beast. They're actually slightly smaller now but, again, still definitely enough to keep you full. The very slow service is the only downside to this place. Don't expect to see your server after they bring you your food until the check. You'll see them walking around to other tables but you'll have to flag them down if you need anything else. If you're like me and drink a lot of water throughout your meal, you're better off asking for a pitcher from the get-go.
