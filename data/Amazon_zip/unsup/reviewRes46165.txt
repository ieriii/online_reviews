I came here after it being highly acclaimed by a couple of friends (I came with them...). We were here on valentines day weekend and the place was PACKED! The wait wasn't nearly as long as I thought it would be, and access to the bar beforehand made the wait not so bad. The nighttime view is astounding. Overlooking Michigan Ave all lit up was absolutely beautiful. The decor inside is very nice too. Now, on to the food! We ordered various things from the menu, but the edamame was not good at all. We actually complained and they took it off the bill, so A+ for correcting mistakes. The rest of dinner was ok, nothing out of this world. Portions were quite large. You definately will not go home hungry.  Desert? WOW. WOW. WOW. The molten chocolate cake rocked my tastebuds and I can't even begin to describe how light, fluffy, and delicious the beignets are. I had never had one before, but I can tell you for sure I'll be having them again!
