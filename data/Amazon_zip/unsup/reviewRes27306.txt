I had high hopes for this restaurant and wanted to be impressed when I went here the other night but alas I was not. The dishes were presented well but I felt that the flavors were bland and forgettable. The beet terrine was fine but fairly bland, the mac n cheese included a large piece of grit that added a nasty crunch to the dish, the whole roasted garlic cloves were overpowering, and the scallops were disappointingly bland. Nothing about these three dishes stood out for me. In addition to my mounting disappointment, I became upset at the end of the night as my fellow diners were finishing their drinks. The staff (most often the hostess) came around the corner every 5 minutes to stare down the few tables left trying to will us to hurry up and leave. While I understand that they may have had a long day and just wanted to get out of there, I don't feel it's ever right to make guests feel uncomfortable and unwanted. I left angry. Now, I must give credit where credit is due - our waitress was amazing and very accommodating, I liked the space (the bookcase/wine rack was very homey), and I loved, loved, loved the guiness gelato in my dessert. And I've always been attracted to the concept. Unfortunately the concept didn't seem to translate well and those few positive elements are not enough to convince me to go back. So sad.
