This place has a great beer selection... if you can get a second beer, that is. I've been here twice, and both times the food was just alright, but the service was horrendous! Both times I finished my first beer long before the food came, and the server never appeared until it was check time - not even to make sure the meals were ok. When I'm willing to pay way too much for imported beers, I'd appreciate being served them! I'll for sure never go back.
