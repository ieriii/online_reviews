3.5 stars. I finally made it to Mia Francesca! I basically live above this restaurant, so I don't know why it took me so long. It was pretty solid. They fit us in around 9:30 on a Friday night with a 10 min wait. We got a window seat! Yay! I liked the interior, and I didn't mind the noise, but I was also on the edge of the dining room. I do, however think the shirts the waiters have to wear are silly. They are white t-shirts with "mia franchesca" on the front and a picture on the back. On to the grub! We splurged and got an app. I usually don't like to get an app at italian restaurants because bread and a big entree are enough food, but hell, we wanted calamari! It was very good, and came out super fast. The bread came out warm and they have herb infused olive oil!!! I love herb infused olive oil. Mia's oil isn't quite as flavorful as Rose Angeles', but it's still tastes. Entrees! I got the truffle ravioli. I have come to be a ravioli addict!!!! This did not disappoint. The truffle was not overwhelming, and the rest of the flavors were great, too....but the portion was a little small for the price and in comparison to other entrees, and considering the only "expensive" part of the dish is a few drops of truffle oil (no meat, no fish) I think they can put some more raviolis on the plate! My date got a pasta dish with mushrooms an italian sausage in a red sauce. It was good, but nothing special, there wasn't enough sauce and the flavors definitely didn't blow me away, just pretty good. Our waiter wasn't very great. He was passing by our table a lot to get to his various tables (and the space is tight, so when I say "pass by" and mean squeezing by) and he rarely checked on us. We waited to order for a long time, and waited for the check for a long time. He was somewhat friendly, and definitely didn't ruin anything. I'll probably be back, but I still like Sapori and Rose Angeles better!
