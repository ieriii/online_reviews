THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! I was taken here a couple of months ago as a thank you for helping on a photo shoot in the neighborhood. We were all exhausted, underdressed, cold and hopped in at an odd hour, like 4:00 or 4:30. the place was pretty dead but the bartended was chatty and made us all the most amazing hot toddies I think ive ever had! After we sat down at a really nice table by the front windows we ordered the empanadas and fried ukka? I think. They were soo fresh and tasty. the presentation was even great! For the main course I ordered a Pistachio crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and scallion, red pepper green beans.... im telling you folks I think it was the best meal I've had YET! I we went in March! The chicken was fresh fresh and juicy. the mashed potatoes were oh so creamy and lumpy and last but not least the green beans were just how I like um, blanched, crunchy and spicy..... amazing place, I need to go back at a proper dinner hour to truly appreciate the atmosphere but who needs it when the food is so good!
