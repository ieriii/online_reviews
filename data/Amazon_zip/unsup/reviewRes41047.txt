One of the best dinners I have ever had, period. Why? Absolutely everything from the space itself, to the food, to the service... unbelievable place. I would have had this rated at 5 stars even without BYOB, but that really catapulted this place high up the list. A big 'thanks' to all the Yelpers who reviewed this, as the glowing reviews were dead on, and helped me pick this place for an evening out with the little lady. Fan-tastic. One tip: We sat down and our waiter/chef asked if he could simply cook for us, no menus, and he'd take care of us. This is by far the best way to go. You'll be constantly (and pleasantly) surprised. BUT, don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions. Because we were curious, we hit the jackpot with a huge, perfect serving of sushi grade kampachi (amberjack) that was as good as anything I've had in Hawaii. These guys have their supply chain figured out for ingredients, so get there ASAP. I'll be back this weekend, actually...
