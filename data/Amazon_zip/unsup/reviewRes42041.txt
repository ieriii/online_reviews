This was my favorite food establishment on my recent visit to Chicago. Dishes we ordered: Steak Tartare: This was Tenderloin Steak Tartare(rare) with a slow poached egg on top that you broke and mixed into the steak. Shallots and capers completed the mouth explosion. One of my favorite dishes from the evening. Cornbread: This cornbread dish sounded almost too pretentious when it listed that they brought in their own corn from some special plantation, but boy was it absolutely delicious. I'm already a huge cornbread fan but this one took the cake. Be sure to get this along with your meal! Pork Belly: This was a grilled duroc pork belly placed over a mixture of braised kale and some sort of chili/cranberry sauce. The pork was a bit too pungent in my honest opinion. Still a very flavorful dish though. Sausage/Grits: This was a roasted poblano and Cheddar cheeses sausage dish over their heirloom grits. If i had to guess, i'd say they probably use anson mills grits. Either way the dish was really good. Sausage was sausage. I liked the dish more for the grits. Ricotta Gnocchi: We wanted to have at least one pasta dish and this was the dish we chose. The butternut squash was perfect as a seasonal selection and the flavor was absolutely wonderful. One of the best of the night. If you're trying the pasta, go with the Gnocchi. (FYI, the orecchiette is the only pasta they don't make in-house hand made. Also the truffle pasta sounds good but they use a simple truffle oil so you're probably better off trying a few of the other pastas with actual ingredients used.) Final Note regarding libations: If you're going to get a cocktail, try to order one of the signature drinks from downstairs(Curio). They're significantly better.
