Wow! What a wonderful place with great decor, food & friendly waitstaff.. Perhaps, the best NY Strip Steak I have ever had--cooked to perfection. Garlic mashed potato's and grilled asparugus--seasoned perfectly. Salt n pepper are not on the tables--ya don't need it.  I will be back soon, however, this time with a different date :)
