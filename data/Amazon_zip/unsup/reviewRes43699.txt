Cute nearby diner with a lot of charm. My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast early Sunday morning and nabbed a good people-watching spot outside. My first impression, the hostess seemed very personable and all the employees were very gracious. Small bit that caught my attention, but for coffee they offered every sugar/sugar substitute possible, which I feel just shows attention to detail in trying to please customers. The only reason I note this is because I got to try that new PureVia sweetener (that uses stevia, an entirely plant-based 0-cal sweetener), and I've never seen it anywhere but stores before. ANYWAYS, side note. As my friends may already know, I have a "thing" for french toast. Of course, I had no choice but to order the Toasted Almond Orange French toast. Presentation scored high marks- it looked mouth-watering! I love french toast on brioche as well, and these were indeed made from that fluffy, sweet bread. However, I have to say they went a little overboard on the toasted almonds. Also, I wanted the batter of the french toast itself to be a little bit sweeter than it was. The syrup gave a nice flavor, but there's something about the sweetness of french toast when someone gets it just right... Now don't get me wrong, the french toast was still great.. but I seek pan-fried perfection! :-) I will certainly be back to try more on the menu and to spend another lazy morning with a big ceramic mug of bottomless coffee out on their terrace!
