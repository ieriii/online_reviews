After six years of living in Chicago, I have finally gone to the Bongo Room. I have heard about it so many times... the great breakfasts, the long wait... I will have to give it to them, they have some creative sweet foods. Like the pancakes, french toast, etc. (And maybe I wasn't that into it b/c I don't like the sweets too much...) But I really have to say that I think it is over-rated. The food was decent, the price was fair... but I think that there is too much of a hype on this place. Luckily, for a Sunday brunch we did only have to wait around 40 minutes when they said 1 hour.. and I am glad that I have finally experienced it... but I would rather try some new places before going back there.
