For me, ambiance is important. I can't love a restaurant if I constantly find myself wishing I did take-out (ahem, Big Star, Kuma's). Lockdown delivers. The concerts on the TVs are loud like god intended, but not too loud to have a conversation. I'm not a huge metal fan, but I was into it.They staff is friendly, the decor is sleek and clean. The burgers are some of the more creative I've seen. The meat is good but not amazing, and the prices are perfect. In a city spiling over with burger joints, this is one of the few I'd go out of my way to eat out.
