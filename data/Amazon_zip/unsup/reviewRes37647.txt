We've been going to the Hopleaf since 1999 when we first got to Chicago. It's roomier now since they added space upstairs, and now has a restaurant (used to be you could bring take-out or order a delivery from menus at the bar). I'm sure many people have mentioned the food, but when I come it's mussels and fries. I usually have to ask for more bread to soak up the sauce. Last night, though, here's what I had. I started with Hansenn's kriek (a cherry beer).  Hansenn's is a traditional farmhouse brewery, still brewing beer in open fermenters that are infected by wild yeasts in the air, creating a sour brew. Hansenn's is especially good because they don't add sugar at the end of the brewing process, so the kriek was very tart, virtually uncarbonated, with a nice sour cherry palate. It was better and much drier than the sparkling wine my drinking partner had. $12 for a rare beer that most Americans would spit out and flush down the toilet! I LOVE this place! Next was the Tripel Karmeliet, a more standard Belgian golden ale served on draft in a goblet. Wonderful, strong stuff, but it's served too cold for my taste - the aromatics that Belgian malt-driven beers are known for can't come out properly. Again, this is very unusual stuff to find in a bar, on draft, and it's why I come here. The Tripel Karmeliet was only $7. Curiously, the bartenders were not mean, cold, and unapproachable as they often are here. It was packed and noisy downstairs, but we bought our drinks and went upstairs - full, too, but we sat on the windowsill seating.
