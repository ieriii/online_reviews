What a fantastic combination of authentic, tasty food, great service, inviting ambiance, and a convenient location. All this for a price of $15, before tip! My buddy and I went on a Thursday night for dinner, around 9:00. Even then it still had a fair number of people. Both of us had the tamarind soup, he with shrimp, I with chicken. The taste was addicting and the quantity size perfect for meal. The surprised us with free lemonade and two small plates of perfectly ripe watermelon and giant purple grapes. The wait staff could not have been more attentive and so incredibly delightful. My only complaint--and this is really being nit picky--is that I asked for a recommendation that had chicken or beef in it and the waiter kept suggested shrimp and pasta-based dishes. I will certainly return and suggest this to my friends. Great restaurant.
