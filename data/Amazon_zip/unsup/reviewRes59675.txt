If I could post zero stars, I would. This was my first trip to a Ruth's Chris and undoubtedly my last. When a group of 11 people go to a restaurant for a birthday dinner you would think that restaurant would gladly welcome the money, but this particular establishment apparently does not need it. Our party was refused the purchase of 2 celebratory bottles of champagne even though we had not ordered any other alcohol yet. Then 6 of our 11 entrees were delivered wrong, including no less than 5 hairs from the head of the head chef Jorge Fernandez, who even admitted to it being his preparation and hair. After we complained to Jenny Estes , the manager, her response was "you need to get away from." No apology, no compensation. Because we didn't eat we felt we shouldn't pay, but Jorge Fernandez had called Chicago PD before we left. They agreed we did not need to pay, and we were on our way. Bottom line, that was by far the worst service I've ever had ANYWHERE in my entire life.
