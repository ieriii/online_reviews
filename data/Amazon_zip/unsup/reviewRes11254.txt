beers on draught here were very bleh. their brewery is not so much, but their pizza totally makes up for it! we had the clam, basil and mashed potatoes pie and it was SUPER GOOD. my first bite and I screamed out "BEST PIZZA EVER". the crust was super thin, but toasty and the toppings went great together with their white sauce. our group of 20 came out of there super happy. This area is super cool as well... very "scenester" but very good vibes. if you arent in the mood for some chicago deep dish, this is the place!
