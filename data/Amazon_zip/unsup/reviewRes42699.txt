YUM! I went in with average expectation for the food at Gilt since I've mainly heard about it as a bar. But the food was SO good! I went with two of my coworkers and we all loved the ambience! We shared an appetizer cheese course- that cheese was so buttery and delicious. For my main course, I had the pork belly and for the price I thought it was a really generous amount of food and very tasty too. For dessert I had an apple rum cake- amazing. The drinks were great too! My only minor complaint would be that our waitress was a little eager and hovered a little- kinda made us feel like she was in a rush to get us out of there. But I think she was just a little new and unsure of herself because when we asked her questions about the menu she didn't seem too confident. I will definitely be going back and bringing my chef husband to try it out- he would love this place and he is a VERY picky diner.
