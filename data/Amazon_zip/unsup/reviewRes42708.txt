Is the pizza art? Yes, on a canvas of crust many many beautiful layers of cheese and veggies are placed and finished with a gloss of deep red tomato sauce. Ok, enough crap, seriously the deep dish is definitely in the top tier of pies I've had in the city. The ingredients are top notch, the crust is tasty and the thing comes more dense than a 5 year old fruitcake. Only a stomach ache brought on by a round of brussels sprouts earlier in the day stopped me from completely gorging myself. One star off because AoP, you severely need to clean up your delivery biz. Not only was my pizza about 30 minutes late (still worth the wait) but the delivery guy had a coronary when I said I was going to pay with credit card, even after the guy on the phone told me the delivery guy would be the one to take down my credit card information. As a result I seriously had to call in my credit card number on the spot before the delivery guy would give me the goods, quasi-swearing under his breath the whole time. Great Pizza, Art, just remember to pay your staff and keep your consumers happy.
