We went last Sunday night as a some friends recommended this place. The owner was very welcoming when we arrived and there was a woman singing some jazz and man playing the guitar, which creating an very pleasurable atmosphere. The Romanian wine was quite enjoyable and the food was delicious. We highly recommend this place!
