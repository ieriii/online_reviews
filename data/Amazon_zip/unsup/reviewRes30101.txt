Went to Frontera last week and I will break it down Positives: Server was great very attentive quick to get our drink orders, Drinks were expensive but worth the $10 price tag We had a table of 6 people we ordered 3 entrees and 8 small plates/appetizers , we made it a point to attempt to try all styles food, entrees we had the Atlantic salmon which was OK but small and I have had better many other places, the chili rellanos - the server saved some of this "special dish" for us I wish he would not have the breading on the outside was bland and flavorless, and the 3rd entree was the enchiladas not very adventurous and mediocre at best. For the small plates we tried everything ceviche's, queso fundido's, duck carnitas, every salsa they had and a few other things which I forgot meaning they were not very memorable. I consider myself a foodie who enjoys a good value and while I did not think the food was necessarily overpriced I did think it was over hyped nothing stood out about this place and for the price it was not worth it. It is packed with tourists and people who drive in from the burbs Save yourself the hassle and take the time to research some Mexican restaurants around Chicago that are not downtown there are many better options for much better prices.
