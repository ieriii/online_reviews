Dat soup... so freaking good. In my top 3 soups ever. If you see the English Pea Soup on the menu, don't miss out! Speck, purple haze, radish, mint - that's pretty much how all the dishes are listed on the menu, so you never know how it'll be prepared. The soup is served cold, with thin sliced rolls of speck (juniper ham), stuffed with purple haze goat cheese, and also some radish & mint. All the flavors just went so well together, making for some damn tasty soup. First off, I really dug the dining room, which had high ceilings, stone walls, hardwood floors, and was brightly lit. Felt like I was in a large cottage. The service was great and overall very friendly. Nobody likes a crabby pants. We got the tasting menu, but I couldn't resist ordering the Foie Gras - banana, cocoa nib, miso, mushroom. I was disappointed at first that it was just some mousse, but I ended up enjoying it a lot. Just the right amount of sweet and salty. I also really enjoyed the Ricotta ravioli... all I remember is truffle + garlic. The Rhubarb beignets were okay, but the meal overall was great. My friend wasn't as happy with her dishes, so I guess I made the right picks. English Pea soup FTW!
