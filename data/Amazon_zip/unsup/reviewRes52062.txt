No wait on a Wednesday at 630pm. Service was great. Ordered a deep dish with Sausage, Peppers & Onions. The pie came out soggy and was undercooked. I like my deep dish to stand to attention a little more and if desired give you the option to pick it up. This was not the case at Gino's, you can only go fork and knife and again the pizza is runny. Crust was crisp and good but at the end of the day, it was a miss. I'd give it another shot but can't say the place lived up to the hype.
