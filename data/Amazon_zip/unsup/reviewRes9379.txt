An elegant decor, attentive wait staff and pleasing food makes this a good stand by. Food: The dishes were prepared as described (bouillabaisse, whole Snapper, filet of beef) and all around quite satisfying. I tend to like my Asian food with a bit more heat, but the flavors were a solid 7 of 10. Not the most complex, but likely targeted for American pallets. Presentation was top notch and I'd eat it again. I'd give it 3.5. Service: The service was a stand out for a menu with $19-30 entrees. The waiter was always available, knowledgeable and definitely demonstrated a higher end attentiveness. Decor: The decor is the highlight of this location. Beautiful dark wood ceilings, palm fronds and rustic touches make you feel as if you are in French Vietnam....they could turn the music up a bit...was a little quiet.
