I'll just say that I used to travel to Thailand every 6 weeks for work and did so for a period of 6 years, so I've tried authentic Thai cuisine in Thailand, and extensively. Opart is the most authentic Thai restaurant that I've been to in the U.S. THe flavors are there, and so is the quality. The spicy basil pork I've had here only compares to my first ever rendition of this dish at the Dusit Thani in Bangkok back in the 80s. Service can be a little slow sometimes, but who cares? Enjoy a glass of BYOB wine while you wait and get ready for an awesome authentic Thai meal.
