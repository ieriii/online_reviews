This is slightly overdue... And by slightly I mean a few months. I had high expectations for GE. I mean, even the diners in next to our table said, "if this place is good enough for Obama, it's good enough for us." I wanted to feel the same, but I'm sure the Obamas received a bit of a different treatment. Perhaps they were actually seated at their table at their reservation time? Or received the right entree? Or were asked how they'd like their wagyu beef cooked? Service aside, the food hit so far on the salty end of the taste spectrum that a potential party-in-my-mouth became a test of endurance. I couldn't take a second bite of the pork belly without washing the first down with a gulp of water. I swirled and swirled the marshmallow hoping it would balance out the saltiness of my butternut bisque to no avail. Maybe next time, Graham Elliot.
