By my own admission, I love, love, love Korean BBQ. I would do a bad bad things for Bulgogi, Kalbi and some Soju. If you share my gastro-sentiments, then you should run, run, run to San Soo Gab San. Some things to know before you go... It's open waaay late and is awesome drunk food. If you aren't drunk, Soju (Korean hard alcohol) is an excellent and painless way to get you there. Trust me, its delicious, burnless and sneaks up on you like a Mofo. Don't expect great service. From what I can tell that's just not a part of the K BBQ experience wherever you go. Taking someone whose fluent in Korean definitely helps, but not drastically. It's pricey. I disagree with other reviewers here. I always get a lot of food, but the bill creeps up on you faster than the Soju. Of course, the alcohol could have something to do with it. And finally, its kind of out of the way and parkings a bitch. (Western and Farragut? Trying getting a cab to take you there.) However, if you love K BBQ like me, this isn't such a bad thing. So like I said run, run, run to San Soo Gab San. But try Cho Sun Ok for a close second.
