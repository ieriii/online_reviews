I've eaten here twice. Both times outside. Based on their food alone, I'm quite impressed with Mr. Oscar's establishment here. Service however, is that of a blind paraplegic tour guide-pointless. If this place were a serve yourself joint, I may have given it a another half star. Our server was annoying and couldn't care less about us. That's fine with me, as I was mentally subtracting from the standard 25% tip I leave. Not only did she hand us our menus and told us to sit outside, she didn't escort us to a table. So... okay, I don't need hand holding, my friend and I pick a table and sit. 5 minutes later, she comes out and says that we need to move to the next table. No big deal as we haven't even been served water yet. Anyways, long story short, she brings our waters out and leaves. Keep in mind, we were only 2 people out of 5 on the outside area. She goes in and cluelessly flirts with the other clearly gay host. Comes back 10 minutes later for our order! THEN spills my water all over my lap, it falls through the metal grated table. Her response, "oh my gosh! good thing you're wearing a skirt!". I had to ask for another napkin. twice. okay, so I hold a grudge, but couldn't after I tasted my portabella burger. Sure my thighs and crotch were wet, but my mouth was satisfied. Haha.
