Sober, drunk, slightly inebriated. I like La Pasadita during all three of these body/mind experiences. The super burrito is especially delicious. The portions are represented fairly and the meat tastes, well, like meat. However, considering there are three La Pasaditas directly adjacent to one another, I'm not sure if I'm reviewing the right one. But I'm almost certain either one of the locations will satisfy my craving for mexican food no matter what time of day. !Gracias!
