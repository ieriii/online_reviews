yeah, this place is ok. there were great things about last night and some glaring mistakes. good: -falafel sandwich. but only the actual falafel part. see below for the rest of the sandwich. -lentil soup. tasty. not as blow-your-mind awesome as everyone keeps saying, but it'll do. and for $3 there was a lot of it. bad: -i ordered a falafel sandwich with chicken. i got a pita which was overflowing with cucumbers and was so messy i could barely lift it. there was a teeny bit of hummus on the very bottom, and the chicken- whoah. the few bits of chicken which were stuffed into the bottom made me want to become a vegetarian. inedible and nasty. gristle for days. bleh. -delivery was reasonably timed, but they forgot one of our sandwiches. then we called back and they acted all suspicious. they brought it to us about 30 minutes later. i will be back for the falafel, but that chicken was criminally bad and should be banished from their menu.
