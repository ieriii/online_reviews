Dana Hotel & Spa is by far, one of the best hotels I have ever stayed. The rooms are elegant and contemporary; which I enjoy over other hotel's classic and bland look and feel. Also, the customer service was great!! From the valet to the waiters in the restaurant to the front desk, everyone provided me with the upmost service and courtesy. Plus, they also have one of the best spas in the city, and an awesome rooftop nightclub, Vertigo. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Chicago, looking for a great spa treatment, or just looking to enjoy a great night out. If you're in Chicago, this is the hotel to stay!!!!
