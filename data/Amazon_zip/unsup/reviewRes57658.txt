I never write reviews, but for Nuevo Leon, I will. Lived in the neighborhood for about five years. Have visited numerous Mexican restaurants through out the city, this is IT. My favorite place to eat. The line is extremely quick, don't worry about your position in the line, if they can fit your group, but can't fit the others in front of you, they will seat your party. That's how it should be, right? Someone said this isn't very authentic, I don't know how much more authentic you can get... but, to each their own. Go here, you will never be let down. I haven't.
