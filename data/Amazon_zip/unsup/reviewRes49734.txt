This place is really fun for trying wine and cheese, and the service was good, but the main courses are nothing special. I will definitely come back for wine and cheese, and probably sit in the bar or lounge area, but will not come back for dinner. The great thing about trying the wines is that you can buy them right there after you're done, and they're not that expensive.
