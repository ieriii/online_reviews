While I really wanted to give this place the maximum rating, the ill-trained wait staff nearly ruined the entire evening. To wit, we had a large group set for an 830 reservation. Once we arrived, we were told that we would have to wait until 9 because the party ahead of us was taking longer than anticipated. No biggie, March Madness was on. At 9pm we again check to see if our table is ready and once again we were told that the party ahead of us was slow and that we woulld be seated at 930. Gotcha. It's Saturday night so I somewhat understand that these types of issues are bound to arise. At this point, I'm still OK. Hungry and penniless from my foolish toruney picks, but ultimately OK.  Once we were finally seated things were moving along A-OK until it came time to serve our entrees. Chaos ensued. Simply Put ( I know I'm hilarious), they need to find better help. I mean, the last thing you want to do is to be rude to the Birthday girl, on her birthday no less.  Seriously, wth? Waiting tables isn't rocket science, if you screw up the order, 'fess up, offer your mea culpas and get your sh*t together. If someone is putting in the effort, but coming up short that's one thing. On the other hand, you never talk back to the customers, especially if you are rocking a neck tat and tongue piercing. I mean it's 2010 people. Is that sh*t even remotely cool anymore outside the NBA or And1 tour?  Whatever happened to the customer always being right? Perhaps, you shouldn't employ 17 year old waiters. Just a thought. But I digress, the food was above average, the owners were incredibly friendly, and the price points were more than reasonable. Unfortunately, the staff was poorly trained and the restaurant was disorganized as a whole.  Ultimately, the owners were put on notice and we never saw our server from hell again. Good times subsequently ensued. While I am rooting for this place to succeed I have little tolerance for RUDE service and hope they remedy the same ASAP.
