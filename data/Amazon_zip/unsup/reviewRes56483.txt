I seriously have no idea why people are waiting in line to get into the Frontera Grill. The drinks were super awesome, but the guacamole was so salty, I couldn't eat it. Totally not worth the 8 bucks. The duck we ordered was very tasty. But for 20 something dollars I would like to have a little bit more food. I would go back for drinks, but not to eat. The overall impression I had when I left was below average.
