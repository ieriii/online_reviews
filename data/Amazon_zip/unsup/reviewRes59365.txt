In April I bought two groupons for Fox and Obel (spend $20, get $40 worth of groceries). I mainly got the groupons because even though in my opinion the prices and service is better at Whole Foods and Trader Joes, sometimes I'm lazy or it is raining and Fox and Obel is right down the street. Anyway, back to my recent experience. I used the first groupon in late April. I tried to use the second one on Sunday, as it expires today. After the cashier rang up my order I handed him by groupon and he went to the front desk area to talk to some guy (never got his name). He came back and had written two dates on the groupon - one was in April and the other was October 10th. He said that the groupon had been used twice - on the dates that he had written down. I wasn't even in town on October 10th. I kept telling the cashier that it wasn't possible - I hadn't been in the store in months and I was out of town on that date. He said he couldn't help me but did I want someone from accounting to call me today. I said yes and that I would be calling Groupon to get a refund. Last night I sent an email to Groupon requesting a refund since F & O wouldn't honor the groupon. Groupon got back to me early this morning and said they could either refund my money or work with the vendor. To be honest, I never want to set foot in that store again. So I told Groupon I wanted a refund. They refunded my money right away (love Groupon!). Hours later someone from F & O called me and left a message that according to accounting the groupon had not been used and since it expired today, they would extend it for a week. I didn't bother to call the person back.
