I went to this highly anticipated restaurant the other week. I really admire what they are trying to do but some of the execution just didn't make it. I'm not saying I'm cheap but when I pay $7 for lardon, it do expect to see something besides 4 razor thin strips of fat on toast. Is it just me? Also the sausages I had were so small, thin and lonely. I loved the bone marrow and the blood sausages. I could have passed on the chicken thighs as it lacked flavor and the steak was ok but once again, I felt i could have gotten a strip steak for the same price. The wines are great and I do like the fact they have the different prices and sizes, glass, 1/2 bottle, etc. My French friend looked at the prices and was amazed. Too expensive for what you can get in Europe, but I say, this is Chicago. We had the wedding cakes for dessert and it was very good. Do not get me wrong, i don't want take away plates but I felt the portions were a bit too small. It's definitely a crowd to see and be seen, but if you want some food that will make you come back for more, i think you need to look elsewhere. Once the novelty wears off, what is there?
