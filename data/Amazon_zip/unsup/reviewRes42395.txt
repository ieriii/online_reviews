If pizza were like women, this would be your old stand-by, your best gal, your Saturday night squeeze. Decently reliable, middle-of-the-road mid range pizza. I've never been too impressed with this place, but I've never been put off by it either. It's a tad cheaper than some of the other joints, and it's a local shop so I like ordering from here just fine. Now, when I feel like dropping the extra couple bucks, my favorite now hands down is Pequod's.
