I've been going here and ordering pizza from here, for as long as I can remember. Used to live in close proximity and my family would order from here a lot. Now with my own family - I've have a first communion party in there restaurant party room, and numerous in promptu gatherings after a basketball game with kids. They have alwasy accomidated us with no problem. Pizza is AWSOME! Reasonably priced for what you get too. Dinning room is old school italian, pretty nice for a date. Delivery is SOOO fast. They are probably the fastest delivery in our area. It amazes me that they have time to cook and deliver all the way to me. (I'm a little out of the way but they still deliver to me) I like the free pizza with coupon thing. They will give you a coupon PER PIZZA, not just per order. So if I am having a party and order a bunch of pizzas , I get a bunch of "get a free sausage pizza" for later. Only reason why I gave it 4 stars is the large smoking area (but probably is taken away now with the change after Jan. 1st) that is kinda obnoxious, and the fact that they changed the prices on their menu recently, making their once super cheap party size cheese pizza for delivery, go up by $5!!! almost overnight! Most things on their menu were priced hiked as well. Although I can understand the need to do so, I wish it were more gradual, than $5!
