Wow - this place is delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed the pork loin with black bean sauce and the guacamole. We had a reservation at 8pm, but they were luckily able to take us a little early and this restaurant was certainly worth the wait! The artwork was beautiful in the restaurant, the food was outstanding and the service was fantastic! This is a must visit when in Chicago!
