Did you know this: When eating sushi you should not pass food from one person to another using chopsticks, because this parallels a Japanese funeral ceremony? Nope. I didn't either--until last night! Well I wasn't at a funeral...I was at Wakamono for dinner last night. Having a healthy, yet filling dinner was on my mind last night. My friend & I ordered a bunch of dinner rolls. Godzilla roll? Spicy Mexican roll? These aren't your average sushi rolls. How fun. Let's order some of those please!! Mmm...so delicious. Sticky rice, shrimp, tuna, avocado...oh my! More please! Those were my favorites of the night. We also ordered the spicy tuna roll. It was good--but not as memorable as the Godzilla! Cute place. Good service. Sushi was great. They are also BYOB (only inside). I suggest sitting that sushi bar, solely because watching those cooks knife skills is incredible. Brings me down culinary school lane. Don't miss this cute little sushi bar! Well, I miss it a little right now, because I'm not devouring a yummy roll!
