Very Busy on a weekend night. Waited about an hour. But you can order food and drinks at the bar! Bacon fat popcorn - as good as everyone says! Smokehouse burger - had pulled pork on top of the burger. good but a bit too much meat for me Blue cheese potato salad - YUM! best side ever subtle hint of blue cheese so goo! Apple pork pizza - i'm not too sure how i feel about apple + pork.
