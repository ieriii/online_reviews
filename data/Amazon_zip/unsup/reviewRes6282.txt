Whenever I come home, I so look forward to coming back to this restaurant. It's one of my faves and the best of the Lettuce Entertain You establishments. 1920s ambiance with black and white pictures on the wall, you will settle into a cozy booth. Then you will eat some of the BEST onion bread in your life here. Their herb roasted chicken has won me over, and their chopped salad is divine. It's truly the cat's meow and the bee's knees.
