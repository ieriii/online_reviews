Perhaps I've become spoiled by the Bay Area ubiquity of farm-to-table, gastro-pubby small plates restaurants specializing in great wine and pig parts. There's a lot to like about Purple Pig - we had the great fortune to snag an outside spot on a lovely warm summer evening, the menu has a number of innovative, interesting offerings, and the wine list is impressive. But nothing really blew me away - if you've had the pleasure of grazing at the likes of A Cote in Oakland or Casaluella in NYC I think you'll think it's just fine, but nothing to write home about. If I had to sit inside, though, I'd skip it - unless I was with someone I absolutely didn't want to speak to (or hear from) - the noise is unbelivably deafening.  Probably more like 3.5 stars - nothing really wrong, it just didn't live up to the hype.
