We had a great birthday dinner at Caro Mio last night for 8 people. Once again the host, waiters, bus people were all so sweet and wonderful. We had originally planned to go to Tango Sur, but they once again had no room for us there since they just decided to start taking reservations and were booked solid. Caro gladly took our reservation, honored it and everyone had a fantastic time. The food is good, not the best Italian we've ever had, but its like Maggianos, a classic that you can depend on. Always a nice time with an unpretentious atmosphere that is warm and inviting.
