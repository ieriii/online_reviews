I must say, the idea of having a deep dish pizza sounds very filling and overwhelming... I had a friend visiting from the East Coast and of course, what does she know about Chicago? Deep dish Pizza! So, I take her here during a Friday afternoon, around 3 pm... The timing was perfect, quiet, and quick. The cheese pizza was ready in less then 30 minutes and WOW, it was fantastic. I've actually been craving and fantasizing about it for the last 2 days. The crust was flaky and buttery, DELICOUS! The cheese had 1 thicker layer and then a thinner layer of a different kind of cheese, not sure of the deference however I don't really care, I loved it. The ambience is very casual and the bathrooms were not kept up, lots of tissues on the floor and paper towels over flowing the garbage however the food is Yummy. So, if you are purely going for pizza, definitely give it a try. If you're looking for the whole experience, go elsewhere.
