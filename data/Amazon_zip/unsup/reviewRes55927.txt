$13 for a Caprese salad? $9 for garlic bread that is made on mushy bread that you would expect to find at Walmart? Spaghetti for $17 swimming in half an inch of olive oil with so much garlic that you stop after 3 bites? Do yourself a favor - at these kinds of prices, you can go to Mia Francesca and get a superbly Italian created meal that puts anything here shame. Quite honestly, this was a complete waste of money.
