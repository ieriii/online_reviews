This Chicago legend has our out-of-town guests begging to return every time. It just takes you back to a nostalgic place. Getting to order from the car and have the food brought out to you is something I've really only seen in movies and heard about in parental stories. These hot dogs are the real deal with a pickled tomato to boot. Crinkle cut fries are a nice touch as well. Add a root beer and a few sips of someone else's milk shake and I'm a "Super" happy camper.
