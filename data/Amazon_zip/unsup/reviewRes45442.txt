I know the gays are striving for equality, but does that mean a bland TGI Fridays style restaurant in boystown?? No thanks.  I have been here twice in the last few weeks. Once for dessert after a film with friends, and then again for pre-dinner appetizers with another friend who wanted to try it. The appetizers were fine- I am glad to hear after reading some of the other reviews that we didn't opt for the crab cakes. The salads all seem pretty decent (we had the iceberg wedge) and the artichoke dip was meh, a solid C rating, like something you might heat up in your microwave. The desserts all seemed okay (the cookies with ice cream are probably your best bet) but nothing you wouldn't be able to find in some run of the mill Ruby Tuesday out in the suburbs. A giant brownie in a bowl? Creative...for 1997.  My friends and I have a new word for things we don't detest, just things that you might find anywhere- common. Common might be the perfect word, sadly, for Wilde. I had such hopes for the place before it opened (as I usually do for any restaurant in boystown, or at least look at it as another place to scope out hot dudes). Wilde has it's share of the hot guys, but not it's share of creativity. I would go back, but next time I hope the ketchup and mustard are off the table and the menu is a little more inspired for the price that you are paying and how the place bills itself. Side note: the faucets in the restroom are amazing, actually. It might be worth a stop in for a drink just to see them for yourself. Why is this place spending money on creative faucets and not a menu that is simply a suburban chain on steroids??
