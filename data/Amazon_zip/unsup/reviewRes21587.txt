I thought I'd be the only one who doesn't think too highly of this place. I love greasy food, it helps out when you're drunk, it's comforting and it sticks to your ribs. Superdawg doesn't disappoint in this respect it does all those things. I can sum up what the two star rating in five short words: For the price, it's overrated. I mean, this place is a landmark, magazines, tv shows and Zagat's have all come by here to rate it and rated it highly. I think that might be the problem, Superdawg's has bought into it's own hype. People love it because it's a quirky local place that served up a good Chicago hot dog and fries...If it wasn't for the name and the giant Tarzan hot dog and his lady love on top would any self respecting Chicagoan pay $7 dollars for a hot dog, fries and a coke? I don't think so. Another reviewer mentioned they could get a lot of food for the price at Hot Doug's. I agree, but what I want to add is that there are plenty of local places that sell the same type of dog-that also comes with fries for under three bucks. There are plenty of local places that sell a great dog, go find one.
