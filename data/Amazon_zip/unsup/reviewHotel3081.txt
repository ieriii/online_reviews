I was taken to stay at this hotel on my 18th birthday and I just couldnt believe how nice, trendy, and beautiful it was. I loved the lobby and the decor in it. The room was gorgous. Very chic and stylish. If your looking for a trendy/chic place to stay or even visit the bar, this is the best place.
