I loved this place.  First, easy parking on a charming little side street.  Second fabulous food in a comfortable, cozy restaurant. I understand it can be really loud, but it wasn't that crowded when we were there so I didn't experience that. Here's what we had (there were five of us): Antipasti: 1) Zucchini antipasto. This is perhaps the best zucchini I've ever had. According the waiter, they sautee it then marinade in lemon juice overnight.  Then they add the mint. I think I might search the web for a similar recipe. 2) Caprese salad. Very nice. I like that they used small, flavorful tomatoes rather than large ones and the buffalo mozz was nicely tangy. 3) Arugula & prosciutto salad. Yum. Pizza: 1) I had the artichoke & porcini special pizza. It was lovely and very earthy. 2) My husband had the sausage & rapini. That spicy / rich / bitter combination is fabulous. It reminded me of my favorite pasta at Anteprima. 3) My daughter had the sausage pizza. Good sausage with lots of fennel seeds. 4) & 5) Our dining partners had the four cheese and the plain tomato sauce one... didn't try them myself, but they seemed pretty happy. Dessert: 1) I had the zabaglione... it was fabulous and we were all fighting over it. 2) My husband had the risotto gelato... it was very interesting and good. 3) The Tuscan Chocolate gelato was good... we liked the hint of spicy and the chocolate pieces, but were less excited about the raspberries as they made it a bit too sweet. 4) The ricotta cake was the least favorite... it was light, but a bit bland and dry. We did like the raspberries with balsamic sauce that came with. So all in all an absolutely terrific place and I can't wait to go back.
