I kind of understand the recent review about service, They seem to a person short or something like but I have to admit I didn't wait 40 minutes. After eating there yesterday I realized why I love coming here. The meat they use for their Carne Asada is amazing. You can just taste the difference in the quality of meat believe I've been to places where the meat is chewy or overcooked. And to compare it to a chipotle burrito under values there tacos and burritos. Good atomsphere and very vibrant and lively but don't plan to have a quiet conversation because it can get loud. Oh yeah BYOB is accepted here and no corkage fee. Love this place and come here quite often and I always leave satisfied. Try the quesadillas de norteno, I'm sure you'll enjoy them.
