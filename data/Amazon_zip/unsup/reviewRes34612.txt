Nothing more than a trendy Greek diner. Spanish omelet was too heavy on avocado and messy in preparation. Chocolate strawberry pancakes were regular buttermilk pancakes topped with chocolate chips and sliced strawberries rather than blended into the batter as the menu stated. Service was prompt. Not worth a return trip.
