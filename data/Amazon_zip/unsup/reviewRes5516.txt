So I could have eaten that asparagus salad by the bucket and like everyone else here, loved the Braised Pork Shoulder. What I didn't like was having a wine suggested for me off the menu that cost $16/glass and that crispy black burnt bread just "came like that." (I'd been here before and the bread was not just 'like that.') Anyway, when we asked for something else to put our schmear on, they brought us a plate of sweet bread. I'm sorry, but cucumber feta on sweet bread -- eww. Later, the waitress admitted it was a bad batch of bread and there was nothing to be done about it. Some staff training might be helpful? Still, there's nothing else like this place around North Michigan. And what's good about this place is great. I'm a fan.
