We came to this location a couple months ago on a random Wednesday morning. The wait was about 20 min, which was a little long considering it was really late morning.  When we finally got seated, we looked over menu and decided on two breakfast items. My husband ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and I ordered some kinda Nestle crunch infused pancake special. Both came out and looked fantastic. Big portions and looked pretty on the plate. After dipping in we realized that both entrees were very rich and sweet. Like an 'if I was a diabetic this would be dangerous for me' kinda sweet. Not really my cup of tea. The lemon pancakes tasted good but were denser than I would've imagined they should be, and the Nestle infused pancakes were super gooey from all the melted chocolate. The coffee was also just ok.  I'd come back, but next time I'd try the benedicts or something from their lunch menu.
