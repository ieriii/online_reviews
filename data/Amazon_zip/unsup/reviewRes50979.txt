i've been to wishbone one other time before and i thought it was pleasant. i really like roscoe village and we got a nice table outside when the weather still permitted such things. the food was good, the service was good. so we went back for brunch this weekend. i'm pretty sure it was my suggestion. again, the experience was pleasant. there was no wait. our waiter was nice and attentive. our food came out quickly and exactly as we'd ordered it. everyone who worked there was really helpful. i ordered the light spinach omelet with home fries and a corn muffin, which was really good. their potatoes are well seasoned and a little dry, like they've been baked (or probably just reheated) which i actually like. my boyfriend got the crab benedict and cheese grits. overall, it was a nice brunch experience. i definitely would have gone back again. if not for the food poisoning we both came down with shortly after. brunch bummer. four stars minus two for trying to kill me. in more positive news, i'm finally back on solid food.
