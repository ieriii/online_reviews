Jeez, there are million reviews for this place. It's a solid 4 stars... great sushi, excellent service, nice ambiance. My tulip Holly and I ripped the place up with 3-4 courses. Holly had the special white tuna tartar, I had the flaming salmon (with the sparklers), and my wasabi dish stood out as well. Remember it's BYOB. We forgot but recovered that fumble with a nice Chianti Classico at the Quickie Mart down the street. He he!
