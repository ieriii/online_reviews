We came on a Thursday evening and the place was slammed. We were told that the wait would be about 30 minutes, so we walked up to the bar for a few beers. Both wifey & I had the home brewed pale ale, which was very good, and priced reasonably at $5. About 10 minutes later we were seated, and the server was immediately at our table. We started with the goat cheese app, which was damn good and only $6. We ordered a tomato and meatball thin crust pizza which was good. Like I said, it was good, but not really anything extraordinary, or worth the hefty price of $18 for a medium. Very good service, good apps, good beer, and good (not great) pizza gets 3 starts. I may return...
