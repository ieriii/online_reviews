I won't go on at length because I'm sure it's mostly been said. Love this place, never been disappointed. They have a gluten free menu which is great for peeps like me. The only thing I sometimes hate is the wait, but that's what you get when a place has delicious food & a nice intimate atmosphere. Been there lots, will definitely go back again & again. I would advise you NOT to, though because I surely don't want to have to wait in line behind you for a table ;). PS. I hesitatingly tried the vegan cheese on nachos once...it's good!!!
