Will forever hold a special place in my heart. This is the last place my lover took me before we decided that there were too many feelings involved to continue to be lovers ... It's dark and romantic and sweet. The food is simple and elegant. We both ordered the combination meal and could barely finish it all.  The cheese fondue was delicious. Great combination of white wine and cheeses to dip crispy apples and sweet grapes and buttery bread into with the fondue stick ... while having a conversation about being lactose intolerant (neither of us were, thank God). Then came the main entree. Scallops, steak, chicken, veggies, shrimp ... it was A LOT. And the oil is hot, be careful! And make sure everything is cooked well. It's dark and there were a few times when I definitely didn't leave my chicken in for 3 minutes. And then the chocolate fondue with which my lover couldn't even keep up with me. So delicious. Chocolate + any fruit = delicioso. Top it all off with some wine and it rapidly became one of the best dates I've ever been on thus far. Given, the company had a lot to do with it. So, boys, be men and take your woman here on a surprise. Let her order whatever she wants. Help her cook her meats. Kiss her and tell her she's beautiful and sexy. But becareful ... feelings may get involved.
