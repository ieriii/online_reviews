I LOVE Hot Doug's!!! They have some of the best veggie Chicago dogs in the city, so my boyfriend and I aren't left high and dry when we take our out-of-town friends and family here to try out all the specialty dogs. Yeah, the cash-only policy's a bit of a drag. But at least I've had good luck in the timing department and never had to wait in line for longer than 15 minutes.
