So sue me, I am a Chicagoan that absolutely HATES "Chicago style" pizza. I personally believe tomatoes/sauce belong INSIDE the cheese. Thin crust is just fine by me, and that rare pan style (where the sauce is, indeed, UNDER the cheese) is even better. Needless to say, I was beyond thrilled to see someone still made such a pizza..and made it very, very well. Art of Pizza is now my #1 local pizza joint because they realize we pizza lovers need choices! I find their pan pizza to be near perfect: butter crust, gooey cheese, abundant toppings. I was underwhelmed by their calamari, but that's not what I came for, anyway. My only complaint is service: I usually go to pick up, and you have to wait in a huuuge line (instead of having a designated pickup window) where some Dilbert-like creature and his family is taking forever to decide what they want. Just ORDER already- it's likely to be good!
