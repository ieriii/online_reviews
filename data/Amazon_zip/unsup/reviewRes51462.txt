I'd give this place 3.5 stars, but I'm going to give it 3 on the notion that I'll be back to have a burrito next time. I'm a sucker for a carne asada taco. And as such, it's how I initially judge all mexican restaurants. I want to order something different, but I just can't. With that being said, the tacos here are just okay. The meat was a good consistency and the flavor was okay, but the meat was way too dry. We found the service to be quite good and the prices were great. Most of all, I think we really both liked the atmosphere. It was a lively mix of all sorts of people enjoying some good food and boisterous conversation. We will most certainly be back here when we need a Mexican fix with some margaritas. If we've got the time to pack our own, we'll probably be back to Los Nopales.....unless I'm craving an enormous burrito, in which case, Garcias here I come. EDIT: 12/08/2009 In a buzzed and slightly lifted state, me and a friend made our way to Garcia's for a little food last night. As stated earlier, I was going to have one of their burritos. Let me state that I far from a burrito connoisseur. Outside of taste, I really don't have a way of judging from one to the next. Are there different types from different regions? Is there a standard of what constitutes a burrito? I really don't know. With that being said, I'd throw the Garcia's burrito into the aptly named Meat Log category. Its 9 inches long by 4 inch diameter of tortilla filled meat. And your choice of meat will greatly affect the overall enjoyment. I went with the carne asada and much like the tacos, it was decently flavored, but a bit dry. Overall, this place is a solid 3. It's a great, lively place to knock back some margaritas and have some decent Mexican food. Nothing here is going to blow your mind and nothing is going to disappoint.
