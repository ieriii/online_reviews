Before you go, make a reservation! This place is excellent, the food, the service, the whole 9 yards, but you DO NOT want to go and wait by the bar for a table. It gets crowded and space is limited if there is a long wait. Once you're seated though, it's all gravy! The California Wrap, Buffalo Fingers, the salad bar, and the cheese and broccoli soup are amazing! Don't ask for french fries...they don't have any! The chips are good and they get better each time I go. If you can't find parking quickly, I think valet is worth it! YUM YUM!!
