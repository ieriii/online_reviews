This place is amazing. We came here twice in 1 week. That's how much we loved it. Everything was good! Their portions can be quite tricky though. We had their bone marrow and it was good! It comes with bread, so you can smear it right on. Their pig ears are also amazing for a appetizer. We pretty much shared everything. We had the pork shoulders with mash potato (small portion) and the turkey leg (which was huge). They were both delicious! Well I'm a big fan of this place. They're always busy too, so be prepared to wait.
