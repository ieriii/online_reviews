Honestly: five stars for the food (quality + quantity), but only three stars for the service. We arrived at 8 on a Monday night, anticipating that Mia Francesca would be busy, but we were promptly seated at a table toward the back and pleasantly far away from the cold of the front door. However, after being served with bread and water, we waited for 15 minutes before our waitress noticed that she had never seen before, and came over with a start. She was very apologetic, which was nice, but apparently she had never read Bruce Bruschel's piece in the NYTimes on 100 Things Restaurant Staffers Should Never Do because she proceeded to touch each of us, twice, as though that was a normal part of a restaurant apology. Maybe I'm too mid-western, but it seemed weird. When it came time to order a wine, we said that we were thinking about one, but curious about two others that we didn't know anything about. Our waitress admitted she didn't know anything about either of the wines, so she went to ask the bartender for his recommendation. She came back with knowledge about the tannic aspect of the wine, per our request, but nothing else (fruity? berry? smoky? throw me a bone here!). Whatever, we chose a wine that was fine, and our food came out within minutes of us placing our order (perhaps she'd bumped us to the front of the line?). But then, as though the entire wait debacle had never occurred, we waited for another ten minutes with an empty dessert plate and near-empty glasses of wine, until our waitress finished a lengthy conversation with other staffers and finally came to bring us our check. Would I go again? Sure. I had the leftovers from my giant portion of rigatoni for lunch the next day. But I won't go if I'm in a rush or trying to show someone Chicago's sophisticated side!
