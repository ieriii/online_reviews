I lived in Louisiana for 8 years and I LOVE Wishbone! It is the only place in the city where I have found awesome cheese grits - YUM! I have only been for brunch, but I have heard good things about the lunch & dinner menu. I recommend the crunchy french toast, the Yankee scrambled eggs, or any of the omelets. They have a great variety of lemonades (I love the cucumber) and excellent Bloody Marys.   You will definitely have to wait during peak hours on Saturday/Sunday, but I would argue it is worth it. They have a very "funky" decor and friendly staff. This is an excellent place to bring out-of-towners for a brunch that deviates from the norm.
