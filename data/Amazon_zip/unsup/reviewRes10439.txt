Sooooo good. Delicious, New Haven style thin pizza. Both the red sauce and white sauce are excellent. They also brew their own beers. My favorites would be the Golden Arm and Dysfunctionale, but all are good depending on your style of choice. I haven't had the pleasure of partaking in the live band karaoke on the weekends, but as long as you don't mind the noise, how could that not be a good time?
