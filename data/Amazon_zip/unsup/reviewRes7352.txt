This was obscene! Small villages could eat for a week off of the food that graced our table. It's restaurant week, and running into friends with the restaurant week menu x4 on their table scared me off, and my coronary arteries are happier for it. We started off at the bar with drinks. I had a strong and traditional mint julep. My two friends ordered the same cocktail as one another, some girly sweet blend, and there was a marked difference in the appearance of their beverages. The taste was also dissimilar. Turns out one girl's drink was missing an ingredient, which the other bartender promptly added. The service was prompt if a bit awkward at times. When clearing between courses our waitress rather aggressively interrupted several times to ask that she be passed things from the far end of the table. I probably would have let it go. As for the food... I couldn't get enough of the complimentary chips and pickles. I should have stopped, but I was powerless. Way more value-added than a bread basket. There was one restaurant week menu ordered at the table, and we all loved the cake-like, sweet and decadent cornbread that accompanied the three smoked meats. The brisket was reported to be very fatty, and I found the pork to be a little bland. I did like the sauce-it-yourself approach. For a main I had the pulled chicken sandwich. The chicken was perfect. The cole slaw was not only abundant but perfectly mayonnaise-d. Just the right amount for my taste. I passed on one friend's brisket and a did snag a baby back rib that was smoky but a bit bland. The macaroni and cheese was everything it's cracked up to be. We finished with a carrot cake that was generously topped with a really nice cream cheese frosting and the plate was presented cutely with a smear of sauce shaped like a carrot. It was also the perfect size for four people. (We actually didn't even finish it.) It was good, but I won't be rushing back, mostly because I feel absolutely disgusting after this food orgy!
