I've just moved to Lincoln Park, IL a few months ago, I've tried a few Vietnamese places around here and I can simply say that this place is bang for your buck. The owner will personally greet you and treat you. The quality is much better than places by Broadway and Argyles.Check it out!Oh, prices are fair.
