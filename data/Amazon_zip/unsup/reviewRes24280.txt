I really like this place. It's simple and consistently yummy, and reasonably priced. It's best for lunch-ish. I like the music and the big decorative jars of capers and the chrome tables. The only reason I don't buy their coffee by the pound anymore is because my stupid coffee grinder broke. They have this bizarre revolving door of pretty, sullen waitresses, which is to say I don't think I've ever been served by the same lady twice, so I can only surmise that the owners are creeps, but I don't have any hard evidence of this and since it doesn't otherwise affect my lunching experience I don't really care. They used to serve their tasty hot sauce in these teeny ceramic bowls with cute little spoons in them, but now it's just left in the middle of the table all the time in one of those little glass pitcher jars with a tin lid. I'm guessing this is because people kept stealing the cute little spoons. I have one.
