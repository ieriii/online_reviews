Here is what matters about Xoco, the food is A. mazing. Seriously. It's insane. The mushroom torta. The ahogada. The chocolate modelo ice cream (please bring it back, it was like a little piece of heaven!). Yes, the way you have to line up is annoying. Yes there is very little table space. But the food more than makes up for it. It's so good, in fact, that my family and I now make 2 trips a year to Xocago that involve (quite literally) nothing but eating at Xoco for 2 days straight. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you stay at the Residence Inn down the block you can get in for breakfast at opening, come back for a late lunch around 2, go to the piano bar around the corner from 6-9:45, and make it back in time for a late dinner before their 10pm closing. All without ever leaving a 2 block radius. Perhaps I should see a therapist for this addiction?
