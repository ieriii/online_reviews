Got the following.. Calamari - breaded and pan fried, it was interesting, but not as crispy as I would like Clam chowder - GREAT!! it really is the best in city as they claim Crab legs - YUMMY YUMMY!!! 3 huge legs for about $27 Marlin - it was OK, but my hubby loved it. I think it was because it's hearty similarly to a steak.  Jambalaya - OK as well, liked the cornbread instead of rice, but not wow flavors. Pecan pie - I think they outsource this, but it tasted like typical pecan pie Total with some drinks and fully fed 3 people - around $130 ish..
