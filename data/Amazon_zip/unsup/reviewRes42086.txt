Me and a bunch of friends got together and ordered Chicago Style deep dish pizzas from 8 different renowned deep dish pizzerias to see which place was the best (Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Pizzano's, Unos, etc). The consensus was that Lou Malnati's is the best. HOWEVER, in my opinion, The Art of Pizza was a close second if not the best. The sauce is what makes this pizza amazing. It's a little sweet yet savory. Decent crust and packed with fresh ingredients. Deep dish pizzas like this make me proud to say I'm from Chicago..
