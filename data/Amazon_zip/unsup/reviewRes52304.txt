While it isn't the most amazing deep dish pizza I've ever had (that goes to Zacharies Pizza in Berkeley, CA), the pizza was still pretty good. If you're going to get a deep dish, I highly recommend getting an appetizer to hold you over until the main event. It took about 25 minutes to get a table, but the line seemed to be fast moving. I'm sure I will be back soon.
