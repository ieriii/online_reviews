Bulls Eye Bakery - Well there are many reviews for Glenn's Diner, but few for the business where Glenn buys his desserts. That is 'Bulls Eye Bakery'. I have to say that the dessert's made by owner, Richard, are fantastic. His lemon squares are 'just like mama used to make'! They are sweet, but not too sweet. One knows he/she is enjoying the lemon flavor, but they are not 'tart' which ruins many great desserts. His brownies (which you can enjoy on Glenn's menu) are wonderful. Add ice cream! Also, you can 'special order' from Bulls Eye Bakery. Try this great bakery business. You'll be happy and Richard will bring all your goodies right to your home on time for your special event. So, when you go to Glenn's for the 'over the top' fantastic seafood and other fare, please add on a dessert.  That makes the meal complete!
