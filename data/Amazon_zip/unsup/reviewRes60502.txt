I've been going to this restaurant basically once a week. Food is excellent every time. Service A+The interior of the restaurant makes you feel very comfy and the library.. were friends and I often sit, have drinks & eat is awsome!I would suggest anyone visiting Chicago/Lake View or even close by to take the drive beacause it is worthwhile!And by the way... if you don't know about Oscar Wilde doa WiKi search... interesting story & character. Thumbs up!
