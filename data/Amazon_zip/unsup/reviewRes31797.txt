The staff is pretty rude, and they don't seat your group until the whole party is there...even if you're willing to order wine/beer/shakes etc while you wait. Ruben sandwich is alright, not my favorite. DO NOT get the chili, its spicy broth with uncooked vege's in it...that's it. Would definitely recommend the nachos, sweet potato fries, and avocado tostada though!
