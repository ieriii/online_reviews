I'm a wine and gin man. This place wants to make me drink more beer. simple as that. enjoyed a few of their Coup D'etat. They have a membership with some fun perks as well as merchandise. I definately need to get one of the growlers and try the food. It looked delicious. Great experience. fun crowd. excellent attentive staff. Can't wait to come back.
