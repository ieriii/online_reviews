We were treated so disrespectful by making us wait for over 40 minutes. The issue was not the wait but seeing other people arriving and getting tables right away and when I asked what was happening the dumb hostess said that we needed to wait another 20 minutes cuz there was no table available "course not she sat somebody else". She then tried to find one cuz she was embarrassed she left us there like idiots. We left to find a different place where they appreciate our business. This happened Sunday May fifth around 7 pm incase any personal on duty didn't notice.
