Wildfire is a traditional steak house with a flair for the innovative. The decor reminds you of a 1920s prohibition speakeasy, small unassuming entrance with a massive room in the back. Their bread is amazing, especially while it is still fresh. The food, especially the crusted steaks provides a new and interesting twist on your traditional steak. In addition, the food provided for your buck is unrivaled, especially in Chicago. The Medallion Trio is a good choice if you want to sample the various crusts that are offered. Unfortunately, the place is always crowded, with tables stacked everywhere. If you are looking for a nice quiet atmosphere with good conversation, you may be better off elsewhere. Pros: Food, Price Cons: Crowded, loud.
