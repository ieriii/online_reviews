While the food is amazing, the wait is tedious. The last two times I've tried to visit, it was so crowded that even ordering a beer was next to impossible. I do love the concept and design of this bar, but I feel the vibe has changed over the years. While I used to enjoy the laid-back feel of this place, it now seems more like a bar one would find in Lincoln Park. Quite unfortunate for lovers of good food and even better beer.
