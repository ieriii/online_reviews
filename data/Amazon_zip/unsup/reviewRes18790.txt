LOD 11 Walked into the place on the fly and glad I did.  The mussels are so *amn good we used the spoon to drink the broth, okay we used the same spoon, HA! Bison Tartare is delicous, oysters yummy, and the burgers were good too. If I lived in the neighborhood I would def be a regular especially to get my mussels on!
