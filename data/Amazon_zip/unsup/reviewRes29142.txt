i am sitting here maybe a block and a half away from this place and wondering why i haven't ordered from them lately and  then about hour later i figure it all out ...again the delivered food got here cold  it was supposedly spicy hot but surprisingly tasteless and they did not provide plastic ware ( not that i asked for any but ... usually it comes with ) this is like the second time that i have ordered there for delivery and been deeply disappointed both times by  the long wait and cold food ! you 'd think that they would want to be fast and fabulous for me ! i am working in a position at a front desk where i recommend food places ALL the time to people i simply will NOT recommend Pasta Bowl ..... even the soda was tepid .... not cold  and the menu says coke they give Pepsi ... what's not to like about Pasta Bowl ??? plenty ! ! their delivery sucks  i won't bother to go inside to eat ....
