Went here for a private party that rented out the entire place. Great open space with high booths for checking out the action below. Seasonal, constantly changing smooth brews and tasty bites made for a great evening. I tried the three darkest beers and would recommend the hoppy First Year Beer. It tastes like an IPA and a porter got together, had a little too much to drink and ended up with the First Year. Huge plus for uniqueness. Second trial was the Eugene, a mild, chocolate stout. Finally, the Black Power Oatmeal Stout ended the night with a punch...with all three beers ringing in at 6-7% alcohol, I was definitely feeling good after this flight. Friends tried the Bottom Up Belgian Wit and the Anti-Hero IPA, both of which I sipped and enjoyed. The Belgian was clean and fresh, and the IPA hoppy and delicious. EATS: Bacon Fat Popcorn with parmesan/sage was amazingly delicious.  Pizzas were all good, each one crispy and piping hot out of the brick oven. You'll see a lot of foodie touches on the menu, like truffle oil, apple brandy jus, celery root puree, along with locally raised meats. Plus: street parking is pretty good...we only had to walk about a block to get here.
