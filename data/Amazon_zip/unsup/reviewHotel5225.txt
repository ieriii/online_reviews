My recent stay far exceeded my expectations. From the moment I arrived the stff went out of their way to make my stay as pleasant as possible. My room was upgraded (no additional charge) due to overbooking.My room had a fantastic view of the Lake. The bed was so comfortable, I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. Also, the location was perfect for my stay, as I was able to walk to most of my appointments. I will certainly stay here the next time I'm in Chicago.
