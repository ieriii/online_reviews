How a place that is so outrageously overpriced can be so popular is beyond me. I'm not a veggie, but I have no problem with veggie food. If you're happy to pay $15 for a small plate of eggs, potatoes, and toast, while dining in a cramped, pretentious environment with snooty waiters, The Chicago Diner is your new home away from home. For the rest of us, never ever again.
