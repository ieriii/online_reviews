BEST BURRITO IN CHICAGO, HANDS DOWN. I was spoiled living out west, there are awesome burrito places on almost every corner, but when I moved back to Chicago, it seemed like I couldn't find a good burrito for the life of me. Thank god I found La Pasadita. Nothing but a flour tortilla, perfectly marinated carne asada, onions, cilantro, and a lime on the side. Perfection.
