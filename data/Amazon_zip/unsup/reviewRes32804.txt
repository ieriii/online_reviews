Why would you name a restaurant that wholly and completely bucks the idea of diners (fatty burgers, greasy sausage, fried eggs on buttered rolls) a name like The Chicago Diner? Because your food will fool even the most scrupulous of diner frequenters. We had the lasagna and the gyro, and we had to repeatedly, consciously, emphatically remind ourselves that we're not eating meat. Seitan apparently is a magical meat substitute that can be molded into beef, pork, lamb, or any combination of the above. And do it deliciously. Sure, you won't have a steak sitting in its own blood made out of seitan, but for most things, this does a great job. We would declare ourselves voracious carnivores, but for that meal, we were vegetarians, and possibly very close to switching to the other team. We were deeply impressed by the creativity of this restaurant, and have recommended it to our friends freely, both carnivores and herbivores alike.
