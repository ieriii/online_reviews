I am disappointed to say my XOCO experience was completely forgettable. I came here last night for the first time with my boyfriend. I had the seafood caldo. He had the cubano torta and the almond milk hot chocolate. We split a side salad. The seafood soup consisted of mussels, shrimp, fish and potatoes in a tomato based broth. It was a little spicy and quite satisfying. I enjoyed the baby greens garnish. The salad was a little plain, simply lettuce and a few cucumber strips. The dressing was good, being some kind of citrus vinagrette. I tried the hot chocolate; it was a little strange tasting with the almond milk but I did like it. I thought both the tortas and caldos were about $2 too expensive. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and might come back if in the neighborhood, but there was nothing so fantastic that in two weeks I'm going to be dying for more XOCO.
