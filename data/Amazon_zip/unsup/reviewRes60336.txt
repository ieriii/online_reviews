Hands down the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant.The first mishap was when they overcharged my delivery bill by $40. In order to be reimbursed, they made me bring in a printed-out bank statement, then made me wait 20 minutes while they sorted it out, and finally told me, "Meh, it happens."The second time was when a snide host told my party we needed to leave so they could seat other people -- on a slow night, only 10 minutes after we had finished our meal, paid a generous tip, and were still enjoying our wine.I do not recommend this place at all. The hosts are combative, and the service is absolutely appalling.
