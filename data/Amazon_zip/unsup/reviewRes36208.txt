Had a game changer for our pre-Valentine's Day dinner and had to be lunch instead due to my husband being called into work for dinnertime. Was originally planning to go to Vines on Clark but instead sticked around our hood instead. As we trudged our way to Broadway Cellars we came upon Indie Cafe and quickly changed our minds and stopped our trek here. I really wanted Pad Thai so we had it with the chicken-yum! The portion was actually huge which I didn't expect. Plans didn't go as they were supposed to but thank God my neighborhood also has options as well. Go Edgewater!
