Lockdown was a disaster from the start. After reading many of the other Yelpers reviews, we knew we needed to get here early to avoid the crowds. Needless-to-say, we arrived promptly at 6:15PM on a Sunday and it was empty and were seated immediately. (Lucky us!) That's when we should have counted our chips and cashed out....But no, we're here for the "BEST. Burgers. Ever".....NOT! Didn't feel as "adventurous" as my wife so I ordered the predictable "The Big House" (Bacon, BBQ and Cheddar) and she ordered the "Cruelty to Animals" (Bacon, Carnitas and Prosciutto). As boring as "Big House" sounds, it was less in flavor. The pretzel roll was dry, the burger was so well-done (ordered medium) it would have been better used for a "Re-Sole" at Alcala's Western Wear down the street. As for the C to A burger, I think they needed to run it through the Morton Salt plant a few more times....and that's not because of the three salty stacked meats on the burger either.  As for the service...our waitress was a joke. She was trying to hurry us out of there in under 30 minutes. Lockdown's beer selection is the only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars. Don't waste your time here with the loud music and 1990 screensaver "concerts." There are way too many other high quality "BEST. Burgers. Ever" places in the city. Try one of those instead.
