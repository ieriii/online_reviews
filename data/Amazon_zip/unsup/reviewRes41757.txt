My experience at Gilt was overall outstanding. There are a lot of good options in this city and i was largely impressed with my experience. Tuesday evening 8:30 reservation was honored in a timely fashion. Lots of good sharing options on the menu. I came here with a co-worker and while loud, I didn't feel that it affected our ability to chat. We ordered everything based upon our server's suggestions. Steak tartare, farro salad, chicken, salmon, green beans, and chocolate cream pie. The highlights were the beginning and the end.  The steak tartare was the best I've tasted - precisely chopped, high quality ingredients, perfectly seasoned and topped with a beautiful egg yolk. When I placed some sriracha on a huge piece of crusty bread and topped it with the tartare, it was one of the greatest single bites ever to hit my mouth. Like Katie, who reviewed it before me, when I go back, I am not sharing the tartare.  The chocolate cream pie here is the best of its kind. Homemade Oreo crust, which was dense and chocolatey. The filling was more of a tart like consistency that airy. It was like a very firm decadent rich chocolate pudding. The dollop of fresh whipped cream added the perfect balance of textures. Truly a stellar dessert. The entrees were very good too, just not worthy of the detail like the steak and dessert. The coffee, which was served as an individual French press was a bit of a let down. For a city with kick ass coffee, this was over-steeped and bitter. Service was good but slow. One thing that kinda rubbed the wrong way was the fact that our server recommended the most expensive items in each category. It could be purely coincidental but seemed off.
