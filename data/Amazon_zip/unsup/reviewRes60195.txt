The way everyone's raving about this place, makes me wonder if the owners paid you to flood Yelp with over-the-top, positive reviews. As far as real pizza, I know you happy midwesterners are deprived, as the best pizza can be found in NYC, NJ and other places on the east coast. I got one of the basic pizzas at Fogo. The crust was a little spongy and soggy and not crispy enough for my taste. There is no excuse for this especially if you're using a brick oven. I will say that ingredients were fresh and tasty. The only thing that makes this pizza "Brazilian" is the variety of toppings. And thank God the pizza comes in the traditional triangle cut instead of those ridiculous squares. The service was chaotic: one guy making all the pizzas and a cashier/helper who didn't seem to have a clue. They definitely need to tighten up the speed and quality of service. Maybe I was just there on an "off" day.I'm not sure if I'd go there again. Maybe if I'm in the area. But I'm certainly not going to rush back.
