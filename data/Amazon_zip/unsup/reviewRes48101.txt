YUM! I went here for dinner. It was such a great experience. There were three of us, and I'm not a big fan of 'communal-type seating,' but I thought it was very appropriate for this place. We were close enough to other people to look over and marvel at their menu choices, but there was no violating of personal space. I was also pleasantly surprised at how organized the seating team was. There were no empty seats. Props for that. We started off with a plate of oysters. You can't go wrong with oysters (or can you?). It was okay. We got the chicken liver pate. At first, I thought, 'Ugh!' But I tried it and my life changed forever. I would go back just to eat this dish. The jelly on top created the perfect balance of sweetness and richness. We had the pork belly next, which was so good! But I'll have to admit that while eating the pork belly, I was still thinking about the pate. We also got ramps, without really knowing what they were. I still don't really know what they are. A vegetable resembling a leek. It wasn't really good for me. I'll pass next time. Service was good, but there were times when we had to look around for our server. I found myself saying, "Where's the next dish" a lot. But it was busy... Bottom line: I would definitely visit again! To get the pate of course.
