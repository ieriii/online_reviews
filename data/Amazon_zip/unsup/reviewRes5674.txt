Found this place in a chicago brochure, so I was skeptical. Went on yelp and found great reviews...were they ever right. You walk in and the place is quaint, packed and alive. Patrons at lunch include anyone from businessmen, to college students, tourists and young professionals. Our waitress stealthily worked her way to us and guided us on our journey. We started with some cheeses, meat and the pork liver pate..yum. that pate was by far the best flavored pate that has ever hit my mouth. The consistency was smooth and it was served on buttery yummy toasted french bread (diet, what diet?). We then tried the pork ear, since it was their signature. I was actually surprised by how tasty it was and how the peppers almost tasted like pickles. We followed that with the clam/sausage concoction that had this amazing broth. There were about a million items on the menu that we wanted to try, but we proceeded to dessert which included a perfect light lemon panna cotta and an almost doughnut like large beignet filled with ricotta/chocolate filling. We took home italian wedding cookies too. Fabulous place and if we lived here, we would be there every week. Am trying to convince my husband to go back today for more pate. Purple pig-can you pack up and open up a place in dallas? Please, please, please?
