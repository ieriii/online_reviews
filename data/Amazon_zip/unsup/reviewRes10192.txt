Not quite as good as the real thing from Pepe's, Sally's, or Modern, but on the whole, I am a huge fan of both the pizzas and the beer. Also, the quality of the pizza when you are dining in is significantly better than what you get when you order take-out. The crust here is the star: thin but with a lot of bite and just enough flavor to be edible when not covered in sauce or cheese. Most of the toppings are good, but stay far, far away from the clams.
