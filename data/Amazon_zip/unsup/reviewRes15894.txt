I have to rate Carnivale pretty high because it's always great, but I just don't find myself dying to come here that often. In my opinion you can't go wrong with anything on the menu (food and drinks). I especially love the Carnivale martini! The atmosphere is lively and cute. More than once though I was somehow seated by several parties with small children. I dont hate kids, I just found it a bit odd. Also street parking is super easy, which is always a plus!
