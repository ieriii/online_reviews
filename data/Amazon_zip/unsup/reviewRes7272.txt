We were here for our wedding anniversary. Overall I liked this place. The service was good. Unlike the chain Italian restaurants, their served bread is fresh baked. We had 4 dishes including appetizer, entre, and dessert. Fried calamari: pretty good, specially the sauce. Veal shank: it is a good one too. To me it seemed closer to the way I cook veal or beef in a Bangladeshi way. Definitely it is a good one, but next time i will try something different. Next day when I was having the left over, it tasted even better :). Lobster Ravioli: It is named as something else, but I do not remember the name. The sauce was excellent! Tiramisu: It was ok. It was a bit on the sweet side. It needs more coffee, and more creaminess.
