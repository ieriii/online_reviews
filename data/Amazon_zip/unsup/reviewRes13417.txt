Love it! My friend use to be the mayor of this brewery on foursquare for a reason, good food/good beer/good service! It's a winning combo! Love the menu, it's always changing so you don't get too bored with it. Although I usually order from the specials menu, which are always amazing! You can't go wrong with stopping at Revolution!
