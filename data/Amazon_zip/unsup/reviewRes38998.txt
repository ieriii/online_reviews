have i drank the yelp kool-aid?...yet another 5-star pizza review!... girls night in = pizza and a movie. la villa cooks up a vegi pizza brewing with fresh veggies. my guilty pleasure made not so guilty with all the colorful, perfectly cooked (read: not "dead") veggie's, just the right amount of cheese to hold it all in place, tart and not greasy sauce and crispy, thin and not too buttery crust.
