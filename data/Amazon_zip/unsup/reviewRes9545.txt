I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. Our meal was a little spotty. Pork app for me - the pork was almost entirely fat, which I found inedible. However, the egg was perfectly poached so that saved it somewhat. Duck for my husband was just ok.  Chilled pea soup with mustard greens for the intermezzo. Does it sound appetizing? For me it was a miss though my husband liked it. Main course was short ribs for both of us which were absolutely outstanding. 5 stars for the short ribs. Ditto for the grilled cheese intermezzo. Most disappointing was dessert. I had the banana peanut profiterole dessert and found it virtually inedible. I ate the 2 inch piece of banana and some nuts and left the rest - it was bad. My husband had the corn dessert and despite all the raves here he did not like it.  We would go back, but would order a la carte next time and skip the dessert and save 30 bucks.
