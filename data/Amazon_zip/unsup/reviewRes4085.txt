Once again, fantastic experience. Having lived in NYC for the last year, and traveled around the world, there is just no place like Schwa. Fleur de Lis in San Fran is awesome (get the beef cheek). John Besh's restaurants Luke and August in New Orleans, as well as Cochon and Stella, are very good. Countless restaurants in NY later, there really is no place like Schwa. You can't dispute the food scene in Chicago, and you can't discount how good Schwa really is.
