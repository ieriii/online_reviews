I had been to Piece four years ago, I remembered liking the pizza, the beer, the bartender and hating the hipster next to me. I am not hating on Hipsters in general which is very trendy on Yelp, just this particular spud. For the last year I have ordered my share of delivery from tPiece with great satisfaction, so it was early on a Thursday and I figured there would be no lines and we could get a quick pie, here are the details of this failed venture. 5:15pm we entered into bizzarro Piece, our monotone waitress met us at the table instantly while I was trying to understand why our table was next to a pin ball machine and a birthday party of what looked like some yuppy spawn. One child was throwing a fit because he sucked at pinball, his mother calmed him down by promising him world domination. Five ambivalent teens were slouching against each other acting bored and taking up the aisle. A giant stroller with two kids tied down was being forced down the clogged aisle to get the kids a chance at pin ball, they looked like little zombies staring off into the distance while pure inanity surrounded them. The beer came, and came some more. Another large table was put together next to us in preperation for the exodus of asshats. 13 year old girls with Louis Vittons, the only thing at the table more expensive than their hand bags were their mothers face lifts. Fuck me Wicker Park was so much more fun when their were hustlers, hookers and heroin addicts. Unfortunately the decent beer did nothing to make the pizza enjoyable, it looked like a kindergartner threw a handfull of peperoni on it. In one area there were 8 slices that were not seperated. Most people would be ecstatic for the grotesque piles of roni, but me not so much. I am a minimalist and this pizza had many other issues that I doubt were the norm. I won't go back, this place made me feel like I was in the food court in Woodfield mall, I will be down at Santullos eating a better, cheaper and more urban pie.
