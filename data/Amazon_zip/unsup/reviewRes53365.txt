My dinner at Alinea was the single best meal of my life! Incredibly friendly and approachable waitstaff, and the food was mind-blowingly delicious. I went there to experience a new way of looking at food, and it certainly was. The black truffle explosion is a phenomenal dish. The food is fun and inventive; closed minds may not have much fun. Sure, it's quite pricey, but totally worth the experience! I will definitely be going back!
