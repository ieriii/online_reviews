Macarons fit for a princess, and only a stone's throw from the palace! Delish. I love the Raspberry Rose, Coconut Lime, and Chocolate + Salted Caramel. Polite staff. I had to text a friend to see if they needed anything from Alliance, and the gentleman helping me asked if I minded if he skipped over me to help others, instead of standing, waiting, huffing and puffing, making it all awkward, etc. Promptly served a few people, and came back to me and was happy to make me an iced Americano and suggest his favorite macaron flavors to me. I'll be coming here on a regular basis, awesome.
