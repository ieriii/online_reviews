Beware of the "OH MY GOD I WAS ON FOOD NETWORK THING" I can fault the place.  Cheese on cheese fries was very milky tasting and underwhelming. Stood in line with all the other suckers who saw it on TV. Hot dogs were too by the book not much better or worse than most other places.  I fail to see the hype. I do give them points for trying.
