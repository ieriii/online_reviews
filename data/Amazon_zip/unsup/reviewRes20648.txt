Went here on a business lunch and was very pleased. Everything was great. Had the scotch egg as a starter; eggs-cellent. Not often you find poutine this far south of the border and it was well done. Pork belly sandwich for my main was great. Beer selection looked very interesting, but I couldn't indulge. Cool space. Would definitely head back.
