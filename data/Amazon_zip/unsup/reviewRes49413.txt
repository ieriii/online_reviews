I must preface this review by saying the food and drinks were really great. The service was horrible. We were a larger party, but that seems to be typical at Las Tablas where at least half the tables were of parties of 6 or more. Waters were not topped off for our table after our dinners arrived and we weren't asked if we wanted additional drinks. Portion sizes were inconsistent. The worst of it all is that we waited for 45 minutes to an hour for the bill to be finalized. Everyone had finished their meals about 8:45 and we were walking out the door at 9:40. It might be the longest I have ever waited for the bill. Highly disappointing service means I will not be going back to this restaurant despite their delicious food.
