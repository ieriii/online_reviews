Congratulations! 3rd Year Anniversary Party was a blast - DJ, free appetizers and hosted drinks by Death Door (a local Wisconsin distillery). A baby showed up for the party. Full house. Advance email invitation was sent out, follow-up email and confirmation email of RSVP. Precise and Sincere. Death's Door White Whiskey Sweet Tea -- Delicious (and I don't like whiskey)! Rishi black tea, peach syrup, American sparkling wine. Single Serving of Pan Fried Soft Shell Crab -- brush strokes of reduced balsamic, pureed roasted zuchini, dots of hot sauce, stream of olive oil with specks. Yummy! Has Nana evolved from pieces of comfort food into haute dining? Alan Krueger's Baumkuchen -- the only one in town! Perfectly complemented by Chicago's own Black Dog Gelato in Chocolate and Raspberry. The best way to eat it is Korean style - spoon on the left hand, fork on the right hand. Mocha Coffee -- Mexican chocolate mixed with Intelligentsia.  Romantic Side Cafe at Night -- enclosed by trellis, naturally lit by half moon, Halsted lampposts, and lights above awnings. The tale of Tile Plate -- renovation was done in the basement. Bunch of tiles were found. Nana cleaned up the tiles and used it as plates. A true sustainable and eco-friendly heart and soul. A sighting of the Solis family is a treat! Service has always been great and friendly. The well-suited gent takes the time to serve Mocha Coffee. Best wishes for many more years to come.
