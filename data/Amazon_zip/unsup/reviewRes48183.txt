Going out to dinner should be a special occasion. When I spend money to eat in a restaurant, I wish to feel like a welcomed guest, rather than a trespasser. When we arrived at The Publican, at about 5:45 on a Saturday evening, the establishment was less than half full. When we asked for a table outside, the hostess rudely asked us whether we just were here for appetizers. What a bizarre questions. I was a bit flabbergasted at the question--and did not know how to respond, as we had been wanting to eat there for a while  As far as I am concerned, it is none of the hostess' business what I intend to order, as I don't know until I look at the menu-which is what my husband said. Instead of seating us and giving us a menu, she shoved menus into our hands as if we were to decide to order right then and there. At this point we should have walked out. But my husband told the hostess we were here for dinner and could we please have a table outside. We were taken outside, where there were approximately 12 tables, with only two full. We asked if we could be seated out of the sun, were led to a table in full sun. When we suggested that we have one of the numerous empty tables in the shade, she said no. At that point we left. Maybe it is because my husband and I both have white hair. Maybe it is because she didn't like the color of my blouse. I have no idea. I will never go back there, and no matter how good the reviews are of the food, I would not recommend this establishment to anyone.
