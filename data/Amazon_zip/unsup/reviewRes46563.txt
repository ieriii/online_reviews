Made my first trip to RJ Grunts last night. My sandwich was tasty (just a classic BLT) and quite messy. I enjoyed gawking at the salad bar (even if it isn't the kind of thing I would enjoy). And the appetizer we tried, a cheese quesadilla, tasted good even if it wasn't anything to rave about. However, I am not the biggest fan of the atmosphere here. It's crowded. Loud. Sure, fun to people watch. But also a little annoying - I was forced to worry that the kid a foot or less behind me was going to spray my shirt with ketchup and chicken nugget (repeated banging of his dirty fork on his plate was just about ready to dislodge any food onto my back). Sure, this was bad luck for seating placement. But I can imagine it happens A LOT. And the water tasted bad. I always drink water at restaurants...and here, not good. I would go back, I'd like to try a burger there. But this is not going to be a "go-to" place for me.
