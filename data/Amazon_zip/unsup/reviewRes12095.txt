Great place to get food and a beer while enjoying a game. The pizza is not bad the ingredients are quality and the combinations are great. I had the BBQ the other day and it was pretty good. The beers are a little pricey but good micros are available. The staff is very friendly in spite of a packed house and difficult navigation. Make a reservation if you can because this place gets packed early. There are plenty of flat screens and any sporting event you could want on one of them. I would give it 5 stars but 7 dollar drafts make that tough.
