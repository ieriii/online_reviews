i can't believe there seem to be endless amazing pizzerias in chicago. i get it already! the pizza at pequod's is super delicious. the burnt carmelized crust is the best part. it made me feel real full real fast, though. after an order of cheesy garlic bread, i could only handle one piece! i also love the atmosphere. it has a great feeling to it; like a perfect place for "family night" but without being lame. i can't wait to go again.
