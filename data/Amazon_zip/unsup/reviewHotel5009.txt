Great looking Building. Nice Rooms.But...Staff needs inprovement.Second day in a row, was out of our Room for over 9 to 10 hours and came back and housekeeping hadn't done anything. Went down to Lobby and Check In didn't seem to care. Only reply was "Well we have til 6pm to do the rooms."So now I am forced to sit in the Lobby and wait for the room to be cleaned.Staff is all attitude and no custumer skills.And the Doorman wears way too much Drakken Noir, what is this 1981! It literallly reeks of his cologne even when he is not there. Not pleasant at all...You can't maintain a hotel on Image alone. You need skilled employees to back that Image up, and you do not have it in this Chicago location.Avoid.
