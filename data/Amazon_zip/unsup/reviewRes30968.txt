I wouldn't say that my ladyfriend and I are regulars at the Chicago Diner, but we do go there with some frequency. My favorite time was once when I had a cold. I got a wonderful pot of tea, some fabulous veggie split-pea soup and a carrot-orange juice. It didn't really cure me, but I did feel much better ... comforted, at least. I also love the polenta fiesta, the Mac 'n Cheez and the soy shakes. My ladyfriend adores the Chick'n parmesan sandwich. I've also had some decent scrambled tofu, although the vegan biscuit and gravy on the side was a little cold and not all that wonderful. Overall, it's a place I enjoy eating at. It is pricey, though, which is why I'm not a regular fixture.
