When it comes to food, I consider myself pretty adventurous, but this was my first encounter with Greek cuisine. Greek Islands didn't disappoint. The atmosphere is as "little Greece" as you get. (Meaning you just stepped onto the set of Mamma Mia...in a good way). I ordered the Taramosalata and Pastichio, both classic Greek dishes. BOTH were unbelievable. The pita bread is the best you will find anywhere in the city. I can't even begin to describe it. It is a MUST TRY :D :D Aside from the amazzzzzzing food, the location is amazing. I came in from the north side and it was right off the exit in Greektown! The valet parking is free, which put a smile on my face before I even went in. All the staff was really nice and accommodating, I didn't get a standoffish vibe like any of the previous reviews mention. If you haven't been, go. It's a must try and REtry for any Chicagoan. I'll be visiting again soon.
