I love middle eastern food. I've been eating it all of my life and always looking for a new place. I don't mind when restaurants stray from authentic, as long as its good. Unfortunately, Sultan's left much to be desired. The shawarma was dry and left me feeling like I ate a rock and the falafel tasted like it came from a mix (although I don't think it did). The hummous was good and i did enjoy the meat pies, but for overall I was let down. It seems like they do really good business and I can see how all the hipsters (who don't know any better) think its the best thing they've ever had, but this restaurant would not last in Albany Park, Bridgeview, or even if Falafel & Grill was closer than Paulina.
