Okay, here's the deal....quit the bitchin' about reservations and get your ass here. Now. If you are so uptight and making their process wrong... then call Maggiano's for a reservation. Exceptional things in life don't come that easy (good men, the perfect haircut, etc.) You are in good hands -- it will cost you around $125 a person. The chefs are as delicious as the food. byob: bring anything and everything...wine, red, white, sparkling, beer gin, port...you will make it work. The worst mistake you can make is not bringing enough. You will be here for 4+ hours. Bring something for the chefs as well.. Compared to Alinea, I liked far better. I thought the food tasted better than Alineas concentration on plating and presentation factor. I also like that the atmosphere here at Schwa is more rock and "fuck it" ...we are humans making ass kicking food...not so stuff like Alinea.... Don't be late. Don't expect things to be explained to you. Go along for the ride and just enjoy... Finally, what really blew me away...a guy at our table had been once before this trip about a month prior...the chefs remembered what courses he had on his last visit and make him his own individual courses for this time so he would "repeat" any courses. Wow.  Schwa is top 3 in my restaurant favorites. I've eaten all over the world. Yum.
