My wife and I went for brunch on December 30. The wait wasn't terrible. The beer list is solid, and the bartending is knowledgeable.My wife had the chicken sandwich, which came out pink and had to be re-fired. We are expecting, so it was a bit of a letdown. I had the sloppy joe, which was savory, although a bit on the skimpy side. The fries were a nice surprise: crisp, tasty, and consistent. But for the chicken sandwich issue, everything was on point, and consistent with the other reviews.I may try dinner, but I will be coming alone, or with friends.
