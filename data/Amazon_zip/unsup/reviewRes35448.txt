As with my other 5 star reviews there's no need to explain why. Everything was FRESH & TASTY! I can still taste my filet and those king crab legs in my mouth. D-R-O-O-L. I'll keep this short and sweet because who reads the good reviews anyway (read my bad ones)? Check out the photos ... Everything was on point. I'm starting to kind of like filet after this place and Bobo's in SF.
