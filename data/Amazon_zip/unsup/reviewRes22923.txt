Irazu gets 3.5 stars overall. Service... meh, could have been better, could have been worse. Salsa... yuck. Just tasted "spicy" and serving presentation was ick. Potato tacos - yummy! Oatmeal/Mamey milkshake - worth returning for If you can just stop and get your food to go, I think that is the best bet. Just make sure you get a milkshake!
