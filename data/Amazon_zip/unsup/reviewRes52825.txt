Loved the place. Atmosphere was great, even vacation like. Sat in oversized chairs and made me feel like a kid. Didn't realize but if you bring wine they make sangria for you. Maybe next time. Had shrimp with red sauce on a plantain. Forgot what it was called but it was better on the menu than on my pallet. Had the pork balls and they were pretty good, big portion. Plantains were scrumptious. The best part of the meal, however, was my gf's steak. Kudos to the waiter for suggesting it because at first he seemed like too much of a salesman. Overall great experience and I'll be taking my @ss back cross 90 mile, but I will be ordering something new on my next visit.Hopefully then I will be able to push this place up to 5 stars where it could be.
