Thank you, Texas de Brazil, for fulfilling my yearly Brazilian steak house needs. This is the fourth churrascaria I've been to, and it's right up there with my favorite (Fogo de Chao). It also helps that they're generous with special deals. They participated in Chicago Restaurant Week this year, so lunch was only $22 a person. I also received a free birthday dinner through their mailing list. Score! First up is the salad bar. They had a little bit of everything - tabbouleh, potato salad, shrimp, asparagus, parmigiano, fresh mozzarella, marinated mushrooms, chevre, salami, pickled cherry peppers, olives, and more. Everything was delicious, especially paired with the warm cheese rolls served at the table. I didn't have any of the hot items though, which included rice, black beans, potato gratin, mushrooms, and lobster bisque (among others). Sorry guys, but I'm here for the meat. The cut of meat that really stood out was the Picanha. Well-seasoned, tender, with delicious crispy fat on top. Yeah, I said crispy fat. I'm only here once a year, let's make it count.  "Please Sir, can I have some more?" is right. I also recommend the garlic picanha, lamb, and flank steak. Don't forget to ask for the chimichurri sauce on the side. The side dishes were all good, but I have a thing for sweet fried bananas. We surprisingly had room for dessert. The chocolate cake and key lime pie were a nice end to the meal. But would I order dessert next time? Probably not. It's just too much food. The service here is amazing. Very...very...attentive. Kinda scary, in a good way. Just go here and see for yourself. And sign up for their mailing list for free/discounted meals.
