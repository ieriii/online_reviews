Revolution's a cool spot. Huge interoir, always seems like theres a lot going on, the bar is a godo size too. They've gota lounge area where you just chilax with some friends and have a few beers and share some grub. I thought most of their brews were just ok.While I did really enjoy their stout or porter (dont remember). We started with the Cheddar Ale Soup, which we sent back and ordered a different appetizer. The soup had the texture of nacho cheese which was kind of off putting. But I bet it would be really good as a dip for their soft pretzels. The Hombre burger was awesome, the smoked poblano pepper really made the burger. I'm gonna steal that idea in the near future. All in all they have great bar food, with so-so home brews, but a solid gues beer list. Revolution is a great spot for any occasion. A date, event with friends, or even catch a ball game but get better food than at your usual bar.
