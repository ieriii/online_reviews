Main trick here: Ask to sit at the bar - you skip the long line instantly =) Bartender's name was Jeff, and he was great ... albeit maybe a little ADD, but very entertaining. Great service, pizza portions are huge, so get the small to split between two. The pizza takes about 45-50 minutes to make, but if you want to save space for it, refrain from getting an appetizer. Will be back when I'm downtown =)
