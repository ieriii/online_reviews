Fabulous breakfast spot on Michigan ave! My husband and I ate there after a night out on the town and were very satisfied. He had delicious french toast and I loved my oatmeal piled high with fresh fruit and nuts! The OJ was fresh and YUM! There are so many delicious sounding items on the menu, I cannot wait to go back and try some more!
