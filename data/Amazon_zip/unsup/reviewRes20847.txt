This place is great and you must check it out at least once. The ahogada is really good. The ceviche is a great starter. The prices are decent for Chicago. It can get busy so plan accordingly. Make sure to try a Victoria Mexican beer with your meal. This place is not "oh my land" good, but it's definitely one of my favorite cheaper places in downtown.
