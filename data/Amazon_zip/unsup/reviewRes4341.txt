What a classy little lounge! I'd been meaning to check out the place since I've always heard good music blaring from the little side door. I hadn't realized how fashionably retro the interior was until I walked in. After ogling at the decor, I went straight for the bar, where I paid $6 for a strong rum and Coke. Just how I like 'em! My friends and I had a great time listening to the band, who sounded like they were playing music out of a Woody Allen movie, and sipping on our drinks. We'll definitely be coming back, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
