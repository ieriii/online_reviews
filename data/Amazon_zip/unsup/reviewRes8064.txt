First, go here. I mean it. Go here. I can't say it enough. Go here. If this is your one night out in a week, go here. From the top: Valet (a little pricey but at least they have it). From the start to the finish: nothing short of amazing. There's a little backstory here. I sold a car to the head chef a few years back when he moved to chicago from Brazil, and promised I would come sometime, and I did. (No more selling cars/being a douchebag kthx). Anyway, the staff is exceeedingly knowledgable and polite, savvy and interesting. They want to know how you are doing, want to make sure you are happy and well accomodated, friendly and pulling out chairs, everything. Literally on service alone these people deserve the tip. This isn't "working for the tip", this is legitimately polite and wonderful people. Food is top notch. Great salad bar, right off the bat. Creative mixed drinks, and a wonderful clean environment with nice aesthetics. A difference here from Texas De Brazil in Schaumburg is that here they bring the meat cooked to everyone's preference. Want a lambchop raw? medium? medium well? well done? They have it all right there, just tell em how you want it. This is truly a step above Texas De Brazil for only hmm, 5 or so bucks a person more? Now that I see the difference, I can tell you that it is night and day. Total great experience. Go here, seriously.
