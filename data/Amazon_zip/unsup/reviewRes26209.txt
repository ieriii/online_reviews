We went here for a pre proposal dinner for relatives. I am sure glad he didn't propose in the restaurant, you would not have been able to see the ring! Positive: The bar and bartender were great. And so was the cheese at the bar. Negative: I have to agree with other reviewers. It is way too dark. I might like to see what I was eating. Also, it was so hot at the table with the oil we almost had someone pass out! The cheese appetizer was so so. I ordered the beef. The first piece cooked nice - but after that - it took forever to cook - unless you like raw meat. By the time it was done - it was too tough. We actually timed the chicken for the 3 minute cooking time - and it was still not cooked. Dessert was nothing spectacular - the pound cake was a little dry and lacked flavor. I would come for drinks but head to another restaurant for food.
