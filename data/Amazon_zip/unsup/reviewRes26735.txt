4 Stars for Nuevo Leon....relative to 5 stars being a taco cart, or a carnitas specialist in the Yucatan. Look, I am a fiend for Nuevo Leon beans. I don't even like beans! But this is my favorite thing about my meal at Nuevo Leon. From what I gather, these are pintos cooked down after boiling and mashed with rendered pork fat and little bits of chicharron. Flour tortillas. I hate them! ....But I LOVE the flour tortillas here, doughy and riddled with yummy ass charred spots. This is not a taqueria, and though I am sure you can get a decent taco here, I'd really encourage anyone who goes here to have a "plate"...(shit, you'll be starving by the time you get to the front of the line) Anyway, the chops, the guisados, chilaquiles, BREAKFASTS!...and if you must, the fajitas! Heart stoppingly heavy and delicious. If you want to be really hip, go see Bayless over at Frontera....if you want to save some loot and have the working man's version of GREAT Mexican food, come on down to 18th St. ...and wait your ass in line, because its good, soooo good.
