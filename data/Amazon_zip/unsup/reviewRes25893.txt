Step into Catalunya. Parles catala? Well, that's alright, you'll still enjoy the lively, Gaudi inspired decor, and flavorful cuisine. The chair backs are encased in fabric that looks to be Custo influenced, and the back wall, around and above the bar, is a grand colorful mosaic. Bulbs hang from the ceiling, which is painted to contrast with the bright, airy walls. The arched windows from the top floor view Grant Park. My sangria blanca included grapes, pears, and rosemary to give it a more earthy and dry taste - far better than a fruity concoction. The Barri Gotic bocadillo, was plated on a rectangular white plate, cut into 2 isosceles pieces, and served with a bowl of herbed fries. The skirt steak was excellent, with carmelized onions, blue cheese, and oregano; a lil sweet, a lil salty and very tender. Great spot, I'll have to return for more. Els catalans ho fan millor.
