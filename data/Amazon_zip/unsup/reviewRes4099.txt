I just signed up for yelp solely to write this review. I went to Schwa almost a year ago and to this day feel compelled to write about my experience. I was more than excited when I found out that I was able to get a reservation. My date and I each brought a bottle of wine and off we went. Walking into Schwa is like walking into your best friends kitchen, music is playing everyone is talking and everyone is uber friendly. All of this aside the meal is what had me talking at the end of the night. We started out with an oyster amuse which didn't really do much for me and I was a little worried, silly me. To this day I still remember the majority of the courses I ate which I cant do for similar restaurants (Tru, L2O). The tiger fish is out of this world, the apple soup was amazing, but the best, the crackerjack sweet breads out of this world. The staff is amazing and you can really tell they have a passion for what they do. I cant wait to return.
