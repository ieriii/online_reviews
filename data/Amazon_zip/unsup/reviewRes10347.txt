I wanted to love it, but....some how it came up short. !st, reservations. Went on opentable, nothing avaiable on a Monday night at 7pm, infact nothing available until next Monday at 5:30pm? Okay so we call. Can get us in at 8:30pm, but when I ask they can take walkins "inside." So what the hey, I figure we will give it a shot and if we can't we will go to Chalkboard for some Mac n Cheese.... Get there at 6:30pm, can seat right away ainside, how long for outside? 45 minutes. Okay we decide inside, and....they walk us to a table outside. Odd. Waiter was okay, I hate when there is a card for specials, but then there are more specials (which he didn't tell us about, the waiter for the next table told them and we overheard).  FOOD; Apps-had the grilled calamari, octopus, shrimp-good, not great, calamari was both tough and (on the inside) kinda slimy, shrimp boring, octopus pretty good Had two pastas..half portions (for $10), guy next to us nearly had a fit. Pastas are around $15, he thought they woudl be 1/2 since it isn't listed on menu. These were both really good, Ravioli was Great, Gnocchi was pretty good...tomatoes in sauce were a little off (and big gnocchi). Entrees-duck was dry (really, really dry), and felt like it had been waiting for the short ribs to come out, which were in need of a little more time in the kitchen. Dessert-Mille Folglie was okay, the real hit (and next to Ravioli best thing we had) was the blueberry gelato. Not listed on menu, The waiter mentioned after I declined dessert, brought a 1/2 portion (for $4) that was really good sized and quite delishious! Wine list is good sized, though our waiter was virtulally no help in picking one out. Cocktails were good. Great outdoor scene, busy place, great people watching.  I just left wanting more....
