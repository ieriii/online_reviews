The best brunch place I have ever been to. That's a bold statement coming from me since I eat my body weight in food. The pancakes were decadent and delicious. Bongo Room changes their menu seasonally but when I went, I remember ordering single pancakes in a variety of flavors (hazelnut, pumpkin, lemon) each with custom toppings (fresh bananas, hot fudge and even gelato). And if you're not in the mood for a sweet breakfast, don't worry -- their salty dishes are just as good. I had a BLT benedict and my bf had a breakfast burrito with sweet potato and black beans. Even though the burrito was vegetarian, it was full of flavor and was just as satisfying as its meaty counterparts. I love Bongo Room and I would make it a must-stop if you're in the Chicago area. But if you're coming for brunch, get there early and be patient. Believe me... its worth the wait.
