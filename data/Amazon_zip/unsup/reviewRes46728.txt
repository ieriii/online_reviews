What struck me most about RJ Grunts was the high rating it has on yelp when it's nothing more than a marginally nicer Chilis. Do people in Lincoln Park have poor taste? I don't know. You're basically going to get greasy bar food. Your meal can easily serve two to three people. Yes, this is why Chicagoans are fat. The Buffalo "Turbo" Nachos were good. The one redeeming point was the restaurant's soundtrack--lots of feel good oldies favorites.
