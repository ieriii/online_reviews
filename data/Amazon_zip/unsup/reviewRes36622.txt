Quite possible one of the coldest host and hostess... Nothing to rant and rave about. This was the second time around. First time I felt the same thing and thought I will give it another chance after the second time NOT going back there again. the food was good our waitress was awesome but having the host ask you 50 thousand times if everyone in your party is here when half were waiting inside and the other half were waiting inside was a very uncomfortable experience. Coffee was the best thing out of everything. Chicago definitely has better breakfast joints then Meli's Cafe. OVER RATED is what I think.
