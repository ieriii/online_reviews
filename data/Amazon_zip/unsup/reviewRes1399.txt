My boyfriend saw Hot Doug's on TV (news) so we decided to go and check it out. Do not go on too empty of a stomach because this place is extremely popular. We waited in line for over an hour before placing our order. I can't remember what we ordered since by that time we thought we could eat the entire store so we ordered a little of everything. These hot dogs were the biggest I've ever seen! Each and every hot dog has its own unique flavor and we enjoyed them very much. Tip - closed on Sundays!
