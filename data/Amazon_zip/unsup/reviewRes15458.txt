A couple of coworkers and I decided to eat lunch here one day and I must say we will be back soon. I must start off by saying that I would love to go back in the evening and enjoy a glass of wine because the atmosphere is so sophisticated and cute! Each of us ordered from a different part of the menu and walked out completely satisfied carrying doggy bags. I had a salad that was full of all kinds of Greek veggies with the perfect amount of dressing. Not too heavy but not too light! An huge plus was the amazing home made bread we received while waiting for out meals to come out. Try their Focaccia... it is perfectly fluffy and flavorful with tomatoes and herbs!!! Enjoy!
