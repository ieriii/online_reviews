We waited 1 hour, 45 minutes for a table despite arriving right at 5 pm, but it was well worth it. I had a fabulous Mexican Mojito (possibly the most delicious drink I've ever had). We shared guacamole, and I had Tacos al Carbon: wood-grilled meat, poultry, fish or mushrooms sliced and served with roasted pepper rajas, two salsas, frijoles charros, guacamole and homemade tortillas. I had the pork version, which was divine! We tried to save room for dessert, but failed. Service was great. We dined outside and it was very enjoyable.
