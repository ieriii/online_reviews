The hotel is beautiful, fabulous location, and the front service staff are amazing. We accidentally booked a double, but our second day they upgraded our room to a king for free. However, the cleaning service did take my phone charger and so I was left without use of my phone for the remainder of my trip. I wish the hotel had been more accommodating seeing as it was their staff that caused this inconvenience, but unfortunately, they were not.
