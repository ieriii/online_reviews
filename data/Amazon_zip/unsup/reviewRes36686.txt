One of my favorites in Chicago, certainly for Asian. Great mix of Japanese/sushi and Thai which offers a lot of flexibility in tastes. The Golden Triangles and Crab Rangoon are amazing appetizers and it is tough to find something on the menu that isn't good for a main dish. Their basil or garlic chicken are good Thai options along with the Drunken Noodle or Pad See Ew.  Reservations not necessary, but it can get busy on Friday and Saturday nights. And perhaps most importantly, it is BYOB.
