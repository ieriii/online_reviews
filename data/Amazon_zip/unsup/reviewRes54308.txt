I have been to pequods Morton Grove all my life. I love the carmailized cheese and the little shack like place. I have never had a bad time there since i have been going there. Me and my family celebrate birthdays all the time and my kids love it. Unforunatley a couple weeks ago I witnessed something that did not make me happy at all. The young girl that was helping us was doing a fabulous job. She was great service and checked on us time to time and was not over bearing. Out of the corner of my eye I see this young girl getting scolded by this lady who i assumed was the manager and was pionting at our table. I was confused because we were fine enjoying our dinner. Our waitress did not look happy. After getting scolded she went into the kitchen and the manager came by our table. She asked how are pizza was and obviously i said good. She then asked to refill my drink and i said nicely no, our waitress just asked and i told her we were fine. I then got not a very nice look from the manager and she walked away. Then about 5 minutes later the manager came back again and asked if we were okay. I told her yes ( talk about over bearing) I really havent had a bad time as this place but that night was just bad.
