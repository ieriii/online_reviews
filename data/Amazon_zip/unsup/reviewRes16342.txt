I didn't get it. And, after years of trying, I still do not comprehend the mass popularity of this hodge-podge Latin restaurant. So-so food and drinks at big-big prices. Long waits, even with reservations. The wait staff always seems preoccupied, although I feel like there are more staff than patrons sometimes. The dining room is loud and crowded and bustling.  I do have to give it Carnivale for the architecture and dcor. When you walk into the dining room from the crowded bar area, your senses are affronted with color and vibrancy and happiness. I just wish the ambiance was backed up by a little more substance in, um, maybe the food department... The exception (beside the dcor) is the guacamole. I GET the guacamole: creamy, fresh, and the perfect limey-spice, my favorite Carnivale item, by far. Guacamole: My order when I am without-a-doubt dragged here again.
