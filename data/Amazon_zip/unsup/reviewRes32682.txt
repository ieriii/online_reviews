I've never had Ethiopian before and I had heard this was a great place to start. We were not disappointed. I will definitely be back - the food and service were excellent. If you've never had Ethiopian before, it is a little like Indian but different enough to make it unique. If you are concerned about spice, we had a person in our group who doesn't like much heat, and they made to order so that it was okay with the entire group (with some extra sauces and powders on the side to make it hot for those who prefer it that way). Our favorites were the lamb and chicken dishes, and the collard greens were excellent as well.
