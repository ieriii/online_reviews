I have been coming to Nana's since they opened, and I feel remiss that I haven't shared with the entire Yelp community my great love of all things Nana. Nana's sticks so much to its menu of organic, seasonal ingredients, that they don't even have Diet Coke because it's not organic! :)  While I have tried so many things off the menu through the years, my absolute favorite order is the soy chorizo and mushroom torta that is slightly reminiscent of a spicy sloppy joe with a side order of the mashed acorn squash. The acorn squash is sweet with a bit of spiciness. Sometimes I'm tempted just to go to Nana's to get a side of acorn squash to go and nothing else! I love my acorn squash, sooo much, that when my friend and I split the torta the other day, I made her order her own side. No sharing of mashed squash for me! My other favorites are their rotating menu of bread-like items at dessert. The pumpkin beignets last fall were ABSOLUTELY orgasmic, and the corn bread when it appears is also very tasty.  I am also a die-hard fan of the desserts at Nanas. I once went in for dinner by myself and shamelessly ate the entire cookie plate by myself! My top two favorite desserts I've ever had at Nana's, though, are the chocolate mousse bacon cake and the homemade funnel cake. The funnel cake is currently on the dessert menu. Chef Guy said he used some sort of ginger pancake batter. At any rate, it was a delicately towered homemade funnel cake that was fried on the outside by melt-on-your tongue light inside! It was swathed in a pool of custard, fresh raspberries, and raspberry sauce. The best touch was the sidecar of champagne that accompanied it!  The very best part of Nana's is the great service. Everybody, from the owners to the wait staff to the kitchen to the bar make sure to make you feel welcome! I am so glad to have a top notch place like this right in my backyard!
