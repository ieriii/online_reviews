This place is a classic. Hands down one of the top three best Chicago hot dog joints. Chicago style hot dogs made perfect. We went BIG and ordered the cheeseburger also, and it was mad delicious. French Fries are super bomb. The drive in style is very different, but something new. Its worth the drive from the city on a nice summer day.
