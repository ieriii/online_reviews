I love Garcia's! I'm a gringo, so I don't feel like a have a say in what's "the best" out there... But DAMN Garcia's never disappoints! Steak tacos for $2.00??? Say what!?!?! And they are delicioso! The pitchers of Margaritas always send me home in a fantastic mood! And the Lincoln Square location is perfect for parking. OLE!
