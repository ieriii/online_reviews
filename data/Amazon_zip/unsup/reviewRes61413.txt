I came here about 5 times and the food is always consistent. It's not the best cuban food I've ever had but there's not much to compare it to besides my friend's mom's cooking. I love the atmosphere. They have an outdoor patio that is perfect during the summer and good service. For appetizers, I always get plantain chips and the congris rice. It is sooooo good. The congris rice has bits of bacon in it which is like a little heaven in your mouth. Then for my meal I get the bistec sandwich it's good but sometimes it can be a bit sloppy. Oh and don't forget to get a pitcher of sangria! It's a nice complement to any meal there!
