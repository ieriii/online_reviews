I had my 150 guest wedding here last month and am so happy we chose this as our venue. We held both the ceremony (in the Fireside room) and reception (main dining room) at the restaurant. My husband and I both knew we wanted to have a brunch wedding and they were able to accommodate us by letting us rent out the entire restaurant early on a Saturday (they normally open at 4pm on Saturdays). Sammy, the on-site event coodinator, was great. She was incredibly patient and went above and beyond to grant all our weird requests. The venue itself is gorgeous and saved us a ton of money on unnecessary decorations/floral arrangements...we didn't want to mess with the aesthetic of the space. The entire staff was wonderful and all our guests are still complimenting us on the food (they were even able to cater to our vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free guests). Haven't ever been here for dinner but can attest that their brunch menu is out-of-this-world amazing (and on Sundays, their mimosas are only $4!)
