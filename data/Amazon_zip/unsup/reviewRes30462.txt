I went to Frontera Grill with my mom. We decided to wait the 2.5 hrs. and give upscale Mexican a try. We were both sorely disappointed. I got the suckling pig special and I can't remember what my mom got, but both items were waaaaaay too salty. That's kind of funny, too, because when I'm starving, ANYTHING tastes good. The only thing I remember liking about this place was the habenaro hot sauce (which is different than the kind they sell in the bottle). And the other thing that really disappointed me was that fact that they brought my appetizer with the food. After 2.5 hrs., I was pretty much starving and ordered the corn on the cob. Our food took forever to come (probably about 30 min.). I figured, by then, they had forgotten the corn. Instead, it came with the food. Fine, I suppose, but that wasn't really the point.
