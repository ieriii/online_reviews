Hands down best Korean I have been to. The Banchan were all great, Everything came out super fast. The Waitress was really nice and they changed our grill a few times which is nice. They do offer a limited menu after 10 so you do miss out on a few appetizers and soups if you go in late, but don't let that deter you I promise you will still find something to enjoy!
