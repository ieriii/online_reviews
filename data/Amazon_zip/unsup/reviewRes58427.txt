Glenn's is definitely a charming place - from the cereal bar, the artwork on the walls to the staff, my family immediately fell in love with this diner.We went for the Sunday breakfast today (did the Call Ahead) and were seated immediately. Many patrons were known by name when they arrived and the line of patrons was steady and moving.We were at Glenn's for one hour and from the moment we walked in to the time we left the staff was wonderful. Gary, our waiter, was very attentive to not only our table, but all those in his section, the entire time.Gary knew the menu - his description of the heat in the New Orleans Scramble was right on the mark. I was able to order my iced coffee the way I like it (plain coffee over lots of ice - not the fancy flavor stuff) and it was served iced not lukewarm as many other places have. The portions were more than generous for the price.Glenn's is a 20 mile drive from our home and well worth the drive. We will definitely be back again!
