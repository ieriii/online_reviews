Yum! 1: It was nice to see all the waiters/waitresses/hosts/etc not all Asian. Not that that is bad, but I feel like Sunda wasn't trying to hire only Asians to make you feel like you are having an "Asian" dining experience. The service was impeccable - the right people were chosen for the job regardless of how they looked. Plus they all had a nice snazzy uniform to make the team seem unified being that all of them didn't have black hair or slanted eyes. 2: The drinks were awesome. Pear sake with the cinnamon rim a keeper. A few fine sakes and we were smitten. A full sake list from light & crisp, smooth & round, rich & bold, and nigori cloudy make drinking sake as elegant as fine wine. Besides, good sake pairs best with this menu anyways. Drink up while sake doesn't have the sulfates wine or booze does that leaves you the hangover! 3: Food was amazing. One surely to please as it did for us was the "rock shrimp tempura with creamy aioli honey" - wowser. Then the lobster and wagyu (kobe beef) roll: creamy lobster, scallions, jalapeo, waygyu sashimi, truffle-foie gras aioli. My tongue was impressed, my stomach happy, my curiosity wanted to try everything else of carefully crafted culinary genius on this menu. 4: The ambiance was beautiful. Something to be seen with your own 2 eyes to take in right. We stayed for a couple of hours for drinks and dinner; being that we were so comfortable, with the place having good energy, perfect lighting, not being rushed by service we made a whole night of the place and could have easily stayed longer at that! With their impressive cocktail drinks we could've drowned ourselves if the price wasn't keeping us closer to sobriety.
