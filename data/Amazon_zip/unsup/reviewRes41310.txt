I'm not an expert on Vietnamese food. Matt W. and another friend and I went purely for the Pho this evening. We had some apps, but the goal was Pho.  If you like an Asian style soup and want to try something a little different, then visit Pho Xe Tang.  Despite having about a hundred options, the menu is pretty accessible for just about anyone, including Pho that includes tripe all the way down to just noodles.  The ambiance and service were typical of an average cheap Asian restaurant. The lights were bright, the server spoke little English and the service was incredibly fast and no nonsense. There wasn't anything wrong with it, but don't expect fine dining...at all. I would've like the restaurant more if we were sharing a table with an old man who thought all Asians looked the same and a younger girl who thought she knew everything about Asian food. She actually said to us at the end of the meal, "keep trying Asian food" like we had just experienced our first Asian meal outside of Panda Express. Chill, bitch. As for the old dude, if you can't tell the difference between a woman from the Philippines and from Vietnam, then your daughter/creepy young girlfriend shouldn't be telling us where to eat.  But, again, the food is good.
