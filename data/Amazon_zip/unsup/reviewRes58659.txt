Food is below mediocre and over priced. The manager is offensive and ignorant. The other waiters are attentive at times, and not attentive at other times. desert is not terribly pleasant. The atmosphere, interior decor as far as Ethiopian restaurants in chicago go, is probably the best.Food: Every time I have been I get served plates of flavorless mush that taste pretty much the same. Incredibly unpalatable. Veggie combo--flavorless mush. Doro wot--again flavorless curry with chucks of equally flavorless chicken. If this wasn't served to me as ethiopian food, my taste buds would probably not recognize it as such.Also, the manager was ignorant. Despite ranting on and on and on about how we should try the african veg combo and how there was an african band playing later, I'm pretty sure he thinks ethiopia is a city in the country otherwise known as Afrika. Kind of annoying. Atmosphere: The best part of the experience. Probably better than you will find at any other Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago. I don't really get all the hype about this place, but as a general rule of thumb, if there aren't many ethiopian people eating at a supposed ethiopian restaurant, chances are the food is probably not that great or authentic. I guess if you need something to chew into before a concert at the congress theater and you have extra cash you would like to waste, its okay. Or if you want to impress your date with your exotic' taste for ethnic food, than yea sure.1 star for the foodand another star for the ambiance/live music that they have going on some times.
