Terrific neighborhood restaurant with excellent food, relaxing atmosphere and attentive service. We started with the anti pasta plate, moved on to the hearty and tasty wild boar parpadelle and finished with the halibut and suckling pig specials. The roasted pig had a wonderful smokey flavor, and the fish was cooked perfectly. The lemon panna cotta was a refreshing finish to a great dining experience.
