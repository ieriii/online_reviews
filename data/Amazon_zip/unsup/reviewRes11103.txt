Aw man...I've been to Piece several times and never reviewed and for that I'm sorry. But I just can't get enough. I love this place! It really is my go to place for pizza in the city. Besides..the Goat cheese appetizer, yummy! I love the beer names, I love the atmosphere, I love the food. Great place to watch games, great place to go with friends.
