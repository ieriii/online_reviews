A weekday morning here usually sees lots of single diners eating very far apart...but it works here. With long hours, casual service, and a wide range of fare (breakfast always, cocktails, nice wine selection, great sandwiches), 3rd Coast is perfect for those times when you want to eat alone (or with others - it's ok!) and hide out at a nicely incognito location. Have visiting relatives staying in the Gold Coast? Take them to breakfast here. Shopping up Oak and Rush to State and want to sit and have a cappucino? 3rd Coast has a variety of coffee drinks and signature scones. However, I have to recommend getting fruit instead of potatoes with breakfast because otherwise it gets to be way too filling. AndI only wish they had a greater variety of omelets.
