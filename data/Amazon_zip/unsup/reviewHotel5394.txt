Plain horrible in my opinion. While the staff is extremenly friendly, helpful and professional, my room was clean but smelled like smoke. The lobby is crowed and old. Ice machine on my floor did not work. The restaurant in the lobby is not worth the prize and when I walked around to look for some place to eat near by, everything was closed by 6pm during the weekend. Place was noisy all time around and there is plain nothing to do within at least 6 blocks. This hotel is NOT WORTH paying $$$ just so you can see the tip of the Willis (Sear Tower) antenna.
