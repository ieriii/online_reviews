We had Sunday brunch here while visiting from Dallas. Trendy yet unpretentious gastropub with eclectic, Euro-centric comfort food. To start with, the bloody marys are among the best I've had. She had the red wine poached eggs and I the weisswurst. Both were excellent. The wurst came in a pot of still boiling water and was of the perfect consistency and seasoning. It was nicely paired with a doughy pretzel and deli mustard. Poached eggs were a refreshing approach to an old breakfast mainstay.
