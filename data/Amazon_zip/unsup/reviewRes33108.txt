Hark! Yolk, how I love thee. Let me count the ways. Seriously the brunch I had at Yolk was the best I ever had. Like in my whole life. Just call me Drake because I have been feening for some Yolk ever since that day. Just the mention of the name gets my mouth watering. I had the savory crepe filled with deliciousness. I don't even know what was in it. All I know is that my little 100lb self sat there and ate the whole thing. It went from one side of the plate to the other. It was so good that I couldn't even stop myself from audibly moaning with every bite. Yes, there was about a 2:1 moan:bite ratio. (what can I say, I'm a scientist). Anyway, Yolk is a must-go place. You will not be disappointed. Trust me!!
