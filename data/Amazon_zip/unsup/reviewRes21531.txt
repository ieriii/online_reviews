i love mexican food. a lot. this is a modern twist on tortas and caldos and i think they do a great job. it definitely tastes healthier than authentic mexican food so it is missing some of that richness, but it is still really good. we order the chips and guacamole, the pibil, the milanesa, the short rib red chile soup, and some tortas. we also each got a papaya agua fresca. everything was fantastic and well-priced.
