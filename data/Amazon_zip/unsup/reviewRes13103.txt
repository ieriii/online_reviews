Wow. The servers here do not mess around. They make me think waiting tables should be an Olympic sport. Unwrap your straw and discard the wrapper next to your plate - it's gone before it hits the table top. Water glass halfway empty? Your ninja waiter will appear out of nowhere, refill it, and disappear before you've realized what happened. If you need extra napkins, your server knows it before you do. I used to live in the neighborhood, but didn't get to eat here very often because I was in grad school and the meals are pretty expensive (I couldn't even really afford to live in the neighborhood, but that's a different story). In fact, I would go so far as to say many of the dishes are over-priced. But the place has a friendly, relaxed feel with an imaginative menu. I always liked walking by on my way to the L (which is conveniently located right next to Glenn's) and seeing a new banner out front - usually humorous, it gave me the impression that the owner/operator(s) have a lot of fun with the place. When people are happy running their business, it filters through every aspect of their services. At the risk of sounding like a new-age hippie, Glenn's has a lot of positive energy. This is the type of place you take someone when you want to impress them, but you don't want to look like you're trying too hard. Example: just moved to the city from the middle of nowhere? When your parents visit, show them how well you're doing and how nicely you're settling into your new digs by casually suggesting a bite to eat at Glenn's. Your dad can eat crab cakes in his jorts.
