Excellent service and great food, but I should try something other than the grilled center cut pork chops. Mmmm...pork chops. I did get a taste of the Feta and Spinach stuffed Lamp Chops but the cheese flavor I loathe was a bit too much for me.  If somebody could explain the logic behind having your sides limited to rice and potato or just vegetables, I'd like to know. Shouldn't vegetables and rice be an option as well? They do their best to turn the restaurant over during all hours, so don't be surprised by the bums rush after your meal.
