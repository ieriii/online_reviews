I have no idea why this is such a popular place. It seems so average to me, starting from the food, decor, service, and prices. It's one of those places I wouldn't oppose going to if a bunch of friends wanted to go, but I would never want to go to this place myself. Their wings are supposed to be a 'big deal,' but I just don't get it. Wendy's has better wings. I do like that they have outdoor seating in the summertime.
