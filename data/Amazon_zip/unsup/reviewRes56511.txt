Loved Frontera Grill!!! My husband and I went with another couple to celebrate a Birthday, and we had a fantastic time. We made the reservation several months in advance, and it was well worth it. We walked in, and they took us right to our table. There were so many fantastic choices on the menu, so we asked the server for recommendations. We started with guacamole for the table. It was the best guacamole I have ever eaten, and I've had lots of guacamole. I read a few reviews that said they'd skip the guacamole for that price tag, but I totally disagree!! The avocados were so perfect and creamy! Our server suggested the Special that night which was Cochinita Pibil, a pork dish. It was so yummy!!! I wanted to lick the plate clean. It came with habanero salsa, which was the spiciest thing I have ever tasted in my life. It was the perfect companion to the pork. The portion was so large, I couldn't finish the whole thing. My husband had the Oaxacan-Style Carne Asada, which was also delicious! The plantains with this dish were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, adding just the right amount of sweetness for the beef. We also shared the mushrooms and green beans at the table. Again, great recommendations from our server. We ended our meal by sharing the Tres Leches de Coco. The kitchen had added Happy Birthday and a candle to the dish, making our friend's night. This dish was heaven! The cake was not too soggy and the mango sorbet was so fresh and light!!! Loved it!Everyone at the table said the drinks were fantastic. There was a variety of Topolo Margaritas and Mexican Mojitos. My only complaint - being pregnant I asked if they could make a virgin drink and the server pointed me to the soda section. I was a little let down with my selection, some sort of homemade soda that was quite sweet. Overall, we loved this restaurant and cannot wait to go back!!!
