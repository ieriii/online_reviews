I thought the food was really really really good. I got the meatloaf sandwich and fries with a side order of curry sauce to put on the fries - delicious. My husband got the Irish breakfast, which I think is lame, but he's English so he can't help it. He thoroughly enjoyed his too. The place is definitely cozy, and the woodwork on the bars is just beautiful. The only thing that is keeping the fifth star away is the service. My food came out about five minutes before my husband's, which meant he ate half of mine before he even started his. I'm sure that will get better with time, since I was there like the third night they were open.
