We came here for lunch this past Saturday after seeing a blurb in the Red Eye regarding the chocolate croquette dessert (fried chocolate balls...how could I have not known of this sooner???). I had made a reservation for noon but didn't really need to. There were only 2 or 3 other tables with diners when we arrived. It's a cute place with a lot of natural light. But on to the food! They have a Catalan Express special for lunch with includes 2 courses and a fountain drink. For the first course, we had a serrano ham & fig salad and the mixto croquettas. I'm usually not a big salad fan but this was amazing! I wish they bottled the dressing and sold it..it was sooo good. I think this was the highlight of the meal. The croquettes, filled with ham and chorizo were also very tasty. The second course, my friend ordered the Las Ramblas grilled chicken sandwich. This was good (he's a big bacon fan) but thought the bread was kind of dry. For me, I had the Black Angus hanger steak. It was cooked just the way I liked it (medium -medium well)...but if you like your steak more rare definitely tell them. The waiter didn't ask how I wanted it (actually he was pretty non-existent...thus the drop in star. But the busboy was cool). Then the waiter came with our check before we even ordered dessert...the MAIN reason I picked the restaurant! We quickly corrected him. Unfortunately the chocolate croquettes didn't blow me away. Don't get me wrong...it was very good but maybe I built it up in my head too much.  But either way, we'll definitely be back! We heard good things about the Sunday brunch too.
