The food was great, but the service was terrible. The hostesses lied to us about our wait time, over and over -- it took over four hours before we got seated. Two hours in, we were having a great time at the bar down the street and they rushed us back saying that "our table" is finishing up. "Our table" proceeded to finish up for another 2 hours. Once we got seated the waiter was a douchebag, who would only recommend the most expensive dishes. Also, he tried to charge us for over $40 of apps that we did not have. Frontera ruined what should have been a great night with friends.
