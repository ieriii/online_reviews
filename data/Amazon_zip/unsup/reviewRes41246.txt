I took some friends of mine that were visiting from Atlanta. They never had Vietnamese food before and they said they wanted something different. It was a Tuesday and it was pretty crowded for a weekday. Our server was cool and he actually went out of his way to please us and offered great suggestions. I had the seafood noodle bowl and my friend had a dish that had Chinese sausage and a sunny-side-up egg served on a bed of rice. My friend LOVED it! His wife had a noodle dish with LOTS of veggies. She was very pleased. Our other friend told us that she was expecting deep fried food like the food she eats at all those China buffets...lol! She was surprised that her entree had a LOT of fresh vegetables. The experience was a very positive one and I finished off my meal with a cup of coffee (sweetened with condensed milk). Can't wait to go back!
