I really like this place! It's within walking distance from my condo, and it's BYOB which is awesome! The shrimp dinner is my favorite....I've had some of their sandwiches during lunch, which were also good.  I definitely recommend making a reservation if dining for dinner (OpenTable), since this place is always packed!  Cons When I say packed, I mean this place really gets PACKED! You will easily feel cramped if coming during prime hours.
