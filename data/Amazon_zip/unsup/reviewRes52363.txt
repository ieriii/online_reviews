We had the cheese and pepperoni deep dish. I almost had a breakdown while waiting; I was so hungy that my stomach stated dissolving itself in its own gastric juices, but when they finally brought the pizza out I was ready to go to town. It was a bit runny (a table full of cops next to us complained about this and the waitress comped them a new pizza to try to make it up to them). Since this was my first experience with deep dish pizza I just went with it and enjoyed the saucy goodness. Soooooooo much cheese and pepperoni! My arteries are struggling to push the saturated fats through. It was scrumptious, but hard to go wrong with pizza. The waitress was very nice and brought us out an extra cannoli even though we only ordered one. And yes, I ate the whole canoli too. Worth every calorie! It precipitated a narcoleptic nap-attack immediately afterwards, so be forewarned...heavy pizza=heavy soporific effect.
