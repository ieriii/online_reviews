We had our wedding rehearsal dinner at Carnivale on June 22nd. It was wonderful. I have been to Carnivale in the past and was not too impressed with the food. However, the food at our rehearsal dinner was EXCELLENT! Everyone commented on how great it was!  I would definitely recommend Carnivale for private parties. I hope to use them in the future for other events.
