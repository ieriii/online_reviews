My husband introduced me to Superdawg when we first started dating and now we go back all the time. Hot dogs anywhere else just don't taste as great. Neon relish, tomato pickles, pickles are great when you ask for extra they sure do give you extra. my kids love going here! took my 2 year old for her first time, and like any kid she fell in love with Maurie and Flaurie. The only downfall to the place is the warmer it is outside the more people go for the great food, and there lot doesn't have enough room for a ton of cars. The car hops are awesome super friendly. The food packaging is priceless. Customer Service is off the chain! With great food, and Great customer service who wouldn't keep going back?
