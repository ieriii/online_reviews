We went to Shaw's Crab House for some good seafood cravings. We were not impressed with the food or the service, we expected more.My review is focusing on the food/service/ambiance we experience, not on why you are there or who is paying for the meal.We had the oyster sampler which was excellent to be expected. Although the frozen vinagrette sauce was a bit overwhelming, not a good match to delicate fresh oyster flavors. Nothing beats some few drops of lemmon juice to bring them alive! But I would recommend this appetizer.The bread basket was interesting but removed and took multiple requests to two waiters/bus persons to get it back. Our waitress was missing in action most of the time. Lobster bisque was good, but small portion and no lobster chunks to speak of.We had the Walleye fresh fish filet (from great lakes), soft white and tasty, with a delicious lobster sauce around it. Would recommend if available, I never had it before. The Seafood sampler was also good but not great! Shrimps were carved in their shell, scallops soft, lightly grilled on each side which melted in your mouth, the crab cake too dry, too much bread and a sauce that did not match the flavor. Had much better crab cakes for a lot less money. We also ordered spinash which were left on the plate, too oily & watery for our taste.You can expect good food, but because of the service and some of the dishes I gave them 3 star rating, for the price they have to deliver a better experience for the foody. These are just our comments for our food taste, your taste and experience could be different.
