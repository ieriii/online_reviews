Been to different pizza joints in Chicago, and I have to say, one of the best ones so far. Service is great, pizza is good. I have been a big fan off Chicago deep dish, and being that I only go to Chi-town once a year, I always have to make time to eat a slice or two. I do admit that Giordano's is quite touristy and pizza is more liked stuffed than deep dish, but man is it good. Layers of cheese, meat, more cheese, and more meat. Topped of with a light and tangy tomato sauce. I have been to Gino's East and Uno's, and for more local flare, I would recommend Uno's. Can't go wrong with what the locals recommend. For a first time to the windy city, I would recommend Giordano's Pizzeria on Rush since it is right smack in the middle of downtown. Giordano's Pizzeria on Rosemont sells frozen half-baked pizza's to take home with me, $50 for overnight delivery is a little much. I guess I will have to wait another year to dig into another slice.
