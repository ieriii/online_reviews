Historic building with great employees, stellar location, and hard to beat price. 3.75 stars Cost to worth it ratio: 5 (we got this room for an average of ~$130/night including taxes! Four Seasons a few steps away goes for quadruple that.) Highlights: - Location: half a block from the famous Michigan Ave, across the street from Bloomingdale's on one side and the Hancock Tower on the other. Walking distance to most everything and short cab ride to Lincoln Park area. - Service: fantastic. After being checked in, they called a few minutes after we got settled to check how everything was. When we had to take the service elevator, we didn't complain but they apologized and let us take the hotel town car to dinner on them. :-) - Amenities: gym, 24 hr room service, restaurant/bar, wine shop, and mini bar. - Historic: building's been around forever--they have a 3 page story of it in the hotel's info binder. Midlights: - Atmosphere: rooms and lobby isn't anything special, but they're fine. Lowlights: - Only had 2 queen bed room when we checked in - 1 of 2 elevators they had was out the whole time. There are several floors, so that slowed things down quite a bit at times. On the place alone I might not be too impressed, but the price, service and location bumps it up a few notches so I'd consider staying here again.
