I picked Geja's for our anniversary dinner beacuse of its reputation for being one of Chicago's most romantic restaurants. I made reservations through Open Table and ordered flowers to be delivered to the resatuarant. When we arrived we were seated immediately and sitting on our table was the beautiful arrangement that I had ordered. It was a really nice touch and executed perfectly.  The service was amazing and it was such a fun experience that we had smiles on our faces from the moment our waiter greeted us to the time we walked out the door. They even presented us with a glass of champagne to congratulate us on our anniversary. This has to be one of the best experiences we have ever had in a restaurant and it will be hard to top this one.
