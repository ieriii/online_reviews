I have been going to Carnivale for years and it has always been on of my favorite restaurants in the city. So imagine my huge disappointment when I went there there last Monday night and received quite possibly the worst service.  We arrived around 6 on Monday night and the place was practically desolate. My friend and I were seated on the outdoor patio right away and ordered our favorites, the ropa vieja, guacamole and the ceviche trio, along with cocktails.  When I finished my drink, the busser took the glass away but my waiter was nowhere to be found. Ten minutes later I asked the hostess to please have our waiter come over. He arrived shortly, took our order, and then we waited 20 more minutes for it. Did I mention the place was dead? When we were done with our meal, my friend decided she wanted dessert. 15 minutes later, when the waiter still hadn't come back, we asked the busser if he would just bring our check. He did, and my card sat on the table for another 15 minutes before anyone came to take it. Outraged, I brought the check to the hostess station and asked her to run our bill. She brought it to the server and he ran it right away. I'm willing to say that any restaurant can have an off night but my friend and I felt absolutely ignored by our server. In hindsight, I should have complained to a manager but we were simply too upset. It's sad to see that at one of my favorite restaurants in the city, I'm treated like my service just doesn't matter.
