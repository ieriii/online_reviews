Some of the food was great, some was just ok. The staff in general was very good, but our server was HORRENDOUS. Ordering was like being in the Twilight Zone. Each person would say what they wanted, and she would repeat back something totally different. After we finally managed to communicate to her what we were ordering, she still brought one of us the wrong dish. Her attitude could not have been more I don't give a shit, and she seemed super annoyed when we asked for basic things like cream for the coffee. It really was shocking, since this is supposed to be a nice place. It felt more like the Golden Nugget at 3 in the morning. A disappointment that the food really didn't make up for.
