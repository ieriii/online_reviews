My girlfriend and I stopped in to Shaw's for an appetizer. We were doing a progressive dinner with the finale at Foga de Chao a few blocks away. Our waiter seemed a bit peeved that we ordered water and $20 worth of appetizers (and rightly so considering each seat in very valuable). I tipped the good man well for his efforts and inconvenience. ORDERED: Lobster Bisque, Crab Cake slider and Burger slider. TASTE: My partner had the bisque and it was so good she refused to share. I was left munching on the round (made in-house?) soup crackers after my two sliders. The crab cake slider was great! All I could think of was Crabby Patty from Spongebob. The burger slider also really great. Shaw's Crab House is definitely a destination for a proper meal when I return to Chicago. POST SCRIPT: I love that they have a photo of my food writer hero, MFK Fisher on the wall for "Consider the Oyster" of course. Also mermaid pinup artwork in the mens' room.
