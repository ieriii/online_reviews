Summary: Location gets four stars, food gets four stars, price gets four stars, service gets four stars. Details: My eating habits are what some people might call "simple." Or if you're my friends, you might call them "unhealthy," "kid-like," or just plain "gross." So going to an Indian restaurant is not usually my first choice in dining experiences. However, a Groupon was about to expire, which means sacrifices must be made. And I'm sure glad I made this one. The food was great! I probably had some of the blander options, but for me it was about as ethnic as they come. The menu is looooooooooooooooooooooooooooong (I'd add extra o's for effect, but that would just be obnoxious). Plan to spend at least 5-10 minutes reading through it, and then another 30-35 minutes trying to figure out what you want. I had a samosa and the "butter chicken." Both were very tasty, and not too spicy. We ordered dishes for the group, and the food was enough for the five of us and then some (except for the one with nut allergies...he unfortunately couldn't share in most of the dishes, so it's a good thing to ask your waiter/waitress in advance if the food contains anything you might be allergic to). The service is pretty attentive and the place is larger than it looks from the outside. We arrived for a 7:00 dinner on a Monday night. It was busy, but people without reservations didn't really have to wait long at that time. So if you tend to have more "simple" eating habits, I'd suggest giving this place a try...you might just surprise yourself.
