This has been a favorite of mine for quite some time, mostly for the cafe area. I do love the actual grocery store, but for me, it is a place for perusing and fantasizing, and not actual buying because of the high prices. The cafe hasn't ever failed me, but usually I order the sandwiches. This most recent time, I had the Asian Salad and the Biscuits&Gravy. (Yes, I know weird combo.)  The Asian Salad was horrendous to say the least. It was just a ton of napa cabbage with chicken and sesame ginger dressing. I was expecting a bit more "Asianness" to go into the salad - where are my snow peas, water chestnuts, mandarin oranges, almonds, carrots...?? or any of a number of other things that could have made this salad more interesting?!?!? It is safe to say that the Asian Salad at McDonalds tastes better. (There usually is a Thai Salad offered that tastes good, but this did not happen to be an option on this day.) The Biscuits & Gravy were another disappointment. Starting with positives: the biscuits were super buttery and crisp and could have been good with marmalade and tea... however that wasn't quite what I was going for. The gravy that came with the dish was quite lacking in quantity. I wanted BISCUITS AND *GRAVY*. Yes, emphasis on the gravy. I expect a big soupy mess on my plate, and biscuits that are soft like mashed potatoes, because maybe sometimes I like to pretend that I'm a senior citizen with bad dentures.  Despite these two failures which occurred in one visit, and I will attribute to horrible bad luck in possibly choosing the worst things on the menu or a bad day for the chef..... I'm still giving Fox and Obel 4 stars for being consistently great before. Also, if you make a $20 purchase here (not hard to do even if you're only coming here for a meal), you get your parking validated (=FREE!!)
