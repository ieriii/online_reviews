I'm a meat eater. When I used to drive a forklift and eat out of roach coaches, I was the guy getting pork tamales and eating corned beef hash out of the can. So believe me when I say that this place was surprisingly good. Let me be truthful though. The taste of the vegan food at this place is spot on. All of the flavors of the "meats" and cheeses are there and I was amazed at how much my Country Fried "Steak" tasted like the real thing. However texturally, yes, its a little different and to be honest, I could not completely finish because of it. It wasn't bad at all mind you, it was just so damn DENSE! I have had Seitan before but never in a Faux "steak" and I think its just something that vegans are used to. Veg. Pot sticker appetizers were really good. Nothing jaw dropping but pretty dang tasty. The best part though was the Vegan shakes. We had a Peanut butter shake and it was insanely good. I really did think it would suck but it was as good as any regular shake. (now that I think about it, I hope it was actually vegan! :) I had read the reviews here on yelp and was worried about it being a little snobby or even dirty but honestly I didn't get that here at all. Service was a tiny bit slow but not any worse then anywhere else on a busy night (was a full house). I'm sure there are plenty of instances when the waiters are stressed out and are jerks to people, but until it happens to me, I won't complain. Kill them with kindness is my M.O.
