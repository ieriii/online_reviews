Place is one of a few good spots to have breakfast in the South Loop.Pro's- Food was fairly good- Large portions- Good coffee- Relatively cheap- Modern DecorCon's- Although you can't penalize a restaurant for this - long wait for table- Service was just OK (slow on refills)- Although food was tastier than your typical chain such as IHOP, there is better breakfast food in the Loop Area such as Lou Mitchells, Orange (now closed), and Eleven.
