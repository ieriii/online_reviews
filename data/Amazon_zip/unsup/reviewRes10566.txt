I like pizza. I really really like interesting pizzas that are HUGE with a big locally brewed beer on the side. The crispy crust here is quite good. I also love that you can get mashed potatoes, clams, and goat cheese on a pizza! (not that I ever would...) All three "style" options are all really good as well. The variety makes each visit a pizza adventure! It's a little pricey because it's smack dab in the middle of ultra-trendy Wicker Park. But, it's worth it every now and then! I like the Sunday take-away special. $25 for a large pizza and growler of beer. They also have karaoke on Thursdays and LIVE BAND karaoke on Saturdays. How fun is that?
