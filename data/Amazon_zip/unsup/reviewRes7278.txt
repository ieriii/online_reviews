I had the pulled pork sandwich which was excellent and the portion size was huge. We also tried the hush puppies for an appetizer which was great. With your meal, you get free pickles and sweet potato chips which were awesome. The restaurant itself has a vintagey homey feel and was very welcoming. I don't know how much more you would want in a dining experience. 5 Stars.
