is this really worth taking my time to write the 1,057 or whatever review? eh, I'll do it anyway. awesome concept, great food, great service. ONE problem: the line is always out the door no matter what time you get there. when I was there I saw the owner (who is always the one taking orders one..by..one...) chatting it up with costumers while the line out the door was only getting bigger. If the guy would just take the orders and go on to the next, I feel as if the line wouldn't be an hour long each day. or if he hired more people. but obviously try it if you havn't, and you have to get the duck fat fries. mmhhh
