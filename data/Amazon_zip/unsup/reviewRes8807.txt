My new favorite place for Persian food! All around the food is great. The pita is amazing as they get it fresh from a Bakery down the street! I think we went trhough 5 baskets of pita and huge helping of hummus. I got the shrimp and chenjeh which was great. Chenjeh (rib-eye) was cook so tender and the shrimp is very flavorful! I highly recommend giving this place a try. PLUS... they have a great to-go place next door so you can always swing by for a pickup!
