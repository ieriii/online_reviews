While visiting Chicago the boyfriend and I ended up here with a friend. I have to say it was definitely a NEW culinary experience for both of us. If you are not adventurous with food or you are a health nut there are limited options. Other than that it is a foodie's playground. We tried all sorts of stuff...fried eggplant balls, some sort of cauliflower dish, mussels with pancetta (just to name a few).  It's like a tapas restaurant but with italian/mediterranean dishes. We were there on a Sat night and the place was PACKED!!! The service was good, I can't say great, but solidly good considering how busy they were. Three different times a server tried to bring us something we didn't order. There was a joke between our group and the group next to us that a phantom table existed between us. Be prepared to sit at a table with strangers. Most of the restaurant is community seating, great if you like to chat with people and see what everyone else is having, not so great if you are not friendly. Best part, they are reasonably priced. We ordered 7 or 8 items, two desserts, 3 beers, 1 glass of wine and tea and our bill was $130. For 3 people, given how stuffed we were when we left, I'd say that's not bad at all. I would definitely go back again to try more new stuff, but I'm keeping my boyfriend away from the lardo.
