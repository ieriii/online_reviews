This weeks date night with the hubby was at Glenn's Diner. We were first timers and hear some awesome things about their all you can eat crab legs. If this review was based on food alone I would have given it 5 stars, the crab legs were huge and its no joke ALL YOU CAN EAT! The menu was extensive and I would love to go back and try more. I learned that you need to make a reservation because it is a teeny tiny place. Maybe 10- 12 tables and it was crowded (this I always consider a good thing), but very very squished. The service was good- nothing stellar just good service, meaning we had our drinks on time, we received our refills on our basket of crabs and were well attended to. The vibe of this place is nothing fancy by all means, it was a fun hip little diner with a fun atmosphere, a great place to come with a group of friends!
