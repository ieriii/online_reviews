What else to say that hasn't already been said after 1,200+ reviews? Just go. That said, it's good to go strategically. Go hungry. Go in mid-afternoon to avoid super-long lines.

The Celebrity Sausage star of the day was outta this world, with a cherry and apple pork sausage, sweet curry mustard, cocoa Cardona cheese and vodka-infused dried fruits. One large order of fries was enough for four people. Oh, and Doug takes the A La Card, and while it seems like a challenge to spend $25 here, we were able to get just over the limit and thus received a generous discount. What a special treat.
