Probably not a hotel I would have picked for myself, but we were there for a business trip and it was booked for us. It seems like everything, currently, is an ikea quality boutique hotel or run down. It was nice to stay in a just really nice hotel with more attention to comfort than the elevator club music. The staff was friendly and attentive. The door was always held open for you by someone that seemed genuinely happy to be doing it. The lobby bar was great and more active than most hotel bars. Really great experience all around.
