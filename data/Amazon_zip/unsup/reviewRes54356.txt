I have been going to Pequod's for about 5 years now. I love the pizza. That said, I have completely stopped ordering from them because of how often they have screwed up my orders. Not once, not twice, and get this... not even three times. They have screwed up FOUR delivery orders in a row. Once, I got someone else's pizza. Yeah, you heard me right. Another time, they left out my appetizers and had the nerve to ask me if I STILL wanted them! EXCUSE ME? Another time I got the wrong toppings completely. It wasn't even close. Ugh, this is taking me down a dark path now. I'll just end this by saying the last time I went to Pequod's to sit down with a few friends, we waited 90 minutes after being told it was a 30-minute wait. I haven't been back since.I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt, expecting my next experience to be better. I don't care anymore if the pizza is good, I can't accept horrible service time after time. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 4 times, we're done here. There's too much good pizza in this city to tolerate your mistakes. BuhBye.
