The Bad Apple was sold to me as "the new Kumas". Perhaps not quite, but I still didn't come away disappointed. Beer menu: rocks, and reasonably priced. The server was semi-knowledgeable about beer, but she has a lot of beers to learn about. I'd come here just to drink beer. Burger: excellent pretzel roll, quality was great, but it was overcooked. I ordered medium and got medium well to well. Fries: a bit soggy, but I enjoyed the old bay on it. Service: no complaints Atmosphere: Clean, attractive, and a great outdoor patio. Price: excellent for what it is. I'll go back, but let's make it clear that it's not Kuma's good.
