This review might be a bit of a strange one, as it is actually for ambiance I saw only when I went in to pick up a lunch menu for ordering to our hotel the next day, and the subsequent food eaten outside of the establishment. I was really impressed by the clean, exotic, romantic appeal when I walked into this restaurant. I've always been slightly interested in going, but this venture in to grab a menu really sealed the deal for me. It is now only a matter of time. The music was low and seductive, the palms and white decor reminiscent of a different place and time. After arguing with a lady on the phone the next day when trying to place the lunch order for myself and my colleagues (I had been assured they *do* deliver to the Millennium Knickerbocker) a nice man took over and completely took care of me. Our food arrived in nice containers with ample utensils - and ingredients (like my fish dumplings) separated out to keep them from getting soggy before their arrival.  I found the soup a bit more oily than I like, but the dumplings were very scrumptious and the seasonings in the soup were delightful. Also delightful was the scallop and ginger noodle salad. I really had no idea what to expect from this dish, and found it fresh and light. All in all a great lunch. Now, to go back an have the full experience sometime soon at dinner.
