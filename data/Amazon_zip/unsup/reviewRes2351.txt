If you only go once in your life make sure it's for the duck fries made on Fridays only!! The hotdogs are freaking fabulous even if you order the regular dog or the Salma Hayke Dog it's delicious. Just do NOT forget the fries made in duck fat... yummy! Oh and another thing this place takes cash only!!
