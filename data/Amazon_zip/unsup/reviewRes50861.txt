Came here for a Sunday brunch, and surprisingly didn't wait as long as I expected to for a table. The service was great: my coffee cup was never empty and the food was good. Well, I had oatmeal and fruit, how could anyone mess that up?! :) I'm definitely a fan as far as their oatmeal making skills and service goes :)
