I spent some time at the Milshire a year ago. Great deal and great location. The cheapest room is $28 a night and it's literally steps from the blue line (Logan Square stop). Friendly and cooperative staff. People may complain about the conditions (and they're partly right)...but thats why the hotel is so cheap. Also great for nostalgia lovers...real old feel to the place.
