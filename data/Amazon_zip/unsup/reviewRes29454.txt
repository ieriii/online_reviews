carb lovers unite! i always order the robust gorgonzola pasta (not for those with weak taste buds) and the clam sauce pasta. i don't know the exact names of the dishes. i just know that they taste good. that's all you really need to know, right? i've been here lots o' times and i'm thinking i should try the other pastas on their menu. i'm sure i'll love the others just as much as i love the usuals. parking is a pain so i usually just phone in my order and pick up. the restaurant itself is small and the environment is so-so. this is a no fuss, sweat pants wearing place to eat.
