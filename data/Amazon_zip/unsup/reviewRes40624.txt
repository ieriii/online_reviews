I've been to all three Pasadita's This place is great for the Sunday afternoon Burro and for late night snacks. I also go in sometimes to get some of the home made chips they fry in the basement to bring home to make my won nachos. Always nice for my veggie pals, they will make it on a separate surface if you ask. They also don't mind if you practice white boy spanglish on them... So great!
