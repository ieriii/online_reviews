One of the best things about Wishbone is the variety of food: you can get really healthy fish/veggie options, and the hamburgers are really good(so my husband says). I'd go with the crab or crawfish cakes or the veggie options (I've heard the chicken is bland) and ask to be seated in the back section (where you will get chips and salsa) away from the throngs of ill-behaved, screaming children. Service varies widely.
