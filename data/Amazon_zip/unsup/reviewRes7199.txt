Favorite Italian place in the city. Great menu selection, good array of season specials while having their house specialties. If you sign up for the mailing list you get gift cards throughout the year. Try the grilled calamari! I have been here with small and large groups, and sometime the chef/owner even comes out and asks how everything is. I would travel near and far to return.
