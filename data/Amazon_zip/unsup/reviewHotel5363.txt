Great location literally right next to the red line Grand Street Station and close to the miracle mile shops. Close to a large supermarket as well, just around the corner. The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. Even the beds were adjustable in how firm or soft they could be. Good sized bathroom, as well as a microwave and fridge in the room. Free wifi was nice too, although they don't have free continental breakfast. Good service too... the staff was friendly and accommodating. Parking and valet is expensive though, just like everywhere else in downtown.
