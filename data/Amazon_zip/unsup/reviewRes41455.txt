Very good Pho. The broth here is "cleaner" than other Pho joints I been to in other cities (meaning they skim off all the impurities). Best tendon I've had in Pho - nice big toe sized slabs of really tender tendon, yum. Their sliced steak was overcooked and too tough - it should be sitting on top not submerged in the soup when served so u can cook it at your leisure. And if there was any brisket, I couldn't tell, all their various meats tasted the same as they were overcooked - generous amount tho. Still, the broth was very pleasing. Spring rolls were also good here as they r everywhere. Found it very similar to Pho 777 (although 777 actually had brisket tho I think their brisket was also tough and not tender). Better than 888 slightly imo, but more crowds here. The fruit smoothie I had was really good, tapioca the right consistency, tho the fresh fruit chunks they put in there are not quite ripe so a bit unnecessary taking up space. You may have to do communal seating. Will def come back for my Pho fix.
