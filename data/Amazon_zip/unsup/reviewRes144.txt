Simply put, Amazing. Nothing is what you expect it to be. It is almost all exquisite, out of 18 courses there is only one that i could honestly say I didn't feel was incredible, that said I would still happily gorge on it. The creativity and complexity of flavors.. the paired scents that accompany many dishes as well as the active participation required in others all adds up to something that I never expected to experience. This is truly on another level, it makes other 3 star restaurants like Le Bernardin appear boring and uninspired. If you can, ask for Richard to be your sommelier, he is as eccentric as the food and adds flair to an already exhilarating performance.
