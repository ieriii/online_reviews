Well, parking still stinks in Andersonville, but here's a good reason to brave the situation anyway! Anteprima was one of the restaurants listed in this week's Appetite Stimulus Special....so we eagerly made reservations for Monday night. As soon as we were seated, the menu truly became the focus of conversation. There were several specials in each category of appetizer, pasta and main dish. Delightful. And their regular menu was also complex and enticing as well. So, cut to the chase....we ordered two different salads, a half order of the chestnut ravioli and two main courses...more on those in a moment. The two salads, one of fennel and orange, the other of endive and persimmon were both dressed in delicious extra-virgin olive oil and fresh lemon juice. I have to say, it's so nice to be able to taste the ingredients of a salad without having to fight with the dressing! Every bite was fresh, crisp and fragrant. The chestnut ravioli was superb; rich but not to heavy. I can see where a whole portion would be too much. As it was, five of the creamy envelopes were perfect for the two of us. My friend ordered the lamb shank and I had the scallops with sunchoke puree...again, the simple preparation allowed the flavors and textures of the food and herbs used to delight the palate. Our server was charming and very knowledgeable regarding both the menu and the wine list, so our bottle of wine complemented our meal very well and at a decent price point. The only not so great part of the meal was the dessert. We had the Pear and Goat Cheese Tart....could have been yummy if it weren't as dry as it was....sigh....my advice would be to cover it a bit during the day...or something. But it came with a complimentary glass of Moscato di Asti as part of this week's promotion....that helped it go down very nicely. We loved the experience and the food.
