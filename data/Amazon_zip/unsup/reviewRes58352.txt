This restaurant over-delivered across every expectation that was already set by the two-star Michelin rating. All I can say is that the 'Partridge & a Pear Tree, Grilled Foie Gras and Saffron Ice Cream are all in the discussion for dish of the year in my book. Wow is really the only thing I can say to explain it.
