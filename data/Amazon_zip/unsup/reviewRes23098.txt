stopped one nite, after getting lost in the city, and yelled at my husband, when I saw Mr&Mrs Superdawg. We are from NWI, and I adore a good dog. I have long heard the legend of this place, where your hotdog, served in boxes,on a bed of fries. It was winter and COLD. We went it and ordered an array of foodies to try. Hotdogs of course, polish, hamburger, shakes, and of course fries. It all was Yummies, and did not disappoint. I adored the kitsch packaging that the food comes it, just adds to the overall experience of the place. They have enclosed dining area in the chilly months. It was a greatsuprise ending to a day out on the city.
