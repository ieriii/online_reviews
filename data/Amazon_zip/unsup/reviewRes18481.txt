Sadly, we were starving when we got here and found out about the over hour wait. So we wandered around the block to find something else, but the places we were interested in trying were closed for lunch, or lunch time was over (2pm). We made our way back to XOCO and decided to just order food to go. I split the goat barbacoa torta (special of the day) and pork belly vermicelli noodle caldo, and then ordered the churros with chocolate dipping sauce. The sandwich was pretty delicious, the avocado went really well with it. The noodle soup felt a little more asian (like taiwanese beef noodle soup), and I liked the kick it had to it. Delicious! The churros were also good... not too sweet. I tried it with the dipping sauce, but I was not a fan... the sauce was a little sour and the sourness was too overpowering. I'd love to come back if the wait wasn't so ridiculous. At least their to-go ordering was pretty quick.
