This place is almost a weekend ritual for me. I dont deviate from their Phos. If they are or not Phos, I do not care. They are filled with goodness and have never, ever, ever let me down. I yearn for my bowl of great soup, random meat, fresh veggies, and noodles. And, the cold coffee with condensed milk is fantastic. I want more.
