It felt like I should be paying more, but that wasn't the case. The entrees are large portions of well made Italian standards and homemade pasta. The room has an upscale feel to it, but it was crowded with relaxed looking locals. The service was attentive. The large bar was packed on the Friday night the last time we went in.
