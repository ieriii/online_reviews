Eh. I'm not overly in love with the place. We had a party of 8. Each couple order their own rolls or entrees. We had the Spicy Tuna, Alaska, and Rainbow rolls with a Ceviche appetizer. We couldn't taste the king crab in the Alaska roll and couldn't verify how much crab was in the roll since it was too dark (there's romantic lighting and then there's dark). The rolls were fine, nothing to rave home about. Plus, was it just me or is it a tad pricey?? The place does get crowded. Glad we got here early.
