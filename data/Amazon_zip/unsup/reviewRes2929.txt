So I'll first say that we were probably the cheapest customers in there. We were all about the cheapest wine and the prix fixe menu.  Hey, it wasn't a business dinner, sadly.  Despite that, we were given the same top-notch service as the high rollers. This is they way it should always be, but heck, sometimes it's just not. The food was just delicious - you get a lot of extras...the spoonful of soup, the candies at the end of the meal... Everything is simply top of the line, as it should be at a restaurant of this caliber. As I said, we were the cheapest customers, and our bill came to over a hundred bucks a person (pre-tip). But it was worth every penny.
