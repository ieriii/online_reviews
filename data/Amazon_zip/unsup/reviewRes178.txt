Believe the hype! I ate here last night and loved it. Best meal of my life? Yup. An amazing sensory overload? Indeed. Over the top? Of course! There isn't much to add to the praise already laid out on this Yelp page. One thing I don't see mentioned a lot is the environment there. While this is a luxurious over-the-top experience, I wouldn't go here for a romantic night out. The focus is all on the food and the wine. So, long gushy conversations get cut-off descriptions and instructions for the next dish or glass of wine. Oh, and as someone who has a pretty minimal knowledge of wine, I sort of wish the sommelier could dumb down his descriptions a bit. I actually mentioned to him that I didn't know a ton about wine, but that didnt't stop the descriptions and wine comments that were way over my head. Highlights - Black Truffle Explosion, monocrhomatic white bass, rabbit rillete, earl grey tea dessert. Now that I have gone once, I am worried I am going to be looking for excuses to head back soonish!
