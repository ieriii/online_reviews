Food is amazing. The prices are so cheap!! I can have a Tostada, my partner a taco or tostada and two drinks.. and we're out for under $20. The drinks are the best! They are always strong and not super cheap liquor. The problem: the service SUCKS. Once you receive your food you will NEVER see your waitress again. Forget about asking for more napkins! They get 3 stars for food and lose 2 for lack of service.
