Five stars for the Cafe con Leche. If you are just grabbing some coffee and a pastelito this place is amazing. If you are looking to eat Cuban food do not go to 90 miles. The food is mediocre and not authentic cuban. Chimichurri sauce on steak? are you serious? The mojo on the Yuca was bland. The service was as bad as the food. If you want good cuban food go to La Unica http://www.yelp.com/biz/ or Cafecito http://www.yelp.com/biz/
