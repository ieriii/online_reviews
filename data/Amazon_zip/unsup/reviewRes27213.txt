In a city filled with and known for amazing deep dish pizza, it can be difficult to stick out. You've got your Uno's, Giordano's, Lou Malnati's Gino's East, etc. How's a (relatively) small pizza chain with a questionably pronounceable name supposed to stand out? Lou's has their delicious toppings, Giordano's has cheese portions that cause the Food Pyramid to crumble, Gino's has their sauce and what does Pequod's have? Their crust. Their delicious, caramelized crust with seasoning soaked right into the pans they emerge from, akin to a fine whiskey absorbing the flavors and aromas in its cask. Rounding out the pies are fresh toppings, just enough cheese to drape the sides of your slice and sauce with the slightest hint of sweetness. If one were to nitpick (not me, just... one), the top floor can get relatively loud when the place gets packed, simply due to the narrow areas near the back reflecting the charming sound of people yelling at televisions. But then again you're not here for the atmosphere. You're here to get your pizza on. Oh yeah, they have a fantastic lunch special of a personal pizza and drink for under five bucks. You'd spend more grabbing lunch at potbelly's.
