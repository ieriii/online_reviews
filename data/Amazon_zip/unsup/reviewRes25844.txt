One of my favorite places in the city. I love the booths (I've never sat anywhere else), the food and the service. What don't I like? Their house Chardonnay. Nasty stuff. The cheese fondue has a great bite to it that highlights the grapes, apples and bread they serve with it. The meat they have is delicious and their seafood always tastes fresh. The dipping sauces are hit or miss, but the dill sauce is amazing! I'll even dip the seafood in it sometimes. The vegetables are fresh and plentiful, love the mushrooms! The chocolate is not my favorite part of the meal. My favorite is the cheese. I'm not the biggest chocolate fan, but I love the marshmallows and fruit. The cake sometimes is a little hard, but it's not that big of a deal to me. My husband and I came here the first time for our anniversary, and the romantic setting is great. We have been back a lot since then, and it's just a nice, quiet place to relax and catch up with each other. Go, go often and always get a booth. It's totally worth it and it guarantees a great, peaceful meal!
