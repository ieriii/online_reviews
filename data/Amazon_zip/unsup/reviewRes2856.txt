Boyfriends Birthday: Was top notch from start to finish. When we arrive at Tru we feel like dignitary as soon as we walked in the lobby. We choose the 9-course with wine pairing. The food was second to none and prepared perfectly and the sommelier's pairings were spot on target. The service was spectacular and with all of the timing and coordination that goes on with a 9 course meal (9 place setting, 9 tastings, 9 pairings) the presentation was flawless. They custom printed a menu in his honor that we were able to take home as a keep sake. In addition, they brought out an extra dessert surprise for him. All in all, and experience to remember!!!!
