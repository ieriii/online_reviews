Terrible service- manager is rude. We waited 2 hours for our pizza and then told the waitress we needed our pizza boxed b/c we were taking our friends to the train. The waitress told us it will be ready in 5 min- 20 min later there was no pizza. At this point we could not wait any longer and had to leave to drop our friends off at the train and told the manager we would call him. Ten minutes later we called and the manager was very rude; 2.5 hours had passed and we were very hungry and said we were on our way back to pick the pizza up. The manager then said he gave the pizza away and voided our credit card. He did not offer any concessions for our time, sympothy or apologize.
