Great beer list, plus appropriate glasses for almost all of them: If you like your Kwak served in the traditional Kwak volumetric flask-shaped glass, this is an ideal destination! Strongly-recommended food items include the mussels (of course), the smoked brisket, and the excellent mac & cheese side dish. The biggest problem, as others have noted, is the post-"Check, Please" crowd. Avoid the long waits by going early or late -- or by managing to snag a table or booth in the front bar.
