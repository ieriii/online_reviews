This was my first real experience with sushi (I was too scared to try it before, but wow, I was missing out!) and it was amazing--now I'm hooked! We tried to get reservations but they were booked, so we just came around 10 pm instead and waited about 20 minutes for a table...after 10:30 the restaurant starts to empty out a little.  We had the White Dragon Roll since everyone raves about it on Yelp, and they're right--it's so delicious! About $13 for eight pieces. We tried two other veggie rolls (spicy sweet potato tempura and asparagus tempura) that are reasonable at $4-$5 and come with 5-6 pieces. The spicy sweet potato is really tasty, but the asparagus could have been more tender. We finished it off with the dessert special--flourless chocolate dome filled with white and milk chocolate mousse, accompanied by strawberries, vanilla ice cream and fudge sauce. I liked it because it wasn't too sweet and was nice and light, so even though we were stuffed with sushi, the dessert didn't take us over the edge. I was apprehensive about the service since it's gotten mixed reviews on Yelp, but our server was super nice and helpful!
