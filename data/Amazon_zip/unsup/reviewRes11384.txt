Starving, my hosts took me to their favorite neighborhood bfast joint. Inside had a kinda modern-throwback look, which fit in perfectly in the Wicker Park area. It's was pretty busy for a Tuesday around 11, but we were able to get a table. Something about the place, made me think I was going to get some very tasty coffee. So I ordered that, which was easy. Ordering breakfast is always trying for me: do I go with something sweet (pancakes, waffles) or savory (eggy wegs). There were plenty of tempting options for both on the interesting menu. I had to go with the pumpkin and granola pancakes with vanilla crme anglaise. It just sounded too good. The coffee came - I was right. How do these places get it so right? Delicious. The pancakes were great too, though there was a bit too much vanilla crme anglaise making it very filling. Overall I was impressed with the creativity on the menu and enjoyed what I ate.
