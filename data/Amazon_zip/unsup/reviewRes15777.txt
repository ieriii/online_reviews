This place is beautiful! So many colors on the walls, on the floor, on the ceiling, on the furniture. I loved the oversized lamps and the tiny neckties. Started the night with a Caipirinha, no syrup. I had read that this cocktail was Brazil's national drink. The waiter warned it would be tart without syrup because then it's just lime juice and liquor, but I took my chances and it was fine, very smooth. The waiter told us the restaurant uses every effort to source local and organic, the pork included. So I ordered the Chuleta, medium rare. The first one they brought out was overcooked, so they gave me a small bowl of soup for the trouble and came out a few minutes later with a pink-centered chop. It was very moist and flavorful, in that fresh Latin American way. It came with a side of "bacon-plantain fufu," which is a plantain mash with bacons sprinkled in. Eaten with the pork chop, we all said it was such an amazing blend of flavors. The place was very easily Paleo-friendly.
