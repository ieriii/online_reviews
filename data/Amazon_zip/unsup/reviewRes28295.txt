The second time was SO much better! Don't get me wrong, the first time my husband and I came here, I had the enchiladas en mole and they were great. However, I left still feeling a bit hungry. This time around, I have to say I may have gone all out. I went with a group of friends and for appetizers we ordered the Trio, Trio, Trio (seafood ceviche variety). This was absolutely delicious. For my main course, I ordered the duck breast tacos--I was impressed. Although I am a wine drinker, I decided to venture out and have the vampiro drink. It had a kick to it (a bit spicy), but it was an interesting adventure for my taste buds-- enjoyable. We concluded our meal with some dessert and the "must have" cafe. The ambiance was perfect, the food was great, and the server was attentive. I was very happy that I chose this place to kick off my birthday celebrations.
