Things to do with wild boars: play Hopscotch with them or make sloppy joes out of them. Thankfully Longman & Eagle chose the latter, and in the process, may have created the pageant winner of sandwiches. It's soggy, oozing perfection topped with a fantastically erect jalapeno. You almost want to order this sandwich, take it upstairs to one of the 6 inn rooms they'll be opening next month, and have your way with it. Wait, that's twisted and gross. Everything else was stellar - the cheese plate, the scallops, the bouillabaisse, the drinks, the affected hipsters- but you just won't be able to get that damn ground up wild boar out of your head.
