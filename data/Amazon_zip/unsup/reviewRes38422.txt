i've only gone here on fridays. it's always crowded, the bartenders are slow and kind of rude (always know what you're going to order before you approach the bar. i got a soup nazi vibe from one of them), and foreign beer=high prices. none of this matters because the sheer volume of la-dee-da fancypants beers is enough to keep me entertained and thrilled while i'm throwing my money around. no idea what the food's like, but they have mead. MEAD! it was totally rad and it made me feel like Beowulf. good times.
