I was dying to try this place when I hear that they received a Michelin star, so I was really expected something great. I just don't get it. The food was pretty good pub food but that is about it. It's a neighborhood place that looks just kind of average at best. My wife had a pretty good hamburger, my short ribs were very tender but not especially tasty and my step son's cod was good but nothing was out of this world. I gave it two stars here but I would not come back. We came early on a Sunday night so there was no wait. I cannot comprehend anyone coming here and having to wait for this place. The food is fine but Chicago has much better.
