Updated Review: 3 Stars I just ate here again. I will admit, it was not as good as I remember, but it was still good. If you live in the area and enjoy food with a Latin flavor, this place is definitely worth going to. However, if you live where I live and have somewhere like Agave Bar and Grill right by you, just go there. Both the food and drinks are better. All in all, it is still a decent place to eat. Old Review: 4 Stars I ate here quite a while back, and really should go again sometime. When I went, the food was excellent. I had duck breast with jalapeno mashed potatoes that I still am working on recreating at home to the same perfection that these were. I liked the atmosphere and the food.
