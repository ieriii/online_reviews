This place was good! Good food, a nice selection of drinks. You have to get a reservation, because it gets packed. It would make a great date place. For some reason, yelp's map shows it on Franklin, but its on Kinzie. The waiter was friendly, maybe too friendly. Very touchy feely from the start. He was fun and witty, but sporadic in service. He often said "I'll be back in just a minute" and wouldn't be anywhere to be seen for 15 minutes at a time (we were there for ~3 hours). The pork belly was fantastic, as was the Steak Tar Tar and the Brussel Sprouts. I'll be going back again.
