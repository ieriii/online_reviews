My wife and I made a reservation and because we were meeting a friend in town, called ahead and were assured that they would have a room for us with two queen beds. At checking, we were informed that this was not possible, but that we could have a room with one king bed or a rollaway could be brought to our room. We took the rollaway option so that our friend would not need to sleep on the floor and were told we would need to wait in the room until the rollaway arrived. After 90 minutes of waiting, I called the front desk and was re-routed to an operator who informed me that there would be a $25 charge for the rollaway and that she would need to connect me to the front desk. After five more minutes on hold, I was connected with the front desk. I was assured that they were very busy and the bed would arrive without charge. Pressing them about our dinner reservations that we would soon miss, I was then informed that if we did not place the privacy sign on the room door, the bed could be delivered in our absence. The Hyatt Regency seems unable to keep up with their current level of demand or is extremely poorly managed. We will not stay at one again.
