Demera is a great lunch spot for vegetarians. The lunch special is only $7.95 and includes your choice of FOUR dishes with injera bread. From what I remembered, there were more vegetarian than meat dishes. I always recommend the lentil porridge dishes like Ye-Misir Wot ("spicy" red lentils) and Kik Alitcha (yellow lentils). If you're just not *that* hungry, there's an option to split the lunch entree with a friend at $4.50 extra! I prefer Demera's atmosphere over Lalibela's. Their chairs are comfortable compared to the massive and awkward ones at Lalibela. Incense permeates throughout the dining room, and chill Ethiopian jazz plays in the background.
