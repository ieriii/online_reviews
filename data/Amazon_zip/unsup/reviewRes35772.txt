What do I remember about Shaw's? Hmmm...it's been awhile, but I remember that the service SUCKED. I had the absolute WORST service in history (and I've had some pretty shitty service at other places). The server didn't check on us ONCE after he took our order. What makes it worse? It wasn't that crowded. When we asked to see a manager about the service, they did the usual song and dance apology and offered to send us gift certificates to use to any of the Let Us Entertain You restaurants. Those never arrived. There are so many other places in the city to get great seafood without the shitty service.
