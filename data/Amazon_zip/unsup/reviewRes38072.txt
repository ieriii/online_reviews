THE BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Chicago style Deep Dish is the best! Ideally with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, black olives and lots of cheese! I would do anything to get Giordano's Pizza to move west here to San Francisco, California. I've actually flew standby on United Airlines to Chicago to spend 12 hours in Chicago to have one of their pizzas. If you go here, leave your vegetarian and New York pizza snob friends at home. This is a place for those with good taste! :)
