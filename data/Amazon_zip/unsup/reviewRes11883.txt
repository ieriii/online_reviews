Why has it taken me so long to write this review?!? I ate here for the first time about two years ago. I hate that it's not in my hood, but if it were I would probably be morbidly obese! They have some good lunch items, but I can't seem to resist their breakfast menu. I recommend going with a friend who likes to share. Order something sweet and something savory, and play musical plates. Yesterday I had the Breakfast Burrito (my staple) and the Banana and Bacon Flapjacks. They seem to switch out pancake recipes often, and this is by far the best I've had. Get 'em while you can!!!
