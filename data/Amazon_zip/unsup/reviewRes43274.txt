If you like Chicago style Pizza, this is the absolute best that I have found in the city. The pizza is so good that it is almost sinister to eat. In my opinion it has far beat out any other restaurant that I have had Chicago style pizza from. Their prices are also very reasonable and the pizzas are HUGE.
