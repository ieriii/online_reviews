Lincoln Park comes to Andersonville. I haven't tried a lot of the food there but what I had seemed like pretty standard bar fare. The crowd reminded me of LP. Nice beer selection, I guess, but if atmosphere and meeting strangers is the reason you're going out, I wouldn't recommend it. Keep in mind though, I tend to prefer the dive bars.
