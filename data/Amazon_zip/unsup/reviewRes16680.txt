Great speakeasy-style bar with nice decor and good vibe. The bartenders and staff were not pretentious, which is a common ailing factor of bars of this similar style. I got a great off-menu drink as a tribute to my birthplace in New Orleans - the Sazerac. I've never had it before, but it was DELICIOUS. Get a seat at the bar and chill with the bartenders for a great experience!
