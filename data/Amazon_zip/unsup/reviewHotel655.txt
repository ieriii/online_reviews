This is probably one of the most beautiful Doubletrees that I have stayed at. The staff are some of the most genuinely friendliest people I have ever met. Mad props to Chase, Ben, Antwan, and Rasheed. Also... LOCATION is AWESOOOME! Not too far and not too close from the main streets of downtown. Also close to the Magnificent Mile so if you ever feel like doing some last minute shopping, it's all within walking distance.
