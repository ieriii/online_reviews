I really wanted to love this place. It gets great reviews, is well-located, and charges extremely fair prices. Sadly, inconsistency and sloppiness mar what might otherwise be a four-star quality establishment. I've been eating here for a while now due to its location across the street from my gym. In that time, I've had: -undercooked chicken shawarma -bone-dry lamb shawarma -flavorless rice -falafel that has clearly been sitting out Pita sandwiches are often prepared with such haste that all of the spice ends up in one little corner of the pita. Takeout containers frequently leak. It's a damn shame, too, because the food is sometimes pretty good. Just not quite often enough.
