Today was my first time actually eating at Irazu. The friend I came with is pretty much obsessed with that place so I wanted to finally go in and check out their food. I ordered Casado with tilapia. It was really good, although I think the Gallo Pinto rice was a little bit too dry and did not have that much flavor. The tilapia was done perfectly, it was delicious. The cabbage salad was also amazing, I pretty much devoured it. The platanes are interesting, have never tried them before, and they were okay, although the fact how different they are made me want to eat them more & more. The Oatmeal Shakes are THE BOMB. First time I went I had a Mango one - delicious! This time I had a pineapple one - ALSO delicious. I take mine with soy milk. Overall, it's a great restaurant, definately would recommend everybody to go check it out. The staff is very friendly and has a family atmosphere. It also has an outdoor section so when it's nice out you can sit outside although I did hear the lines can be quite long. But still. I will definatey visit again soon!
