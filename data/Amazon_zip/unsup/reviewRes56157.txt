This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. But on a Saturday afternoon the story changed. The young waitstaff was new and more interested in chatting with each other than customer service. I ordered the Moroccan crepe rather than my favorite, the Icosium, and despite the menu description, it was spicy hot. My friends confirmed this by tasting it. My server assured me she had no idea why it would be hot, and offered to have it remade. The second crepe tasted exactly like the first.  I basically did not eat it, and brought it home, to my gastro distress. As we were leaving we heard the table behind us also complaining that a crepe was very hot even though no hot spices were in the description. The waiter denied it was spicy and the customer kept it.  I hope this was an anomaly, as I really loved the atmosphere and the food here. Now I would hesitate to go back. (My first review was 5 stars).Also, the soup was very salty. Did they get a new chef?
