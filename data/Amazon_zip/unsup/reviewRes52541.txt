Brazzaz used to send out these coupons where it was bogo for up to ten ppl. It was awesome. We would use the coupons on a rotating basis...great value.  Then, they started being stingy with the coupons and they are hard to come by. But the next time I see one, don't hate me if I push you over to get to it. Even if you don't have the coupon, it's worth it to go. I like the meats here better than Fogo de Chao, but I like the salad bar better at Fogo. oooohhh and here they have the grilled pineapple which is awesome.
