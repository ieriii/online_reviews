I've had chicken, but not Korean. Together they make a fantastic meal. The prices are great for the amount of food you get and the staff is really laid back and friendly. We went on a Saturday night and there was a ton of traffic in and out of the little restaurant. The atmosphere is great and I love the tables and benches scattered around. Beware, your personal space might be invaded just a tad due the layout of the benches and tables and the popularity of the restaurant which makes it crowded. Still a wonderful place to stop in the for a quick bite. I ordered the chicken tenders and fries meal with Seoul Sassy sauce. Amazing! The tenders were delicious and the sauce made it better. The green onions on top was a big plus for me too. I got more fries than I expected and they were served to me minutes after being taken out of the fryer. I also tried the Chi-Town Chicken Bowl that my boyfriend ordered. I'm totally ordering that next time we go back! I'm already salivating. :)
