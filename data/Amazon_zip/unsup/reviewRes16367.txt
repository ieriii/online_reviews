Okay...so I have been waiting to go to this place ever since I heard about it a couple months back. I am into classic cocktails, old fashioneds, manhattans, sidecars and all the rest. Introduce me to a new distillery, a great cocktail and I am your best friend! That being said, I went here last Sunday with five other friends. I'm glad I went on a Sunday, becasue we were six of about ten people in the place. I guess that 's good since we didn't have to wait outside for someone to get out of their seat. My first impression was, "Why the hell is it so dark in here?" When I finally adjusted, I saw floor to ceiling drapes, ten foot high back chairs and a sparse bar. My first impression was that it was way pretentious. Too dark, the music was worst than spa music and nobody was talking. I thought I made a wrong turn somewhere and walked into a morgue. We made our way past the long drapes and into the back bar where we found enough seats at the bar for all of us. The bar seats could fit two people on them...easy (that was kinda nice). The bartender greeted us promptly. He was cordial. He was informative. The drinks were very tasty. It did take a bit of time to make six drinks. But, when you're cracking eggs and eyedropping bitters and such, I can see how it would take time. That was fine...for a slow night! I couldn't imagine being in here on a Saturday, when the place is rockin'! Overall...check it out. If you're daring go on a weekend night. If you want to chat with the bartender and hang out a bit, Sunday or Monday is a better night. Finally; someone who knows how to make an old-fashioned and knows the importance of hard ice! .
