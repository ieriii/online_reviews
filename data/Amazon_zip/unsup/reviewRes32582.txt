Our favorite Ethiopian place. They are family-friendly which is key with 2 little ones and the food makes it to the table quickly (also a bonus). Haven't had a bad experience yet and we go there quite often. The staff is very friendly (though sometimes you have to get their attention) and accomodating. Sometimes they have messed up an order of Sambusas (they really want to give you the beef one (maybe they own dairy stocks) over the chicken ones). But it's a minor problem and doesn't take away from the whole experience. And they also have Namibian beer (the land of the world's largest sand dunes)
