I've only eaten here twice. The first time I got a Peach Cobbler Crepe. (I mean, peach cobbler AND crepes? How can you go wrong, right?) Maybe that was a bit too non-traditional for my pancakes and waffles loving self because I didn't really like it. I can't remember the wait, but there was definitely a wait! I decided to go again for brunch when my parents came and within minutes we were seated. I got a Healthy Start Waffle and it was delicious! The waffle was very good; light and crispy. There are a lot of options on the menu so maybe it is simply hit or miss. Might go back again some time. I thought the decor was fun and great for brunch.
