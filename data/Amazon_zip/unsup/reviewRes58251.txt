So I've been out of town for a few weeks doing some traveling over seas , seeing some family etc . I bragged about this place to family and friends because I came here right before I left and wrote a nice review about it . Well I went back. The night started off alright , busy as usual fast paced and it took a minute to be seated which I totally understand . Once we were seated the service staff was amazing and very attentive again like I remembered but there was a new element . It started about a third into the meal and a manager came up , he said his name was John . He asked us how our service was and we told him . Normal right? Heres where it gets a bit strange . He came back SIX times and asked us how service was . Each time we told him it was fine but he kept persisting , as if he was trying to get us to complain . We were trying to have a good time but this little fat guy kept rolling up interrupting our conversation , and not only did he interrupt but he was kind of a douche bag . He was trying to be funny and was saying snide sideways remarks about the service , like You can tell me if its not good mate , thats what I do , I take care of things like that !!!! What the hell is that?!?! I feel sorry for the staff if this guy does this to every table . I mean the service was great and he kept acting like it was horrible . This guy killed the ambiance of that place . Plus He doesnt even look like he belongs there. He looked like he'd fit in better managing an olive garden in the burbs . And who says things like that to guests ? thats what I do , I take care of things like that Like he's an army ranger or something. All I have to say is kudos to the Pig in all it's service and food but this manager John doesnt fit . I hope no one else has any run ins like this there . I'll go back but if I see that guy at the door i just may turn around and come back on a night when he's not there..
