Pizza is great! Perhaps one of the best pizzas in Chicago. The white sauce with clam pizza is to die for~ But what really topped everything off for me is the Raspberry Frambrose w/ice cream drink. It is *rolling my eyes* amazing!!! My friends and I came here late night. We hadn't had dinner. We wanted something good and tasty. We also wanted some drink to take the edge off from work. Piece Pizza sounded like the perfect place. We arrived. The wait was ridunkulous! 45 minutes!!! But you know what, it was worth it! And the staff! amazing. they are so down to earth and real. If you're looking for good beer and good food and good service. Piece Pizza!
