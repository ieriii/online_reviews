This is some good pizza. My favorite in the city? No. But is it good deep dish pizza that you will definitely have enough of for leftovers the next day? Yes. We tried a meat filled one and a veggie one for Supper Club... I favored the veggie but the meats were delicious the next day. You order and pay up front at the counter, seating we'll call minimalistic. It's kind of like eating in a cafeteria but it's BYOB so if you're meeting up in the middle of the city with friends from the West Loop and Lincoln Square, it's kind of like ordering pizza and enjoying it in a really odd kitchen together.
