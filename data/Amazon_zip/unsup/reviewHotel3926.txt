I wish I had good things to say; but never stay here. My wife and I have stayed here twice. The first one was bad and we should not have gone back. My wife was back in September 2011 and the hotel placed her in a room with a connecting door. She was suspicious of the lock on the door; but it required a key to lock. She placed her shoes in front of that door as an indicator. When she got back to her room - her shoes had been tossed away from the door and the person who had broken into her room had gone through her suitcase! When she talked to management of the hotel - they were reluctant to give her another hotel room and wouldn't apologize for the break in or the fact that the room staff did not lock the door in bewteen the rooms.
