Here I had eggplant parmesian. My parents and I like this little spot to dine at in the evening. It is intriguing inside and has a majestic feel of romance. It is a intimate atmosphere for two mostly. The food is pastas and alfredo sauces or marinara to highlight. I'm pretty sure its candle lit but not to sure. Very tiny place to eat in a quiet area near the damen brown line. It literally is right in the middle of a nice neighborhood so you will have to walk some distance or drive to get out of the very residential spot to Montrose St. or Damen St.
