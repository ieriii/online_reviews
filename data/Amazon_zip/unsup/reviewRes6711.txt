I was astounded at the affordability of such a wonderfully complex and attentively shaped meal. The servings are generous for tapas, but not the formulaic over-serving traditional, southern Italian that most have come accustomed. Maybe it's just me, but I have not known of many Italian places to cater to broad, modern palates, but this one hits a home run. I would suggest to 26-50 year old diners who take their food and wine seriously.
