I have to admit I saw this place on Food Network first. Even though i only live about a mile and a half from it. so today after my best friend had dinner there last night I decided to go for lunch at like 2pm. Arrived and was seated at the bar immediately. I looked over the huge menu which had everything from burgers to bottomless bowl of mixed cereals and Fish. I ended up ordering off the blackboard fish specials. I had the Marlin special. This was a steak of marlin rubbed in Jerk spices and a side dipping coconut and pineapple yogurt? sauce. It was served with a potato pancake and steamed vegitables. I also ended up with a bowl of French Onion soup. The soup was delicious but my fish came out super fast. So i didnt quite finish the soup but it was really good and not super salty like most soups are. The fish came out and i started on it and determined it was slightly undercooked for my liking. I prefer at least medium and this was slightly medium rare. I sent it back and within 2 minutes it was back out perfectly done. Fish is a difficult thing to get perfect and it was. It really was perfectly done and super moist. if most fishes are overcooked they are way too dry. The sauce was really sweet but paired perfectly with Jerk spiced fish. The potato pancake was a taste of heaven and the veggies were cooked to perfection. Even with the fish not how I like it cooked originally this was one of the best Fish meals i have had in a long time. This is not your typical diner. but will blow grandmas favorite place out of the water!
