Well, I'm not an experienced Ethiopian foodie, but this place has made me obsessed. I had a meeting down the block & I wanted to grab a bite beforehand. I was standing on the corner of Lawrence and Broadway & I smelled all these wonderful spices and pretty much just followed my nose to Demera. They have a very reasonable lunch special, but I felt like it was WAY too much food. I felt guilty for not eating it all and I didn't want to take ethiopian food to a work meeting because it would smell.  Anyways.....I LOVE Ethiopian food now. You eat it with your fingers & use floppy, spongy bread called injara to pick it up. It reminds me a lot of Indian food. A lot of the same spices, especially turmeric (mm yay! ) They have darn good coffee too! Might I add, the waitresses are gorgeous...but that's no surprise since every single Ethiopian woman I've met has been too.
