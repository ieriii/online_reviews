The first time I came here, I was annoyed and skeptical of the efficiency of the ordering/seating process. Needless to say, I quickly got over that, as I have visited XOCO more than any other sit-down restaurant in Chicago in the one year I have lived here. I also recently decided that, with such a small kitchen and seating area, the process works actually pretty well. Or maybe the food is just worth the wait. I routinely crave several items on the XOCO menu, including one seasonal spring special that I fear they will never have again. It was the Ham L.T. with some type of prosciutto, a delicious cheese, roasted tomatoes, and some type of greens. My other favorite is the Woodland Mushroom torta, with goat cheese, black beans, arugula, and 3-chile salsa. Absolutely melt-in-my-mouth amazing. I could eat it every day. That with some of their fresh guacamole and homemade salsas with tortilla chips, and I am in my happy place. I have also tried the Cochinita Pibil (suckling pig torta with the spicyyyyy habanero salsa), Chipotle Chicken (self-explanatory), and the Pepito (short rib with caramelized onions). All amazing and I would order them again. Rick Bayless, you are my hero.
