As you can see by the (1,000+) reviews....this place is popular! Not only a brewery & great pizza but tv screens everywhere to see a game! Since it is popular expect a long wait on a weekend night. We got there after 6:30 on Friday night and were seated about 45 minutes later... The wait is not that bad if you find a seat by the bar...and have a drink! I unfortunately, did not get a seat at the bar....and I didn't want to go to far from the front because they weren't calling names...it was like they wrote your name...and once your table was ready tried to find you by the bar...how do they know who you are? So I wanted to be visible. Service was a bit slow and messy...I been here before and I felt like maybe they were short staff. Once seated our waitress was no where to be found for awhile. Food: We ordered Spinach cheese dip (soooo good....the bowl was completely emptied). The pizza topping options are extensive...from meatballs...to fresh basil...jalapenos(spicy!)...even mashed potatoes! Our group ordered 4 different type of pizza's and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I really liked our pizza but I was hoping for a more crispy thin crust. Drinks: Loved the Golden Arm & swinging single (nice and light..)
