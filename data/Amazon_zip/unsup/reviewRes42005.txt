They're not lying, they really do know the art of pizza. And trust me, it is an art. I absolutely love this place. Super cheesy pizza is usually not my thing, but the combination of sauce and crust on their pizza is too delicious and too extraordinary to ever resist. I am a pizza LOVER (and saying that is an understatement), and out of every Chicago pizza place I've been to the Art of Pizza is definitely top 5. Not only do they have slices, which is perfect when I do not have time to wait or don't want a whole pizza, they also have three different types of pizza: deep dish, thin crust, and pan. The pan is my favorite because it is cheesy without too much sauce. The dough is also great. I have had all three types, but the pan seems to win out every time. The pepperoni is seasoned with spices so it tastes extra delicious. Too bad I gave up eating red meat a month ago :( Sometimes during busy hours the selection of slices is sub-par, but usually there is always a pizza getting ready to come out of the oven so I've never had any real problems in this department. I am always willing to wait an extra 5-10 minutes for a piping hot slice! They also have a large selection of appetizers and pastas, so there is always something for everybody. The daily specials are great if you live in the area and are looking for a cheap pasta meal. The only reason I didn't give them 4 stars is because it can get a bit pricey, but that is to be expected for superior Chicago pizza. Oh yeah, and they have a parking lot! Art of pizza, two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
