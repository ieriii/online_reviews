Man, this place is really mixed. I'm giving 4 stars purely on value, bed comfort, cleanliness, and nice staff. If this place were a $1 more expensive, it would easily fall to 3 stars. OH, now the front entrance will make you FEEL like you are at a Hotel Indigo, but once you enter the elevator, it gos downhill from there. For a Hotel Indigo, lets get this straight, the decor is disgusting and flat out OLD. The floors are old, the paint and carpets are old. The showers also do a pathetic job of keeping water off of the shower floor (There's a very small amount of glass coming from the wall an the curtain will not help you cover the gap). You will be using extra towels to mop up the water spraying out. The bed was Hotel Indigo standard. Lush, comfortable, sheik, and of course covered with some of the most heavenly pillows around. The place is CLEAN. The staff here is also pretty amazing. If someone could just remove the staff and beds, and then blow up the decor with something new (WITH new flooring) and the place would be legit. Still, for $155 including vallet parking with unlimited 24 hour entry/exit, the deal is pretty hard to beat. You can get great deals if you call the Hotel Indigo reservations squad directly as opposed to going thorugh an online broker. When calling in, ask for any room/parking special rates.
