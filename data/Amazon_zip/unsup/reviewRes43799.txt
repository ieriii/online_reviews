Milk and Honey makes me feel all warm inside, and in a good way. Breakfast Panini's-GENIUS. That's all I've had here, they serve it with their kettle potato chips, and I usually get a chai latte or mocha along with it. YUM. I also have tried the bloody mary's here. I do not like bloodys usually but they do them right here. The one thing I hate though is the setup of the place. It is so tiny, and while waiting for a table to open up, I felt like I was in everyone's way standing in the middle of the place. This place needs to be bigger!
