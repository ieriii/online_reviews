Friends and family were celebrating their 17 year wedding anniversary- seventeen years! Now that, my friends, is a fine example to emulate and cause for celebration! I adored the Vesper 50/50 martini and you simply cannot miss that gorgeous drink- a handcrafted masterpiece- clean, cold, dry and perfect! We enjoyed oysters- sublime. I will forever crave the oysters Rockefeller that followed- those were a spectacular, phenomenal, out of body experience that no words can possibly convey... rich, salty, I am incandescent with ravenous joy at the flavorful memory- Possibly the most glorious, delicious thing I have ever enjoyed in my life. My petite butter fillet was salty crisp on the outside, juicy and delectable as the subtle texture melted on my tongue. Boyfriend inhaled the potatoes- I think that means they were tasty... he also savored the TBone steak, the ahi tuna and the mushrooms. The dessert was a touch disappointing- the bland chocolate mousse cheesecake will, in the future, be forgone for another Vesper. Maybe my precious tastebuds were knocked out from the oysters? Intoxicated by Vesper? The texture was dense, and Boyfriend enjoyed it. I will return for the exceptional Vesper martini and the oysters Rockefeller- worth any price ($14 each, I mean, worth any price... My firstborn? My immortal soul? Is that sacrilege? Done.) Not just a meal but a lush experience. This is love at first bite!
