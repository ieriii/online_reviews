This cafe, located near 290 on halsted is really a cute and quaint place to eat lunch. My mom and I were there yesterday and shared some food. We had the squash soup which was creamy and good, just lacked a little umph. The greek salad was fresh and light and very crisp, but too expensive I think. 8 bucks for a plate of cucumbers and tomatoes...just doesn't sound right to me. Then we shared a lobster ravioli. The lobster was fresh, and the sauce was light and tastefull, but the noodles themselves lacked ALOT. Couldn't taste any salt on them or anything. Very plain. I had the house greek red wine which was ok....But the mouse...now that was something. They really have amazing pastry items. Everything, I mean is so fresh and just creamy smooth sugary lovely! They have a full bar with GREAT coffee, you can buy a bottle of wine for the ride home, and you can sit or you can take it to go. Lot's of great choices, so many that I will be back to try more. Very comfortable place to sit for a couple of hours, and unwind. Definitly stop by!!!
