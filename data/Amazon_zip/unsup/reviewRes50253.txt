Simply put: there is always something off about this place. I want to love it because I grew up in the south, but there is always something wrong with the meal and we just can't go anymore. There was the "twenty minute wait" that lasted two hours. There was the "muffuletta" that was right on flavor-wise, but the most pathetic looking muffuletta I've ever seen. Winn Dixie (southern grocery store) muffulettas are better that these things were in terms of filling. We've been served dishes with so much fat they were completely inedible. Generally speaking, the food is overpriced and often disappointing. We want to love it. We just can't.  And frankly, they've taken the only thing worth dealing with their "quirks" for off the menu. That was the Carolina style BBQ. When we first found this place everything on the menu screamed "home" to me. Now maybe a fifth of their dishes do and they often don't deliver. (I got the pimento cheese once. I love pimento cheese. It's nearly impossible to get wrong. But they did.)
