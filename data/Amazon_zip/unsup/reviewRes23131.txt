How have I lived at North and Western for seven months, being a vegetarian the whole time, and not known about this place? It was amazing! I got the veggie sandwich and my bf got the apparently well-known veggie burrito. We also ordered a side of chips and salsa to share. Everything was perfect, to the potent heat of the salsa to to the fresh-cooked-ness of the chips to the perfect balance of ingredients on the sandwich. Since it was -2 degrees out, we chose delivery rather than going to the place. The delivery guy was friendly, courteous, and most importantly fast. The guy on the phone said "see you within the hour," and they ended up taking a little less than a half hour.
