I was craving some waffle fries and heard The Fifty served them. It was past dinner time, I was hungry, so why not give it try? Went on a weekday night and it was pretty packed. The service is excellent and their staff is very attentive and super nice. A big plus in my book for a busy place. Its pretty common to get crappy service at busier joints but The Fifty is an exception. The atmosphere is fun and laid back, it is pretty loud so you do find yourself screaming across the table. They were voted best wings in Chicago during some year, can't remember when. So we decided let's give them a try, they should be good right? Boy oh boy was I disappointed. Wings came out piping hot and they were very meaty. Definitely getting your money's worth. Another positive was that they were true buffalo wings by the spicy level. Very flavorful and left my lips on fire.  Downside, they were drowned in the buffalo sauce. To the point where I was getting nauseated by it all. I had 2 wings and called it quits before I would hurl it up. If saucy wings are your thing, I would definitely recommend giving it a try. I ordered the Fifty burger, instead of cheddar cheese I sub-ed it with Pepper Jack. Burger came out hot with the cheese oozing with oh so goodness. I love it when burgers come out with the cheese nice and melting. The patty was so huge that I had to cut it in half. Even then it was difficult to take a huge bite into it. Burger was well seasoned throughout and the flavor was awesome. Served on a nice warm fluffy pretzel roll. Yummy! Fries were perfectly salted and not your typical grease pile. Our server never left our drinks dry. She always came by the right time to ask if we needed refills and asked how things were. A nice finishing touch after dinner, they have a lemon slice and a nice hot towel to clean your hands. Never experienced that at a sports bar type of place before but I like it! We'll definitely be regulars here!
