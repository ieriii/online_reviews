Pros: Huge portions, affordable prices, everything I've had is good (veggie skillet, two eggs, cinnamon roll). Cons: Huge portions, long waits on the weekends, wish they were open during dinner. If you want to go on the weekend, try the location close to Navy Pier. Not as convenient to pub trans and parking can be a little spotty but you definitely won't get quoted an hour for 2.
