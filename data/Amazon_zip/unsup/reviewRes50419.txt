love ,love, love, the service was right on point, people are very friendly and our waiter was very helpful when it came to the besst choices on the menu... i ordered the turkey burger and oh my god it was the best thing iv had in such a long time,, for my side i got the sweet potato fries ugh my trainer is gonna kill me lmao.... on a scale from 1-10 the food was a 9 ... the only con was the bullshit ass liquor my boyfriend paid $10 for basically a cup of juice... then when i told our waiter his excuse was that the drink was supposed to be smooth , and it was a bear base (yeah right)
