Went to Xoco the other night for the first time on a Thursday at around 7:30. No wait. My friend ordered the pork belly caldo, which was a delicious soup filled with veggies and perfectly cooked pork . It had spicy complex flavors and very different than any other soup we've eaten before. I ordered the chicken milanesa sandwich, which was very tasty and spicy as well. It was really big; I only ate half and wrapped up the other half to go. The guac and salsas were fresh, but expensive ($6.25) for a small portion. Definitely a good quick and impressive spot in the River North area!
