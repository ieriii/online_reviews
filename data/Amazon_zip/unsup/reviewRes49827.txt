Two other friends and I ate here last weekend on Friday evening. We were excited to try this place. However we experienced horrible service. We ordered a white wine blend... trying something new... it was mediocre. We all satisfied our burger cravings and ordered burgers. They were so salty we could barely eat half. The only thing that might have saved the meal was the six cheese sampler plate. We struggled to get our bill and the manager had to come over to collect our payment because our waiter was so negligent. I didn't appreciate the manager's attitude when I inquired about customer service and whether or not there was some type of feedback in place. She snapped at me no. Never going back.
