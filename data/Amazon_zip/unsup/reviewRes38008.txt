A note for out-of-towners: Giordano's delivers! (Fuggedabout DiGiorno) Their web site (which I just added into this listing) has details on how to have the pizzas shipped: http://www.giordanos.com. Since the pizzas ship in dry ice, it helps greatly if your delivery destination can receive the package immediately. Having these sit out on a stoop would be a bad idea indeed. Also check out their overnight delivery FAQ (http://www.giordanos.com). In particular, read the fine print on when your order will ship. There is a lead time. I admit it's been years since I've had one of these pizzas shipped to me, but I recall that the cost of shipping easily cost as much as the pizzas themselves. It seems the web site lets you buy pizzas online but if you have any questions you should call them directly. A note to New Yorkers in particular: I probably don't have to say this but it is _nothing_ like New York style thin crust pizza. You've been warned! Having said that, it's still the bomb.
