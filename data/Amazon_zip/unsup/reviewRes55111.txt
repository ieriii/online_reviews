Having been at Gilt bar twice now, I wanted to wait to write a review based on how new this place was. First of all, this Gilt Bar has nothing to do with Gilt bar NY. The atmosphere is very elegant, dark and cozy, sexy and intimate all at the same time which is surprising for such a big space.The first thing you should know about the menu is that the pricing reflects some of the most inexpensive food you can get in river north these days. The cuisine is rustic, inventive with very fresh notes (homemade pastas, etc) and with the owner's background, I would have not expected anything less quite frankly. The wine list features most of the wines under $30 and both times I dined here, the sommelier recommended a great bottle.Overall, service was friendly and attentive and, if we might have waited a little while at times, the ambience made it up for the wait.In conclusion, I wish I would have some criticism, but really, this looks like the kind of establishment that is going to be around for a long time.
