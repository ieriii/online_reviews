Calo's has very solid Italian dishes. The food is not trendy or pretentious, just good, filling, classic Italian fare. As expected, they have really great pizza (and feature giardinera as a topping which is a HUGE plus in my opinion). That said, I must admit that I miss the OLD Calo's -- the one with the 60's neighborhood pseudo-supper-clubby atmosphere. It had great character! On the weekends there was always a band and cute neighborhood couples would trip the light fantastic on the dance floor. Now Calo's has been remodeled (actually it was a couple of years ago) and the remodel is nice. The problem is that it's just a little too generic-yuppie. Last time I was there, there was a "light jazz" combo (which is OK), but no one was dancing. The "old school" atmosphere is definitely missed (at least by this nostalgic ol' queen!). In short, for home-style classic Italian dishes, Calo's know exactly what they're doing (and have been doing it for a long time).
