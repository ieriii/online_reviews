Went in along with Dragon for some sangria and apps and thoroughly enjoyed it all. The inside of the restaurant is what I'd imagine dining in a rainbow would be like. The sangria reminded me of a simpler time, when drinking fruit-based beverages didn't make you feel like less of a man. The arepa and the empanada were both delicious, although next time I would like to try the ceviche. The homemade guacamole lives up to the billing as I could picture its skin rejuvenating powers reversing the aging of my stomach. I plan to get a bite to eat there again, perhaps even a whole meal of food!
