By far my favorite place to go to eat pizza. Piece is a super social/friendly environment and has AWESOME thin crust pizza! I have never tried one of their micro-brews that I didn't like. I haven't found the wait to be long on a week night (around 6-ish), and as far as a Friday/Saturday night goes- the wait, I feel, is typical for any bar/restaurant in Chicago.
