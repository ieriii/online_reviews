We have loved this restaurant in the past, but no longer a big fan sorry to say.They have put in too many tables too close together, and the noise factor on top of that ruined our evening. Servers are really nice and the menu is interesting, but we are going to go elsewhere until they can figure out not to take too many reservations and jam people in. We are young and enjoy going out all over Chicago, so hopefully this restaurant will go back to being charming like it once was!!
