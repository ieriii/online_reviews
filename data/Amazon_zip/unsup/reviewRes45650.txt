This place was OK, but a little pretentious. My time spent here was only justified by the good company and the fun staff. All of the waiters and bartenders were nice, but the people around us were meh. It's Chicago, so it's more expensive here than in the burbs. $7.50 for a Cape Codder. You can get the same for maybe $5 in a burb and you won't have to pay $20 for three hours of parking.
