Tasty food. Nice ambience and decorIt just happened that we had the sweetest waitress ever. While she was quiet-spoken, she paid attention to us and the neighboring tables, All three pastas, the Cacio e Pepe, Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori al forno and marrow ravioli special were cooked perfectly al dente like Rachel Ray says. Small sizes that are somehow suppose to be shared. We were not out until 9:30 pm! Nice evening.
