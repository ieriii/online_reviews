Super posh decor. Interesting set up with the exposed shower (there's a curtain for those shy ones). I couldn't figure out how to turn up the air conditioning for the life of me. The floor to ceiling windows got a bit annoying at times b/c at every angle there are facing buildings that can catch a glimpse of everything you do. *Ahem* like changing. Having to use a room key to use the elevator was quite frustrating at times. Imagine going up and down the elevator a few times cuz' your key isn't being recognized. Anyway, on to the good. The staff was friendly. It was centrally located to train/bus lines, attractions, and eateries.
