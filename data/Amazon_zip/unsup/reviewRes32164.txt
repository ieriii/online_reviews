I love Ethiopian food.  I dream about the quosta at Ethiopian Diamond. I pine for Twins Lounge, Meskerem, and the seekrit homemade Ethiopian lunch specials at Cafe des Amis du Cafe in D.C. I don't love Demera. Meh. Their vegetables are mushy and not very interesting. I'm not a food-sender-backer but I've sent food back both times I've been here. Go a few stops north to Thorndale.
