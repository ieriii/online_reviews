A remarkable tavern with an incredibly diverse selection of belgian draft beers and an eclectic menu. The brisket is unbelievable. The atmosphere is lively. It's one of the few bars in town where you can order a bottle of Old Foghorn. Street parking can be challenging at times, impossible on a Friday night. Mid week is my preferred time to go there, either earlier in the evening (say by 5 pm) or later at night (after 8:30 pm).
