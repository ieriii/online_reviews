I came back here with my boyfriend in February and I was pretty disappointed. My boyfriend had the Pulled Pork Sandwich, which he liked, but I ordered the Gumbo, which turned out to be a huge mistake. The only thing I could taste was the burnt roux; if you've burned the roux of the gumbo, then the whole lot is just bad. I know, I know... I should have said something to the waiter, but I guess I felt bad because the last time I was here, I had to send food back. Honestly, if I felt the need to send food back each time I've dined here, then I guess that food isn't so great after all.
