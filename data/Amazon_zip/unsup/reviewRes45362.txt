Went here for brunch on Sunday with dad and we both were EVERY HAPPY with our choice! We both had the Eggs Benedict, dad had the basic and I had the the Crab Cake Benedict! The only problem we had was that dad didn't read the menu to see that they put tomatoes on the Egg Benedict so if you don't like tomatoes make sure you tell them to take it off. Mine was GREAT! The place was VERY quite, warm and cozy. I would go back for sure!!!
