Another prime example of being mislead by my fellow yelpers. I love food, and I love trying new places but, it is disheartening to try things that my fellow yelpers recommend and really get slapped in the face with disgusting food at unreasonable prices. This is one restaurant where I did something I almost never do and I asked to have my entree comped. Usually, I am too embarrassed and just want to pay and leave when I get served bad food. The night we ate here, however, I ordered the honey Jalapeno glazed pork chop. Someone on yelp said it was a highlight. Mine was terrible overcooked. It was so tough I was chewing on one bite for the whole meal. Someone sitting next to me had gotten the same thing and was obviously had the same problem but was probably too embarrassed to say anything. This place isn't cheap. And this night I was not willing to pay almost 20 bucks for an inedible entree. My girlfriend got the slow-roasted pork tenderloin. By comparison it seemed ok at first because mine was so terrible but under closer examination we really shouldn't have paid for it either it was nasty.  I will never go back! Do yourself a favor and steer clear.
