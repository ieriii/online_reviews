Don't like it. At all. I can't believe how many people give this place good reviews. Where are you people from???? Not Chicago, that's for sure. This is NOT Chicago deep dish. It's a slushy mess of grossly sweet sauce on burnt crust. I've had it twice (because other people ordered it and I was famished) and disliked it both times. Yuck.
