I was a little worried about moving away from my traditional pizza joints when I ordered from Pequods the first time....but that quickly went away when i tasted my first bite of this most tasty treat! I love the pizza here and it has quickly become my favorite in the city! Nothing better than a pepperoni pan pizza with that delicious caramelized crust!!!! MMMMM!
