Hot Doug is a lot of fun. Great food! Get the foie gras hot dog - it's unbelievably good. The owner is very friendly and warm - I forget his name. I personally believe the wait is worth it. What's not worth it is the duck fat fry. They only serve it, I believe, on weekends. The wait can be long - seriously long. So get there super-early. If you want to do lunch there, I advise you to get there by 10:30.
