Just called to make reservations. The woman answered the phone in a very rushed, uninterested voice and spoke so fast I didn't understand what she said. When I clarified that it was, indeed, Frontera Grill, she said "that's what I said". Rude. I was told there everything was booked (no problem there), but then when I said, "okay, thank you", she just hung up. SO RUDE! I have eaten here before, the food is yummmy. Too bad the front desk put a bad taste in my mouth.
