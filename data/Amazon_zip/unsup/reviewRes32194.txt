I had the sweet potato quesadillas and my boyfriend had a meat-free gyro, both were made with a meat substitute that was well-flavored and very good. I would give probably give 5 stars except I love meat, so while I very much enjoyed this "meat free since '83" boystown diner, I can't give 5 stars and stay true to my love for well-flavored and gently cooked animals. :0)
