Oyster bar or five-star dinning room? The side you choose to dine in simply demands to know what you are in the mood for, and if you had enough sense to make a reservation. Shaw's is a tasty treat for seafood lovers. A venue that offers an excellent dinner menu with outstanding service, and the option to sit at a high top table and drop something on the floor, is a match for everyone. Highly recommended, whatever your pleasure may be.
