My favorite place in Greektown! It's insanely huge so I don't know how it's still always packed and there's a wait, but I take it as a sign that it's the best. I went last night for an early dinner (before 6 PM) with a friend and it was nearly empty, so I think the lesson learned is - go early! You have to start with the flaming cheese. My friend and I feel this way, and it turns out everyone else there does too. It's a fun show, and delicious. The egg-lemon soup is delicious. Last night I knew I needed flaming cheese with lots of bread and the soup, so it didn't leave much room for anything else, so I had a small Greek Salad. Everything I've gotten there is delicious, I don't think you can go wrong.
