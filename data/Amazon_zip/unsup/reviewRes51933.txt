Eesh. Not worth the hassle. The crust is weird, thick (in that yeasty-thicky way) and tastes like pure trans fat. The cheese is good, but is overdone (read: pound of cheese per slice). Pepperoni - medicore. I expected SO much and got SO little. I'm sorry to say, but I think I prefer DiGiorno's (yes, the kind you find in your grocer's freezer)....
