if you're in from sf, la, or nyc and looking for a great cocktail, this is your place. the problem is that they're all great. you can't have just four -- you want them all. ideal set up: fly into ORD on tues. go there that night. if you like it, go back on wed and thurs. fri and sat get busier, so pop in around 7, get you're name on the list and check out the other great places around the damen blue line stop. definitely worth a stop every week or two (for chi residents) or every visit (for non residents).
