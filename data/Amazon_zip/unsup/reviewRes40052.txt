The food is great, but the service is terrible. I've been going here for years and its worst than your typical Asian service. I would know since I am. I would give it more stars but their attitude and service really brings the place down. I think they have the best bbq. On one occasion, I asked for tea 3 times, and it was never brought to us. Finally, I asked again and they lied straight to my face they had none (group of 15). Later I asked another worker for 4, and I was given tea. A bit lazy even though your going to tack 18% gratuity on my bill.
