My boss took me to Kinzie Chop House for my 90 day review, and ALL went well. Our server , Stephen,was attentive but never oppressive, my Martini was unparralleled and was moved to a frosty new glass about half way through. Yay! Tuna Tartar. In a steak house? Exceedingly satisfying and I was a little sorry it was over. A PERFECTLY Medium Well Filet with recommended bacon/scallion mash and parmesan creamed spinach that forced me to over eat because there was just no way to leave a morsel. Bring on the Creme Brulee. I am an aficionado, and though not MY perfect one, it was Stellar none the less. Thanks, Boss!
