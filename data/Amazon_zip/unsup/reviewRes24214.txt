This place is amazing! We went for an early dinner, which made it easy to get seated at the tiny place. It is very cozy and the staff was very friendly. We tried the Chifrijo appetizer which is soooo delicious - like guacamole, salsa and fried pork all together - yum! I had the steak milanesa with gallo pinto, which was also great, but I also hear the sandwiches are really good. Can't wait to go back!
