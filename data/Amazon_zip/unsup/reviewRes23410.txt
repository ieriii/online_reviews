Wanting to visit Costa Rica but never got around to it? This place is probably the closest you'll get in Chicago. We finally made it to Irazu and I'm so glad we did! We got there early on a week night around 6:30 or so.....it got really crowded shortly after. The weather was great, and our seat in the outdoor patio made it even better....very relaxing. Its nice to be away from all the noise on Milwaukee/Damn/North sometimes. I had the Shrimp dinner with the Gallo Pinto rice and sweet Plantains....delish! The hubster had the Fish (Tilapia) tacos which he also thought was tasty. We both thought that the plantains were the best we've had! Its definitely a treat to have Irazu in our neighborhood and I know we will be frequent diners. **BYOB** **Cash Only** ATM inside
