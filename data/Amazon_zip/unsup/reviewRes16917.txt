We had Girly drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. it's a huge place it seats about 300. after the waiter told us the specials i had to have the Salmon i am glad i did it was Really good , it was so f lackey and Seasoned perfectly. we shared our dishes everything was worth ordering. if your in the west look and want am a upscale meal i would check it out SOOOO GOOOOD,
