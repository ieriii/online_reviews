amazing food, perfect service, charming atmosphere! doesn't get much better than this place.  loved the sweet pickles & homemade chips the minute we sat down. tried the hush puppies for appetizer - excellent! had the pulled pork sandwich w/a side of macaroni & cheese. everything was unreal. i will definitely be back...hopefully, sooner than later!
