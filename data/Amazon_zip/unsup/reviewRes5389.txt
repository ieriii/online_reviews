I think of a great restaurant as one that I can't resist the urge to go back to for whatever reason, be it a dish, drink, ambience, service, all of the above(!?) Purple Pig is one of the rare that fall into the all of the above category. Situated just off Michigan Ave. near the Chicago River, PP has a great feel not only b/c where you are (look around--this city is flippin beatuiful), but the decor and vibe is reminiscent of a upscale European bistro. First biz partner and I had a "dinch" at about 3:30, so the place wasn't crowded at all. I've found this is when I sometimes get the worst service, but not in this case. Our waiter couldn't have been better. He allowed us to taste each of the wines we asked about and all his recommendations (both wine and food) were excellent. My favorite (and it's no easy task to choose) small plate was off the "smear" portion of the menu. Mortadella, Balsamico and Pistachios served atop the most amazing (and salty) toasted peasant bread. The Mortadella was melt-in-your-mouth good! We both also enjoyed the Goat Cheese Arancini with Mint Pesto (basically balls of rice and cheese in a yummy pesto sauce) and another dish that was a slice of the incredible bread topped with some kind of soft cheese, paper-thin slices of ham, roasted asparagus and a fried egg. YUM! The Fried Sardines with Lemon Vinaigrette were, I thought, a little greasy. And I loved the Sepia (octopus w/o tentacles) with Toasted Almonds, but not so much my friend. Would have loved to have on of their delicious-sounding desserts but we were on our way to O'hare at rush hour so we dragged ourselves away vowing to return!
