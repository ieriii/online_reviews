I absolutely love this restaurant. It's one of my favorites, and whenever anyone offers to take me out to eat it's always my first pick for brunch. The food is amazing, however, I do have one huge problem: I've been 3-4 times in the past month and they've been out of some of my favorite dishes; each time they were out of crab benedict which is 80% of the reason I want to eat there in the first place. I agree with others that the food is great and the cocktails are amazing, but they really need to get on this. It's not fair for everyone to hear about their amazing menu and then consistently be out of some of their signature dishes! If it weren't for that I would give them 4-5 stars, easy... but to be out of the same dish for several weeks in a row says to me that this place needs to step up their game.
