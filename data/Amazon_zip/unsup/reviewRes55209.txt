i love this restaurant. it is amazing, everything is good there. it is nice to know that you can have different kind og meats to choose from. When you flip your card to greent food is coming your way. I am not one of these people that like to check all the restaurants, but I am glad I went to this place. In my opinion this is one of the best restaurants in Chicago.
