Once my husband shared with me the 50 best in the world list, we eyed all the restaurants in the US and had to make reservations at Alinea. This was my first tasting menu experience so before arriving, I was incredibly nervous about what we'd be eating... would I like it? Would I really like it? Or would I just convince myself that I was enjoying it because of the price tag. I am happy to report that Alinea did not disappoint.  We had 22 courses, 15 presentations and with every one, we were blown away. Highlights * Getting to play with my food (and being encouraged to do so!) * My favorite dishes: Hot potato cold potato, hamachi, short rib, and of course the chocolate mousse. * The staff was so knowledgeable and yet down to earth * Personalized Menu (my husband had an "abbreviated" wine tasting, and the menu even reflected this!) We were so lucky to get Chef Grant to make our dessert. I don't know if any restaurant can top that!
