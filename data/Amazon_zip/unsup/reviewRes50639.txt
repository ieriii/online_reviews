Wishbone's food is fantastic. That is why you should go here. I have never had anything that wasn't terrific. And if I ever wanted something additional, such as ketchup or bread, it is brought quickly. However, there are so many parents that bring their children here and it becomes congested with strollers strewn around the TINY waiting area and crying children. Beware of this or ask to sit at the bar where they will usually seat you right away and you will be aware from the chaos. Wishbone does try to do a good job of keeping parents/kids and non-parents happy.
