I have mixed feelings about my experience at Shaw's. I wanted it to be great, but after much discussion I just can't say that it was. First off, atmosphere. As one of my friends said, "It looks like a place where middle aged men go for business dinners." That isn't necessarily bad, especially if you are a middle aged man looking for a business dinner location, but my friends and I were definitely on the younger end of the demographic and to me it was quite noticeable. We were seated at a large round table where I literally could not reach the wine list that was placed in the middle. This wouldn't have been bad for a large group, but for only six of us it made it really hard to have a conversation with everyone at the same time. As far as food goes, it was all good but not great. We shared some oysters which were really fresh and tasted great as well as an order of calamari which seemed on the small side. I ordered the grilled halibut with roasted vegetables. It came with a heavier sauce that I was not expecting and the top of my halibut was more grilled than I'd prefer - to the point where it was hard and chewy. The roasted vegetables were just ok; I enjoyed the broccoli and macaroni and cheese sides that we got as a table to share a lot more. Another friend at the table ordered the surf and turf and said that his steak he ordered rare was actually quite overdone on the outside and cold in the middle. Unfortunately I was even disappointed by the desserts. The peppermint ice cream was fantastic - but it was really just peppermint ice cream at the end of the day. We all agreed that the chocolate cheesecake and triple chocolate cake were underwhelming. Service was fine. Our waiter was a little stuffy, hard to understand/communicate with and there was a large time lapse between entrees and dessert, but no real issues. I was really excited for Shaw's but at the end of the day I can't help but feeling like I'd wish we'd gone to Joe's Stone Crab instead.
