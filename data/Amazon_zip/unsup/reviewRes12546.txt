Sign up for emails, get 2 for 1 deals for bday, anniversary etc. it's pricey but a no brainer at 1/2 price deals. We had exemplary customer service last night. My partner told them to keep the filet mignon coming around and they sure did! The desserts look amazing but are nothing to write home about. Eat yourself into a meat coma, you can have cake at home to tomorrow.
