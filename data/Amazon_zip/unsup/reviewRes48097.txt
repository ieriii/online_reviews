It's the ultra spot for pork lovers. I was so excited I had to fill out the postcards and tell my friends that we should go wild boar hunting to fulfill my pork needs. I recommend booking a reservation on Open Table, that way you won't have to wait long. I made a reservation and showed up early. they offer the option of standing at cocktail tables next to the bar and having a few cocktails and appetizers to while away the time. Ordered the Bloody Mary with a beer chaser. It was definitely a great choice as most of the items are quite pricey, and if you're like me, you probably drank heavily the night before and can appreciate and electrolyte/potassium boost from the Bloody Mary. The beer was just refreshing and added a nice little buzz to my punch. My friend ordered the Prophecy which was a mixture of Italian vermouth, bitters and an egg. It was a bit like eggnog that punched you right in the face. I ended up having to finish it for her. Think: frothy whiskey-like substance you don't know whether you'd love to hate it, or you'd want to make sweet love to it. The pork rinds were great. Fresh and crispy. The bacon is a dream. Think thick sliced pork fat back that is braised. My only issue is that at those prices, you'd be better off going Lord of the Flies style and hunting down your own pig. Ordered the pork shoulder with grits and the friend ordered the Bibimbob. We took the advice of the couple next to us who said to just order the pork. They can do no wrong. An yes, they did a whole lot of right. It was tasty and tender. Although I think my pork shoulder was better than the bibimbob. Tables are long cafeteria style tables. Much like Harry Potter style dormitory eating. I was a fan. The bill did make me blink. But this is a highly rated gastropub. Try at least once before you write it off.
