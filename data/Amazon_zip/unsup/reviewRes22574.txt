I have been eating at this restaurant for more than 10 years. This restaurant is consistent and has the best table service in Chicago. The food is excellent and I have been having my fathers company dinner party hosted there for about 8 years now. Always a couple things I can't leave Greek islands without ingesting them into my stomach. 1. Flaming Saganki, yes a gimmick, but what else would a self respecting Chicagoan order? 2. Fried Zucchini slices with Skordalia 3. Grilled Octopus 4. Lamb chops, pure simple, medium rare, so flavorful. 5. Greek coffee ( don't call it Turkish coffee or else get the evil eye)  Free Valet fricken rules. Location is excellent since I used to work at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is decent walk from S. Wacker. An overall must visit for any out-towner or native Chicagoan.
