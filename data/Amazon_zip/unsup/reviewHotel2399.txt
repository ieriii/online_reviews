Great hotel! Went to Chicago for Lollapalooza. Stayed at this Hotel because it was across the street from the concert. When the girl at the desk realized I was in town for the concert, she upgraded me and gave me a suite on Michigan Ave overlooking the whole venue! Great, big clean suite. The people who worked there were really cool.. 2 good bars down stairs. Great food, as well!!!
