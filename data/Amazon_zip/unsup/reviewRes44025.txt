my thoughts after dinner: "did i read the right reviews for this place? is this in fact kinzie chop house?" perhaps my mistake was going out for dinner on valentine's day, which is one of the busiest and most hectic dining nights of the year. we had an 8:00 reservation and were seated about 10 minutes after arrival, which was good. the service was friendly, professional and prompt. that was good. the decor was clean and simple, giving the kinda dark, intimate mood i like steakhouses to have. THAT was good. so what went wrong?? i came in with high expectations....juicy steaks and pork chops, warm fresh bread and butter, mouth-watering sides.... here's what we got: bone-in delmonico: 25% fat, NO flavor whatsoever....i think i had a better steak at outback baked potato: i could only describe it as "essence of cardboard"; dry, yucky...i make better potatoes and i'm not known for my culinary skills jalapeno bbq pork tenderloin on a bed of spicy slaw: i was really looking forward to this; i've always had excellent pork at steakhouses. this was some overcooked pork pieces on a bed of cabbage SMOTHERED in some kinda sweet n sour sauce. no spice, not even a hint of jalapeno...it was on par with the chinese shack i order lunch from whenever my stomach's feeling adventurous crab cake appetizer: good wild mushroom and gorgonzola tart: okay bread basket: i'm pretty sure that bread was sitting out for a looooong long time...it was cold, dry, and hurt my jaw so basically, all the food we ordered had no interesting flavor, if any. i was disappointed with the selection of appetizers and sides. there was nothing "wow" about it. had i known this was what we were going to get, i would've taken my man to chili's or outback (note: i HATE outback because their steaks SUCK....so you can see how very disappointed i was with kinzie) lesson learned: make dinner reservations at gibsons 5 months in advance if you have to
