This place is the best. Even if the line is long, it moves fast.  It's classy that they still send out a small plate of a daily dish for everyone at the table. It's a nice touch. The mole is some of the best I have ever had. Can't go wrong with it. The tampequena (sp?) is great too. I've had a bunch of their tacos and all were above average in flavor and quality. The rice is a little plain, but that's being nit picky.  My favorite dish however is for breakfast. Machaca con huevos a la Mexicana. Nuevo Leon is the only place in the states where I've had machaca that is even remotely close to what you get in Mexico. Awesome awesome awesome. If you've never had it, machaca is a shredded dried beef. I'm not sure how it's seasoned, but it tastes great! The decor and servers are just what you would expect and the total package is a big win. It's been there for about 50 years, which should tell you enough. Can't go wrong here.
