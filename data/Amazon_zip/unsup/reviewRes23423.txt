I love the Greek Islands restaurant on Halsted & Adams in Chicago's Greektown. As Greek person I can tell you that it's my go-to spot for both authentic and clever contemporary interpretations of the cuisine. The quality of both the food and service is consistently very high. It's a warm and comfortable atmosphere that feels like home. It's my favorite Greek restaurant on the strip, in Chicago, in America and even rivals most of the traditional spots in Athens or Mykonos as well. They have my highest endorsement and recommendation.
