For any beer lover, especially lovers of Belgian-style beers, Hopleaf is a must-go... you simply will not find a better selection of this style at any other bar in the entire greater Chicago area. While the selection is staggering, the prices are, as expected, fair but moderate... usually between 5 and 8 dollars per bottle. Also, I wish they would provide descriptions of some of their beers - I'm fairly knowledgable about beers and there were quite a few I didn't recognize but didn't want to risk the money without knowing what I'd be getting. If it is not too crowded, you can ask the bartenders... but it is often crowded. If you go for drinks on a Friday or Saturday night, its best to get there before 9 pm if you want to sit down. If the downstairs is full, you can go upstairs, but there are only bottles (no taps) upstairs. I haven't eaten here because sources I trust tell me the food is average and there is better to be had for better prices in Andersonville.
