I'm definitely a fan. The fried chicken is fried at the perfect amount - it's definitely not KFC chicken. I love the tangy sauce too. Try the mushrooms as well, which are really good. It's a bit of a messy/crowded/sharing experience if you go on a weekend night, but I supposed that's part of the charm. It's also not as cheap as I expected, but it's not outrageous either. Expect to spend $10/person or so. For something a bit different and relaxed, I'd check out Crisp.
