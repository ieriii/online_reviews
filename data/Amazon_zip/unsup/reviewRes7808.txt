Good for a party of more than 8. Good for eating more meat than you probably should. It's the "Game of Meat" where you have a little coffee-mug sized disc that has green on one side and red on the other. Green means "put more meat on my plate", Red means "I didn't think you guys were serious about the green thing, please stop now". Deee-lish. There's a sides section that has veggies for you veggie people. But then why the hell are you going to Fogo de Chao if ya don't eat meat?!??!?!!!
