Ok, so I know this place is continually winning "best pizza in Chicago" awards, but I have to say that I was kind of disappointed. My pizza was decent, but I was really bummed that when you order by the slice, it's just pizza that's kept warm and really tastes like reheated pizza. It had clearly been sitting around for quite some time, despite the fact that it was crowded and I ordered a popular flavor. I guess it was my mistake for not just ordering a whole pizza, but the place is kind of confusing given the absence of waiters and a counter to order at. It's definitely more conducive to ordering by the slice. If I do come back here, I'll make sure to get an entire pizza instead, but for now I just think I'll stick with my Lou Malnati's.
