I have such mixed feelings about Superdawg. I am not really a fan of the food, except maybe the onion chips, but I keep coming back and I always bring out of town people there. I love the idea of the place and how it reminds me of the way things used to be. I am nostalgic in my old age and this place is the real deal. Of course in my memory, the food used to be a lot better too!!!! Stopped at Superdawg today. It was a beautiful day and we enjoyed the excursion, except maybe for the wasps, who are now out in full force. By wasps, I mean the yellow jackets and not our white Anglo-Saxon Protestant friends.
