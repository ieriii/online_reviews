You know it's a good sign when you stare at the menu for 10 minutes and can't decide because everything looks good. Just when you think you have something picked out the server throws you for a loop by telling you the day's specials. Awesomeness. Went recently with a large group of people (there had to have been 14 of us) and it was great. I ended up going with my standard spaghetti carbonara and it was quite good. Like some other reviews said it was quite salty (I blame is on the prosciutto), but I heard all my friends saying the same thing. Pretty much every dish was really salty. Most people didn't mind though. I do have to say I drank about a carafe and a half of water myself and still woke up dehydrated in the middle of the night. Maybe too much salt... Overall it was a fun time, the food was good and the service was excellent. Chances are high I will be back to try some of the either dishes I was eyeballing.
