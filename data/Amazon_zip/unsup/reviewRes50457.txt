Big Jones is simply one of Chicago's treasures. From the emphasis on locally sourced ingredients to the chef's devotion to serving authentic cuisine from across the South to the all-around friggin deliciousness of the place, I love everything about Big Jones. Oh, did I mention that they routinely put on special dinners that are ridiculously good? Or how about the Whiskey club that includes a free pour every time you visit? I'm just kidding. Not about the food but about whether I'd mentioned it or not. I knew I hadn't. That's called unnecessary overwriting, a specialty of mine. Back to the serious. The fried chicken lunch. $16. Half a chicken. Not the factory farmed crap but the good stuff. Fried in lard. Super crunchy and flavorful crust. Comes with cornbread, biscuits, homemade jelly, greens, mashed potatoes, rice and gumbo, and dessert. Sixteen friggin bucks. Show me a better deal in Chicago!
