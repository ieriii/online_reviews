This is a fine place with tasty food - fun for groups, especially. We went in one night after a show at the Atheneum with about 10 of us, no reservation (fortunately it wasn't a weekend), and they got us set up and there were some nice low-key musicians. The drinks rocked and the food was solid Colombian fare. A great time was had by all. One note: I hope whoever wrote that "note from the owner" learns how to spell. It's hard (impossible) to believe a Colombian could use the ubiquitous gringoized error "Columbian" - unless after seeing it so many times he/she just gave up, or thought that's the right way to spell it. But then they got "churrasco" wrong also, so I think it's just a case of bad spelling. Tsk-tsk. UPDATE: I see they fixed the spelling. Very attentive. The service there is like that too.
