Hot Doug's is to Awesome; as Picasso's Guernica is to Mind Blowing! With that said; I cannot stress just how important it is to go to Hot Doug's if/when you're in Chicago! Typically I launch into some over the top exasperated tale of how the food was more mind bending than a Rubiks Cube. However, in this case it's exactly like that; but I'm going stick to what I ate. First of all, I had 3 hot dogs. Not your mere mortal, entry level hot dogs; either. In fact one of them was a blend of Venison / Bison / Elk / with a Pomegranate Glaze!!! Pomegranate Glaze?!!? C'mon now. I mean, meat combos aren't a new thing but combining them with a Pomegranate Glaze and putting all of that in a bun?! Hot Doug's is Gourmet Dining at its finest whilst sitting in shorts and under a tree. Simply Put - this is a dive spot that will delectably charm your pallet. I'm from Houston, and was here during a Bachelor Party with guys from Oklahoma. Let's just say - this is where you take out of towners for a one of a kind experience. Hot Doug's you're a Genius, and I appreciate your creativity.
