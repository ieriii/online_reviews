My boyfriend and I went here this last Monday night and we are both in the industry so may have a bit more of a critical eye but I would say its just okay. The ambiance is cozy and relaxed. We had the roasted beets which were tasty but I felt like I should be eating them for breakfast, just kind of had that feel. Also, the chix liver pate and the ricotta and honey comb which were both great and then the pork belly and potato pizza which was not very awesome. They have a great wood burning oven that they cook their pizza in but this one was just soggy and not crispy and to me, pork belly is a bigger less crispy version of a bacon lardon but this was more like rib meat.  Our server was a larger gentleman who was very accommodating but could have sold us on the specials by slowing his spiel down. Also, had he taken the time to get to know us he would have realized that my boyfriend is the executive chef at a james beard award winning restaurant in the loop in which the owners of this restaurant enjoy very much. Myself as a restaurant manager can not stress the importance of getting to know your guests because you really do never know just who you are waiting on. It was also our three year anniversary which would have been the answer to the simple question, " Are you celebrating any special occasions tonight?" In general, this question will tell you so much about your guest.  On one last note, the bartender was eating a burger at the bar and then making drinks in between with no hand washing. This kind of grossed me out. All in all, I'm happy we experienced this spot as it had been highly recommended to us by co-workers, we will just hit up the Pig next time as it is always a great time.
