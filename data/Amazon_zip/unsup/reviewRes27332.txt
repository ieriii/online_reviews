My Rick Bayless charm bracelet is complete - I've now been to Xoco, Topolobampo and finally, Frontera Grill. It was great food, less pricey than Topolobampo but without the superb coddled service. We got reservations for my birthday back in February when we couldn't get June 16 at Girl and the Goat. Really glad it worked out the way it did as I enjoyed this much better. My only issue with trendy popular restaurants is that the tables for two are so small! However, it was at least nicely situated! Our server was great, took great care of us even swapped out my salmon when I was too wimpy for the salsa. I would recommend getting the salsa on the side! We also split the Entremes surtido which was delicious. My huband adored his carne asada and we gobbled up the Biscocho con fresas. Yum! Plus the Mexican hot chocolate is, duh, delicious! While dining I noticed all kind of babies here, a phenomenon I also noticed at Girl and the Goat. Really, your 2 month old or toddler needs to eat at a trendy restaurant? There are no babysitters in the city? I really don't get this at all, isn't the point for Mom and Dad to have a date night? But I digress. I am super glad I have tried all three and I would go back to all of them but next year I may pop for the extra bucks at Topolobampo; even with the lousy through the kitchen down the stairs bathroom, I think I dig the super service. You have to try one - just make the reservation and wait!
