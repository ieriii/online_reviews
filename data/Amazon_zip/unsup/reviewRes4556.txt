i had a great time at the green mill a couple weeks ago! the music was fantastic, the service was friendly, and both the cover charge and drinks were reasonable. the night i went, the band was playing gypsy jazz. very chill, made use of the violin and great beats -- i'm definitely sold on this brand of jazz and this spot in general. definitely a great place to just appreciate good jazz.
