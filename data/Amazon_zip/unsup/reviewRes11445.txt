I love Bongo Room. I am spoiled, since I am self employed I get to enjoy the City gems during the week at off peak hours that everyone else has to wait in long lines for on the weekends. I originally came here years ago with a friend (back when we HAD to wait an hour to get seated) and have been coming back pretty regularly ever since. The chocolate tower french toast is a must - but I think best shared with a friend as an *appetizer*. The breakfast burrito is yummy as well. All of their sweet pancakes and french toast's are to die for. Never too sweet... always just right. You'd think there were tons of other awesome breakfast options in the city. I've been to many of the others folks swear by and am never as happy with what I get as when I come here.....
