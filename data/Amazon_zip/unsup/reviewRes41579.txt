We did the 4 course menu plus added the duck tasting. The food was served beautifully, but it tasted just OK. The first two courses, octopus and lobster and soup, were very disappointing. I did not like either dish. The duck was good and the pork chop was great. Milk and cookies (dessert) was average. The service started out great, the waitress was very kind and knowledgeable. Half way through the tasting another waiter took over. He was not very good. We waited 20 minutes at the end of the night for the waiter to take our bill. Finally I had to get up and find the waiter and had it to him so he could run our credit card. It really put a damper on the end of our evening. The service score would have been 5 stars if the original waitress would have served us all night. We had a Groupon for $70 and our bill (with tip) was still over $100. It's BYOB, so this does not include alcohol. I would not pay these prices again for average food and service.
