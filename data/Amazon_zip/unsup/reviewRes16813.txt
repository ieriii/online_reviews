In my opinion the cocktails at the Violet Hours are tip top. The price is on the high end, but I have had plenty of cocktails at the same price point that were not even close to the taste and diversity that this place has as to offer. For that fact alone this place has 5 star potential. I am not going to go into the details of the drinks and the interior, it has been beaten to death in the reviews. Unfortunately the last time I attempted to enjoy a this place they did not have a call list and were not that friendly about telling me that small fact, shame on them. Experiencing the Violet Hour a few times was enough for me to start a pursuit for quality cocktails in every town I have visited since, and for that, Thank You Violet Hour.
