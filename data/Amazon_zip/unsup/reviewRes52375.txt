Gross bathroom-Let me start by saying I really can't rate the food because I never made it to a table. The two stars are due to my stop in the bathroom and me standing outside waiting in the rain.  I have eaten here, it's just been over ten years, so I'm not ratIng the pizza. I do live in Chicago, but usually frequent other pizza establishments. I was quickly reminded why. Stopped by last night to see how it was these days because we were considering having our rehearsal dinner here to go along with our Chicago-themed wedding.  When we got there, we were told it would be a 25-minute wait.  That's fine, although it was raining terribly outside. The place is so big, I don't know why they would make anyone stand in the rain. I guess it's kind of like standing in line for a cool club, that's not crowded-shows popularity(?). This was the minor problem. I asked if I could use the bathroom. The doorman allowed me:). When I walked in I was shocked. I thought I was in a gas station. Although, I've seen better at gas stations. The place was trashed. Toilet paper covered the floor. It was filthy. I really wanted to find a manager, but stopped myself. The hand dryers were all broken. The paper towel dispenser was empty. Just plain dirty. I've never been in a Restaurant that would allow a bathroom to look like that. Working in the food industry, I know that if a bathroom looks like that, usually the kitchen isn't very clean. Needless to say we left. It was gross and shocking. I would never take my out-of-town guests there.
