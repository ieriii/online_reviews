The food was fantastic, the service was the worst ever!! Our waitress was rushed and had our sides brought out before our entrees. Then, when we asked for the sides with our meal, the waitress brought them out with our bill. I am not kidding. Aside from the horrible service and very dark lighting, the food, on the other hand, was fantastic. I had the pot roast and my husband had fish. Both were great. Everything was fresh, well-portioned, and beautifully prepared. I would go back on a weekday when it's less crowded.
