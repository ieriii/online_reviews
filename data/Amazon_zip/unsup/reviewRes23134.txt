We had our rehearsal dinner here because we were going to Greece for our honeymoon - it tied in nicely. We had about 35 people in a semi-private room. The staff was excellent, the food was amazing! We had a ton of leftovers that they bagged up for us. We brought in our own groom's cake, which they set up on a table and cut and served for us. This place gets an A+ for hosting a great party!
