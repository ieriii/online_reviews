Coast is a small neighborhood place, but the food is big on flavor and the service is friendly and personal. After walking a mile in high heeled boots my dinner companion and I stepped into this place out of desperation. The restaurant was full but we were seated rather quickly. Started off with a pot of delicious jasmine green tea to warm us up and proceeded to have some very fresh, very creative and very tasty sushi. The White Dragon Roll was my favorite, but everything we tried was delicious. The bill came out pretty reasonable also.
