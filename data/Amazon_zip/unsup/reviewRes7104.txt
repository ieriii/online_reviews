If you're looking for some good ol' fashioned BBQ in an upscale setting, this is your place. as my first meal in Chicago, it was not a letdown. baby back ribs and spareribs were fantastic. if you're looking for the best, check out the competition-worthy ribs selection - given that extra touch in the kitchen which is on par with the same ribs that have won the chef numerous BBQ awards in the area. downstairs has a very homey, upscale vibe. if you have a group of 6, I would advise you to book the table with the couches upstairs. very comfortable to sit in with your friends, have dinner, down some drinks, and watch the big flat screen right next to you! it's almost like going out to eat in your own living room. very cozy!
