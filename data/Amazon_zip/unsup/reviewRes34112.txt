Mia is one of my long time favorites. I live around the corner, and it's one of the best in lakeview. The rotating pasta dishes and entrees are almost all wonderful and fresh. The atmosphere is extremely lively and loud, with the kitchen in the back corner of the restaurant. I love bringing people from out of town for a true Chicago neighborhood experience. Most of the servers have been with the restaurant for years and remember you when you dine. Felix is our favorite!
