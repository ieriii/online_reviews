I live down the block from Garcia's and was excited to have a nice sit down Mexican restaurant in the area that was fairly inexpensive. The first time I went I ordered the vegetable fajitas. As a non-meat eater I had always wanted to be able to experience the sizzling fajita presentation, but meatless options are rarely offered. I was extremely disappointed when a lukewarm plate of mushy vegetables was set down in front of me. I had it boxed and vowed to never return. Luckily the salsa was AMAZING and I was able to make a meal out of that. The reason for the 4 stars you might ask? A friend wanted to meet there the other day and although I was skeptical, I did my due diligence on Yelp and it looked like the fish tacos were the way to go. They are. And at $2.50 a pop for a whole fish fillet per taco, it's a steal. Cadillac Margarita, complimentary chips and salsa and 2 fish tacos. Delicious and totally reasonable. The main seating area is totally unappealing and cafeteria-ish so I always ask for one of the tables in the bar area. Seems a bit more cozy. It's also open really late which is nice since there aren't a lot of options for food in the area past 10.
