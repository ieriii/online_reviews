My wife and I love Mexican food and have tried many restaurants in Chicago. It is hard to find a better Mexican restaurant in this price range. The food is phenomenal. The salsa is perfect. The ceviche is superb, but the carne tampiquena is my favorite. Also burritos, tacos, etc. can be ordered a la carte. That along with lots of great appetizers (real jalapeno poppers, queso fundido, etc) allows you to have a Mexican version of tapas if you can not decide on a dish.  During my college years we used to frequent the owner's other restaurant which is down the street, Taco & Burrito Palace (T&BP). Now I have taken those same friends and their wives/girlfriends to this restaurant. I've taken my parents. Everyone who've I went with always comments on the quality of the food. Every time I see people lining up outside Tarascas I think how unfortunate the people are for not going a few blocks away for food and service that is so much better.  Oh yeah, the service is exceptional. The waitstaff works as a team. Do not expect to only interact with one staff-person.  You can ask anyone for what you may need and they will assist you and not say "let me get your server" .
