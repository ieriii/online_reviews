I adore cupcakes and so I was really excited to check out my neighborhood cupcake shop. I stopped in after work one day and I asked the girl behind the counter what her favorite one was. She was rude and didn't really care to give me her opinion (so much for passion for your product). I finally squeezed out that the red velvet was her favorite so I ordered that and an italian soda. They didn't have the soda water for the italian soda so I got an orange juice instead (which they charged 3.00 for a tiny bottle!) So I was being charged over 7.00 for a cupcake and an orange juice, but after eying the cakes in the windows for the few weeks I had been walking by, I let that go and went outside to enjoy my treat. Not only was the cupcake dry as a bone and flavorless, the icing was gooey and bland. SUCH a waste of my money and calories. With all of the fantastic cupcake shops in Chicago I won't be coming here again any time soon.
