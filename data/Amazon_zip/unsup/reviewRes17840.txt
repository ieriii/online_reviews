yum, this place is not bad at all but youll leave smelling like a greasy pit of greasness. its worth it though and the tandoori chicken that comes with the lunch buffet is tops. starndard indian fare, but the only drawback is the price. expensive for lunch but worth it every now and then is suppose. i seem to remember spending 15-17$ for buffet or what not? yikes.
