I was really excited to try this place after reading the reviews but I was more than a little disappointed. The evening started strong, attentive waiter, great sense of humor and right on wine recommendation. It only went downhill after our meals were served. I ordered the tuna lightly seared, which it was but the fish was warm on the inside, almost like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. I sat with an empty wine glass for 10 minutes, my friend was also left with out anything to drink and it took a concerted effort to get the waiters attention to rectify the situation. Not sure I would go again for the price.
