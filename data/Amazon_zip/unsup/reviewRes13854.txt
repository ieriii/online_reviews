I really want to like this place, I do... It's nice and purty and colorful and you can dine outside (well I guess you kinda have to since there's pretty much no seating inside), and it's Cuban... So I have that added pressure of trying to force myself to love the place. But even with all the optimism of the clientele, the servers, the ambience, I would have to say the food was kinda mediocre, bland, and greasy. I'll try the place again, and hopefully it'll be better next time around.
