We wanted to have a fun, good dinner and not have to walk too far from our hotel and the Purple Pig turned out to be an excellent choice. A little skeptical at first as it is right off Michigan Avenue and I didn't want touristy (Being from NYC I was afraid I was going to get the equivalent of a overdone place) and it was anything but. And with no reservations we could walk in and get a table. Yes, we had to wait, a little less than an hour (we arrived Friday night at 7:30, so to be expected) but there was plenty of space outside to have a drink and catch up with the rest of our party. Can't complain on that front! Once seated the service was great, our server was friendly, helpful and we never felt rushed. He helped us determine how to order and we got a good mix of everything. This is a place to share and taste a lot of different things, we order two dishes per person and the pig platter which was perfect. Some standouts: Artichokes with fingerling potatoes Fried Manchengo Cheese Pork Neck Bone Rillette Pork Saltimbucca As you can see a lot of Pork! A little disappointing was the fried deviled egg and could have served another few chorizo stuffed olives to make that plate more worth while. Good, comprehensive wine list with some excellent choices for under $50 a bottle. I would definitely go back to this place, great atmosphere and excellent food. But you have to like meat!
