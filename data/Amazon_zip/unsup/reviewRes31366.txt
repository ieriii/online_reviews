Of course The Chicago Diner has great reviews! IT IS AMAZING! For Veggie couisine it's just beyond what you would expect..... Different, tasty, and most importantly, you can't tell that its vegetarian food! I want to bring my mom here and try to trick her into thinking it's a regular restraunt... Might not work but ill let you know!!
