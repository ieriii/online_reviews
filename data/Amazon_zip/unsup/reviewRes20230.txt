Love The Gage! We came here for my birthday dinner before seeing Billy Elliot. We had a 5:15 reservation and the bar was already packed when we got there. They took us to our table and the server was very helpful. I like that they have everything from a basic burger to some fancy specials. We had a few fun appetizers... one were pickles and olives. Another was a slice of bread layed with sauteed mushrooms and topped with a duck egg. That was was amazing! It was Chicago Chef Week when we were there so two of us had the prix fixed menu. Two had burgers, and one other had fish and chips. All of our food was great. One thing was better the other. Another fun thing was that they had some type of Italian Surprise wine. I can't remember what they really call it, but often they feature a different type of Italian White wine which is what makes it a surprise. The one they had when I was there was really great. I can't wait to go back. In fact I'm hoping my next catchup lunch with the girls can be here. I look forward to trying the lunch menu.
