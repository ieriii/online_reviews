Hands down - Best brazilian steakhouse in Chicago. The salad bar is awesome too. Good selection but don't get too full because the meat keeps coming and doesn't stop until you flip the button. The meat is perfectly marinated. I think it is a bit pricey but definitely worth the money. Can't wait to come back and endulge again.
