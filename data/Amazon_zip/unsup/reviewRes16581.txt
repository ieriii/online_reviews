India House traditionally has great food at all times of the day however, their lunch special is the greatest value by far!! For something around $16-$18 a person you get a basket of warm nan and serving of tandoor chicken. Then you get to walk around and eat as much buffet style food as you like. All my favs were on the menu, chicken tikkai, tandoor curry chicken, all kinds of paneer. Sweets. After lunch I had to go home and takw a nice, long, stuffed silly nap but it was so worth it.
