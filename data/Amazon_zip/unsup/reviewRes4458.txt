I miss a good week night excursion to the Green Mill where I could randomly stop in to see whomever might be on the stage. Most acts were decent and many-many more were outstanding. Now 10 years of living in the stodgey DC area and I've yet to find anything like the Green Mill. Musicians of Green Mill quality play the Kennedy Center or a pricey Georgetown snoot joint with a 2 drink minimum and a wildly over-the-top cover charge (read Blues Alley). Chicagoans... the Green Mill and every little divey music venue across your chilly city are your treasures to discover and enjoy. Count your blessings.
