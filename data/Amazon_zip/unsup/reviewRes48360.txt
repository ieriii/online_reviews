Overall a great and very satisfying brunch. I loved the table setups - very industrial but practical with big mugs and giant brown sugar cubes waiting on the table for coffee. The restaurant decor was nice, but tight with communal seating. Thankfully, we had a table for two and were sat at an individual table. Service was impeccable. Food: Ham Schnitzel - enough for two people and fried absolutely divinely with great flavor. Mussels - yummy, but not special. the best part of the dish was the fresh baked loaf of bread that had just that perfect muchy texture. Bacon - they call it bacon, it was more of the a delicious slab of glazed fatty pork. really good. the bloody marys ranked tops on one of the best i've ever had.  Great job Publican!
