(Third star is for ambiance) THE GOOD: I first off want to give this place credit for having some pretty darned good ribs. We had the competition style (non. STL), and it was really good, The sauces were also pretty good. THE BAD: The service was slow, I did feel bad, because it seemed like there was only one server in our busy area (MGT needs to address).  & THE UGLY: The kobe brisket.  It was crap (OCB is better!). I requested a moist brisket, and got the leanest pieces of meat to man kind ( I guess if you're into that kind of meat, it's good for you, but I requested it a certain way). The meat was flavorless, and so was the coleslaw that came with it. I don't think I've ever had anything kobe that was bad until I ate it.... In any event they do throw in some pretty good bbq chips, and pickles, and have some good beers and bourbon on the menu. Come for the ribs, don't mess with the brisket
