It hurts my heart to give Glenn's Diner one star. The clam chowder is phenomenal and, until last month, it really felt like a warm and inviting atmosphere. For the third week in a row, I darkened Glenn's doorstep for delicious food and fun. The third time is definitely not the charm. We felt a little rushed initially, even though it was a Monday. After having a hectic day, a relaxing dinner was what I wanted with one of my favorite gal pals. However, it gave dine and dash a new meaning. Before we finished our meal (clocking at almost an hour at this point, for reference), we noticed that five water glasses were staring at us (waiting for our table). When we asked if we could get one more beverage, we were told that they would gladly serve it to us if we moved to the bar. Huh? We a) had not totally finished with our bill and b) noticed that four tables of people who had been there prior to our arrival were still there. And, of course, our server said that she was also the manager on duty when we requested to express our concerns to a manager. I have never experienced something like that before. And the hard edge is that they clearly did not care if I made it a fourth week in a row or not. That being said, I am waving a fond farewell to the clam chowder. Glenn's will never get my 20+% tipping or my good vibes again. One star is for the memories. If Glenn's is concerned about servicing more people vs. the quality of the experience, it should open up a drive-thru diner instead.
