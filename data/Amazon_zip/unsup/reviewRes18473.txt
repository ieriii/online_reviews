Srsly, the churros here are TDF. Then again, I really have no comparison bc I was always too chicken to buy any from the churro lady on the 7 train platform =/ Came here just before closing time on Saturday to get some churros (3 for $3.75!) & Mexican & Aztec hot cocoa to go! Putting in my order was quite fast and I think I waited about 8 minutes in total for the order to arrive. Meanwhile, my dad was mesmerized by the torta making abilities of the workers in the open kitchen. Unfortunately, we were way too full from our dinner so didn't order any this time around - def will next time if we're ever here! The churro & hot cocoa combination was glorrrioussss and kept us warm on a cold Chicago night. However, the hot cocoa on its' own didn't impress me too much; I felt it was too thick & heavy and the spices didn't gel correctly. Once we finished using the hot cocoa as a dip we tossed 'em!
