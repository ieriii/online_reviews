Just like any Chicagoan, I have tried a lot of different pizza. Peqoud's is amazing. They even deliver to my apartment, which is great.  I have dined at the restaurant once. It was busy, but we didn't have to wait long for a table. I really want to try the salad next time because someone at a table next to us had one and it looked delicious. Also tried the mozzarella sticks, but they were pretty much standard. The other times, I have gotten delivery and it takes sort of awhile (45-hour) but the pizza arrives hot and fresh. The pizza. Obviously got the pan pizza. I don't really like the bottom part of the crust, it's a little dry. The caramelized cheese part was delicious and so were the sauce and cheese.  Peqoud's is definitly one of my top three pizzas of Chicago!
