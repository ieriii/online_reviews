Can't believe I ever gave 'em 4 stars in the first place. So you've heard the legends, made out of veggie burritos and oatmeal shakes... believe the lore, this isn't hype! Everything on the menu is super fresh, inexpensive and quite colorful. Exactly the way food should be. And they deliver! But I try not to order delivery too often, because I have a crush on every single guy that works here. They're teddy bears. I hate tomatoes but at Irazu I would eat them. If that's not a testament, I don't know what is - they make EVERYTHING taste better. Word.
