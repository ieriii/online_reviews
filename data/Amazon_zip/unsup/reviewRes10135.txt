I went to Piccolo Sogno on a Sunday night and the place was packed, in the midst of the Great Recession. That's how you know this place is good. The service was impeccable and the pizza was perfect! It reminded me of dinners in Rome but they didn't charge us for the water or bread. I am looking forward to going back ASAP. Did I mention their prices were very reasonable for this type of establishment. Yum!
