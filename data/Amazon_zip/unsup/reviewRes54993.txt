Cozy place with an old world feel. the drinks were inventive and sooo yummy! Dinner was pricey but delicious! I highly recommend the Scallops and Foie gras small plates and the duck for entree. Save room for dessert because the mini donuts were great with a touch of ginger. Yum! I can't wait to return..
