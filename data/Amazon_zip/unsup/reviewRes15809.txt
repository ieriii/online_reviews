So delicious! I went to Calo last fall with a buddy, and completely enjoyed our appetizers with a couple of Martinis in the bar area. (adored the Calamari Diablo) Tonight, I took my visiting father for dinner. Even better! You know it's going to be a good experience when you can't even decide what to get because it all sounds so good. Glad to report that I made a great decision. The lobster ravioli with asparagus and portobello mushrooms. Some of my all time favorites dunked in a cream sauce. Delicious! I highly recommend this place. Super busy, with staff that was helpful, always there, but never intrusive.  I can't wait to get back this summer and enjoy one of the few sidewalk tables.
