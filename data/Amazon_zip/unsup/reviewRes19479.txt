It's going to be packed....and loud....and totally worth it. Great sushi and BYOB?! Doesn't get better than that. As for rolls, I would definitely recommend the Maine Roll and the Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll. I've also heard great things about the Angry Salmon Roll, but unfortunately it wasn't on the menu. Regardless, I think everything here is fresh, high quality sushi...you probably can't go wrong at Coast.
