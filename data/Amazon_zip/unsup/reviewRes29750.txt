Finally made it to Frontera and it was everything I hoped and dreamed. Nice atmosphere and the food, well, amazing! We had the ceviche trio and it was wonderful. My friend swears by the Carne Asada Oaxaquena but I had the Tacos al Carbon with chicken and loved it. We got there at 8 and they told us it would be about 3 hours! We had a table in about 45 minutes though. And they don't accept reservations unless it is very far in advance and you have a party of 6 or more. So don't listen to these other people talking about reservations...
