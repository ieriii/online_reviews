Since my meal here, i've been dreaming about their crab rangoons. I almost wish I were kidding. The food was very good (quite close to great) but the service was a little rough. I was very thirsty for a good portion of the meal, but it has been brought to my attention that I'm a fast water drinker(for what that's worth). Also, the couple sitting next to us was fighting with their sticky rice, though humorous, I'd venture to say the rice was a tad too sticky. Yes - I'll go back. Yes, I'd order the crab rangoons again, and probably the panang curry again, and I wouldn't mind having their pad thai again.
