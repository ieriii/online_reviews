I saw the Green Mill on a PBS show so I knew what to expect. Even though the $12 cover (Friday night) surprised me I quickly recovered when I saw the beautiful interior and my ears bent when the jazz musicians started playing. I'm a huge fan of music and it was awesome going into this club and having the bouncer tell you to shut off your cell and not talk during the sets. It's nice to bounce back in time at the Green Mill and simply enjoy the environment around you. Even if the Manhattans leave you in a daze.
