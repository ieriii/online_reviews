This W Hotel is definitely intended for people staying on business, but we chose to block rooms at this hotel for our wedding which was around the corner at the Rookery. I have to say that the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. The decorating is almost eerie and Alice in Wonderland-esque. Definitely strange at times (we had one ceramic white roller skate in our suite) but we found it more entertaining that anything else. The food in the lounge was great. They had free coffee all hours of the day, and I ordered a waffle that was delicious. I wouldn't recommend eating or drinking anything out of the room since the prices on snacks are so inflated. Our suite was really nice. We had a separate living room with two couches, a dining room table and a large flat screen TV. There were closets everywhere. Two large full bathrooms which had awesome Bliss Spa toiletries. The bedroom was large with a King size bed, a really cozy down comforter and another flat screen TV. The only negative to the room was that the lighting was very dim (along with the rest of the hotel) so when it came time to do hair and make-up we called concierge for more lamps. And living up to their "wherever, whenever" motto, they brought up 4 table lamps in a jiffy! Overall I think this hotel was perfect for our wedding stay. Mainly because it was so close to our venue, but also because it was clean, comfortable, and the staff was very accommodating.
