I love italian food and would eat pasta for every meal if my figure could handle it. My boyfriend and I had dinner here with another couple and we were highly impressed. My boyfriend is more of a meat and potatoes guy, but when he suggested we go back to Sapori Trattoria a second time I knew he was a fan. We eat out a lot and love trying new places which is just another reason I know this italian eatery is one of the best I have ever been too. He ordered the lobster ravioli and it was better than any I have ever tasted. I ordered the rigatoni caprese and it was the freshest pasta, mozzarella and tomato sauce I have every experienced. Every bite will melt in your mouth. The wines by the bottle are priced well and the restaurant over all provides a very cozy atmosphere. I would recommend this to anyone in the mood for some reasonably priced italian food. Our reservations were on a Friday and we had to wait roughly 10-15 minutes before being seated, but it was well worth the wait.
