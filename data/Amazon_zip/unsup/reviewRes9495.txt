This is my new FAVORITE restaurant in Chicago! Now where to start??? I went there on a Saturday evening and had a wonderful spot right next to the window overlooking rush street. The upscale Polynesian decor was very nice and the smells made hungry from the second I walked in the door. Our waiter Francisco was very insightful and informative and extremely friendly. To start with my girlfriend and I got 2 apps which included Chao Tom and the scallop salad. The Chao Tom was like lettuce wraps with sugarcane infused shrimp....so GOOD although a little messy. Next we split the scallop salad and let me tell you, TO DIE FOR and very reasonably priced at only $12...large enough to be a meal for one for sure. Next for our main course we got the Ga Xao Xa Ot to split and this was seared lemongrass chicken over mushrooms and a basil chili sauce. We also got a side of shrimp fried rice. The dish had a wonderful presentation and the chicken was tender and spicy! The fried rice was so-so and could have used a little more flavor but their homemade chili sauce helped with that. For dessert we had vanilla ice cream with dark chocolate hot sauce over coconut macaroon and it was so tasty (recommended by Francisco of course). To finish the night we ordered Vietnamese coffee's that were made with condensed milk and tasted like expresso. This brought me right out of my food coma and prepared me for night out downtown. I LOVE THIS PLACE and will be going many more times. TY for such a great experience.
