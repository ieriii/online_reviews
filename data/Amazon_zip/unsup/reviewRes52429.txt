We went on a Monday when it was $34.99 and I think this was a pretty good deal for all the meat you can eat. The lamb was pretty good and the salad bar was great. We had a bottle of white wine and it was amazing. Pinot grigio. Everyone was dressed pretty nice as were we. We didn't come for any special occasion, however, the waiter and host were very attentive to us. I loved the environment and the food was great. The mashed potatoes were mouth watering. In addition, we waiting for less than 1 minute to be seated, if that. I would definitely go back.
