Great neighborhood Italian place with really solid food and great service. We drove up expecting valet per the website but didn't see any so my wife asked the host who he told us to just park in his spot right out front which was a huge bonus. The place seems to keep going so it's big yet still quaint.  Had a great glass of Malbec for under $10 and the Stella salad was really tasty. I decided to have the whole Branzini fish which was a bit out of my comfort zone but was a good experience and the sauce was the perfect compliment. But the highlight was the stuffed chicken breast which was absolutely delicious and would highly recommend.  Again, great Italian neighborhood restaurant but there are others so just depends on how far you want to drive out of your particular neighborhood.
