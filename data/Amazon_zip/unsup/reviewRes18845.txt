Get the pate board. That's really all you need to know. I went during their 5th anniversary celebration. They had specials from the original menu and $5 drinks- two local beers and a 9 year bourbon, plus a ginger cocktail with the bourbon. Ridiculous deal considering the regular price of their drinks!
