Came here around 7:30pm on a warm Sat night. Tons of people waiting for outdoor seating but no wait for indoor. Portions are HUGE! Two of us shared a ceviche and a bistec tico. Husband wasn't crazy about the horcafe. Ceviche did seem like a never-ending bowl topped with tomatoes and avocado. Bistec with bell peppers, tomatoes and onions were so tasty but a bit too salty. Friendly service and we'd definitely go back.  byob, gotta love that.
