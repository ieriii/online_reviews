Even though I've been coming here for over 15 years, Sabatino's surprised me last night! I usually have the veal, because all of their veal dishes are so good, but I had a taste for their gnocchi and the waitress suggested something for me. They didn't bring me the regular gnocchi, but the Gnocchi di Spinaci which is a green spinach gnocchi in an alfredo sauce with bits of prosciutto and asparagus. It was SO good that I had it for dinner, a midnight snack, AND breakfast this morning. Sabatino's has really good Italian food that is reasonably priced. This is a traditional Italian neighborhood restaurant. Don't expect anything fancy - if you want that go down town. But for consistently good food and nice service, you can't beat Sabatino's.
