I had the foie Gras and sauternes sausage with foie gras mousse, truffle aioli, and fleur de sel - well executed and unique to say the least, but way too rich. 1 bite would have sufficed. I do not fault Mr. Doug and his establishment for this - I should have known what I was getting myself into. The duck fat fries, on the other hand, were absolutely divine and worth the 1 hr, 45 minute wait by themselves.
