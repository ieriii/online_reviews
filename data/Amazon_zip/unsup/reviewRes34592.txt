I was not impressed with Yolk. As a matter of fact Yolk was Yucky. If you want tasteless omelette's with dry potatoes then this is the place for you. Otherwise I'd steer clear. I think most of the hype is because it's a restaurant on the magnificent mile that's reasonably priced. The pancakes were a little thick but one of the better things they had to offer.
