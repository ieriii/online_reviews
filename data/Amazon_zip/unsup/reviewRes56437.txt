my girlfriend came home hyped up that Simply It now have sandwiches. she keeps telling me she wants to see if its better than uptowns. so we came back the weekend that just passed.the little man at the door, once again, so generous and sweet. had offered appetizers while we waited for a table. it looked pretty busy. we still got a pretty decent table though.she ordered the duck sandwich and i ordered the porkchop sandwich. both were delicious. and they have plenty other kinds. plus the fact that its only $4 a sandwich! life is beautiful. with the economy being the way it is, id say Simply It is pretty great.we also ordered the tamarind shrimp soup to share. yummm. it kind of reminds me of going to her house =). with it being...I WILL COME BACK!
