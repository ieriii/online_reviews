I just moved into a place nearby and have the goal of hitting every restaurant and bar around eventually. Simply It looked good for a night when my husband and I didn't feel like cooking, and it was really good! We're both pretty particular about our Asian food, and have gone to our share of Chinese/Japanese/Thai/Vietnamese/etc. places and been underwhelmed. This place definitely met and exceeded our expectations.  We had the shrimp tempura for appetizers, and while the shrimp was great, we didn't think the "spicy sweet and sour orange sauce" was spicy OR very orange tasting. For entree, I had the clay pot chicken which was FABULOUS. I had to make myself stop eating or I would have demolished the whole thing.  Beware the giant pieces of ginger, though, because if you're not expecting them, it's like a surprise in your mouth. My husband ordered the Bamboo Roasted Duck and said it was amazing. I don't like duck so I'll take his word for it, based on the fact that he was done with his meal before I'd even half finished mine. The presentation of the food was very well done, as well. After the meal, we were given free slices of orange and watermelon as dessert, which was nice. Service was okay -- not great, but not bad. Our server didn't seem too invested in us, but the food made up for it. The prices were great for the amount that you get. Looking forward to going back and trying something else.
