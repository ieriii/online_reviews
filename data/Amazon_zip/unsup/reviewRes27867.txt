I am rounding down, but I believe I would give this place 3 and a half stars. I actually really wanted to like this place in every way, but came away slighty under-impressed. Kudos for the jalapenos on the table to go along with the chips, salsa and a small appetizer of puerco guisado (closest thing that I would equate it to). My dinner companion had the enchiladas in the red ancho sauce which was pretty good. I had the carne tampiquena, which was alright but a little tough. I believe I've had a better steak at Garcias (Western & Lawrence). The beans and rice were good by any mexican standard. Overall I'd like to try it again and see if I'd like the other things on the menu, because what I did try was overall satisfactory
