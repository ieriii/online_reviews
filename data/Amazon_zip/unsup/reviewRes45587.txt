Oh so long ago this location housed a Barbara's Bookstore. For the past umpteen years it's been a True Value Hardware store. Now Wilde has taken over and it is a neighborhood Irish pub. I still miss Barbara's but Wilde is a huge improvement over hardware. We've eaten here twice and we had a great time. We find the decor warm and comfortable; maybe that's just in comparison to the harsh lighting of the former True Value. It is a remarkable transformation. The food has been good, if unspectacular. We liked the burger. The chicken pot pie was tasty but watery. That was way back in their first week so things might have improved in the pot pie department. A little on the pricey side...2 beers, 1 appetizer and 1 burger (we split between 2 of us) with (generous) tip was $38. Still, a great addition to the neighborhood.
