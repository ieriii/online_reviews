My boyfriend and I ordered Indian House tonight delivered by http://diningin.com. It was pretty delicious and stood up to the 30 min delivery time very well.  We ordered the chicken tikka masala and the chicken jalfreezi (chicken with onions and bell peppers in a tomato based sauce). Both were very tasty. I asked for both with white meat, and it was of a pretty good quality.  I ordered the dishes extra spicy and they did NOT disappoint. I was wishing I had a glass of milk the whole time. The garlic naan was also very good, clearly fresh baked out of the oven using fresh not pre-minced garlic. I would definitely eat here again and would be interested in visiting the restaurant.
