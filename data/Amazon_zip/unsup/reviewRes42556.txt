Alright, I said to myself that if I ever went back that I would write an update. Gilt Bar has redeemed itself--the food was really delicious. First as a quick aside, after my last review, Brendan Sodikoff (the owner) sent me a message and apologized for not communicating better and offered to personally book my next reservation. I thought this was a classy move and I very much appreciated it. I chose not to, since I wanted to objectively give Gilt Bar another try. I learned my lesson last time and called ahead. It was a Thursday night and I called earlier that same day. Their earliest opening was 8:30. We arrived at about 8:00 and the place was packed. My wife enjoyed a great cocktail with elderflower liqueur and champagne. I stuck with an old fashioned. We were seated by 8:15. The food was exactly what i like to cook and eat--flavorful, simple, technically excellent, and rich but balanced. We started with the bone marrow with red onion jam and the foie/pork liver mousse. Two very rich but well balanced appetizers. The sweet red onion jam was a great counterpoint to the richness of the bone marrow. I like my meat salty and when I asked for salt for my marrow, the waiter brought me "the good stuff" from the kitchen--seasoned salt with dried herbs. Also, how can you not like foie/pork liver mouse with classic accompaniments: crunchy bread, dijon and cornichons. A simple winter green salad with a classic vinaigrette was a great palate cleanser and the main course which we split was the spoon tender pot roast (seemed to have been braised forever) with perfectly glazed root vegetables which were like savory pieces of candy on the plate. Everything was delicious. Service from the bar and from our waiter was friendly, laid back and very efficient. The host/hostess remain.....aloof.....it is a trendy spot, so maybe to be expected Thanks, Gilt Bar.
