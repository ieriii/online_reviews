Wow, 278 reviews before me? Guess I'll keep this one to the basics: -BYOB, which is great. No corkage fee which is even better. There is a limit of one bottle for two people or one six-pack for two people...and just beer/wine/sake, no other liquor. They didn't seem to be enforcing that rule, but it was a slower Monday night with no one waiting to be seated. -They do take reservations. Great for our party of ten. -Seriously awesome miso soup. No spoons, which was strange, but handles for easy sipping. -Edamame was served a little cold and with little to no salt. I like mine piping hot with lotsa salt, so this was a little disappointing. -The sushi was pretty good. Definitely not the best I have had, but I've had worse (then again, I am no sushi expert, so what do I know...). Tried the una avo (good sauce), crunchy spicy tuna (more crumbly tempura crumbs, but alright), spider (my favorite), volcano (spicy, but that's about all it had going for it, and it left me yearning for my delightful Bentonara volcano roll with the secret sauce), and I had a bite of the White Dragon...not bad. -Pricing was pretty reasonable, given that the ambiance is pretty great for a BYOB. No silly explanatory pictures on the wall, just calming zen-like setting with dim lighting and warm colors.  I felt like I was in a place where I should have paid much more. And the presentation of our food was lovely. -Service was adequate, but not overly friendly. I do appreciate that they accommodated our large group and worked with us on the check. I will probably be back to try some more rolls, and to enjoy the lovely ambiance.
