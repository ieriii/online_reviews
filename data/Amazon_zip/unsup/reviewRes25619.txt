MMM mmmm! Finally came here after hearing about it from lots of people- it hasn't disappointed. I have only had the pan pizza- and that cheese crust is SO good. Service can be slow but my husband and I have taken to calling in our order ahead which speeds up the process a bit. Overall we've never had a bad pizza there. It can get crowded so try to call in for a table. Lots of TVs if you want to watch a game. Pequods has turned into our deep-dish default pizza place (and we do Piece when we want thin crust!).
