We stayed at the James over the weekend, and I was definitely impressed. What I didn't like about the hotel was made up for in the impeccable service of this boutique hotel. Decor: I'm not a fan of the red. It SCREAMS tacky. It's the type of place with hip electronic music playing in the background and then you see a group of 30-40 year old bachelors with ripped designer jeans, half unbuttoned shirts, man jewelry and enough cologne to start a fire (when they light their cigarette). I guess a little red is okay, but to put a large patent pleather red chaise lounge in a room with four white walls is just wrong. What were you thinking??? The bed was very nice. Very large and plush with soft sheets and down comforter. Perfect for lounging around or having a lazy Sunday morning. I liked the large wooden bench for setting your luggage and the nook for reading, working or eating was very nice (but not that comfortable).  Bathroom is very large, but houses the closet (weird). Shallow tub reminds me of my own apartment.  Service and amenities: Love the cookies for turn down service! Also love the martini glasses, large assortment of full bottles of liquer in room (Tanqueray, Grey Goose, Johnny Walker Black and Petron) with martini shaker, and Kiehls bath products. (I LOVE Kiehls!!). Free wifi is always great too! Full sized gym is awesome. Clean, empty with a variety of cardio and weight equipment. Complimentary large bottles of SmartWater in the elevator area too! A couple of things that were lacking, ok just one. No Newspaper!!!  Dog and cat friendly too! I enjoyed my stay, but the Peninsula is more my type of place :)
