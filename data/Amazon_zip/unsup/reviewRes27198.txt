Not sure if I hate disappointing food or the resulting disappointment from disappointing food more. Although my friend thoroughly enjoyed our experience, I found everything to be effort-full, but lukewarm at best. Granted, my friend loves american food, while I tend to steer towards the more exotic food stuffs. But, at the end of the night, I just left feeling that the best part of the night was the good conversation.  I started with the roasted beets after having been hyped up about this dish from both the bartender and the server. It was just like every good beet salad I had ever tasted (although the whipped chevre was a very interesting touch). My companion started with the risotto with cheez-its (and she loved it). Second course was the skate (this was truly the thickest piece of skate I had ever seen, having been used to those flaky non existent thin portions you get in french restaurants) for me. Second course for the friend was the stroganoff (which again, she adored).  We shared the peach cobbler (like another reviewer said it was entirely forgettable (I even advised the server of this)). Cocktails were ok, albeit a bit sweet. Service was fine.  All in all, an average experience.
