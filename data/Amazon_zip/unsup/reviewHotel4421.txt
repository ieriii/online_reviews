Magnificent. Just stunning. I was absolutely taken away with the grandeur of the hotel lobby. The Palmer House Hilton is a beautiful hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. It's in a fantastic location -- there are lots of great restaurants in the area; it's within walking distance to many of the city's top must-sees; and there's very easy access to the subway (the Red Line is right outside of the hotel). I arrived in the morning around 10am, which is way early for check-in. I was planning to store my bags until the afternoon when the rooms would be ready. However, the woman at the front desk was able to find one room ready at that time (the other wasn't ready yet), which was fine by me! How wonderful! It was nice to freshen up and change before heading out to explore the city. The room was ginormous! My friend had told me the last she stayed there her room was tiny were small, so needless to say, I was thrilled when I walked in. There was enough space to waltz if you wanted to! Good bath products, excellent water pressure (that is so important to me). The beds were super comfy. For someone who doesn't normally sleep well to begin with - much less in a hotel - my head sank into the pillows and I fell asleep right away each night. Just a couple of negatives: cell phone service was very spotty in the hotel. In fact, I had no service at all when I was in the lobby. F&B service in the lobby wasn't great. We sat in one of the comfy chairs along the wall, hoping to have one last drink before we flew out that evening. There was a menu on our table so clearly they do service all the tables. However, the server never walked by us, not even close enough for us to get his attention. Overall, it's a great hotel and I would definitely stay there again!
