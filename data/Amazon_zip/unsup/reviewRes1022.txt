As we walked to Hot Doug's around 1pm there was a line out the door. That was a good sign! It was kinda chilly that day and there was even a CNN crew out there braving the Chicago cold air. We finally got to the counter and decided to try the Foi Gras hot dog. Yes... that's right, we got they have a Foi Gras hot dog and it was even $10. We had to get it since the place was a little bit outside of where we stayed. It was excellent! I wish I could afford another one... As we walked back to the train station, I remembered I don't like Foi Gras because of ethical reasons. I felt bad about it and promise myself to never do it again. I still recommend it though... (;
