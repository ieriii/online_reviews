Any restaurant that can handle me and 22 members of my insane family with grace is a winner in my book. I brought in a large chunk of my family from Indiana yesterday, and our server was great-- and we're a picky family. After I gave the lecture to my siblings (the ol' "Look, I come here a lot... so don't be a mensch" lecture), everyone really enjoyed the generous portions and the excellent seasoning. I warned everyone-- you don't need to order anything with the burrito. They didn't listen. At the end of the meal, with more than half a burrito left, they wished they had. Make no mistake, Garcia's' burritos are amongst the largest in Chicago. Extremely filling and absolutely delicious. Thanks, Garcia's, for treating us so kindly. We'll be back! (With fewer screaming children running around!)
