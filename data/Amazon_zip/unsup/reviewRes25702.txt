I'm giving an extra star for the literary reference in the restaurant's name. Also for their logo design. 3 stars overall for the food. We ordered a deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage and were not even remotely disappointed. It was beyond delicious and I would love to know where they get their sausage from. Noms! Service was nice and quick (considering it takes about 30 minutes to get your pizza, of course) and I left with a happy, happy belly.
