So after I had an epic BLT at the last Bacon Fest, I've been craving another tasty pork sammich. With so many interesting choices on the Lunch menu, I kept changing my mind on what I was getting. Then I saw the BLT and just ordered it. Actually I didn't even read what was in it, so I was pleasantly surprised when it came out. Now THIS is a BLT. A thick meaty slab of some crisp & tender pork belly, arugula, and sweet tomato jam. Plus some secret white sauce... it was good stuff. Halfway through, I regretted not adding the optional egg. That would've been all kinds of yolky porky deliciousness... sorrow. The beef fat fries were solid. Also, get the cheese grits if you like it super cheesey. Tasted almost like I was eating pure cheese in the shape of grits. Our server seemed unenthusiastic, but the service was good. The hostesses were very friendly and it only took about 15 minutes to seat us. The drink menu is impressive, with a huge list of beers, hard liqour, and wine. I mean the list for the bourbon alone was about a page. But it was a hot day and I ordered some fresh lemonade. Sweet, tart, and ice cold - I would buy a gallon of the lemonade if they sold it. I know I'll be back for some more good food and drink.
