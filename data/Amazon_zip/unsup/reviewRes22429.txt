I love this place! Granted it was in the middle of a busy intersection, but it was still cute with the landmark weiner building! The drive-in effect was so 50's. I was waiting for the rollerskating waitress to deliver our order, but was disappointed when she didn't show up. (Got over it). You would think with a big hot dog on the building I would order a superdawg, right? Wrong. For some reason, I felt like a burger that day. I was a tad wary about the bluish relish, but my local friend informed me it was their signature condiment, so I took the first bite of my Supercheesie...yummy...juicy and flavorful! Gotta love the blue gunk! I don't normally like fries, and even that was delish! I absolutely encourage a visit to this place. I cannot wait til my next Chicago excursion when I hope to end up in this neighborhood to delight my palate with, this time, a Superdawg!!!
