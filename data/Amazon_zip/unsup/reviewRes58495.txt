amazing food and great service !We reached there a little after the time our table was booked for, so dint get it right away. But the owner welcomed us warmly with a hot cup of tea and a plate of complimentary dumplings..all our food was really great, well flavoured and good quantity. It was fabulous. and the owner is just the sweetest guy, he understands the meaning of customer delight......highly recommended!
