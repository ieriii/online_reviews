I don't know what it is about Yolk, but despite simply ordering a coffee, waffles, and potatoes there every time I go....I find the food absolutely amazing! My sister was in town earlier this week and I took her out to breakfast here - it wasn't too busy (a Wednesday morning) and the service was amazing. The kitchen had just made an extra waffle so when I ordered mine the waitress gave it to me for free! I do hear the wait on weekends is pretty long and given I would just consider Yolk a standard breakfast place I don't think I would wait on the weekends. But otherwise, I will definitely be back!
