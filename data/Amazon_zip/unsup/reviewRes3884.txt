GREAT FOOD!!! Especially the WACKY WACKY WINGS For those hankering wings sans the rest of the bird, we've got a treat for you. No itty bitty wings here -- these Jumbo sized wings are fried to perfection and come in your choice of sauce. however they loose one star for closing at 9 pm! who closes at 9 on a friday!!! If your trying to serve a young crowd, then you you need to stay open longer on a Friday and Saturday. They lose 1 star for not serving the needs of their primary market.
