Come on how can you go wrong by going to the restaurant of THE winner of Top Chef Masters season 1? He's a master a guru... So an American chef that specializes in authentic Mexican cuisine, can be skeptical but this stuff is legit! First off the restaurant is small and parking is difficult so prepare an hour to find parking and waiting. Was it worth it? Well I had split two tortas: Pepito: Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos. This was good, not amazing. I thought the meat was tender and onions made it good but nothing special. Pibil: wood-roasted suckling pig with achiote, black beans, pickled onion, habanero salsa. This was flippin amazing! The suckling pig was so well seasoned and tasty that I am dreaming about it now. I don't know how to describe it but this is THE torta to get. Also comes with habanero salsa... this will destroy you but you will love how flavorful the salsa is as well.  *Both tortas were $12 and pretty small which was disappointing but its all about the experience. The suckling pig might bring me back here sooner than later. Classic Hot Chocolate: I was disappointed they didnt have the almond horchata anymore but know that they freshly grind chocolate beans and it show. So fresh, thick, and creamy. Good stuff. Churro was in a fish shape and was deliciously crispy outside and soft i the inside as it should be! Overall great experience, bravo Rick Bayless on displaying why you are a Top Chef. Thanks for bringing your talents to Chicago
