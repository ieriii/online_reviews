This place has the best basil chicken in Chicago. Full-flavoured (if you request it so), basil added at just the right time to maintain its fragrance, and chicken very well seasoned and not to dry. Not as spicy as it could have been, but overall, it was still excellent.That being said, don't bother with the Khao Soy, with pineapple but no chili, more sweet than it was spicy. I'll definately be back, and will update this review accordingly.
