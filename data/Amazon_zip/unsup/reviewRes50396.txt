Definitely one of the best brunch places I've been to in the city! Ambiance is really cute. They take reservations and i recommend making them for this place, as it can get crowded. I guess it's "Southern style food" but probably more like Southern style fusion. Unique menu with fun atypical brunch items. They start out with serving warm beignets as their "bread." SOOO yummy. Who does that? Serving beignets for free! My dish was SO good - the Crab Cake Benedict might sound like a risky dish to order because you're not sure if the crab will taste fresh, but man oh man this dish tasted SOOO perfect. Really standout and very delish. The hollandaise sauce is perfect, the egg is perfectly cooked, the hash browns were delicately fried and flavored - basically the combination of crab, egg, and potatoes, and sauce was EXCELLENT and delicious. I've had this dish at other places and this was definitely WAY better. It is a pricey dish, about $16 but worth the experience. Coffee is also pretty good here. My friend ordered the Shrimp and Grits which came out as a soup - while tasty, it was not filling for even a gal!! She had to munch on other things to feel full. My other friend ordered the pork sandwich on the lunch menu and she said that was really tasty as well. For dessert, we had the famous red velvet cake that my friend raved about and so did everyone on yelp - it was good but not like the absolutely best red velvet I've ever had, or anything. However, my friend said it tasted differently this time, but maybe the next we order it will be taste much better. Lastly, their presentation of food is modern, delightful, and warms up your taste buds =) Only negative in our case is that our service but super super slow, to the point where i had to wave down the waiter for the check. But maybe it was because it was saturday noon, and they were really busy.
