A female barbecuer who beat Bobby Flay at a Throwdown? Yee haw! I was excited to try the bbq here and it did not disappoint. I ordered the bbq flight as my meal so I could sample as much as possible (brisket, pulled pork, and chicken), and my hubby ordered the ribs so I had all my bases covered. The appetizer portion was generous and came with thick slices of cornbread topped with sweet butter, and the meat was delectably, deliciously tender. The meat comes dry-drubbed and they bring out the array of bbq sauces, which is a nice combination of flavors.  I only wish the sauces had come the way ALL good barbecue sauces should come - in big squirt bottles instead of tiny thimbles because after all, if you've got it...flaunt it! And it's barbecue sauce doggone it, not truffle-pate-whatsit-sauce.  Cue me up for Chicago q!
