I had high expectations for this place and I must say, it met my expectations (but didn't exceed them). They put lots of thought into the food and our overall experience while we were eating. I was also pretty surprised at some of the things they could do to food! The tasting menu was 19 courses (with optional 20th course you could add to your experience. Some memorable dishes: Beet soup in a large block of ice Leaf that tastes like oyster Making dashi in front of us Yuba wrapped in shrimp with red miso dipping sauce Turning a scallop into tofu Very very tender and yummy swordfish (usually I think swordfish is tough but this one was the best I've had!) Mushroom dish where the plate sits on top of a pillow and slowly sinks down, compressing juniper scent at you. Supposed to mimic you walking through the woods smelling juniper and picking mushrooms This explosion of black truffle goodness set on an "antiplate" Meal set on utensils in a random array all over the table (inspired by Miro)--This bucket in the middle gave off lavender scent as you are eating Crispy brie and apple on a lit cinnamon stick (playing with smell as you're eating again) Snow flavored into peppermint and CLEAR hot chocolate! Desert where a chef comes out and plates the table in front of us! This place is definitely worth it!! Everything was presented to me so artistically. The food also tasted great! They also tried to involve me in some parts (like doing certain things to food or assembling parts of the dinnerware). I may consider coming here some other time...some other season :D
