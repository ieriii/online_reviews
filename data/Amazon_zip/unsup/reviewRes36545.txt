On a recent Sunday morning in February 2012 my wife, son, and I visited the Meli Caf for breakfast at approximately 10:00 a.m. We are all return patrons but had not dined there in a while. As no surprise, the restaurant was packed with diners and waiting customers lined the small corridor leading to the reservation stand with many more standing outside. After about a 25-minute wait we were seated at a table located in the south dining room near the entrance. The area was cold and drafty due to the constant opening of the entrance door. I explained our problem to the hostess who quickly moved us to a table in the north dining room, which was comfortably heated. Our breakfasts included the feta scrambler, ham & eggs, and a special consisting of eggs and vegetarian sausage. All of us enjoyed our meals with everything being warm and tasty. Also, the coffee was flavorful, hot, and quickly refilled. Our toast was accompanied by a plate containing small bowls of butter, orange marmalade, and grape jelly. The orange marmalade was excellent, but the grape jelly was atypically bland for this restaurant. Our servers were accommodating and very adept in carrying platters of food and squeezing between the tables that are all closely positioned. The long wait to be seated and the crammed tables reminded me of the reasons that I don't have breakfast more often at Meli Caf on Sunday mornings. I certainly will be back but will try to confine my visits to weekdays.
