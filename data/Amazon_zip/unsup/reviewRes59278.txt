The staff is friendly and knowledgeable - I'm just started to develop my sushi palate, so I'm pretty lost when reading sushi menus.The recommendations the waitress made were amazing. She also took the time to explain to me what certain types of ingredients are, and what generally goes well together.My husband doesn't like sushi, but there is plenty for him to enjoy here. He swears by the basil chicken, and we both love their crab rangoon!It's tricky to find parking around the Indie cafe, but it's worth it!
