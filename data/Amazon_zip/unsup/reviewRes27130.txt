I've always been intrigued by Rick Bayless, ever since watching him on "Mexico, One Plate at a Time" on WTTW/PBS. Next he tore it up on Top Chef Masters and I was then a slight % more proud to be from the Chicagoland area. Rick know's what he's doing and Frontera is his flagship restaurant (IMO). Getting to the point, Frontera is a must try for anyone who even likes chips and salsa... The decor is fun and vibrant, service is adequate and casual, but the food and drink speak volumes about his deep passion for the cusine and culture of Mexico. His food is almost as colorful as the decor. The Ceviche trio is a must for anyone who enjoys that refreshing and energizing feelin a good ceviche can provide. You truly cant go wrong with any Margarita, served straight up, so you know the bartender/mixologist knows what they're doing. Any entree you order will be solid. If it's on his menu, you wont be dissapointed. No sense in writing on. Mexican chef's (from Mexico), are inspired by all the creativty and ingenuity Rick has influence in Mexican cusine. Plan ahead, go with a fun group, and get ready for a memorable meal.
