The missus and I went to Mayan Palace a few nights ago when searching for Mexican food in a restaurant setting which we had not been patrons of before. Being that we were in the area we stopped in at the aforementioned establishment. We were seated quickly and were promptly brought out a couple of waters, chips and salsa and asked for our drink orders. I ordered a Margarita on the rocks no salt for her and double J&B for myself as well as an order of guacamole. The waiter (whose name I forget now) was very pleasant and prompt. We perused the menus waiting for our bevies and chomped on the chips and salsa and guacamole. I wasn't all that impressed with the chips, salsa or the guacamole but let me be clear that it's because I've become so accustomed to my own that most store bought and restaurant salsa's and guacamole pale in comparison to my palette. They weren't inedible though so no marks down, just my preference takes over.  As is usually the case after appetizers and drinks I rarely have an appetite for my meal but this way I have a nice breakfast, lunch or dinner ready to go the next day. So my vegan burrito (not listed on the menu as such I just opted out of the sour cream and cheese) made a wonderful breakfast the next morning, yes breakfast...I don't go in for the idea of not eating certain foods at certain times of day. If I want a big burrito and a beer for breakfast then that's what I'm going to eat. Anyroad, the burrito wasn't fresh any more but it wasn't lacking flavor by any means and I really loved the huge slices of bell pepper and mushrooms (which even after a re-heat we're still crisp). I will go back to Mayan Palace again for dinner another time and forego the appetizers so I can enjoy the ordered meal on the spot.
