The food at this place was BOMB. It was our first stop on our Chi-Town trip and it totally set the bar sky-high for our food expectations for the rest of our time there. We went on a Thursday morning around 10:30am and it was pretty crowded. The wait for a party of 2 was 20 minutes but that's okay because it gave us time to look through the million-page menu and have an outdoor photoshoot with grant park in the background haha When we sat down, we already knew what we were going to order. Their classic eggs benedict with canadian bacon and their red velvet french toast. Didya hear me? red velvet french toast! This dish is basically three slices of red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting smothered in french toast batter, grilled, and topped with whipped cream and strawberries. It was so divine. Despite how good the food was, I'm knocking off a star because the service was horrible. The hostesses at the front were totally rude and looked like stuck-up snobs off the set of some trashy reality show with their spray tans and highlighted hair, and our waitress was MIA for most of our meal. Considering my annoyance with them, I should have given the restaurant 3 stars. Yolk, you're lucky that your red velvet french toast melted in my mouth the way it did.
