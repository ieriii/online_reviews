I've been to Coast on numerous occasions and have always been satisfied with my meal. I've decided to break it down in to pros and cons because that is how I am feeling today: Pros 1. The Maki is extremely delicious, tastes fresh and has wonderful presentation. 2. It is BYOB and there is a liquor store down the street with a decent craft brew and wine selection. 3. Very cool decor and great for dates (assuming you have a date.) Cons 1. Always crazy crowded. You should call for a reservation or you will most likely be waiting for a looong time. You can drink in the waiting room though so, you know, score. You could probably get a table if you get there right when they open but let's be honest, who does that?? 2. The wait staff has never been particularly friendly, but they are certainly professional. Sort of like a coworker you get along with, but would never have a beer with. 3. It is priced just enough where it wouldn't be an everyday sushi place. It's sort of like the difference between Olive Garden and Maggiano's. It's the Maggiano's of Sushi. 4. Expect to feel out of place if you aren't on a date or part of a girls night out. Personal experience I know, but it still hurts all the same. Overall I totally dig this place. The White Dragon Maki is insane good. I think there is Nicotine in it. Not really. But really.
