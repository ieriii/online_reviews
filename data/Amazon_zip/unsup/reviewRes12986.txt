the experience I had at cafe 28 was wonderful! we arrived on a wed night and were seated right away. we started off with the coconut shrimp and rice appetizer. It was ok but in my opinion it didn't really fall into appetizer category, next time i think i will venture for the goat cheese. i had the skillet with beef and shrimp and it was delicious!!! it came with salsa, black beans and sour cream and individual tortillas so you can really mix and match to your taste. i loved the way the restaurant was set up, it was warm, cozy and the overall ambiance was well-- charming...
