We had the Chef's Luxury tasting menu, and everything was simply delicious. Including the free crispy bread topped with a heavenly tomato salsa. I really had to stop myself from eating it to save room for the tasting menu. Next time, I want to try the Iron Chef Mondays tasting menu. The food was more than plentiful and very well priced. The service was good. This restaurant was very noisy, even on a weeknight. So, don't go there for business or romantic meals. Chef Jose Garces rocks!!!
