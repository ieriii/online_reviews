The korean fried chicken here is finger-lickin-good! Its prob not very authentic, but it is very tastey-- esp with the Seoul Sassy sauce. They have a whole chicken special M-T that comes with 2 sides and 2 drinks from one of the coolers (soda or water) all that for $20 + tax! Awesome deal, enough food for 3-4 people. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because their sides are not the best. The fries are ok, vegetable sides are probable the most authentic (and pretty good), they of course have kimchi. A must to try if you live in the area.
