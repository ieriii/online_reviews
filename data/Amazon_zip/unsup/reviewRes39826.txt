The food here is great! Because they give you a LOT of little dishes you eat with your meal, you can order just 1 bbq thing off the menu, be full and pay less than $20 for 2-3 people! Just know that you will smell after you go in. The smoke gets everywhere. Also, understand that this is not a restaurant where you will be waited upon. You are supposed to cook the meat yourself. It's an interactive dining experience.
