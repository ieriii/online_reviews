Soooo here's the deal : Sunda is great. I know a lot of people have pre-conceived notions about billy dec, the underground, rockit, etc etc, but i have to give it to the guy and his team : they do a bang up job of making classy restaurants. The clientele is definitely upper rim - but as someone noted below, not a snooty upper class , more of a relaxed setting . A lot of old and young, diverse professionals from Chicago - this place hasn't quite turned into the tourist / suburbanite trap that is now Japonais. I went with a large party , about 10 people , for my friend's birthday. They were very accomodating with the reservation and had our table ready on time. The server was excellent and did a great job of handling everyones orders - many of us were vegetarians and she was receptive to what was veggie friendly on the menu, what was good, etc etc. Having been here for lunch and dinner - i'd definitely recommend the corn fritters, and the sunda special sushi with the avocado/shrimp topping - it was probably some of the best sushi i'd ever had. The curry chicken/noodle thing for lunch is fantastic, the desserts are all pretty much awesome, and the thai fried chicken for dinner is superb...i'd avoid the grilled chicken with bok choy dish though, it was a bit more boring. Oh yeah, the garlic lo mein is great too. all in all this place does a great job of attracting an upscale crowd without being incredibly overpriced or pretentious....will this last? probably not....but in the meantime it's definitely worth a go.
