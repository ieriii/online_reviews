Xoco is quite an experience. They have a unique way of ordering, seating guests and delivering your food, which adds to the Xoco experience. Overall, any restaurant is focused on their food, and I think their food is pretty impressive. My favorite is their churros. I'm not a fan of desserts/sweets, and churros were never something I thought were that great, but something about Xoco's churros are pretty superb.  I had their wild mushroom torta and their chicken torta, both were very good. I don't eat pork so that takes away almost 2/3 of the menu, and I'm sure their pork is the highlight of their menu, and I wish they had more options for non-pork eaters. But what I got to try, I was thoroughly impressed and enjoyed.
