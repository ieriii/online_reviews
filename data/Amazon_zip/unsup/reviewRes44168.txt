I had heard a lot of good things when I came to this place. Granted, this review is just about my experience ordering take-out, but I have a lot to say about that experience. Anyway, I came here CRAVING some good sushi. I ordered takeout on a rather busy Sunday evening last month. The wait was long, but I didn't mind. I was updated every 10 mins or so that they were still working on it and to please wait. So, I get the sushi, and I open it up... First of all, I was not impressed with the size of the rolls I got. They were a lot smaller (especially for the price) than I'm used to and the amount of fish in each roll was laughable. Then I eat it. I got 3 very simple "hard to eff up" rolls: Godzilla, spicy white tuna, and philly + avocado. The flavor of the fish in each of the rolls was disgusting. It definitely tasted un-fresh. Overall, a disappointing experience. The next time I get sushi when I'm up in that area, I'm going to try the new SushiX location on Diversey... They do delivery/takeout sushi right. :)
