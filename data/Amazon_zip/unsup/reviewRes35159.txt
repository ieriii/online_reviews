it was a toss up for dinner between Joe's Stone Crab and Shaw's Crab House. Shaw's won out because I have never tried it and was able to secure a reservation on a Friday night through opentable. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the overwhelming fishy smell. Most high end places I have frequented don't smell like that. We were seated in a comfy area in the old-fashioned restaurant. I loved the pictures on the wall of Charles Shaw and the first crab shacks way back when. it definitely has history and character.  We ordered the cold seafood platter and sampled cocktail shrimp, oysters, King crab bites and crab claws. All of it was very good. Next up was seafood linguini and 2 sushi rolls (Spicy tuna and I have already forgotten the other one). Decent. Didn't love it, but didn't hate it. All in all it was good, just not standout.
