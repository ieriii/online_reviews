We went there on Saturday for dinner and it was fantastic. Fresh seafood delivered 6 days a week, hours from catch. The scallops in a mushroom sherry sauce rocked! We also has the trout and it was superb. One recommendation, if you make reservations later on Friday or Saturday, ours was 9pm, call ahead and have them save a piece of the fish you want. Check their online menu. This is our "new" spot!
