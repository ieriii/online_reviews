**UPdate. It was all a misunderstanding. I emailed restaurant and they were very accomodating. Made reservation. Will update after we eat there... I just called Graham Elliott to request a vegan appetizer and entree and they said 'would not accommodate' OK. vegan at its most basic = vegetables, fruits, spices, olive oil. How hard is that? All other restaurants I have EVER called have enthusiastically accommodated my diet including: RPM, Paris Club, Tru and Ada Street, HUB 51, even Gibson's for goodness sake!!! Just an FYI
