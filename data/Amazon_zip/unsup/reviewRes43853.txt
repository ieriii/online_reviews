While visiting Chicago we were drawn to this place due to it's incredible 3-course fall menu. WHAT A DEAL!!!!!!!! We started with the cheese platter (not part of the special)..... it was yummy! I had the value meal with salad, steak, and flourless chocolate cake.  The steak was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed it. My husband had the steak risotto, it was good but nothing to write home about. Our server was good..... friendly and on top of things. I would definitely go back here if I lived in Chicago.
