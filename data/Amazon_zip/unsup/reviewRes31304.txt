We went for restaurant week. Based on our experience, we will never go back there. It's not that anything was bad, it just didn't live up to the hype and wasn't worth the money. The portions were small, and the food was uninspiring and bland. The chef's special sushi, which came with restaurant week, was like kid's sushi! If you've never eaten sushi before, then you should like this. For real sushi lovers, it was BORING- not to mention only 3 pieces. Seriously, it should be GREAT, but it was disappointing.  Service was slow even though there weren't that many people in the restaurant. Our server rarely checked on us- he was friendly when he was there. Ambiance was good- seemed like it would have been good for a group. But food is FIRST, and everything else is a distant second. Food was just OKAY. For some reason, Sunda felt the need to charge the higher dollar amount for their restaurant week dinner menu- $44 instead of $33. Usually, this is the case if it's really special- it was NOT. The famous rock shrimp? It's like a knockoff version of walnut shrimp from Chinatown. Any place in Chinatown or on Argyle serves it better. The best thing I ate was the eggplant that came with the cod. But there were only 5-6 small rounds. We also got the short rib- talk about underseasoned! And they serve it with this congee stuff that is bland, and frankly disgusting.  Even though it was restaurant week, we ended up spending about $200 with drinks, and I wish I could say it was fantastic, but it wasn't. Not even remotely.  SO overhyped! Take your money and go somewhere else!
