I have been to Shaw's at least 50 times over the years. I usually stay in the Blue Crab Lounge. It is informal and you can have the menu from the main dining room if you want it. Some of the bartenders have been there for 20 years which is nice. I love the place. You can sit and drink or eat to your hearts content. Great location whether you drive or walk and easy to meet people there. One of my tops in that area along with Frontera Grill
