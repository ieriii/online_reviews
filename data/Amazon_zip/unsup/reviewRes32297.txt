Appetizer was scrumptious...we had these samosa type snacks. My dinner partner and I chose to go the shared plate as the norm with Ethiopian dinners. I gotta say, it was good, but I've had better. We chose vegetarian things and they were good, but felt that they were lacking in something. I can't put my finger on it. Maybe I put my standards too high ever since eating awesome Ethiopian in Minneapolis.  I really do adore the communal aspect of Ethiopian dining. I really do. I think there's something to communal dining. Sharing food is sharing experiences and its a bonding experience. Regardless, the injera was top notch, but I think the meal came out a little too luke warm for me and frankly could have been more flavorful. The service was only O.K., but at times I felt that we were being forgotten. Btw, I could have sworn that one of the other diners in the restaurant looked like Randy Harrison from Queer as Folk, but I was told "if it is him, he let himself go." I'll take that as a no then. We went on Wednesday, but apparently they have live music on Friday and Saturday so I'd suggest going to Demera then if you are going to try it first. Also consider Ethiopian Diamond and Ras Dashen both in Edgewater.
