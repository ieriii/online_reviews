My friend and I went to Sun Wah after we found Silver Seafood, down the street, closed. And what good luck it was for us! The Peking duck was memorable: moist and scrumptious with the sauce, accompaniments, and steamed buns. Served with soup and an undistinguished fried rice, it was enough for four people, so we took the rest home. The wine is reasonable, the restaurant is clean, and the duck is worth going out of your way to get. Don't miss it!
