I'm not sure I can say much that others haven't said but I will go as far to say this is the best Italian food in Chicago. I go here all the time & I recently took my mother when she was in town visiting because I knew she would love it & I was right. From time to time, she will call & ask if I've been lately & have the panna cotta for her haha They greet you like you are a lifelong friend, sooo welcoming. I really like the ambiance, too. Brick walls, dim lighting, quiet, very quaint. But enough about that, let's talk food. Every time I eat here, the waiters are super friendly & it's not put on at all. Willing to kindly go through all of the specials, recommended wines, etc. But let's get to the food, the pumpkin ravioli is THE BEST PASTA I'VE EVER HAD! Homemade noodles, fresh fresh pumpkin, perfectly seasoned & a hefty portion. I couldn't get enough, I feel like I could keep eating and eating it forever. Definitely worth a go! Also, the chicken gnocchi with pesto is delicious, too. HUUUUGE portion & great from the first to last bite. As many have said, definttely sign up on the mailing list. A few weeks after you go, the chef sends you a voucher along with a personnel note which is obviously a really nice gesture. Working at Nordstrom, I always extend the letter to come back & maybe it's just me but I really appreciate things like that. Plus, who doesn't like $14 off a meal? All in all, if you haven't been, GO NOW!
