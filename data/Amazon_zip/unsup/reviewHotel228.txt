I'd absolutely stay here again! The rooms are small but the fun, bright decor makes that ok. The service was wonderful - I called down for toothpaste and within 10 min I had toth paste, a tooth brush, and an assortment of other goods. The room was clean when we got there and housekeeping kept it tidy when we asked for it and stayed out when we asked for that too. I can't say much for the food but the menu had all the standard stuff. The location is really great. Instead of feeling like you're in the middle of a city, you get a sense for what it might be like to live there - the surrounding streets turn into a farmer's market on the weekend. You're in walking distance to the red line and a short stroll to the Miracle Mile, Gold Coast, etc. Oh, and they give you free internet. woohoo!
