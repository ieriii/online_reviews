I finally got to try Violet Hour after much hype and anguish! I went with a couple of girlfriends on a Wednesday night ONLY because school was canceled and we didn't have any power (score!). I was quite surprised to see how popping it was on a Wed. night!  It was my first time there and it seemed so odd going into a windowless dark building and walking through velvet curtains... However, when we went inside it felt like a slice of prohibition. I expected to see men in zoot suits and women in flapper dresses. The decor and ambiance were absolutely fabulous. We got seated in less than 5 minutes in a nice big booth. Violet hour is a place to have great conversation and delicious drinks. I loved that the staff were not too overpowering. They came only when you needed rather than the other places that try to shove drinks down your throat and take money from your wallet. Everything in the place felt like it was planned with care and the presentation of the drinks were amazing. I was however very overwhelmed by the drink list, there were 5000000000 types of liquor you can order, which was AWESOME! I would highly suggest going to Violet Hour with some good friends as a starting off point. Don't be the third or fifth wheel though, you probably wait for eternity to get a table!
