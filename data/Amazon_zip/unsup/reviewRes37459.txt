I just had some of the worst customer service ever from a cafe. It seems that the cafe changed to full service dining a few months ago. The signs stating the change were placed close to the cash register, and not at the station where we have always ordered our breakfasts in the past. As we had already ordered by the time that we saw the signs, we were told that we had to sit in the aisle where a few tables were set up a few feet away from the dairy cooler. Instead of leisurely enjoying our meal in the pleasant dining area, we sat listening to the hum of the coolers while patrons and staff alike continuously breezed past us. As if this insult was not enough, I had to run back up to the cashier to get the toast that I had ordered. My wife subsequently had to run back to get the bacon that she ordered. My wife added that the restroom was dirty and that there were no paper towels in stock for her visit. She also noted an ammonia smell where we were 'dining', and thought the the meat section had a bad odor. As we only visit there two or three times a year, my one star rating will remain until they have another chance to redeem themselves.
