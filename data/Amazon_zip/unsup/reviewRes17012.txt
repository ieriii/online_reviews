I LOVE this place, and this is the only 5 star review I've given. Starting from when you see the place, the outside is like a speakeasy...the walls as well as the door is covered in colorful graffiti - very unique! When you walk in, there is a tiny hallway/waiting room leading to velvet curtains leading to the main area. Since this is first-come first-serve, we waited for quite a bit but it was well worth it. I love how they don't let you in if there aren't any seats available just to make some extra money while you stand around. The interior is beautiful and classy, with high-back chairs and enough room for everyone. There is also a no-cellphone policy which is great so that people can really just talk amongst each other without people yelling. Now, to get to the drinks. They are probably the best cocktails I've ever had. There is a sign on the door when you first walk in that pretty much says don't order beer, don't order "bombs", don't order Grey Goose & (blank), don't order jager. This place seems to pride itself on knowing how to make an amazing drink, not just something thrown together to get you drunk. We were given the wonderful opportunity to sit at the bar, since those were the only seats available. Our bartender was very knowledgeable and went through the menu with us. They use fresh ingredients and they make their own syrup. I have never liked gin, but I decided to give it a try since the bartender spoke so highly of their cocktails. I got the Indian Summer and the Juliet & Romeo. My friends got the Riviera and some other ones I can't remember that had egg white in it. Despite how strange it all sounds, they were seriously the best drinks I've ever had and worth the extra cost. They even spend the extra time to add the finishing touches on each of our drinks. I think I have found my favorite bar in Chicago.
