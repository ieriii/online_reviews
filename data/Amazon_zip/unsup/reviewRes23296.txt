Can't wait to go back again. I've gone here a couple times recently and have enjoyed both visits a lot. Everything I ended up ordering rocks but the veggie burrito is hands down my favorite thing I've had from them. I've had the shakes a number of times and of course the famous oatmeal shake. Now don't get me wrong the oatmeal shake was good but it wasn't as blissfully wonderful as I thought it was going to be. Good friendly services with great prices and amazing food what more could you want. Watch out because Irazu isn't open on Sunday and that is always the day I end up think about going. Be ready to deal with a crowd and bring something to drink because they are BYOB.
