not sure about dinner, but do go for brunch. their eggs specials are yummy, especially the New Orleans. Fried fish of the day topped with an egg over a yummy pool of grits, my heart hurts but my taste buds say go for it. yes, get the grits! been to dinner there twice, both meals were okay (similar sentiments from friends who've been there), nothing memorable, but could have been my choice of dish as well, I suppose. space: cute enough. service: fair to good. will be back again, not sure how soon (sooner for brunch than dinner), but it is a good addition to cuisine choices in the city.
