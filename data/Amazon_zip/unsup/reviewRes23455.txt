If you are searching for a good cultural Greek dinner in Greek Town, this place is perfect! Great overall experience from the atmosphere to the "oopah!!!" after entry of the saganaki (flaming cheese) to the salad (one of the best Greek salads I have ever had) to the lamb,chicken and baklava. We tried the sampler meal for two ($19.99 per person - minimum two people) which gave us a great taste of everything Greek without having to know what to order. Everything was so good and well worth the price.  Free vallet to boot!
