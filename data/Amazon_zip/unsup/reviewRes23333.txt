I never had no Crepes like that before, man. That was some good stuff. I had the greek crepe with the merguez sausage. Tasty stuff, the olives were flavorful and the feta was tasty. My dining mate had the Roma crepe without tomatoes, weird, but it was tasty too. I wanted a desert crepe, but my fellow diners were full. I said I could finish 75% if their little lady stomachs couldn't handle anymore food. I ordered the banana and nutella and got to eat 26% at best, the girls ate the rest. We brought two bottles of wine and after polishing off the first, we stepped out to have a smoke and gave the waitress the "we will be right back, going to smoke" sign. We came back in and the busgentlemen cleared our area. No big deal, but I would have given 5 stars except for that minor snafu.
