It was my birthday and out into the night we went. My wife, my two teenage sons and I, hungry.We were rejected in our first two attempts on places to eat, both closed on Monday. Driving around, on a rainy cold night looking for something good. So, third try, we drove over to Spacca Napoli. My wife got out of the car to check if they were open and we waited for a thumbs up...open! We walked in to Spacca Napoli and find out there is a private party going on. Sorry, not open to the public. Almost a strike three for my b-day night and then the owner queries us...After hearing our basic story he offers us a few snacks to try in the waiting area. Then, my wife adds that it is my birthday...Within five minutes we were sitting at a table with a nice bottle of red, a refreshing salad, and pizza on the way..The pizzas were fantastic, a nice margherita and a prosciutto with arugula, excellent in every respect. Nice simple salad with a basic oil and balsamic vinegar. The room in this place is very comfortable and the staff was very attentive and professional.We were so touched by the warmth and generosity of an obviously, enthusiastic man who offered us his room and his food. I love to eat good food. I also love the fellowship in a meal...We were treated warmly and made to feel at home in the middle of a large private party. It was a special and fun night. My sons both agreed that it was a great night, cool place.Big thank you to the proprietor of Spacca Napoli...Those things you did for us were great and memorable. We would reccommend this place in a heartbeat. Long story, excellent food and great atmosphere.We'll be back with droves.
