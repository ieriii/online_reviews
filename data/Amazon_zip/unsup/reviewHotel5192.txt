What a place. Excellent location right in clean downtown and within short walking distance to the "Magnificent Mile."  The view from our 32nd Floor River View room was lovely, up and down the river with their recently redone colorful waterfront. Even with glorious sunsets, and the Trump Tower (the second highest building in North America) is right across. We had lucked out. Booked at a very low rate through an international Internet travel agency, which went belly-up, and we were cancelled. But an absolutely great customer service lady, Diane Pena, went all out to get us back in with a river view at the originally confirmed price.  Professional and attentive door service. Truly appreciative of a gratuity. Very pleasant, cheerful and welcoming reception. Joelle, one of the best anywhere. Room and bathroom inviting, large, bright, and clean. Big comfortable bed. A fridge you have to ask for in advance. But...they still use old, electricity-guzzling incandescent bulbs. No one else does that any more in our extensive travels. Hey, save electricity and money.Would we come back? Of course. Soon. Altogether, in Mid-September, the hotel added to a dream vacation.
