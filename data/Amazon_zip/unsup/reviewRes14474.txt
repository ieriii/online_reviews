Outstanding. Fun. Excellent food. Friendly, truly knowledgeable staff who could really go into detail about the food and what pairs well with it. Lovely wine selection. We ordered the muscles, which were outstanding - we had to fight over who would slurp up the juice (kidding, but we used everything we could to soak up the goodness). The arctic char was perfectly prepared and truly delicious. Glenn's came highly recommended by a friend and I took an out of town guest (New Yorker who doesn't think fish should be served away from the coasts) and she RAVED about the place.  By the way, it really is a diner. You could order cereal and milk for dinner if you wished and people do. I will most certainly be back. DO make reservations, otherwise you might not get in or have a 90min wait. Every square inch of available space was occupied. We sat at the counter and it was even more fun than at a table or outside.
