i really enjoyed this place alot.. the first time i went there i was right away impressed with how beautifully everything was set up... the food tasted great and service was fabulous....i give this restaurant a high thumbs up on everything. it was perfect when i went and i cant wait for the opportunity to take my friends and family who haven't gone there!!
