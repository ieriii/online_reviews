This place STILL blows - a trap where you get lured in with the overly-exaggerated reviews on the so-called 'quality' that people believe this place is serving - I would rather go to Golden Nugget for their consistent pancakes and solid breakfast items, rather than coming here for the rudeness from the owners and his useless spawns and waitstaff. Seriously, what's up with the 4 and 5 stars? Just because a place charges a high price on a platter of crappy food and uses a piece of parsley as a garnish doesn't make the place deserving high marks! The food dishes they serve are found in any other breakfast/brunch joints in Chicago (and those places would exceed this lame excuse of an establishment), so it's nothing special - overly sweet, overly dry, and overly flavorless (except the place's favorite: sugar). Oh, yea- their juice bar is overrated - even I can combine juice and a few pieces of fruit and charge $5 for it. I HATE the hostesses - they cause you to lose your appetite and become extremely angry with everything in the world. I HATE HATE HATE this place.
