I have visited Sushi X a few times now, and I can say I am officially a fan of this modern maki maven! If you like rolls, then Sushi X is definitely worth a try. The establishment itself is very small, so do not go here with a large group, four people max. There is a very sheik contemporary feel to the space, I get the feeling I'm in a private sushi club while I'm there. The rolls are very diverse and they give you a good amount for your dollar. If you like spicy, I strongly suggest the Bamboo Thai....which is one of my favs. (Warning! If you aren't immune to wasabi/curry heat...make sure you have water on hand for this one!) Many of the rolls have new and funky mayo sauces and they offer lots of new approaches to your standard maki ingredients. Don't worry if you aren't adventurous, you will find some of the old standbys as well. Another plus, they are BYOB...so come prepared with a bottle of wine. You'll want to enjoy these tasty rolls with a nice glass of wine to compliment them.
