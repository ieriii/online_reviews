Well, this place has really gone down since I last visited in 2010. The salad bar just ok. Nothing like their competition. They brought over a tiny plate of mashed potatoes, sorry looking fried bananas, creamed spinach with only cream (no spinach), and dried out rice. Once we labored through that, we turned over our chips to indicate we wanted meat service, and waited and waited and waited. And it wasnt busy. A Monday night ! Overall, meat was good but again, but not like the other places. I just got the impression they are cutting corners a bit.We had a 2 for 1 coupon. The waiter initially told us it would be two dinners for $34.99 which seemed too good to be true. When the check came, it was $48.50 for two. It didn't irk me that much because I expected to pay $48.50 for two in the first place and not $34.99. I just knew the waiter was clueless from the start. What did IRK me, however, was that they calculated the sales tax on two dinners for $97.00 rather than $48.50 and then deducted the $48.50. They also added their own tip. I will be checking with the sales tax rules as I dont think that is correct. If so, I will report them.Anyway, i wish this place well. They are going to need it !
