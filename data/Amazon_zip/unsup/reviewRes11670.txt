I've been to the Bongo Room many times. Generally I enjoy it, but I usually only go when the rest of my party really wants to eat there. I have often wondered why, when left to my own devices, I stay away. Yesterday I finally put my finger on what bothers me about it. If you want a sweet breakfast, this place is doing exceptional things. However, if you are like me, and usually go the savory route, then the food is truly just average. Average food would be fine, if it weren't for the fact that it's 1) painfully overpriced, 2) you have to wait 45 minutes (on average) to eat, and 3) the servers always rush you out. Absolutely no lingering (even to finish your coffee) is allowed. So, go check it out if you're into dessert disguised as breakfast. But if you want delicious egg filled goodness, go somewhere better.
