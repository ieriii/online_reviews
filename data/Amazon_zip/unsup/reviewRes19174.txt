The wife and I went there the other night for dinner. Decent beer menu, food was just eh. The goat cheese fondue I thought was good but the spicy burger was just plain old terrible. No spice, old peppers, the burger meat itself just kinda fell apart. The decor is nice and the staff is friendly. I would not go back for dinner as burgers and sandwiches are not a regular thing for me. Would go back for the beer, staff and one of there beer pairings dinner just to see what its all about.
