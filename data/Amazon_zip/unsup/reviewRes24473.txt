Prepare to be treated poorly. A promise of 45 minutes turned into a dismissive "nothing is available" an hour later. Keep on driving to the Purple Pig. If getting treated like crap makes you think it's just more exclusive, then this is the place for you. To their credit, I was contacted within the week my their GM after this posting. His follow up was credible and prompt. I'm willing to give them another chance, if only to be able to make a judgment on the food!
