WOW! was the expression of the night for our dinner party of 4 as we enjoyed dinner one summer evening.. From the prompt outdoor seating, to the knowledgeable, though tad hypersensitive, waiter we were blown away. All being first comers, we had plenty of questions, but fearless to try anything that was recommended to us. The Pig's Ear With Fried Egg And Calabrian Chilies were amazing, the fried manchego w membrillo sauce, Prosciutto Bread Balls,Deviled Eggs With Arugula And Caper Berries was sensational, Wagyu Sirloin Tip with bone marrow vinaigrette and Pork Blade Steak With Anduja And Honey was phenomenal and Big Ed was, well, not big in size, but Definitely made up for it in flavor. We had a blast tasting the sampler  Purple Pig meats platter, and dessert laid the perfect finishing touch to our ORGASMIC meal with a Brioche stuffed with Ricotta cream and chocolate, and a smooth Butterscotch pudding. A lovely, aromatic and smooth spanish wine called Cote de Hayas Alto Moncayo a Tempranillo/Cabernet blend was the perfect compliment to the variety of meats and bold flavors I experienced. Take an open mind and friends that Love food and I Guarantee you will want to go back for more. We Definitely walked out satisfied beyond our imaginations.
