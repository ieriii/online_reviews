Love, love, LOVE Sultan's Market. My husband and I come here once a week for the Veggie Combo. We can both eat (and get full) for around $8. (we order an extra felafel and pita and make our own sandwiches) The service is quick, the felafel is fresh and they even gave my 18-month old daughter a free glass of milk. (Yes, a small thing, but very much appreciated!)
