I recently stayed at this hotel for four nights. I chose the hotel because of its location and I wasn't disappointed. I have stayed several places in Chicago and this was my favorite location. I checked in about 11:00 on a Sunday night and the front desk was barely helpful. I understand it was late but I felt like I was interupting them. However, the weekday staff was AWESOME! I brought my PS3 consule (yes, kind of dorky, especially if I want to enjoy the area, which i did). I wasn't able to hook the PS3 up to my TV on Sunday and the staff said there was nothing they could do....like I said, they were busy doing something else.  The next day, I asked the front desk and they were extremely accomodating. The hotel "engineer" came to my room within minutes, realized the TV wasn't compatible with a PS3, called the front desk and asked if I could move to another room. Within 20 minutes I was in a new room on the 21st floor.  The bellman brought the key to me and helped me with my bags. The engineer hooked up my PS3. They bent over backwards to make me happy. Too bad the late night weekend staff wasn't this accomodating or I would have gave a 5 star rating.
