I remember as a kid looking down at my first superdawg. It was in a box, with a pickle peeking out, covered in an ocean of French fries. I was confused. What was I supposed to do? eating your fries before your hot dog was like committing a mortal sin! The fries are the treat, the dessert -- not to be eaten with the intention of being able to dislodge your hot dog! But my father insisted that instead of digging out the dog and spilling fries everywhere to methodically eat the fries first. Can life get any better than a Superdawg stop on your way home from O'hare, cash at hand, turning down Nagle like a mad woman? NO. There is NO better reward than an ice cold root beer with a Superdawg how you like it. Gah, just thinking about it now is making me salivate for more. My father who visited this place since he had his first 57 Chevy is a diehard devout Whoopercheesie fan. My sis loves the cheesedogs. And I just like to eat. Portillo's closes at 10:30pm. Lame. Superdawg is open until at least 1am. OK, now that's what I'm talking about! A visit to Chicago is not complete until I had my damn Superdog (and my mother knows she won't hear the end of it until I do!). Oh also during the summer the greasy dudes with their sexy hotrods come out to showcase their sweet rides at night. Usually around 10-11pm or so. CASH ONLY VEGETARIANS NOT WELCOMED (Veggie dog? There ain't no veggie dog. Get over it. The menu is nearly the same as it was when it first opened.) NUCLEAR GREEN RELISH FOR EVERYONE ELSE!
