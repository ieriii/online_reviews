Hotel 71 is on the river within close proximity to the Miracle Mile and Millennium Park. I liked the modern contemporary style of the hotel and staff are very friendly and helpful. I had a river view room which provided a magnificent view of the river and skyscrapers of downtown Chicago. The room itself was large with an amazing bathroom. The shower had one of those giant shower heads directly overhead. Also the bath is separate which was perfect after a long day at the conference. I ate a couple of time in the cafe and had the Cesar Salad. It was very fresh with full slices of Parmesan cheese over the top. I would recommend staying at Hotel 71 if you are looking for a place in downtown Chicago.
