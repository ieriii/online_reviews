Mmmmm Mmmmm good. I can't really add anymore to what the other reviewers said. It's just that good. My girlfriends wanted a cheap but good dinner and pasta was craved. I've been wanting to try the Pasta Bowl for awhile so I figured this was as good a time as any. I was pleasantly surprised by everything I ate. It was all very good. I loved the cheesy garlic bread. I wanted 6 plates of that stuff. Great now I want pasta. Thanks pasta bowl.
