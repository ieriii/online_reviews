I give Garcia's a two star , i just don't feel comfortable there. Seating is very limited and the space there is crapped . I mean you seat elbow to elbow with every one in the restaurant . Good for comfort level matter to me to make it a five star restaurant. Also you can easily spend more than you bargain for getting out. Also is a busy place, so parking is limited and need to pay for so bring quarters ready. Public transportation is advise . Near western bus route and brown line one block away. You might want to visit local cold stone ice cream place 1/2 block from Garcia's. You also have a theater that isn't too expensive along the way. Is a great block of awesome restaurant . Not to mention the local star bucks.So if you go to Garcia's you'll have a lot fun looking and shopping in local business.
