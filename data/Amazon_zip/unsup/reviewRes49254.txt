I didn't come for the wine but can I still comment on the food? I will take the silence as a yes! My roommate and I came here for lunch. We didn't drink any wine, but we did have their wood grill burgers. Fries were too salty (i know wahh wahh salty fries!) but I did'nt strip the star because of a little extra sodium on my starch. One star went to the drinks that my roommate wanted but didn't get because the tap is broken. Other than being trigger happy on the salt and the lack of sodas (yes I didn't say "pop" sorry midwesterners), my experience here was fairly good. I will come back again for the wine experience because they did seem to have a wide variety.
