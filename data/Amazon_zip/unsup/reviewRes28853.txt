Disclaimer: we had to wait 3.5 hrs for a seat, so meanwhile we went do Dicks for some fried food and beet. So we showed up to eat at 9:30pm- a bit tired from a day full of walking and not hungry. But, it was still VERY good! We started with the guac and queso fundido and both were tasty! Our friend who is a guac and avocado fiend was very impressed and so was I. Joe had Poc Chuc Lamb(?) He loved it, I thought it was ok. Ben got the tacos al carbon and they were delish. My favorite though was my dish- enchiladas the mole poblano. Wowzers! This is the first time that I have "mole" that is as good or better than my moms. I can't wait to be back. Maybe to one of his other restos? FYI- we didn't mind and expected the wait.. but we'd love to try Topo or Xoco AND with an empty belly. :)
