GREAT great great Greek restaurant! A friend took me there while I was visiting the Chicago and it's a huuuuge fun restaurant. We got seated on the highest level in a room with multi-tiered seating so it was fun to watch all the tables below us and scope out the kitchen front scene, too. It was packed when we got there (I believe they don't take reservations) but the wait was reasonably--20min--and we just hung out drinking wine at the bar. Be prepared for tons of "OPA"-ing! We started off with the flaming Saganaki cheese (MUST get)--so tasty! They flambed it right in front of us so it really does come to the table all flaming with fiery excitement. That was quickly devoured by the three of us at the table. For appetizers, we also shared dolmades and the Athenian salad. I guess these were more regular, nothing too special but the portion was quite generous. For my main dish, I "created my own combo" with a gyro and a mousaka. The gyro's meat was tender and flavorful while the mousaka was satisfying to the taste buds. One friend got the Vegetarian plate which was a bit too much for one person (it was filled with tons of various beans and veggies in heavy sauces) and the other a lamb plate. I forgot exactly which one, probably the roast leg, but that was done very well. Fun place, good food, good prices.
