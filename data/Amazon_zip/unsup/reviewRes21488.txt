I grew up in Edgebrook - five minutes from Superdawg - and have been going here for almost 40 years. The service is great, food is outstanding. There is just something about that super beefy dog packed in a box and smothered in fries that is comforting. It feels like my childhood all over again.  For as many years as I've been going to SD, I always got the Superdawg - I figured why get something else.. I know I love the Superdawg! Well, today I went out on a limb and got the Whoopskidog. BEST DAMN POLISH I'VE EVER HAD - and I've had lots of them! The onion roll absolutely makes the sandwich. Just like my parents always took my brother & me to Superdawg, my husband (who is from Texas and is now an SD junkie!) have started carrying on the tradition with our own son. Even though we don't live in the immediate area anymore, my parents do. So every time we visit them, Superdawg is a must-do on our list. P.S. I hear they're opening a location in Wheeling which will be closer to where I live, but I don't know how well that will go over. When places like this with such originality start to open other locations, it's never the same. I'll probably remain true to the Chicago location and drive the 20 miles to get there rather than go to the new place. It just won't be the same in Wheeling.
