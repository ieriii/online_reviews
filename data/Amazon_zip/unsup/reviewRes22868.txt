How good is a Superdawg? I live in New York City. I have only been to Chicago 1 time for 3 days and I have eaten 12 Superdawgs. I have it to admit it wasn't just on that one trip, but when any of my friends or relatives stop in Chicago or the Midway Airport I ask them to bring me one. I was actually happy that my morning flight was delayed there so I could have a Superdawg for lunch. I know I have a sickness...and it's encased meats.
