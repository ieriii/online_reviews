Go HUNGRY, but expect a bit of a wait. Went on a Tuesday for half price burgers and got there at 6:30 - which was the perfect time to get a table for 4. The burgers are LARGE, but amazing. Served on pretzel buns, these things rock. If you like your burger juicy, order down one level - mine was ordered Medium well - definitely will go medium next time. Splurge the extra $2 and get the mac and cheese as a side. It's amazing, and maybe even better than the burger itself. Staff was great, took us awhile to get our food, but they were stopping by frequently to check on our drinks. For 4 of us the bill was $65ish - not bad for a large meal and 2ish drinks a person. It's pretty loud - so don't expect a quiet night. We'll be back - the food was superb!
