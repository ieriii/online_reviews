Alliance Bakery is hands down one of the best bakeries that I have been to in Chicago! I have been suckered a few times into going into "organic" bakeries and have despised every bite that I have had to take after finding out that they were organic. They just don't taste the same as the good ole frankenfoods that we are used to eating. The inside is small, quaint, and cozy with a touch of nostalgia. Inside decor is fairly old fashioned and walking in gives you a sense of stepping back into the 1920's. Looking around on the walls you will find the numerous awards that the owner has won in pastry contests. Nice touch! The people here are always extremely nice and the pastries are a great value. You are sure to find something that will tickle your stomach here!
