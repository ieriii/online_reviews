The beer list is great but the experience and food were bad. Four of us went to Hopleaf on Saturday July 7 at 8pm. We were seated in the new expanded area upstairs. Warning, it is extremely loud. To the point that everyone at our table had to yell to have a conversation. After placing our drink and food orders it took over an hour to get served. Our waitress "forgot" to bring the wine after being reminded twice. We had to ask for water 5 times before we received it. Our food orders took so long that tables that were seated after us had eaten and left before we got our food. In fact only three of us got our food and the fourth had to wait 15 minutes before she got hers. We had ordered the brisket (it was room-temp), steak frites (greasy), and the chicken (also greasy). The food was almost inedible. I really wanted to like Hopleaf but it's gone way down hill since the expansion.
