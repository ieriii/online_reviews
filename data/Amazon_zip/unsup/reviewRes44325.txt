This is a great place to stop by and pick up little brownies, lemon bars, raspberry oatmeal bars, etc. to bring to someone's party when you are too lazy to bake. :) Cut them in half diagonally and you have cute little triangles to share with your hungry friends! The cupcakes are nowhere as good as Sweet Mandy B's, but the other baked good hit the spot.
