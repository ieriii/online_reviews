As first-time visitors to Chicago, we wanted to enjoy some fresh and delicious seafood. We searched the Internet and chose Shaw's because of the recommendations submitted by fellow yelpers. My som ordered the steak with a crab cake. I ordered the seafood combination. The waitress warned us about the size of the side dishes so we shared the spinach and the mashed potatoes. I was not sure about the freshness of my crab cake and my grilled shrimp were overdone. The food in general was not as delicious as expected based on the price. We both disliked the key lime pie we had for dessert. We wouldn't revisit this restaurant.
