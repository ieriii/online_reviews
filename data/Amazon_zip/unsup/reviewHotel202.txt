Rooms are OK, quite roomy, but that's expected for a hotel of suites. Every night was quite and the location is great. Easy walk to lots of great restaurants. The staff was great. Front desk was one of the friendiest and happiest I have come across in awhile. Even the Starbucks on site had two friendly Baristas. Staff that kept up the meeting room was beyond excellent! They saved the meeting because the food was bad. Breakfast omelet day was OK, but everything else was poor at best. Do yourself a favor and try the food before you have a meeting here. You may want to go to Rosebud across the street for your meals. That place is good!
