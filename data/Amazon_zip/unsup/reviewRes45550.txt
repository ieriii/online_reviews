It's OK and a nice dress casual place to hang out in Lakeview, but I wouldn't say the food is amazing. I would give 4 stars for atmosphere - cozy and inviting without being too dark, though at times it is kind of loud. I wasn't impressed at all with the food. I ordered the mac n cheese and it was mostly swimming in grease, and still didn't have much flavor. My stomach was really upset for the rest of the night. However, my fiancee had one of the pot pies and loved it - so I'll definitely try something else the next time!
