I'd say that this is an average place to go for brunch sometime - traditional greasy-spoon food just with slighly higher quality. Its a bit too expensive for its own good too - you can get a meal at Earwax or Bite (around the wicker park/ukranian village area) for less money and it'll be more tasty in my opinion. The atmosphere is nice, but its not worth the extra $2-3 for an average meal. For the money I'd go some place a little nicer, or a little cheaper and enjoy it more.
