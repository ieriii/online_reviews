It's hard to really explain the way Chicago deep dish is regarded in New York. It's a bit of a curiosity to most, who may have ventured to Pizzeria Uno, but still hold on to the belief that nothing can possibly unseat the superiority of the New York thin crust. Now, I'm actually a fan of Pizzeria Uno, although I know that's not cool to say. So believe me when I tell you that I was extremely excited to sink my teeth into some deep doughy goodness. The first thing that strikes you at Gino's East is the graffiti that is covering the place. It creates a cool welcoming vibe, that makes you immediately regret not bringing spray paint along with you to lunch. But not to worry, the wait staff will happily provide you with crayons and white out so that you can properly leave your mark. When taking our order, the waiter dutifully informed us that we would be waiting 45 minutes until our food arrived, and that we might want to get an appetizer of sorts in case we got bored sniffing white out and waiting. We wound up with an unnecessary fried crap platter with Mozzarella Sticks, Calamari and Spinach Sticks. Believe you me... just wait and sniff. You don't need all that grease sitting in your stomach when the main course arrives. The pizza was good, but ultimately disappointing. The cornmeal crust left a sort of strange taste that left a bit to be desired. All this negativity did not mean I didn't enjoy my meal... because I actually did. I just wanted a bit more. The worst thing about it, is that as I was leaving, I couldn't help but think that the Pizzeria Unos that I had been to on the East Coast were better. But I recognize that Gino's East may not be the best example of Chicago deep dish. So that in itself means that I'll need to drag myself back to the Windy City to give their pizza another go. Worse things have happened.
