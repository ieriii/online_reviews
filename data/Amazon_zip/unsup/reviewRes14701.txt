I'm a nut for a good Cubano, and these guys have a good Cubano. Good Ropa Vieja, good everything. Love this place. It's a bit small, so get there early if you wanna eat inside. The walls are covered in Cuban news clippings and things of that sort, so even sitting at the counter to eat is entertaining. Grab a Materva while eating too, totally delicious.
