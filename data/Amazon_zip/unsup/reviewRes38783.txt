Updating my original review due to the outstanding customer service I received regarding an incident with an order placed via GrubHub. When I called and explained what happened, i was put on hold to speak with the manager. The manager Nicole had already contacted GrubHub to refund our money as our order was placed as pick up instead of delivery and was never picked up (turns out it was delivery and something went wrong with GrubHub). She was extremely helpful and I was very impressed she had looked into this prior to me calling. It's nice to see that there are still businesses out there who understand the importance of good customer service.   Order never delivered--pending charge on credit card for order. We placed an order through GrubHub for pizza delivery on a Friday night, 7/13, around 11:20 pm. We waited and waited, figured it was a busy night. My husband fell asleep and I continued to wait. Around 1:15 I checked their website and saw they closed at 1 am. Now it was too late to order from anywhere else and our card has a preauthorization the pizza we had ordered.  We love La Villa pizza, though are now totally disappointed by the service via GrubHub. I have never placed an order for delivery and not received it, from anywhere, in the past. La Villa needs to improve their process for reviewing orders placed on GrubHub. I'd award 4.5 stars for the food but went with 2 due to the disappointment of never getting my order.
