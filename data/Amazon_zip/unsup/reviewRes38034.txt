I know that there are dozens of pizza options in Chicago and I have tried some of them. But I keep coming back to Giordano's because it's always the best. Well at least the best in my opinion. This Giordano's is the closest to the hotel I stay in when I visit Chicago. On one trip our waiter talked us out of ordering a large pizza and said the medium would be enough food. He was right and for some reason that always makes us feel good about this place as silly as that might sound. We like to order the special pizza (sausage, mushrooms, green peppers and onions) and an antipasto salad. It's the perfect meal for four people on their first night in the Windy City.
