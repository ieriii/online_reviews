The ribs are awesome and the weekly special for the ribs is a great deal. Comes with potato and salad or soup. I always take some food home. I also like the party room. I have eaten in the bar area not noisy and I have eaten is the restaurant. I have ventured to another dish there. It is the eggplant wrapped with cheese and a marinara sauce. If not the ribs for when I am super hungry than it's the eggplant dish. The service is excellent and I say this because I do not know too many of the staff and I have never had to ask for anything twice or feel as if I have waited to long. I do miss the old bar but otherwise the food is the same. Delicious.
