It's usually around this time of the year that I make my annual visit to the Bongo Room. Whether it's a post-record fair brunch, a birthday, or a chance to meet one of my girlfriend's sisters for the first time, The Bongo Room consistently serves as a great back-drop to hang out and enjoy good food and good conversation (despite the occasional noise). If you haven't been here, understand that you're going to have to wait for a table. Luckily, when we went this past weekend, it was almost 80 degrees so waiting outside wasn't a problem at all. The service was timely and I had forgotten just how much I love their breakfast burrito. I wasn't a fan of their Bloody Mary though but that's okay. Their specials that day sounded amazing but none of us were feeling *that* adventurous... maybe next time though (and it won't be another year before we come back, TBR).
