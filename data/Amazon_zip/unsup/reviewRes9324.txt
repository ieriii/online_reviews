I've been eating at Noon O Kabab since it opened... small, intimate, brother & sister owned (brother-cook, sister-waitress). The food was delicious, the service impecable. Then the restaurant became quite popular and they renovated and it was never the same. Other Middle Eastern restaurants opened down the street and so we tried them and were quite satisfied and never went back. My brother was in town recently so we decided to give Noon O Kabab another try and I have to say I was quite disappointed. The quality of the food was very fresh, the presentation beautiful. For a weekday night the place was pretty packed although we did get seated right away for a party of 6. I was so looking forward to the kabobs and rice. I ordered the chicken kabobs, others in my party ordered the steak or lamb. While it looked delicious, the taste was very flat, no seasonings. I asked everyone in our party how their food was and basically the answer was the same. Quality was great, portions are huge. I do not think I will be going there again. I am waiting for my favorite down the street, Al-Khaymeih, to reopen instead. Or try Semiramis, a few doors down, a little different, but quite good.
