Nice looking rooftop. Poooooooor service. Our server was completely neglectful and it was a quiet evening. The calamari was totally soggy and lukewarm, and after we mentioned it, it was taken away and came back exactly the same. Possible it was taken downstairs, nuked and brought back literally 30 minutes later. For lousy calamari on a Wednesday night?  A dissapointment to me. Friends liked their sliders and the idea of a summer rooftop is nice. But seriously- if you are going to mess the dish up twice and still charge us for it....could you at least check on us once or twice? Thanks.
