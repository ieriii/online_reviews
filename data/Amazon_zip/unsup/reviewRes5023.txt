This place is delicious, and we didn't even try any pork. So a friend and I went to lunch here in the midst of a (mostly) failed day of shopping. We were seated after a brief wait at the central communal table went about ordering the roasted beets with goat cheese, the eggplant camponada on toast points smeared (smothered) in lardo (that's pig fatback, in case you're wondering), the fried olives, and the stripe bass with a celery and blood orange slaw. First of all, the fried olives were pretty meh. Fried and super salty - exactly what you expect. Luckily the beets came out at the same time, and they were a welcome and delicious lightly sweet contrast. Then came the eggplant camponada - my favorite dish. Chunks of fresh eggplant and tomatoes with pinenuts on top of toast points drowned in lardo. The amount of lardo was overwhelming in spite of being delicious - probably 'cause I was thinking about where it came from - so I scraped some of it off. The camponada itself though was oh so good. A perfect mid-afternoon, early spring burst of flavor. You must order this. The big chunky filet of stripe bass was very good in and of itself, but I wasn't a big fan of the slaw on the side. It was just neutral and there, and it's not like the fish was overly salted anyways to need that. Our tall european server was super friendly and helped us out with the menu. He enthusiastically tried to get us to order wine and get dessert, but we rebuffed his charming efforts. Only downside is that it seems understaffed as it took a while for our cards to get processed. So the food's great. Service is good if a bit harried. It's bright and tastefully decorated inside - like a sussed-up cabin in Switzerland with the lighter wood and tiles. On top of all that, we didn't wind up paying more than $20 each. Best deal on Michigan Ave.
