SOS! No, I'm not sending out a distress signal. Snort Oink Snort for the Purple Pig! I love me some swine.   Since they don't take reservations, don't be too surprised if you're told the wait for a table is over 2.5 hours on a Saturday night. Try lunch on a Monday (our master plan). :o) Everything we tasted was impeccable and well executed. What better way to build up your appetite than with a cheese trio, served with freshly toasted baguette and fig jam? What we tried: morcilla (blood sausage ground with rice, onions, and spices, which was total comfort food and made with love), jowl (flesh hanging off the jaw) with fried egg, which was super fatty and delicious, and braised pork shoulder in milk. Despite the bf's judgmental looks at my decision to take down a Sicilian Iris (essentially a chocolate chip ricotta stuffed donut), I inhaled it proudly... and got powdered sugar everywhere in the process. No shame in being a Miss Piggy!
