For my bachelorette party my awesome friends rented a suite at the James, it was amazing! They had a hookup on the TV so we could play Wii karaoke and there is a Trader Joe's right accross the street which was perfect for snack/alcohol runs. I love the modern style and furnishings. Our room had a seperate living room area and bar. The bathroom was huge and we all fought over the Kiehl's bath products. I swear everyone who works here is super good looking. We had room service for breakfast the next morning and it was delicious. I HIGHLY recommend booking the James. I am sure we got a little loud and they never complained. Just writing this review makes me want to have another party there!
