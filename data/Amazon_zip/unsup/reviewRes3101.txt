This establishment has it going on. I am not one who eats fried chicken regularly unless I have a craving for it. A bad one at that. I was really impressed with the size of the wings. Not only that because they come "whole" as in all three parts of the wing connected. Not cut up as some places sell them. I have been back twice and will definitely be going back. Good "cheat" food for me at least once a week. Tah-Dah!!!
