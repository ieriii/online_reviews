If you can make it to Mercat for Restaurant Week, do it. They grill their seafood perfectly (calamari a la planxa, and the grilled octopus), allowing the flavor of the food to speak for itself. They are incredibly accommodating (we were in a bit of a rush). All I can think is yum, yum, yum, and if you can make it during restaurant week, then your wallet will be singing too.
