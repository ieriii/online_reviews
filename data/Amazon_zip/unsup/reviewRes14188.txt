BEST WINGS EVER!!! I dream of these wings at night. Really... my mouth is salivating just thinking about them now. Applewood smoked wings... Homer Simpson drool starting now... I know this place is a brewery, but the food is really the centerpiece here. Burgers... great. A simple chicken sandwich (mustard herb) was surprisingly flavorful. The blue cheese potato salad is really rich and well, fatty as hell, but delicious and compliments the wings well (Oooo the wings...). RBC offers a number of different flatbread pizzas, a decent amount of vegetarian options. From day one, RBC has been packed. Cool atmosphere, great food, good beer. And most importantly, wings that are walking distance from house and ummm... delicious.
