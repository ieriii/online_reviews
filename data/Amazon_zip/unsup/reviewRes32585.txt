Writing this review a few weeks after the event wasn't the best idea huh... It's okay, I can't say its any better or worse than Ethopian Diamond other than inside it is much nicer than the latter. This place get's busy too, so it seems the servers get a little preoccupied or behind, because my friend and I waited on our food for a while. The food was decent, I like how they let you pick your dishes for the platter, I don't think ED allows for that. Overall good, but my one little complaint, the food could have been much warmer, it got cold quickly.
