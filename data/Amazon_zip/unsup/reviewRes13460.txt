Pretty good. Came here after the Southside parade, so I wasn't exactly sober... But it hit the spot. I got a grilled cheese with tomato and it came with a potato pancake? I had no idea what that was, but it was delicious! Cozy, cute, big menu. I sort of wish I had tried the fish, but I wasn't in the mood. Perhaps another time. Service was friendly, food was good, prices were reasonable. A solid diner!
