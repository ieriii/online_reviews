By far the best pizza that is not Malnati's or Uno, for obvious reasons. The pure idea that pequods has awesome, amazing pizza with huge chunks of meat and vegetables and cheese that oozes out says tons. AND they are open till 2 am everyday of the week, which means when you get off work and are starving or you get out of the bar and are starving, you can call hand have them deliver to you!! It may take an hour for the delivery but its well worth it. Their carmelized deep dish crust is absolutely to die for. Definetly cell phone worthy
