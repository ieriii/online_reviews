Beignets to start brunch? Oh yeah. This place was so charming and cozy - and it totally reminded me of New Orleans, I loved it! Friendly service and non traditional brunch items - total plus. I had the migas, which was oozing with tons of flavor. My friend has the andouille sausage, which was seasoned to perfection! The hubby had catfish and grits and said he loved it. We ended the meal with an order of moon pie. The best part? The rice krispies and bacon bits on the side which was like a party in my mouth. I want to come back for dinner and try some southern comfort food!
