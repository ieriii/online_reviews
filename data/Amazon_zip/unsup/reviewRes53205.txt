After the owner was gracious enough to reach out to me on Yelp and offer his sincerest apologies for my previous less than stellar experience , I vowed to make another visit. Came in on a Friday night and the place was slammed, but we were lucky enough to be seated right away. The servers were nice enough. My sister ordered a pop which was served right away and I ordered a water which took 20 minutes so not off to the best start but I was slammed so I let it go. I ordered the stuffed tostones as an appetizer. They were filled with a red salsa and shrimp. Overall they weren't great but pretty good. Moved on to my Guarijito which seemed to be a Cuban take on the Jibarito. I must admit it was really good. The plantains were hot and crisp, the steak was lean and tender, and the marinade they use is tasty and delicious. Tried my sister's ropa vieja sandwich and it was only mediocre. The portion wasnt too generous but since it was the end of the night the meat was probably pre-made earlier in the day, no surprise there. When the check came, I was shocked since we were charged almost double for the sandwiches than was indicated on the menu. When I asked the server, she stated that the lunch prices are on the menu. Which is fine and dandy, but on the menu there wasn't a different price for the dinner hours. It would just make more sense if the dinner prices were actually indicated on the menu. Overall as far as the food goes it really is A-Ok. The servers are courteous, and its a clean establishment. Will definitely be back for a guarijito, even if the rest of the menu was bad i'd still come back for it. That sandwich alone is worth a visit to 90 miles, but it seems like off peak hours earlier in the day would make this place much more enjoyable.
