Dearest Doug, You have some of the best hot dogs and sausages in town, but waiting 2 hours for a hot dog is insane. On the plus side, when I want to eat at your restaurant and see the block long line, my rage forces me to keep driving/riding onward and try some place new. So I am writing you to request that you open 3 other restaurants on the other 3 corners, so that the crowds can be handled in a timely fashion. I have always wondered if you would frown upon me getting my order to go and selling it to the highest bidder outside? Thank you for your time, Concerned Sausage Lover
