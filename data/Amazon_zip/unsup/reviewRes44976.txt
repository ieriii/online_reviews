My fiance and I came upon this place after a long and weary trek to the top of the Sears (er, I guess I mean Willis) Tower. I very much appreciated they were there and open, since the next best options seemed to be McDonald's. I also appreciated that they make it clear it's going to take a long time to get your pizza, so we ordered the spinach artichoke dip and devoured it while waiting for the pizza. The dip was good, though I'm not sure it was stellar - although I was hungry so it was fantastic! Hmm, the pizza. We ordered the stuffed pizza with fresh tomatoes and pepperoni, but really they sell a cheesy-stuffed cheese pizza - there were about 4 slices of tomato on top of the pizza and I found 2 pieces of pepperoni in my slice, so you might as well just order the cheese pizza. It's stuffed with good mozzarella, so that was good, but without the cheese the crust didn't have much flavor - it kind of reminded me of a saltine cracker. I found the food to be decent, and much appreciated after a long day of being a tourist, but if Chicago doesn't have a better pizza place I'd be sorely disappointed.
