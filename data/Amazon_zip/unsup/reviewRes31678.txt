I visited Nana for the first time this morning and was greeted by cheerful and sophisticated decor, a super-friendly staff and served fresh organic beet, apple carrot juice and then had the best wheatgrass I've tasted in Chicago. My companions ordered really yummy looking dishes (I'm allergic to eggs so I couldn't try most of the breakfast dishes) but my spinach beet salad was good. I was thrilled that when I asked for a to-go container and it wasn't styrofoam! That's rare in a city like Chicago. All in all, I'm impressed with the family-owned vibe, you can tell these people really care: about the food, about their neighborhood and about the Earth.
