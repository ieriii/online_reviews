I love this place. I have been eating here when it first opened and nobody heard of them. Now sometimes its hard to get on the door. The subs are big for the money they charge and the pizza is good. My only complaint is sometimes the pasta sauce is a little too spicy for my taste. Other then that keep up the good work!!!
