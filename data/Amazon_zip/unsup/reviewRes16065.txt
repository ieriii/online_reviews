I never would have considered myself much of a "hype" girl. I don't race to openings unless I'm already a fan of the investors or chef. At the risk of sounding reeeally pretentious, I always figure that listening to mass opinion will land me at Moe's or le Passage. Nothing against it if its your thing, but never been mine. In Violet Hour's case, I have to say that it exceeded even the loftiest expectations set. From the speakeasy/Wonderland quality to the cell phone policy to the particularly well-appointed cocktails (REAL cocktails), I can't wait to go back. That's not an overstatement. The bartenders are pros that could have hopped onstage with the Decemberists without giving anyone pause. I had the Daisy 17 and a whiskey lemonade concocted just for me by a bartender with thick chops. I caught up with some good friends in town without having to raise our voices. Bottom line: I don't know if I've felt ambiance like this in a Chicago bar before and now I'm addicted. And happily part of the hype.
