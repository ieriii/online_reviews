I know everyone loves this place and when we tried the 9 course menu, the food was between spectacular and spectacularly disgusting. Specifically, the cheese course was inedible. I actually had to spit it out. The quail egg in ravioli was incredible, as were two other dishes, a risotto and a sunchoke soup. The atmosphere was non-existent. It really is a bit of a dive and the service was rushed and nothing like you would get from other restaurants that serve this quality food. Overall, I wish them much success, but if I am going to spend $105 per person (without drinks), I suggest Spiaggia or Crofton on Wells. If you want to break the bank and be treated like royalty go to Alinea. I think that is the molecular gastronomy that Schwa is most like, but I'd give them a B to Alinea's A+. I'm glad I went once, but I won't be running back. And since it took several phone calls and several months for them to call me back I guess they won't be missing me either.
