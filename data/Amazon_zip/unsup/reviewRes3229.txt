Be still my hungry heart. Crisp has me fixated and wanting more already. The first thing that struck me was the kindness of the people behind the hectic and crowded counter. They answered all my newbie neurotic questions and were really helpful-- neither overbearing nor too lax. That's really impressive for such a small, crowded place with a long waiting line. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the half chicken with some amazing sauce. I don't even remember what sauce it was but it was sweet and slightly tangy with some sesame seeds on top. One bite of that chicken and he was smitten. By the time he finished, it was all over his face and fingers and he couldn't be happier. The french fries were crunchy and salty and hit that naughty desire spot for greasy goodness. My sandwich had mushrooms and onions and glorious cheese. I'm in love. Can't wait to go back and try some more Crisp!!!
