Pizza gets the stars. It's so good that it makes blocks out the actual restaurant. I mean... it's like sports TV and frat/Lincoln Park rock. I mean kudos to you if you like that kind of stuff. It's just not me. I do like the pizza. It probably started out as a blob of dough slapped unto a baking tray, with just enough sauce and cheese. Toss in some sausage and dunk it in what seems to be a brick oven. It's thin crust goodness. Sometimes when I walk by the place in the summertime I want to yell, "Duude! FOOOTBALL!! SUPERBOWWWL!! GO TIMBER-WHATEVER!! BEEEEEEEEEEER!! HAEY BABY! AOOOWW!! GO ALPHA SIGMA SIGMA!! GO NORTHWESTERNINDIANAILLINIBEARSMICHIGAN!!!" ...whatever. I would probably get my ass kicked for that... and probably for wearing funny colored Japanese sneakers.
