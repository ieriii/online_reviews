This place was like a party in my mouth. I had no idea that i could have Belgium chocolate and ice cream for breakfast! It was absolutely the best food I've ever had. Even the coffee was great, and the place itself was very relaxed. The service is a little bit slow, but I don't think this is a place you should come if you are in a hurry. They are very friendly and the owner himself often comes around to table to see how you enjoyed the food. I highly recommend!
