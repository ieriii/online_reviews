It was a busy Sunday, but my friend and I ended up finding seats at the bar immediately to avoid the 1-hour wait. I had the duck egg hash and my friend ordered the whole hog crepinette. My duck egg hash was actually a bit bland. The only things that had flavor were the tiny, sparse pieces of duck in there. I had to pretty much bury the thing in hot sauce to extract some flavor from it. I had a bite of my friend's crepinette. While I admit the hog was very tender and extremely full of flavor, maybe it was just a bit too sweet for my taste. I like savory things for breakfast, and this dish pushed the limit with its strong hints of maple. L&E is definitely a decent place with an extensive alcohol menu. The brunch was a bit lackluster IMO, but maybe I'll try dinner next time and hope I come out amazed.
