Talk about an inflated place to go! Not only are the prices really high, but the food is mediocre and not worth it. Our hostess advised us (and the menu indicated) the portions were really big, but we found our steaks to be pretty small. I ordered the $43 rib-eye and only got a few bites of the really good stuff; the rest was pure fat. A really good steak never has to be drowned in butter-it was overwhelming! The kids both got puny steak pieces and a pile of fries, and the price was $26! Not worth it in any sense of the word. Go to Morton's instead.
