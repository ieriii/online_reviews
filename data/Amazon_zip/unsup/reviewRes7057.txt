OMG! This place is awesome! I went here with my girlfriend on a Saturday and were lucky to get a table. Our server was Sarah and she was terrific. She was quick to answer any questions we had and was fast with the drinks. Always a plus. Lol. The food was so good. Pork was super tender and the different sauces were great. I tried fried green tomatoes for the first time and they were really good. We stayed until midnight and it was packed the whole time so they must know what they are doing. If you like BBQ then you want to check this place out!
