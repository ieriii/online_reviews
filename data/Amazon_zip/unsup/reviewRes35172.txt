I had a really great time at Shaw's. First the place is very retro, stylish. Reminds me of a cross between a seafood market and blues club. They had a great blues band playing that was very entertaining on the Oyster Bar side. Tried some of the oyster shooters. Clever and playful, maybe a bit too briny for my taste. The oyster's rockefeller where actually light and tasty (for oyster's rockefeller). I really enjoyed them. I had the crab cake, scallop and shrimp combo. Great flavors and just the right portion size.  Really had a fun time. It is classy without being stuffy.
