My husband is a "meat and potatoes" man. Literally, his atoms are comprised mostly of meat and a variation on potatoes, so I make sure to take him to a steak place every birthday and special occasion and review it on his behalf.  Kinzie Chop House is one of his favorites. It's a subdued, no hype, classic Chicago steakhouse where the spotlight is where it should be - on the steak. He loved his Delmonico and could not manage any articulation beyond the satisfied grunts that were squeezed out between bites. As an aside - I watched a skinny guy at a table nearby us devour an entire 48 oz. porterhouse (which is supposed to feed FOUR people) BY HIMSELF!! I kept waiting for him to share but he NEVER DID!!!
