Like the idea of stuffing your face with meat until you can't quite breathe correctly? Then Brazzaz is the place for you! While I haven't experienced Fogo or TdB, I am just fine with sticking to Brazzaz. The salad bar is great, and also varies from time to time which is good if you're a fat cat who can stop into this place as often as I'd like to. All of the meats are great, but given the choice I usually go with a beef over pork or sausage so I can't totally vouch there. Also, lunch is a steal here, $20 or 25 but be warned, no shrimp at that price! The sides of mashed potatoes and fried plantains, along with hot off the grill pineapple are always very distracting when I'm trying to set a new record for meat intake. Still, I suggest you leave the vegetarians at home. My girlfriend loves it here as well, so I'm sure we'll be back. (Sooner rather than later if I can find oneof those coupons everyone on here seems to be talking about!)
