Downgrade from 5 stars. We come here every time we come to Chicago, starting on the night of our engagement 4 years ago. We tried the broth this time instead of the oil since we always come home smelling like it. You need to cook for twice as long, to make sure we didnt overcook we used our cell phone timers. It was good except I tried most of the food without sauces and realized the lobster quality was very poor, probably a warm water lobster. For the price and portion they should be able to afford quality lobster that you don't need to cover in sauce. The recommended time in lobster was 4 minutes, tough lobster, so i tried cooking it for 3,2,1 minutes. Nope, still tasted awful The potatoes also were awful unless you dipped em in sauce. Guess the sauces are a good cover for poor quality. I don't eat meat so I don't know how the quality is.nDowngrade from 5 stars. Service 5 stars.
