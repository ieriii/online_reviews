Clean, nice hotel. Way more than I expect from a Hampton Inn. But beware, IT IS SO LOUD!!!. They even give ear-plugs in the hallways to help with the noise. There is a police/fire-station nearby and the sirens blare all night long. I couldn't take the noise and had to use the ear-plugs. Other than that, the experience was great.
