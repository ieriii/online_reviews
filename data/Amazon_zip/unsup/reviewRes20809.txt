I will (and do) drive from my own restaurant job in Evanston down to Xoco at the peak of afternoon rush hour just to get my fix. The food is consistently great, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and it's pleasant to know that sophisticated flavors are accessible in an unpretentious way. YAY XOCO.
