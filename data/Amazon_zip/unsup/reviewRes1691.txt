This place is awesome and totally worth the wait. We stood in line for about 45 minutes (luckily I think this is a shorter wait than usual) and got it just in time before the close. We ordered up two dogs duck fat fries, and drinks. Heavenly! The foie gras and duck sausage dog was totally worth the $8 or whatever it cost. Great texture. The duck fat fries were nice and crispy with a lot of flavor. Reminds me a bit of In-n-Out fries in terms of 'freshness' but the crispy part really takes it to the next level.  If we ever make it back out to Chicago, we'll definitely have to make time to stop by Hot Doug's again. There's a reason why this place is listed as the number one hot dog joint in the nation. I'd have to agree with that sentiment.
