I've been here a few times and they've been consistently good. It's slightly more expensive than the usual Thai places in Lincoln Square but I like having the option of ordering some sushi rolls as well.  Crab rangoons - Very good but not mind blowing as a lot of reviews seem to make it. It's mostly just cream cheese but has a nice thin wrapper unlike a lot of other places. Tasty though Soft shell crab appetizer - Just ok. They only give you one crab for the order. I prefer the ones from Silver Seafood instead. Chicken gyoza - Very tasty as well Spicy blue crab roll - Very good and made with real crab unlike the crab stick or imitation crab that a lot of places use. Cape Cod roll - Real crab with avocado and cucumber. Tasty but paled in comparison to the Spicy roll. Indie Signature curry - This is one of my fav dishes to order here. It's a yellow curry with potatoes and squash. Delish! Chicken broccoli/peapod - Very bland. Kind of a dissapointing dish. Not much flavor at all. Shrimp Pad See Ew - Also very tasty. Sometimes it has a little too much soy sauce though and is a bit salty. Thai custard - Also very good, but a bit small as far as potions go. Mochi w/ green tea ice cream - Tried once and didn't really care for the rice coating. The ice cream was good though. Will be back soon!
