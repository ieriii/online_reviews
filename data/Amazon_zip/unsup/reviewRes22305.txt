I ate here during a recent trip to Chicago, and it was truly the best Greek food I have ever tasted. I had a great experience eating here with my friends and I can't wait to come back again. The service was also wonderful and I felt like they truly cared about each customer. It was busy in there (always a good sign) but we never had to wait long for anything. Highly recommend!
