Great Mexican food. Absolutely great. And the service was quick and very friendly - she just kept those Coronas and the guacamole coming! Not too pricey. The only thing I would say is that there isn't a whole lot of space. Reservations are definitely necessary because there aren't very many tables. I went with a group of 7 or 8 and we were sitting right against the bar, pressed pretty tight up against each other. But that's my only complaint. Otherwise its just fabulous!
