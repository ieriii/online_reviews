I have been going to "Sab's" for years.................and every time there, I am never let down! Eddie and Enzo are great.........very friendly and always making sure everything is ok! They know me and my family.......and always take care of us!  Let's just say you get so much food!! From complimentary pizza bread then bruschetta! Oh, and of course.....fresh warm bread!!! You then get your salad and amazing minestrone soup! I then usually get my order...........sometimes pasta, sometimes a steak....or if you are on a date....try the "Steak Diane". They prepare it right in front of you! A very good choice!  After dinner.........we always get a complimentary fruit plate.  If you do not walk out of there stuffed.....it's your own fault!!! Sabatino's is a great place for friends to gather for a great meal......and always is a great "date" spot! They have nice cubby booths in the walls which make taking a date a little more romantic! The wait staff and help are always very knowledgeable and helpful with the orders. A key for me is being good on the water and bread refills. Oh they are right on top of that here! I highly suggest Sab's.........great food, great service and great prices!!! ! You don't have to deal with the downtown traffic and nonsense for a good Italian meal!  Trust me, if this place was downtown.......and i am glad it's not...it would be a bigger hit than it is now.  I have been coming to Sabatino's for many year and will still be coming back for many more!!
