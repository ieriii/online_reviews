Working nearby this restaurant, we order frequently from here. The lunch special is such a good deal and includes a lot of food. Delivery is very prompt, and we usually put in a large order and it is correct. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. I always get the Pad Thai and it is always satisfying and delicious. I enjoy giving them business.
