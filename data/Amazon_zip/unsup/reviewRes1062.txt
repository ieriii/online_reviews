I finally made my way to Hot Doug's! I've been staring at all these pictures of delicious gourmet hot dogs FOREVER. Since I had last week off, this was one of my first picks for lunch. Thank god I decided to stop by on a weekday. Our wait was less than 15 minutes and we were starving! The duck and foie gras hot dog was ... you know what, I can't even express in words right now how much I loved it. It was just "mmmm ..." I seriously thought about going back and buying a couple more just for dinner. I should have (dammit!). I just wish I had the stomach (and wallet) to sample them all. Doug was really awesome too. He takes all the orders himself. And in case you missed it in other reviews, it's cash only here!
