My first review ever on Yelp. This place was so great that it motivated me to create a Yelp account. My wife and I are foodies and we've been to all the best Chicago spots. This stacks up with them all without being stuffy. The food was top notch, service was excellent and it's a fun atmosphere. Dale spoke with every person in the place. Just a wonderful experience. ENJOY IT NOW BEFORE EVERYONE FINDS OUT ABOUT IT!
