4 stars for the food, two stars for the service. Came here with my family on Christmas Eve and was not too thrilled with the dinner.  First of all, we were seated in the very first table upon entering the dining room which SUCKED. It was freezing and dark in the room and we had to yell over the stupid bar singer belting out Katy Perry and Lady Gaga.  We also had to wait like twenty minutes to even be acknowledged by our douchebag waiter. When he finally came over and heard we had changed our mind on the seafood tower ($35 a person? no thanks), he seemed to completely loose interest in us. Screw him, I thought.  FOOD: Bread basket: good pretzel rolls Wedge salad-ehh, just okay Bone-in ribeye-delicious Bone-in filet-even better Gorgonzola mac n' cheese-rich rich rich but awesome Crab gnocci-ahmmazing flufly pillows Garlic mashed potatoes-strong garlic flavor, nothing outrageous **I would like to point out how rude our server was though. My sister ordered a caeser salad and asked for the dressing on the side...which, to me, does not seem like too crazy of a request. It came out wrong so we sent it back. So the waiter (with long hair) came out and goes, "I'm so sorry about that, I'm going to go throw myself in front of a bus now. But if you don't want me to know, I won't." Umm. okay? Try to be a little more insincere buddy. It's not like she made a big deal about it, and kindly asked to have it fixed. It should not have messed up in the first place. We pay how much for a stupid salad, get it right. The guy pretty much ignored us the whole night except for when he took our order. Considering we were seated in the smackdab middle of the room, it was really obnoixous how everyone kept walking past us.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but overall, I'd say this was a let-down.
