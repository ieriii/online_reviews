This supper club features oversize black and white photos of days when going to a supper club meant dressing up. As I looked around the room of folks wearing old cords and wool sweaters, the irony was not lost on me. It wasn't a bad meal but there is nothing wanting me to come back. The ambiance did nothing for me. I came here before the new Roman Zaslonov exhibit. I chose this place based on locale as well as a gift certificate for a free spinach artichoke fondue from some goodie bag. I placed the order for the fondue as soon as the waitress brought over the menus. It was good although we had finished it before she was able to take the rest of our order. My husband, who was famished, was in luck because they brought over a chunk of bread made with onions. He had it all to himself since I really don't like onions. The chopped salad, which we split, was average. I judge chopped salad by the Palamino standard (I've yet to have one better). I doubt that I will go back unless someone else is buying.
