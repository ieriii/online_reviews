I've been to Indie innumerable times in the past three years (dine-in, take-out and delivery) and, like other reviewers, I am always pleased to find a variety of dishes to choose from. Take a group of friends here and everyone is sure to find something crave-worthy. Delivery is fast and reasonably priced, if you don't feel like braving the snow. However, I do feel that, having eaten here so much, I can tell you that their sushi is not always consistent. It's either delicious, fresh, fabulously plated. Or it's--well--not. Three times now, I have had spicy tuna rolls that were inedible; last time, I actually had to send them back because the smell and taste was just off. And I KNOW what their spicy tuna is supposed to taste like, having had it at its best.  My stomach felt a little queasy just 15 minutes after I started my meal. I can't give you reasons why, and I don't want to discourage business for this nice place, but I would say that if you taste something off, send it back. The waitress was very accommodating, took the roll in question off my bill without a moment's disagreement, and even gave me a free miso soup "to settle [my] stomach." So, my heart is with Indie, but I'm going to only order sushi at their restaurant and not risk a night in with disappointing delivery.
