I live just a few blocks away from Nana, and before they opened I alway curious what will they do there -- and now I love the fact that I live close to them ! Last Friday me and my friends ( who came from another state to visit me ) had a not so nice brunch from Nightwood, I decided to treat my friend to a better breakfast place, and it was NANA .I really like their decor, their dining room arranged to be sch a nice homely environment , with big windows and lot of sunlights ,it gives you a morning boost right the way . I had learn from my past experience from NANA that their potions are somewhat too big for me , so I ordered only the side dishes -- Smash Squash -- YUMMY !! IT's so refreshing , with a hint of pumpkin and spices ! Side Salad -- I love the dressing , and the greens are excellent ! Sunshine up eggs and toast -- nothing special , but I like their mixed berries jam ! My friend ordered the cheeseburger ( he ordered the same thing from Nightwood but the meat was way too raw ) , this time at NANA, it was perfect ! The only thing I don't like about NANA is their staffs , they barely talk to you , they also charge way too much for a small glass of juice , $4 for a small size orange juice ? I can buy a 1-liter size fresh squeeze OJ from San Jose down the block .
