What's open on New Year's Day....Chinese restaurants. period. Having said that, a friend of ours drove us around town looking for her favorite food spots that were open, of all the places we drove to, Sun Wah's was the only place open that we found. We came in around 8PM and it was the second time that day that our entire group had eaten Chinese food. Our friend raved about the Peking Duck dinner. For $30 they give you a roasted duck, which is delicately carved table side, buns, fried rice, and soup. Not a bad deal. Since the place was super packed, they informed us that we would not get our duck until 9:15ish. After waiting a bit, it finally arrived. It was juicy, succulent, crispy. Everything anyone could ever want in Peking duck.
