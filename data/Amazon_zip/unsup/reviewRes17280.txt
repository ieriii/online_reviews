Real rating is 3.5 so I rounded up. Anyway, the place looks fantastic. Unfortunately, we did not get a table in the main room, but in a side room behind the bar. I guess we didn't look cool enough. Service was solid. Mojito's were good but weak. Caipirihna was way better. We started with the ropa vieja app which was fantastic and huge. And the trio of ceviches(shrimp, tuna, kona) and loved it. Moving on, the Churassco was cooked to perfection and had a great smokey flavor. I had the Ono special which had very little Latin flair to it aside from the olives in an attempt at vera cruz style. Anyway it was a very nice piece of fish. What really annoyed me is the your table isn't ready, please wait at the bar game and drop $10/drink game they played on everyone. Our reservation was at 6:30 and I saw that our table was ready and our watier was not busy. Very mixed crowd and overall I felt the apps were a great bargain, but the entrees and drinks overpriced. I'd go back though.
