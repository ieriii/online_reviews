Hey, Rob L., I thought I was special! We got Prosecco, too. My boyfriend and I ducked into Spacca Napoli one snowy night just before New Year's. The owners were planning to close up shop about an hour after we left; they chatted with numerous repeat customers about their plans to visit Florida for a week or so. We ordered the Funghi e Salsiccia and, after seeing the size of the boxes coming out, decided on a second, the Prosciutto e Rucola. Well, we demolished those. DESTROYED them. The crust on both was lovely -- chewy, subtly flavored so it wouldn't overpower the toppings -- though the middle of the FeS was soggy and overly floppy because of the sauce, cheese and toppings weighing it down. That said, the PeR was a heavenly visit from a round, doughy angel. It was so simple but absolutely perfect. The prosciutto was tissue-thin, and the arugula was still cool and fresh when we bit into it. Even reheated three days later, I swooned into a state of total bliss. Yes. That. Good.
