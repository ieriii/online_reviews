There aren't enough words of praise to properly describe our experience at Zed451. From the moment we walked in the door and were greeted warmly and with an acknowledgement of my husband's birthday, to the end of the evening several hours later when we walked out in a happy haze, we had an amazing time. The level of communication in the staff made our experience feel personal and heartfelt. The Harvest tables were filled with deliciously creative salads, delightfully flavorful cheeses, succulent meats, and superbly savory soups. The meats, served by the chefs that created them, were cooked to perfection. The wine selection was perfect-even having a favorite of ours that is not widely available. It will be a pleasure to go back again.
