My lady and I went there the other night fro some drinks, and appetizers etc... It was a good experience, although I definitely went home a little sick from the greasy food.4-stars: 1 for service (friendly and attentive), 1 for amazing ambiance (very classy and diverse), 1 star for great beer on draft and tasty, and 1 because I enjoyed my experience. I would defiantly try their calamari (nicely plated), however -1 stars because their burgers were too greasy for me (and I split it with my date). Maybe it was just personal preference, but my date was as well. However Ill defiantly be coming back for another beer sometime or dessert, but I am not sure about dinner. Overall nice place.
