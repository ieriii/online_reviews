Okay, so I visited this place almost a year ago and forgot to write the review along with other places in Chicago I visited. So, here it is... After waiting in the long line that wrapped around the block, we ordered 3 hot dogs and the duck fat fries. The Keira Knightly, The Dog and the Fois Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli. It wasn't really fois gras, but in mousse form like a pate. Anyway, the dogs were delicious and worth the wait and experience! having the fois gras dog by itself would be too overwhelming, so make sure that you can take bites off of another dog to change up the taste a bit. The duck fat fries with 3 dogs were too much. We couldn't even eat half of the fries so it mostly went to waste. We were so stuffed that we couldn't even taste the duck fat in the fries after chomping away at the hot dogs (mind you... we waited well over an hour!) If it were just me and one other person, I would skip fries all together and order 3 dogs! or just share 2 dogs and order some fries. I could've done without the duck fat ones and just ordered the regular...
