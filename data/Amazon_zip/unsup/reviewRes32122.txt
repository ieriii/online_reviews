Wow. An ol' time standby favorite, Chicago Diner didn't let us down today. Service was hoppin' tonight, so the wait (around 5pm, Saturday night) was about 15 minutes. No worry. The staff was so friendly. I opted for the Spicy Black Bean Burger and Hazelnut hot chocolate. My husband ordered the Enchiladas, oat stout and we shared the new pizza appetizer. Our food was hot, delicious and quick. We barley talked during our meal. It was THAT good. We opted for dessert. Yes, dessert after that hella good meal. Being adventurous, I went for a non-chocolate dessert: Strawberry Chantilly Cake for 2. More like for 4. I posted a picture for your enjoyment. Never disappoints.
