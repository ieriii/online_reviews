I'm not ever going back to this place. It's overpriced for what it offers. It attempts to be sophisticated but is quite pathetic. The decor is lame - it's dark so you don't see shoddy furniture and dilapidated space. Although the pasta was good (but you have to be really pathetic to screw up pasta), the only appealing thing is the outdoor seating, but too is nothing special. If you must try this place and were lured in by the $20 off coupon, do NOT present any coupons until the end. As a respectful consumer, I followed the request stated to present to my server upon ordering. Our server was shady the moment that we informed him of our coupon. If you're participating or advertising through coupons to attract customers, you should not act like a jerk. We ordered our entrees and he asked us if we'd like to have soup or salad and we told him: salad. When the bill came, he charged us for 10 bucks a salad. If you're going to charge for salad, you should ask in a way that informs that it's ADDITIONAL. Anyway, we pay the bill told him that he didn't inform us or mention that the salads were additional. He lamely says, "oh sorry". He brings back tiramisu from the "chef" and apologizes for the mistake and tells us everything is a la carte on the menu, so we know for next time. There won't be a next time. I appreciate that he made some effort, but because he's inept at service does not mean that I should pay for it.
