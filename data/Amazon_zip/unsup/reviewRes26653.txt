Note that I gave this place 5 stars, a rare- very rare occasion for me. Keep in mind that those 5 stars are strictly rating the pizza and the pizza alone. This review is a one time only deal and here's why. If you go into the place to eat (which I'm NOT recommending) sit wherever you can squeeze in, don't ask a lot of questions, keep your head down and don't make a lot of eye contact. The ambiance and staff are a suck fest. There I said it. But the pizza is sooo good! The deep dish is out of this world. Talk about an indulgence. The dough is not just dough it's like buttery, crispy, yet slightly chewy dough heaven. The sauce, garlicky, basily, ripe tomato and perfectly seasoned amazing. Toppings and cheese all pile on nicely, all together it's like magic in your mouth. Then you get to the crust. Which has caramelized cheese baked on it. O.M.G.- I mean it, that's the first thing you'll say after you've bitten into what might be your own personal island of pizza paradise! ! If you're in their delivery area, lucky you. Otherwise take it to go. It'll be the most expensive (not like a $100 bucks or anything, but a loaded medium deep dish is like $35 dollars, wtf?), but the most tasty deep dish you will ever have, I promise.
