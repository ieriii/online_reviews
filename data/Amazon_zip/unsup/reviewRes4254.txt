This place is awesome. I've been here right when they opened (total ghost town. It was kinda cool actually) and once when they had a live band and dancing. Practically everyone was dressed up which was a nice touch. The drinks are strong, the music is great, the decor and history of this place is reason enough to visit. Besides, this is where Johnny Depp hung out in Chicago. Why wouldn't you want to go?? Not to mention the underground tunnel system....my kinda place.
