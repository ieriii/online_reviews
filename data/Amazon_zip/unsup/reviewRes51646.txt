I love Garcia's. The Free chips with 2 kinds of Salsa. The burritos suazo (with Cheese) is as big as your head! the tostadas are great too. A little pricier but the steak in the burritos are good. Big portions, other Mexican restaurants may have Little better taste but for large good tasting portions Garcia's can not be beat.
