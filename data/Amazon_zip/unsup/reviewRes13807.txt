Glenn's is a wonderful spot to get a bite to eat anytime of the day...they serve breakfast all day long, but their weekend breakfast specials are really something to check out! Dinner time = seafood chalkboard specials = YUMMY!! (they have a whole menu of other options as well) They have items you most definitely can not find anywhere else. Not to mention the super popular all you can eat king crab legs every Tuesday night. Major win! Whether you want something traditional or something different, they have something for everybody! Great place for kids with a whole wall lined with cereal options for them to pick and choose from. They really seem to love it. Great wine & drink selections. In the wine department I am currently digging the Malbec they are serving...also on my list of favorites there now is their B-52, coffee+Kahlua+baileys=yum!!! If bloody marys are your thing, Glenn's makes a one of a kind bloody mary that is really tasty. For dessert try some pie made by Hoosier Mama Pie Shop! The staff at Glenn's is fun and friendly. I always take good care of them when I'm there because they take such great care of me! I recommend making a reservation for weekends and nights with specials such as Tuesday crab night! Walk-ins are always cool too.
