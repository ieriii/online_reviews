Awesome place! The shrimp and scallops are a bit bland...but the flatbread and the steaks are awesome. And you can't go wrong with bacon wrapped dates.Our waiter was very funny and took good care of us. We got the deal where you pay $58 per person, and then the chef just sends out a bunch of the most popular tapas. It's fun, because you just sit back and relax and they just surprise you with a new dish every few minutes. We told him to go light on the seafood, and he did, since my friend is pregnant and isn't exactly craving it.Great place to go!
