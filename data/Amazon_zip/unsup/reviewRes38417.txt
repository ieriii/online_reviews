Giordano's embodies the word, "excess." I can't say that their pizza is a perfectly contrived masterpiece. In fact, all of the constituents of the pizza are rather generic. There's no denying that having a few bites can be very pleasurable, but the excessive cheese overflowing from the sides and the expansive feeling of the dough in your stomach makes you feel gross. I think it's a decent place to take some kids who really want to indulge in cheese-like fantasies, but serious adult pizza eaters will find the pizza excessive and silly.  Ironically, the pizza was the best part. Did you know that if you get a super-veggie pizza and say, "no mushrooms," they will charge you more? I kid you not. I have never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life. Not only that, all the employees had a serious attitude problem. I can see why. If you're there in the middle of the Near North Side and you have hordes of hungry tourists to keep your business running, you have no reason to treat the customers well. They're not looking to keep regulars, they're looking to feed ravenous and naive tourists. To top everything off, I had to wait for the 40 minute pizza twice. The first time, the mouth-breathing food runner gave my food to a group of Indians who decided to take our food despite the fact that they ordered something completely different. At least the managers did comp the pizza, if they hadn't done that, I would be furious. I wasted most of my night sitting and waiting for a second pizza which was mediocre at best. I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here because you will leave feeling like a complete douche bag for wasting your time and money there.
