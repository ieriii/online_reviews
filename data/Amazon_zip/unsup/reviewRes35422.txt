This place is awesome!!! I already been here twice and I will continue on coming back. The first time I came here, was with my Hub and we were not really looking to eat anywhere. I mention to him that I saw a place with hanging ducks by the window and its always packed. So I sparked his curiosity and we decided to give it a try. I have to say we went on a busy night because the wait line was huge and the place was super packed. So after a 30 minute wait, we were excited to try this duck. The first time we ate there we had the Peking Duck platter, which was pieces of Peking Duck cut into stripes over white rice and it was also served with a duck egg ( just half of it). That dish was $5.25. We also ordered fried scallops which were also great and that was $8.50. Our bill with taxes and tip came out to $25. Now the second time we ate there I invited my parents and we all shared a whole duck. Now you have the option to just order just a duck for $17.95 and you can order additional side dishes, but we ordered the whole duck course which included: A whole Peking Duck, A big bowl of duck broth soup, fried rice, pickled onions with carrots and 6 steamed buns. All of that was enough for the four of us and that came out to $46 with tax and tip. I so recommend this place for its delicious food. If you have not tried duck meat before and your not picky this is the place to come. Oh did I mention FREE OBLONG TEA!!!
