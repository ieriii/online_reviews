I have been to Icosium Kafe on multiple occasions. At first I thought it was great like everyone else but now I realize how terrible it really is. First, it takes FOREVER to get your food no matter if they have a full house or you are the only person there. Second, the owner is a RUDE man who has absolutely no customer service skills or manners in general. Third, the food is NOT worth the price! Everything is about $3-4 dollars too much for the quality of the food. I was disappointed because I was really excited when I first found Icosium but I definitely do not plan to eat here again.
