I used to love this place and would have even waited 45 min to get seated. Today I went with someone from out of town and thought I would impress with a Monday, "no wait" experience. We both ordered omelets and mine was dry and barely cooked on the inside (ingredients: spinach, feta and tomato were still raw). I noticed that they changed the menu a bit (made smaller) since my previous experience and removed this fantastic eggs benedict dish.  Our server was so friendly, however, and made up for the lackluster food but I couldn't bring myself to give it a 3 star rating. It could have been an "off" day but I was not impressed.  I live around the corner from Meli and will likely just stick to what I know is consistently great breakfast food. If you are going to spend $11 for an omelet, it should be a great meal.
