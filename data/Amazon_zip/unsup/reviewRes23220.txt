Man, talk about a hole in the wall. It's very easy to miss. However, open the door to the restaurant and it's bustling with customers. We got the last table in the joint and it was just 6pm on a Friday night. Busy busy. Scanning their huge menu, I ordered Kung Pao shrimp and crab rangoon (yeah, yeah). The crab rangoon was actually mostly crab. Or maybe imitation crab. Very little cream cheese, which was a surprise. It was good, just very different than what I was used to. The Kung Pao shrimp was OK. The sauce was overly thick (and there was a buttload of it), but it had a pretty decent flavor. The shrimps were cooked well. The vegetables weren't overdone. I gotta say though, when I compare this with the holes in the wall I've eaten at in San Francisco, it just doesn't measure up. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, and I'm totally willing to go back and try more off the menu. But right now, I can't give Lao that high of a rating. Best I've had in Chicago, but definitely not the best overall.
