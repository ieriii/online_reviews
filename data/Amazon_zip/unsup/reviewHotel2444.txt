This hotel is nearly as old as Chicago itself ... built in the 20's and was the largest hotel in the world when it opened. And it's grand ... very ornate with lots of wide open spaces and marble, marble, everywhere. The service I experienced was lovely. Although as per usual I was there on business so everything I needed was utilitarian. But I was impressed and folks that worked for the hotel were very nice. The weird thing was the set up of the rooms. I was "upgraded" to the executive floor ... 24th Floor!! ... which I thought would be cool but I guess they converted the room from 2 to 1. There were 2 double beds (not queens) in the room, 2 closets and 2 full bathrooms! That would have all been ok, I guess, if there had been a King. Our conference was in the main ballroom and if you are looking for a ritzy place to thow a HUGE party, give it a try. It was fancy. One of the speakers actually told a story of being a teenager and attending a cotillion there. That's the kind of fancy I'm talking about. Anyway, good spot! I'd go back!
