One of my top 3 restaurants in Chicago. The food is incredible, and has elements of two of my favorite cuisines (Spanish and French). It's Catalan food, so don't expect the same menu as a Spanish tapas restaurant. We ordered the Mixto Charcuteria, Cepes y Butifarra Flatbread, Serano Ham & Fig Salad, olives, bread w/ crushed tomato, and a couple other items that I can't remember, but everything we ate was full of flavor and beautifully presented. Also very good sangria with some interesting fruit and herb combinations. Fun place for dates, girls nights, group dinners, celebrations, etc. Great location (Michigan & Balbo) overlooking Grant Park. Bring your visitors here for dinner and then walk over to Buddy Guy's for entertainment--fun night out in Chicago!
