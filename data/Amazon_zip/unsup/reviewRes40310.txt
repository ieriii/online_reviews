A++++ I know I'm just repeating what everyone else said, but this place is really great. The atmosphere is very laidback and the food is outstanding. Extensive beer, wine and whiskey list to please all drinkers. Kobe meatball and rabbit pate apps were great, as were the Kobe burger and veal entree. We ran into some friends right after we ordered and they gladly changed our table of two to a table of four. Service was friendly and fast. My only complaint is that they ran out of sweetbreads.
