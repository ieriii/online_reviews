I went to Le Colonial this past weekend for my birthday and had a great time!! We were welcomed very nicely by the host and had a great table by the window. The waitress (I think there should be more of a title given to her since she was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly) was very attentive and provided excellent suggestions for a wine that would go well with our dinner. We started off with two appetizers (the wok seared monk fish and the shrimp beinget stuffed with chicken and vegetables). Monk fish is not a pretty fish. If you watch any of the travel channel show, you can bet you will see a freshly caught Monk Fish on one of the No Reservation shows and say that there is no way you will ever eat a fish that looks that fugly. But, put those thoughts aside my friends because that is one delicious appetizer. For my main course, I had the barbecued pork over angel hair noodles. The pork was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The great surprise about the dish is that it has an amazing salad along side it. It seemed like the perfect dish could fill you up and not have you sweating uncontrollably if you were in heat and humidity of Vietnam. If there was anything that I could have improved on the dinner would have been the cocktail. I had the Saigon Sling and was expecting it to have more of a pineapple taste to it. But hey, if that is the only thing that I have to complain about, then it was a great evening all the way around. I also have to say that the atmosphere was very nice. It gave the place a very elegant, but yet relaxing feel. I was expecting the the atmosphere to be much more stuffy and serious, but it was a lot of fun. This is not your usual touristy Gold Coast restaurant. I would highly recommend it and definitely go back.
