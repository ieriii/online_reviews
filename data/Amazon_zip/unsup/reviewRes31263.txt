This place is brand new, but already represents a trendy, fun and delicious Asian restaurant for the area. The food influences span cuisines from all over Asia. The space is well done, lots of different areas to choose from to sit. Sushi bar, community tables, regular tables, the bar, and the lounge. I sat in the lounge. Service was great, quick and knowedgable. The soup dumplings, duck bao buns, sea bass, spicy tuna 2 ways, and other items I tried all were prepared well and tasted even better. Great drink list too, from beers, sakes, cocktail list etc. The desserts are unreal. Try the "Ridiculous" - enough said! This place is going to do real well, and everyone should try it. It is going to be packed at all times I feel. Oh, lastly, don't forget to order the sticky rice!
