This weekend, my husband and I decided to go out on a date night and picked Graham Elliot. I had gone there a year ago and wanted to try it again. The atmosphere is very cool and hip although the music was very loud. We started with a tuna sashimi and deconstructed caesar which were both very good. For dinner, I went with the halibut and my husband went with the sturgeon. While both plates were amazing, the plate was enormous and the portion was very small. Then came dessert, which was just okay. It said chocolate on the menu, but when it came to us it was a little piece of cake with a sliver of chocolate on it. My husband commented that he could've eaten 3 of them and we even talked about getting pizza after our meal. Overall, it was a good experience. For the price though, we might opt to go somewhere else where we'll feel more satisfied once we are done.
