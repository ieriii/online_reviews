This is just a standard place; nothing special but nothing bad either. I am not sure what people are saying that this is the best salad bar in the city - its a basic salad bar with a couple more items. I mean, put some lettuce on a plate with some cheese and croutons and cover it in ranch. That's good - but nearly every other salad bar offers the same thing.  The cookie ice cream dessert thing is pretty solid though.
