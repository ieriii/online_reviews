We went for the "Transylvanian Tasting" around Halloween. It was a 3 course meal for $25. The soup was excellent, veal in the soup was tender and outstanding. The entrees were superb, and the dessert was just OK (some kind of cake- not red velvet though.) He undercharged our check by $10. The service was a little bit loose, but the trade-off was the personality of the owner guy (Bruno). He is insane, gave us a free appetizer, free shots (we refused to drink out of the long skinny hose it was offered in). Sorry, we don't want community swine flu buddy. He asked us to sign their mailing list. The accordion player was hilariously intrusive, and he asked us what nationalities we were and proceeded to play us a suitable song based on that. He was really good. I did feel like we were in a restaurant where things were spur of the moment and not at all following the rules, which was refreshing. It was craziness. I was entertained the entire time by this guy Bruno, which never happens anywhere else. This place is a WEIRD GEM. I'd definitely go if you have a sense of humor, are up for a weird time, and love good food. Stay away if you're a snob, they don't need ya,
