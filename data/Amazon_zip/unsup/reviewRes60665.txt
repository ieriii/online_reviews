Always good food! And the nice thing about it, it's always consistently good. Yes, I know most complaints are about the wait time, but plan on going during non-busy hours; best times are between 2 and 5. And of course, the other complaint (or at least my complaint...): portions are big; so I usually share one entree with my husband, or get 2 appetizers, and still have room for dessert!!
