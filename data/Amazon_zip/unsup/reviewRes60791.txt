This place is definitely dedicated to its concept, a metal/prison theme complete with smoke machine and laser show in sync with the concert DVD playing on the wall of flat screen television, tin prison plates, and (perhaps oddest of all) black linen napkins. This place could be cheesy but luckily falls short of too over-the-top.The food was superb and the service was very good. I say this as a guy that has lived around the area for a few years and has been waiting for a place that not only has good burgers, but is as dedicated to the idea of the perfect burger as Kuma's Corner over in Avondale or the Rocking Horse in Logan Square. Yes this sounds like a bit of a hyperbole, but I was stricken with love at first sight with the Cruelty to Animals, a gigantic mound of ground beef topped with three different kinds of pork.My gf was pleased with the only vegetarian option, the Identity Theft (a fried eggplant sandwich) but was more impressed with the dessert, the Community Service (Banana Wontons).The beer list is also worth taking a long look at. There are some great choices in addition to the standard domestic drafts I avoid like the plague. The prices seem on par with other establishments I have been to of late. I think it is important to note that my gf and I are not metal fans. This is important because we still had no major issue with the music. Sure it was a little loud, but this is a metal bar and we only had to raise our voices a little bit to talk to each other or the server (as opposed to screaming).
