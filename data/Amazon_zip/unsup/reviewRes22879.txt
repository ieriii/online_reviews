This place is located inside Chinatown Square. Parking isn't easy to find since it's always crowded and you need to find a spot along the streets. The restaurant itself is tiny but the portions are large. The prices are average and the waitresses aren't as bilingual as expected. I love their baby clams and snails. Very fresh and very tasty. Not to miss dishes: salt and pepper pork, salt and pepper smelt, Tony's Three Chili Chicken. Although I love the food, I have to confess there was an instance when the service wasn't that great, (i.e. untimely drink refills, untimely check). We walked out with little or no gratuity and our waitress followed us out asking why we didn't give her a tip. So it's NOW that she shows us some attention. That was the last time we set foot in there. I still gave this restaurant a high rating because I don't mind being stalked once in a while. Makes me feel important. For the same quality in food and far better service, and if you don't mind the drive, venture out to Lao Sze in Downers Grove on Ogden Ave. It's the same owner. This restaurant , as well as the Lao Sze in Downers Grove, are Zagat-rated.
