So I came back to this place as promised. The service continued to be good, greeting, smiling, accommodating, in chicago consistent good service is rare. As far as the food went, I tried the steak sandwich, and the ropa vieja sandwich. The steak sandwich was decent, but it really didn't have anything distinguishing that really would make me come here again. They add small pieces of potato that look like small fries, and a pico de gallo style garnish, but still nothing earth shattering. The Ropa Vieja is a shredded beef sandwich. This was real tasty. They put a bit of bell pepper and the meat was soft and delicious. I would come here again for this sandwich. Overall I would like to give this place 3 1/2 stars, the place has great atmosphere, decor, and friendly staff, but 2 out of three sandwiches were pretty bland.
