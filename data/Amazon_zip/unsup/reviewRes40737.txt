Really people? This place is awful and given the MANY options you have for Mexican food in this area there is no reason to go here. If you like tacos loaded with rubbery meat and less than fresh veggies by all means go here. Otherwise you'll have better luck next time at a place that doesn't microwave their tortillas. This review is all locations, silly me kept trying it.
