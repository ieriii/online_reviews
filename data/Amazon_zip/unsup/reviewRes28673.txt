I have been going to Opart for about 16 years. This is the best Thai in the city. I usually get the Spicy Basil Chicken, Tiger Cry and Veg Egg Rolls. All of those dishes are terrific. The Basil Chicken dish can be very very spicy if you like it, but if you don't like overly spicy, just let them know. The Tiger Cry is just marinated beef with this tangy sauce to dip the meat in, so frickn good. The service is great, most of the servers have been there for a very long time. It's also BYOB which is awesome. If you like Thai and/or spicy food, get here asap.
