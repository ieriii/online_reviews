As a rule, I can't give a 5-star to a place after one visit. That said, Revolution is a prime candidate for an upgrade if my next visit is as kickass as the first. I was with two companions, one who had been there 3 times already, and one who was on his 6th time. There were also two empty growlers in our party but they didn't eat anything and only got beer at the end. We went for linner - 4 PM on a beeeeeautiful Saturday, and waited less than 5 minutes for a booth. I love the clever design/decor of the place, especially the chandelier in the entryway made from brown bottles. The walls and light fixtures use old barrels, too. I can vouch for the following: Sweet potato cakes: Great app, with an Indian essence. Grilled and smoked tofu sandwich: Very smoky flavor, whole spinach leaves, and the bread was perfectly crusty. Just enough sun-dried tomato spread. Sooo good! Allagash White: They didn't kick me out for ordering a non-Revolution brew. Goose Island Citrus: This was supposedly an experimental concoction that turned out to be delish and complex.  My companions' Tempeh Reuben and Goat Cheese Croquette Salad were reportedly very good as well, as were their beers. The two growlers went home full of Double IPA. Our server (Ann) was knowledgeable and friendly, and even though my friend counted 32 employees, it didn't feel like they were overbearing. They just have a lot of people to serve, and rightly so - Revolution BC deserves their popularity. I'll be back!
