This is the only place in the city that I'll eat sushi! Sushi scares me, but my husband loves it, so I humor him every once in awhile and will go here. I've tried sushi and 2 other places and did not like it at all. Since I can only eat about 2 rolls max., we have to go to a place that also offers tasty noodle dishes. They have these! It's also BYOB, which I always enjoy.
