I stopped in after work for a work related dinner. It took me a while to take in all of the menu, it is quite eclectic. Everything from duck to antelope to burgers. The ambiance is a casual elegance. Great for both tourists and business clients. Of course wanting to try the unusual, tried the antelope appetizer. It was prepared raw with a quail egg and various accompaniments. I found the flavor very delicate and not at all what I expected, excellent! For dinner, I had the duck confit with lentils. Also wonderful. Succulent without being heavy or fatty as duck can sometimes be. The waiter helped with the wine selection and what we eneded up ordering was light and complimented everything well. The wine was decanted and definitely opened up and brought the flavors out. I would highly recommend The Gage for business dinners or the diner looking for the something extra along Michigan Avenue.
