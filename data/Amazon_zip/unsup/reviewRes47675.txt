ROOF DECK IS INCREDIBLE! Yes, I do believe that statement deserved capital letters.... In my humble opinion, I think it is worth skipping the prix fixe dinner (because really, who needs to eat) and making your meal out of the delicious drinks. There are many fruity drinks on the menu. By "fruity" I mean that there is a juicer at the bar and they fresh squeeze orange juice into the drinks! The drinks are refreshing and expensive (seems to be a likely combination in this town). The roof deck is amazing...wood benches, green grass, a beautiful bar, ample seating, great views, the list goes on. Try Zed 451...you won't be disappointed!
