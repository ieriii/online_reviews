(Don't judge by the first line . . . ) The very first time I went to Big Jones, I was not impressed. But, they had just opened and I decided to try it again.  So glad I did! Much better! I've had great dinners with great service. They have definitely worked out the kinks. I have been back many times.  The most memorable experience was during the blizzard in February. They were the only restaurant open in Andersonville at about 3 PM. The owner and one server were trying to help everyone. They did a great job. The food was excellent as always and the service friendly. They did a great job in a difficult situation. Since my partner and I switched to only eating humanely raised, hormone free and antibiotic free meat, it's great to have Big Jones in the area as a lovely choice.
