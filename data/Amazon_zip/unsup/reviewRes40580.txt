I had gone to Tank on a previous occasion, however, my last experience here was disappointing. We ordered an appetizer of shrimp and lettuce in a translucent rice wrapper, pho and a bahn mi sandwich. The appetizer was questionably fresh. Due to the seasoning we did not recognize the off smell until half-way into the first roll. We did not finish. The pho was quite pleasant, in general. We shared the extra large bowl. It was not the best either of us had had, but decent for the price. The sandwich was shredded pork and pork skin. It had nice texture and decent flavor, but nothing outstanding. The service was quite good throughout. We ordered one item at a time and food came within five minutes of the order. In sum, a decent lunch place for a local, but not worth travelling to.
