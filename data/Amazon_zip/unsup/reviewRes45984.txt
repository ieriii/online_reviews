While the service at Grand Lux Cafe is pretty stellar due to our server Nikki (I'm assuming its spelled that spunky with an "i"), I just don't understand why anyone would come here on a saturday night. It's crawling with tourists, and the wait is an hour and a half plus. They tell you the wait time, hear your reluctant, "I guess we'll put our name down," and then suggest you go up and have a drink at the bar    with all the other 100 people waiting to get seated.   The food comes in typical American style: over-indulgent, over-priced, and greasy. I had the sesame tofu (one of 3 vegetarian dishes if you don't count the pizza they defrost for you) which was actually pretty good-- except for the fact that there was a pound of white rice on the plate and only six pieces of tofu.     Rarely do I resist any restaurant experience... but Grand Lux Cafe I will surely pass on.   I'm over it, folks. Let's come up with something original and fair.
