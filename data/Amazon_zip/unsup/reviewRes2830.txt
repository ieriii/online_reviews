Excellent food, the best service around, and a memory more than a meal. I would give five stars but sometimes the food feels like an afterthought... and wow is it expensive. 6 bucks for a coke? Maybe with rum in it. Not to sound like a peasant, but there is cheaper and better food to be had in Chicago. However, you will never have a more memorable dining experience, anywhere.
