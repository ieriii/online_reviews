I'm a New Yorker. Before I came to Chicago, Peter Luger Steakhouse was king. I was told that Chicago steakhouses will destroy Luger's and all NY steak. Challenge Accepted. Let's just put it this way -- I walked out of that restaurant, barely able to breathe, with a smile that stretched from ear-to-ear, repeating "that was one of the best meals of my life." Can I confidently say it beat out Lugers? Well, look.. the atmosphere is COMPLETELY different, the service is amazing, and the drinks are something to truly appreciate. This is a classy establishment with phenomenal food. I would highly recommend this to any steak lover and/or tourist. It's not cheap.. but you can cry about the bill later.
