Great spot for a romantic date. Many of the nice-r Chicago restaurants are SO loud, making it hard to carry on a conversation without yelling across the table. This was not the case with Geja's. However, SKIP the seafood/beef/chicken course! It is extremely overpriced and it is FRIED. Fried food + fondue = not so romantic nightcap. Order the cheese fondue (add some vegetables) and chocolate fondue. This is more than enough for a hearty appetite, and you won't need a nap afterwards.
