Fantastically awesome brunch place! My friend and I were visiting and decided to hit up Yolk before heading to the Field Museum. Yes, the wait was a bit long- but totally worth it. It would be nice if they had more seating in the waiting area (like benches along the walls of the side room). I had the "Tour de France" dish and it was delicious. Three types of bread used for french toast with three different toppings. I also had a bit of my friend's peach crepes, which were equally yummy. All in all, a great time.
