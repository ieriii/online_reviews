Took a vacation to Chicago and this was my first stop. The boyfriend and I arrived at our hotel (The Blackstone...wonderful!) at about 10am and were starving for a big breakfast. The concierge at the hotel directed us to Yolk as it was just a few blocks away. Thank you concierge! We were not disappointed. I had the South-of-the-Border Benny which is a Mexican twist on the traditional eggs benedict (my fave). It was absolutely perfect. My boyfriend made his own omelet, which we swore had to be about 5 eggs, but the waiter claimed only 2..yeah right ;') The big portions are fun, the atmosphere is nice, decent coffee, good price range. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive; it wasn't too busy on a Thursday morning though. I would definitely be excited to go back next time I'm in Chicago.
