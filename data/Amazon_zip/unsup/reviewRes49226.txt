We stopped for cupcakes after paying a ton of money to get our car fixed. We were looking for a pick me up in the form of cake. I had the red velvet. It was good. The bf had the carrot cake. It was meh. Its missing something in my opinion, nuts and stuff. We actually split them, each eating half. I would get the red velvet again and skip the carrot. The icing was good on both, nice and rich but not to sugary.
