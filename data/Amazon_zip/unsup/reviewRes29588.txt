A local recommended Frontera Grill but mentioned it was a very popular spot with a long expected wait for a table. I decided to try it out for lunch. It was a nice day in Chicago and there was a 45 minute wait for a seat outside but I was able to get a table inside for 1 person very quickly. A friend explained to me that it was one of the restaurants owned by Rick Bayless who I learned won Top Chef. I can see why! The food was excellent! I had the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano suggested by another Yelper and loved it. Topped it off with dessert. A group of friends and I tried to come back later in the week for dinner but the wait was over 3 hours so we decided to go somewhere else.
