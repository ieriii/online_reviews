Thank you Yelp for leading me to yet another great dining experience. The bf wanted to experience a Chicago steak house and not a chain (yes I know there are a few really good ones). I just wanted a dinner where I could dress up all purty. I made reservations through Yelp but the day of all four of us got tired out by the Shedd and I had to call in to push the reservations up by a few hours to give us nap time. At first the woman on the phone seemed hesitant but in the end I got a "no problem, done". They were nice enough to do that for us but unfortunately we were not disciplined enough to show up on time. By the time we showed it was a half hour past our reservations. I felt pretty certain there would be no table for us... To my surprise when I walked in all apologetic the hostess just smiled at me warmly and asked where I would prefer to sit in the main dining room(cozy but more packed) or bar lounge (really quiet)! Thank you Kinzie staff for being so accommodating and nice. I'm no expert judge of steak but I swear there were two manly men with me who knew their steak and they were both in seventh heaven. I had a glass of the Malbec with my 8 oz filet and me and my taste buds had a party. I didn't order sides because everyone else did and nobody could finish theirs, so I got try the risotto, broccoli fondue, and creamed spinach. All great except maybe the spinach, too much cream and not enough spinach. I can't really stop writing this review because I keep coming up with good things I keep remembering about this place. My point is: If you're stuck picking steak houses in Chicago I say hit up Kinzie and you will not be sorry.
