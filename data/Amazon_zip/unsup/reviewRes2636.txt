I've been going to Dougs since he re-opened a little west of Roscoe Village after a fire at the first place . Let me start by saying that Doug Sohn is the nicest man you could possibly meet (or, encased meat!). He greets EVERY customer EVERY day! I've never seen him get pissy, mad, or be mean to ANYONE, despite some serious snobs wandering in there on occasion. You could say I have a man crush on him..Anyway, seriously, try the specials. You can go anywhere to get a brat, corn dog, or italian. The real good stuff is the specials. Some of my favorites in the last few years include the spicy pork with cocacola bbq sauce, the mountain man (venison, rabbit, elk sausage), the jerk sausage..with plaintains, and of course, the ribeye sausage..about as close to a "Ribdog" as you could get! The best part about the sausages is the combinations..He makes home made sauces and spreads for the dogs that don't seem right, but play in well with all of his gourmet cheeses. I once had a strawberry mint sauce on a jerk sausage, which I thought would be retched but was perfect. So make the trip. If you want to get in and out..go right when it opens, or get carry out. He always posts his specials on the website, so you don't have to wait to see the sign inside. Another tip would be to go during the week, if possible.
