My wife and I tried Coast a few months ago, but with some out of town guests hankering for sushi on a Sunday night, we figured too much trouble to get into Toro, so we should try Coast again. I was a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews - though our first visit was just fine. I'm not much of a maki guy, but I figured our friends were pro-maki and didn't need piles of toro. I called about an hour or so prior to getting there and secured a reservation. We were also promptly seated as soon as we showed up. Our table was in the hinterlands all the way in the back past the bathrooms, but service turned out to be flawless. Our waitress was attentive, got all the orders correct, and the pacing was great. Actually, after each round we ordered the next round of dishes. We started with a hamachi jalapeno special - tasty! We also tried the edamae, the warm shrimp salad (sweet corn tempura was interesting in a good way), agadashi tofu, and ceviche. I'd pass on the ceviche as a family style sharing dish. We tried about 9 maki, including three vegetarian ones at the end. The sweet potato tempura, oshinko, and shitake ones were all delicious. We tried the standard rolls - white dragon, ceviche, spicy scallop, a special with smoked salmon and cream cheese, super white tuna, etc. Nothing was all that memorable and it was at times like eating candy, but it was a fun dinner and everyone left happy. Dinner with 20% tip (there were 5 of us) was about $32 a person + 2 bottles of byob white wine. Very good deal! my only complaint is that the place is so dark!!!
