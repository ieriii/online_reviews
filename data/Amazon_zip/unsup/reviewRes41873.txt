For the prices and the reputation, I really wasn't blown away. I got a filet and it was tender as butter but there really wasn't a whole lot of flavor. I also got a lobster gumbo soup and a side of spinach. Again, both good but nothing that blew me away. They serve steaks on HOT plates. It looks pretty cool. The butter is literally boiling on the plate as you cut into your steak. I cut a few pieces and they literally cooked on the plate before I could get to them. Again, good, not great. Probably not worth the money. I'm going to look elsewhere for my fancy steakhouse.
