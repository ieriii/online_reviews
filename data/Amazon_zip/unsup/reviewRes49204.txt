Disclaimer: I came here 20 minutes before closing time on a Friday night. Drunk. And hungry. Any place could have done the job at that point.  Despite this fact, Bin 36 was a pleasant surprise. Service was super friendly (but what service isn't friendly in Chicago?), atmosphere was modern and airy with a touch of home-i-ness, and the food was plain good. The burgers were juicy and flavorful. Fries were just so so, but had a good crunch. The cheddar popovers were a pleasant surprise. I think I would have dug this place sober.
