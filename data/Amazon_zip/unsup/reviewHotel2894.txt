This a review from someone who does NOT stay in hotels very often (read lots of reviews on this hotel from business people....my stay was leisure) I loved this hotel. Priceline did a great job giving me the 4 star hotel I requested. Sheraton was the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at, I'm used to staying at Hampton Inns. The pros: *Fast elevator service! Lightening speed! *Friendly helpful valet, got us a cab with literally the snap of a finger *Great views (we had a view of the city and some view of lake Michigan on the 19th floor) *walking distance to EVERYTHING. * the most comfortable beds ever!!!! (seriously!!!) *windows that open.. I loved hearing the "city noise" at night. * VERY clean!!! Cons..... Well they charge you for evvvvverything. I'm unable to comment on the wireless internet, pool or gym because we didn't pay for those services. The mini fridge was stocked .... But a $5 kit Kat wasn't appealing to me. Rooms are small, bathrooms are SUPER small and seem very our dated. But..... Once you swallow the $50 parking bill, you'll fall in love with this hotel. There are a few restaurants (Shula's is great!!!) and bars. Two thumbs up!! (and located across the street from AMC which was great for a late night movie after touring the city all day)
