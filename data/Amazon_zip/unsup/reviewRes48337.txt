Glad I finally got to experience The Publican. Went with my mom and her work friend. The fried clams are so great and so is the apple salad. We shared the spring chicken with sausage and fries. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The coffee was great and our apple dessert was glorious. Need to go back and try some liquor. P.S. three of us sat right down on a Thursday at around 7:30. And our server was so accommodating. And I loved the decor.
