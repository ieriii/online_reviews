Pancakes and French Toast only?? I think not. As somebody who overindulges in carbo loaded gluttony on a regular basis, breakfast foods like pancakes are the one area of my diet that I don't quite love enough to fit into my regular rotation. My brunch staple is the omelet. I am happy to report that Bongo Room's omelet, while being basically the only egg dish on the menu, is STELLAR. Perfectly cooked nice big half moon of fluffy eggs. Melty cheesy fresh delicious ingredients in perfect proportion to each other. Potatoes just crispy around the edges liberally seasoned with dill. The only piece of this plate that was less than perfect was the toast, but hey it's toast. Big winner. Dessert for breakfast only option at the Bongo Room? I think not.
