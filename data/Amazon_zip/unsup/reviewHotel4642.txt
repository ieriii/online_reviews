Wow. We booked the Hotel Felix for our wedding night. But after reading some pretty discouraging reviews here and there I gave them a call to discuss my concerns - I live in Chicago so the idea of dropping several hundred dollars for a bad experience when I could just sleep at my house is super unpalatable.  So, I called. And the woman I spoke with was incredibly aggressive and rude. She basically barked at me that what I had heard was an absolute lie and that in one particular situation where hotel staff opened the door to an occupied guestroom - that it was the guests fault. And I quote "If you are going to be doing that in your room you should observe the hotels policies and hang a do not disturb sign on your door". Are you kidding me? Insane. This place needs to get it together. I cannot believe that someone would respond to a guests concerns like that. Totally mishandled. Taking my business elsewhere!
