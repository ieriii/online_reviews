Take your out-of-towners here. It's a great gourmet pizza place with so many interesting combinations and a relaxing atmosphere. I had the Salsiccia e Broccoletti pizza, which was great. I tried other things and they were all good, too. The pizza is priced right (I think it was $11) and is really intended for one person, not two. However, if you got an appetizer or two, one pizza would work for two people. I felt the desserts were overpriced by about 40% and were wayyyy too small. Skip the desserts here.
