I love Ethiopian food and Chicago has many, many options. I've been to a bunch and I thought I had found my favorite in Ethiopian Diamond. But then a Groupon came along and I decided to give Demera a try. So glad I did! I now have two favorites. Demera has a very calm, soothing vibe and even looks a little fancy. We were worried about bringing our baby but the friendliness of the staff soon put our fears completely to rest. The food was excellent and as is typical with most Ethiopian restaurants, there were many vegan options. Based on the excellent food and service, extreme friendliness of the staff and the welcoming, warm atmosphere - we will be back again and again.
