Do not understand what the Fuzz is about this place. It was the worst Pizza i have ever had. I drove from the suburbs on Saturday and figured i pick up instead of waiting since the place was crowded with the young ones drinking. As i drove home i started eating a slice for the road. Well! the dough was chewy, the ends were burnt and there was not enough cheese. What a dissappointment. The pizza was so greasy that after sitting in the car for the drive home it looked so grosse that i ended up throwing it out. After spending $18 for a small pizza ,driving 23 miles to get it . i would not dare put that piece of food in my body. Sorry but it is the truth.Will never be ordering there again.As a matter of fact i should off driven back for a refund.What a waste.
