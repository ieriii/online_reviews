I have been to few of these brazilian steakhouses. I went to this one last night for a friend's birthday.  The service staff was personable and could tell our table was in a playful mood and they catered to that. The salad bar was good and what through it over the top was the lobster bisque and the sushi chef making fresh sushi. The bananas are really good, in fact we had 4 servings they just kept bringing them back. This is probably one of the better ones in the city.
