Took our family (with four kids, ages 7 - 14) to India House while visiting Chicago. Was a bit risky as our two youngest had not tried Indian food before and our third youngest relatively new to the cuisine. The entire family was very pleased with the variety and flavor of the naan, curries, and chicken recommended by our host and server. While we ordered "mild" it was still a bit hot for the newbies but loved the flavor. I myself found the food delicious and better than I have had anywhere. A great restaurant for sure.
