Right by my place I have eaten here once and grabbed takeout a few times. I love the curries, spicy and priced well. The sushi is very good but I did find that almost every roll has avocado which I like but I like a little more variety in my rolls. Wine list is nice and low priced thou they poor a bit conservatively.
