Carnivale....one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! Or anywhere for that matter. Love it here so much, I religiously go once a month. The ropa vieja appetizer is so delicious, my boyfriend and I order a few of these for our actual meal. EVERY TIME. LOL. There is just something so satisfying about a simultaneous biteful of sweet (plantains) and salty (braised beef). We've ventured off the path to try other menu items such as the empanadas, guacamole, pernil, and steak (which are all quite good) but we will no longer stray since the ropa trumps absolutely everything, every time. The raspberry mojito is also excellent here. I also can't help but order an extra side of the sweet plantains to take home. So good! I usually have to make reservations here a couple of days in advance to avoid the walk-in wait (which can be up to 1.5 - 2 hrs on a Friday or Saturday night). Well worth it. The outside seating is really nice, too. Can't say enough great things about Carnivale. LOVE IT!
