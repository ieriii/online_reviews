I get really tired of chains in this huge city, and mostly go for indie restarants.  I took a chance on Geja's and wished I was at Meltin Pot.  There isn't a choice of cheese besides one that tastes a little powdery, and I thought the value was comparable to Meltin Pot.  The atmosphere is great, but try your hardest to get a booth...
