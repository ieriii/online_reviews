FOOD: My favorite place for deep dish. I like how it's not really a chain, and so staff and food is quality. Not too cheesy (for the lactose intolerant), lots of MEAT, and my favorite part: the crust. Tastes like corn bread, but better. Everyone has their own taste for what kind of Deep Dish they like, but this is my favorite out of the Loumilnatis, Giordanos, and Pizzeria Uno. ATMOSPHERE: Almost always has a wait nearing dinner time, but the line moves at an OK pace. Love the atmosphere inside, very chill, down-to-earth, somewhat loud if there's a lot of people, writing all over the walls, etc. Kind of like a diner x 10.
