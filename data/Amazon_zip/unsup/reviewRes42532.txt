I'm in love with Gilt again! After a frustrating group dinner, I returned as a party of 2 and had a stellar experience. Everything was a close tie for deliciousness: -bone marrow - I get this every time. Our waitress, Amy (shout out to Amy, you are awesome!!) explained that Gilt's format of cutting the bone lengthwise allows all of the marrow to roast evenly so it's not raw in the middle. I think it's the best marrow in the city. -pot roast with red wine glazed vegetables - this was described as one of their house specialties, and I can see why. It was a huge portion of tender beef with a thick, flavorful glaze. -blackened cauliflower with pickled red onion - always a hit, perfect combo of smokiness and pickled tang -fettuccine with braised rabbit, artichoke & pecorino - I usually get the truffle pasta (SO GOOD), but wanted to try something different. This was very rich, the rabbit was flavorful but not too game-y, the artichokes were great and it finished with a spicy kick! -honey cornbread - my friend LOVED this cornbread, it was served in a piping hot skillet and drizzled with honey. It was too sweet for my liking, but she highly recommended it We forced ourselves to eat dessert, and were glad we did. The hazelnut, brown butter, apple cake was DE-LICIOUS! It's served with a hardened apple cider caramel crust and topped with homemade vanilla bean ice cream. It was to die for. And it's served on the cutest antique plates that are reminiscent of grandma's kitchen.  Our experience was fantastic. The food was delicious, the service was outstanding, we felt like VIPs the whole time. Gilt has always been a fave, and despite a small blip on my last visit, I will keep it on my list of faves!
