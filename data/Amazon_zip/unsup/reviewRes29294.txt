This was long my pilgrimage point when I lived in the Midwest -- happy to say that it still lives up to my hype. From the perspective of a (somewhat) longtime vegan, Chicago Diner is simply magical. I had my first gyro here. My first restaurant vegan milkshake. My first raw cheesecake. My first Monte Cristo sandwich. Now that NYC has Foodswings, that's my East Coast vegan diner jam, but Chicago Diner holds a place in my heart -- it has an adorable atmosphere, the service is always fine (and they deal with my crazy over-excitedness well), and I always have issues with needing to prevent myself from ordering ALL THE THINGS. Chicago Diner: *heart*
