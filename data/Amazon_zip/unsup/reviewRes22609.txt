On a brilliantly cold Chicago evening, we ventured into Chinatown from the northern suburbs. We had to drop the ladies at the restaurant, and go park the car. I think we had to park in Michigan and walk back. By the time we returned from our trek (weather beaten, with ice crystals dangling from my beard), the ladies had been seated, and had a warm pot of tea, and some sort of hot spicy appetizer on the white-linen clothed table. We asked for recommendations from our very non-English speaking waitress... and just left our meal in her very capable hands. I have no idea what I ate, but I know it was delicious! Well worth the trip, but not so sure about the trek. My fingers are still numb.
