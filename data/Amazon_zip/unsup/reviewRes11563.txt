I have mixed feeling about this place. First, I have been here multiple times and each time the pizza was excellent, however the service has been absolutely atrocious every time! The beer is also excellent, but you pay an excellent price for it as well. PROS: tasty pizza, delicious beer (plus they brew their own which is hard to find in chicago), good Kareokee nights, plenty of TVs CONS: Horrible service, expensive beer Attn Piece Staff: Get it together and you will reap the benefits!
