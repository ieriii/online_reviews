This place has the feel of a fancy restaurant that tries too hard to be trendy; think Morton's atmosphere for 20-30 somethings. I had the Alaskan King Crab legs. For the price, it was alright. Wasn't terrible, but definitely wasn't impressed. In my opinion, as far as King Crab is concerned, Bob Chinn's still reigns supreme. Two bright spots to mention. One, I had this pomegranate martini with champagne drink that was outstanding...I'd go back just to drink those all night. Also, our waiter was a master of his craft. Didn't appear too much or too little, and carried some interesting conversation.
