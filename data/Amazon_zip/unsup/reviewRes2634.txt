Being a New York girl, I was pretty excited when I found that my cross-country travel comrade had included Chicago hot dogs on our to-eat list during our stay in this city! The line was definitely long, but be friendly and bold enough to strike up a conversation with the folks around you and time will pass much more quickly (and don't be like the unfortunate blokes behind us who didn't realize it was cash-only until they got inside!). I was worried that there wouldn't be any seating by the time we got in, but somehow, the timing works out really well since 1) you can't sit until you order your food, 2) they have a bunch of different table sizes, from 2-seaters to larger tables that would seat half a dozen or so, and 3) hot dogs take a relatively short time to cook and consume. At least, that's how it worked out for us on that day. For money and curiosity reasons, we both ended up getting the regular Chicago-style hot dog (I was way too overwhelmed by the amount of specials to decide amongst them!) with the free-refill size fountain drink, which the counter staff was kind enough to actually recommend to us (which was WELL worth it since it was a hot day!), and it was a great way to start our day... yep, we had hot dogs for breakfast. Definitely not the kind of dressed-up hot dog I crave as a New Yorker (I'm fine with just ketchup!), but it was tasty and an memorable part of my Chicago experience. We didn't take advantage of the opportunity, but a lot of other tourists were taking their picture with Doug, who was totally cool and friendly about it. Also, the decor is super fun: the store is decked out in reds, yellows, blues, and hot dog-related things of all sorts - don't leave without seeing the bathroom artwork!
