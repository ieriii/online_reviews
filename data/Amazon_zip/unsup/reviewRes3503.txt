SO GOOD! After driving by one day I decided later that week to stop in on a whim, and I am glad that I did! My partner in crime and I decided to split a whole chicken and get it done two different ways per suggestion of the man taking my order. We got the sassy and the BBQ. Personally I'm glad that we got both, but I ended up liking the BBQ more. We also got a couple sides and drinks along with the whole chicken done 2 ways- and it was $21 dollars and change. I think that was a pretty good deal. Cute restaurant, nice employees, and great food!
