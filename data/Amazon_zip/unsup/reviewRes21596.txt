What else can I say that hasn't already been said? Great food, nothing fancy, fantastic margaritas, all for very reasonable prices. Service is terrific, too. "Our waiter" remembered the GF and I after we hadn't been there for many weeks, and he commented that it "had been a while." It can get a little busy (read: crowded, loud, and you might be in for a wait), but it's what a neighborhood Mexican restaurant should be.
