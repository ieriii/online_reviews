I'll start by saying I've been to Publican around 10 to 12 times. Tonight = NOT GOOD. The food was surprisingly very, very disappointing. Are they losing their touch? Dishes: Grilled Octopus - huge portion, tasty but heavy handed, i've had better. Hamachi Crudo - tasty, fish cut too thick, so so. Assortment of hams - good. Main dishes just sucked. Sirloin - cooked to temp but the meat was tough and fatty. Shame on you guys. Country Ribs - these are essentially pork chops - also fatty, over-charred tasting, just plain bad. Fries With Egg - good as always. Publican - I'll give you one more shot and chalk this up to a rare strikeout. Tonight was a huge let down.
