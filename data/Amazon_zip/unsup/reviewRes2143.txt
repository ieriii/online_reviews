The only place casual or otherwise where I can order Keira Knightley with my foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and fleur de sel to wash down with a bottle of Green River. I love Hot Doug's. And yes, Doug Sohn the owner sort of resembles a sausage but I think that's a good thing.
