We booked through Hotwire and got an amazing deal on a suite with a full kitchen, sitting room, dining area and most importantly for traveling with family, a real wall and door to the bedroom. The living room was so spacious, we even had several local friends over for drinks before going out, or down as we first stopped at their wonderful little wine bar and bruschetta place in the basement.  They are updating the rooms but if the grandma style decor (China press with blue china monkey) is part of the low price we had no problems. The staff was really nice and helpful with old school service like bell hops and door men.
