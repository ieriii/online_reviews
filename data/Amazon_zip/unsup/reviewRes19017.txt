The emperor has no clothes, people! After all the hype, I found that my meal was sadly Bay-less.  The Aztec hot chocolate had an odd sour taste that just didn't gel with my notion of what gourmet hot chocolate should taste like.  The Pepito was almost unpalatable. The bread was so tough I was afraid of getting a throat splinter. The meat, what little there was, was stringy and dry, like when you leave your crock pot on four hours too long. I found the sandwich to be pretty bland. The two stars are for the green salsa that came with the sandwich. The Ahogada looks interesting, and I think that the sauce it comes in would help the sandwich go down (literally), but I won't be back to try it out. My experience made me appreciate Potbelly's more.  I live in River North and I truly believe that if I: gave my apartment a schnazzy name, held the line at the door, and overpriced everything, the world would line up at my door to eat Kraft mac & cheese for $30/plate in my living room.
