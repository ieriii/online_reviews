I love Ethiopian food. And I've been a little starved for good choices since moving out here, so thank god for Demera. I now have a great place to get my injera fix. Their sambusa appetizers are fantastic as well. I'm vegetarian, so I can't speak for their meat dishes, but their collard greens and lentil dishes are really flavorful and tasty. The atmosphere is decent too, although the night we were there, the heating system was suffering some major issues. It was freezing cold one minute, and so hot I couldn't breathe the next. Not too many other people seemed to notice though - maybe it was the location of our table? Service is friendly, but a bit spotty - it didn't seem like there was a dedicated server for each table. Several people came by over the course of the meal, and we needed to ask for extra injera rolls from two of them before someone brought them over. Also, be warned: the place gets full really quickly on weekends. A reservation helps, but if you're more than five minutes late, they'll give your table away. We made it just in the knick of time!
