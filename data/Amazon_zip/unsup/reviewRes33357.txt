i can not say enough good things about this place. it's charming and the food is fantastic. i'd be tempted to keep it my secret, but as i'd love it to stay around forever and the owner, branco, was so nice i can't help but to rave about it here. it's a hidden gem (on elston), although it has been around forever and used to be in a less hidden location. the decor and design is great--super rad backlit faux stained glass windows that i'm glad they moved into the new place. the food is phenomenal--literally some of the best i've ever had. i couldn't make up my mind between a couple of things and the owner let me taste both of them--the goulash was great and the cabbage rolls seriously the best thing ever. i've been thinking about them ever since. it's totally reasonably priced and they have daily specials--some days wine, some days entrees etc. although i sometimes think live music can be a bit much, the music here only added to its greatness--thursdays are a good night--i'll vouch for that. don't come here expecting to shovel food in a minute and leave the next. that's not what it's about. it takes hours to go to romania--this place will probably take you ten minutes to get there--why wouldn't you want to stay? i literally haven't enjoyed a meal this much in ages and i can't wait to go back. if you went to the old location and find yourself needing a new place to discover consider this your re-ignition of the fire.
