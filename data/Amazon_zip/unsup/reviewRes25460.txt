Arguably the most romantic restaurant in Chicago, as suggested by the Tribune, Geja's Cafe is fondue spot that is definitely worth visiting..and here's why: - Stellar ambiance for an evening with that special somebody. - Cheese fondue...AMAZING. A gruyere served with a variety of breads and fruit. - Meat and seafood were primo..particularly the scallops, lobster tail, and aged beef tenderloin. - Chocolate fondue flamed with an orange liqueur tasted so good. Beyond all of the food though, the service was excellent. I've been to Geja's Cafe multiple times, one of which was an anniversary. During that visit, the house offered a complimentary bottle of champagne. Come on, you can't beat that. In addition to that, the restaurant sends gift certificates via mail and sends email notifications of special events. The only thing I would peg Geja's for is the lack of selection of broths for the main entrees. It is an oil fondue, just to cook the meats and seafood. They do, however, make up for this with a tray of sauces. I would give Geja's Cafe 4.5 stars, but yelp doesn't like halves.
