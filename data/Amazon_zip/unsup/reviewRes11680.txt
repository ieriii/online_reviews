I've been here many times, but this last time I went, I went with my friends who were visiting from New Haven! They approved the authenticity 100%. I went to a real New Haven pizza place when I visited them a few weeks ago, and we all agree - Piece handles a big crowd with much more grace, class, and quality service. Seriously, how does Piece pull it off? With such a high demand for their kick-ass pizza and beer on a Saturday night, they still give you the attention you desire (after of course you wait an hour to be seated but STILL, people! This is Chicago, what can you really expect on a Saturday night?!) Thumbs UP! WAY UP!!!!!!
