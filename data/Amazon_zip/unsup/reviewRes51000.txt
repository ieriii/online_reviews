Warm, inviting, low-key. Friendly and attentive staff. I've been here with my family a few times and we love NO style cooking! For Thanksgiving, we had reservations with a delay, understandable with a busy holiday. The host was wonderful and offered us comp drinks and appetizers. Once we were seated with the rest of our party our dinner was wonderful! My only wish is that Big Jones offered a more generous portion. I still am a happy visitor thought!
