Paul C....sorry man but the boat just left and it looks like you missed it. First off...that is not where the Real World Chicago was. It was across the street, but not sure what that has to do with anything.  Chicago style pizza is for some...New York for others...and for those who have had the privilege of spending a few years in New Haven, this is the pizza for them. Im not going to go so far as to claim that it is as good as Sally's or Pepe's, but you are not going to find anything closer in this part of the country. The pizza is top notch, the beer is stellar, Aps are good, huge place with great layout, live band karaoke....what more do you want man? If you don't like a crowded, hopping spot....go move to the burbs and enjoy your pizza hut...
