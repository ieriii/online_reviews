Vegan mac n cheese and a karma burger, I was in heaven! I actually think I tore something while eating because I inhaled my food so fast. We arrived here after a 10hr road trip from, you guessed it, Tdot and were all famished. The staff are super friendly and got a group of 5 seated quickly even though there was a huge lineup. We were in a booth initially which was a bit crowded on the 3 person side but we were moved to a table after we placed our orders. The mac n cheese is made from daiya cheese, a dairy-free tapioca-based product. It was very delicious but tad bit dry. The burger came with two different kinds of sauces that were both amazing, I couldn't even tell you what they were, just spicy and tangy. I liked the decor and atmosphere of the place. I also got a soy chai latte to-go. The chai tasted very fresh and not at all like those from syrups versions. CD had a booth a Pitchfork Music Festival so I ate veggie corn dogs all weekend. Love you Chicago Diner!
