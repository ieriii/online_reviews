I've heard a lot about this place from my buddies so I wanted to try it out. Everytime we drive by, it's really busy, so we decided on whim to go one day in January when it was snowing like crazy. I couldn't believe there was still a line halfway around the block. We went on a weekend so we got the duck fat fries. Wow, just wow. Also I had to get a Chicago dog just to check it out. And of course I tried a specialty dog. I had a turkey sausage with cranberry, goat cheese(?) and something else like almonds. I don't remember cause it was a while ago, but shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiet that was good. I'll go back but I hate the wait. edit: 4/5/08 We decided to go here for a late lunch. The line was a block long, but we gave ourselves limits (if we pass that brick in 10 minutes we stay.) When we got in, we forgot about how long we had waited as the aroma filled our lungs. The ribeye steak sausage with horseradish sauce, french onions, and cheddar???????????????? Seriously, that was amazing.
