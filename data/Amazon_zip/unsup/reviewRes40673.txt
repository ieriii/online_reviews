Absolutely fantastic. I've been a number of times and have tried the majority of the appetizers and small plates, and everything is great. The major standouts were the beet salad and the pig's head terrine. The food is rustic but executed with tremendous skill. The bourbon list is great, and the service is spot on. A must try.
