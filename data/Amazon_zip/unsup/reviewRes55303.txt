We were party of 3 celebrating special occasion. We loved their competition Brazzaz and Texas de Brazil so we wanted to give Fogo de Chao a chance! Our server ruined my perfect opinion of this place! Since this is Brazilian stake house we agreed on getting Brazilian wine with our dinner. Our server was really pushing carpininas first, so we ordered them but still didn't change our mind about wine. My friends went to get salads for us when our server approached me and asked about wine. I said we would like Brazilian wine. He answered... No, no, no... you really don't want that wine, it is not good, take something else instead... I was so confused... and shocked... didn't know what to say... so he recommended wine from Chile and I said... OK... My friends returned to our table and when I told them what had just happened they were upset... so they called our server back and he was still firm with opinion about Brazilian wine... also said... Do you know how Balsamic Vinegar tastes like - well this wine tastes just like that! We could not believe our ears!!! If that wine is that bad why do you have it on your many!!! And even if we were making wrong choice... there is other ways of recommended different wines in the same price range so we don't feel our server wants to make some extra $$$.... We won't go back, such a horrible experience! Fogo de Chao, your competition does so much better job with making their customers happy!
