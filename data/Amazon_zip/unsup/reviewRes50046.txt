I got a Groupon to Las Tablas and went with my boyfriend who really, really likes meat. I'm a vegetarian, but there are still yummy things on the menu like cheese empanadas and fried plantains and yucca. My boyfriend ordered a combination plate that had giant pieces of calamari and chicken and a friend plantain and some yucca. He was quite pleased and enjoyed the leftovers the next day.  The service was absolutely lovely. They had recently revised their BYOB wine policy, but hadn't updated it on their website so they allowed us to drink the bottle of wine that we brought, even though we were willing to order a bottle off of their menu. I'd definitely go back, even without a groupon!
