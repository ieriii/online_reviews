Sultan's! So cheap! The best falafel! So good! Nice salad bar! Good lentil soup! Pellegrino is a little too overpriced. Hummus is yummy. But there seems to be some sort of inconsistency -- the menu says the small is 3 and the large is 4 dollars, but actually they sell it by weight and it always winds up being more. Otherwise, so good! So cheap! Go late or early for lunch, so you can get a seat.
