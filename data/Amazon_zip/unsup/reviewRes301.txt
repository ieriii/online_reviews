From Alice in Wonderland: "Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin; but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever say in my life!" Alinea takes you down the rabbit hole, turning worlds upside down, clocks backwards, or rather, food on thin air, scents developed from nothing and flavors exploding out of tiny containers. I loved it. I kept expecting our wild haired sommelier to ask, "and who my dear, are you?" since this food clearly knew who it was and where it should be. Alinea is a ride and worth every minute.
