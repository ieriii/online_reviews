Our experience was pleasant and the food is good but I don't think it's something to write home about...so I'm writing Yelp. The service is attentive, they'll take care of you, but it's a tourist trap. And they'll serve your meal with cafeteria like speed. Coincidence, I think not. I enjoyed my visit but I won't be back. I live in Chicago, I don't need to see revolving digital portraits of it on the wall whilst I eat. The service is the difference between "meh" and "A-OK."
