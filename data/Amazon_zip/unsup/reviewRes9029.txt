Wasn't overly impressed. It seemed to be more hype than anything. Went for a birthday dinner right before restaurant week, and the meal was good, but not spectacular. The service was a little subpar, as a few at my table were a bit frustrated with the speed and attentiveness of service. A little pricy, but it's worth a shot to make your own judgements....
