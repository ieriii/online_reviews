Has a great deal on Tuesdays! I know practically everyone here has written about it, but I can't believe how little my friend and I spent when we checked this place out this summer. I was so curious about the Jail House Rock that I had to try it: peanut butter, banana, bacon, burger. It's no wonder they call it the fat Elvis! Surprisingly, it was really delicious. All of those ingredients are amazing. And I would pretty much eat anything on a hamburger! We also ordered some macaroni and cheese but I can't remember what we put in it. Either way, it came in abundance and tasted amazing. Plus, with a Foursquare deal, I got a free Schlitz. Not the best of beers, but for zero dollars, I'll take it!
