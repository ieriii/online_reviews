Awesome, awesome, awesome from the food to the service...everything was top notch! I took my husband there for dinner last week and being his birthday and the reputation of Le Colonial, the expectations were high and they did not dissapoint. The menu is huge. Often Matt and I like to get a few things and share. I was afraid that everything would be within the same taste profile and that the flavors would become repetitive, but we went for it anyway ordering three apps and an entree with dessert. Everything was tastefully unique while staying true to French Vietnamese flavors. We shared the beignets, the pho, the mussels, and then finally the chopped filet mignon entree. Our server was excellent and split everything up as he knew we were sharing items. He was attentive, without being in your face the whole time, and very friendly. Highly recommend Le Colonial for special occasions or a sexy night out on the town! Don't forget to check out their lounge and outdoor space upstairs!
