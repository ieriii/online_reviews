You have to go here with an empty stomach, because they really bring on the food. I loved everything and especially the charcuterie and the drinks. I really appreciated the ambiance and interior design and upstairs and can totally picture eating at the bar here. It winds up being about 100+ a person, so take your parents there when they come to visit if you are worried about the bill, haha.
