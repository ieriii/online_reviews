I usually don't order steaks when I come to a seafood restaurant but this time I did. Everything was top notch except for the steak. The seafood appetizer was incredible. My brother ordered a lobster roll and he said it was great, I didn't like it, I thought it was too sweet. Nevertheless, i shouldn't have ordered the steak and stuck with seafood.
