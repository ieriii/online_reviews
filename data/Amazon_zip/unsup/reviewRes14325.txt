I've been trying to find time to eat here for two months now! But due to their early close time and not being open on Sundays, my earlier attempts failed. I finally dined here on Friday night for dinner, even sat outside since it was warm and light enough that day. It was well worth the wait! The Space The actual interior space is tiny. If the photos posted up here are any indication, it's a shack. But, a delightful one. There's only counter seating inside, but if it's warm enough, I'd recommend dining outside on their "patio" where there are high top tables and regular tables. Due to the tiny space inside, it's best to grab a paper menu to decide on your meal to avoid congesting the area by the register. The Food Delicious. Reasonably priced. And delicious. The staff will have recommendations. Take them. Try the yuca frites and empanadas to accompany your main dish. I ordered the bistec sandwich. It was good, but the second half of my sandwich was a little tough. The bread was perfectly crunchy/chewy. I had a bite of my friend's Media Noche (Cubano on sweet bread), which was very good. Next time I'm going for the Cubano. And the time after that I'll have to try one of their dinner plates. The Service Staff is very friendly and very helpful. Order at the counter and they'll bring your food to you (seat yourself). I can imagine this place getting crazy busy some days, but luckily we went on a moderate night where the rhythm seemed just right. We had no wait in line, no problem finding a table, and the staff stopped by a couple times to check on us during the meal. Extras There's ample free parking on the street.
