Initial caveat: we got a 4-night stay during the holidays for $75/night using priceline's name-your-own-price, so it's hard to complain, cause the place is really pretty swanky. But, I strongly doubt that the maid service, concierge, and other service personnel knew we were there on the cheap, so it doesn't excuse their behavior. The place was undergoing major renovations, so the outside of the buildings and the (main) east tower was kind of a mess, which maybe explained why they may have been short staffed or disgruntled. We stayed in the West tower and it was quiet and the rooms were nice and comfortable, with good views. The service was rotten though. The maids never once replaced anything they removed from our room. If I ever wanted fresh glasses, ice bucket bags, or shampoo/conditioner, I had to call the maid service and request them. And when I called, I usually got attitude: "Can I get turn-down service tonight while we're out this evening?" "OK, someone will be up shortly." "And would you ask the maids to possibly check and replace any used or empty items around our room while they're up here?" (gruffly) "Ok, sir, you're going to need to tell me EXACTLY what you need. What do you ACTUALLY need?" I listed the various items, which I found later in a plastic bag tossed in the bathroom sink. They couldn't even place the items in the shower or their various places. The other big issue was room service, whose absurd prices (I assumed) already contemplated the strenuous task of delivering the food up an elevator, Nevertheless, they charged a $4 delivery charge on top of auto-gratting the bill 18%. Thus an already over-priced $13 turkey sandwich cost a mandatory $20. Ridiculous. I like Hyatt and would probably try the other one near the Water Tower if we visit Chicago again, but this experience was a mess. If we'd been paying the full $179/night, I would probably have lost it.
