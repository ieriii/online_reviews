Every time I passed by The Purple Pig, I always saw a long line outside of the restaurant. Seeing how popular the place was, I always wanted to check it out, but never had the opportunity until recently. We got to the restaurant a little before 6pm on a weekday and although there were a few people waiting outside of the restaurant, we were able to get a seat as soon as our entire party had arrived. We ordered four dishes: the pork shoulder, scrambled eggs with sea urchin, the calamari appetizer and the octopus with fingerling potatoes and green beans. The pork shoulder was extremely tender, but the gravy made it a little heavy for me. The scrambled eggs with sea urchin had garlic bread served with it. I thought it was really good, but you could taste the egg part a lot more than the sea urchin. I'm a big fan of sea urchin so I kind of wished that we had been able to taste it a little more, but my friend said that it was just right so it all depends on how much you iike sea urchin. The calamari and octopus were very flavorful, but a little sour. We had to ask our waiter to bring a little more bread for us to balance it out, but we still enjoyed both dishes. At the end of our meal, we had some room for dessert so we ended up ordering the bread with nutella and marshmallows. The dessert looked like a sandwich with bananas, nutella and toasted marshmallows on the inside. The bread was toasted so it was crispy and warm. The marshmallows were toasted and melted very well. The dessert was basically like a mix of s'mores and a banana split sundae. In sum, everything we tried was generally very good, unique and interesting. I will definitely be back to try more things on their menu!
