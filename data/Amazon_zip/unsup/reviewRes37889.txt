Giordano's was my first crack at Chicago-style deep dish pizza. With my first bite of my lunch-size portion pizza, I really didn't know what to think. The sauce was good. The cheese was good and so was the "baby sausage" (as the waiter called it), but I still didn't know what to think. It was a lot. A lot of pizza. A lot of cheese. A lot of sauce. A lot of crust. A lot of cheese (did I mention?) A lot to take in. But the more I ate it, the more I liked it. It grew on me. It was almost like a challenge to finish it all (even though I never did). The atmosphere was very casual, laid-back. We had a colorful, fun waiter who gave us a few laughs along the way too. I felt my visit to Chicago wouldn't have been complete without visiting one (or all) of these Chicago-style pizza staples. Everyone says Giordano's, Gino's East, etc is the best, so I say, you just have to try them all, including this one. But for now, for me, it was just A-OK.
