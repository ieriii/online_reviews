Went there twice. Loved it consistently. I am glad I read the reviews before going though cuz I would have had a much harder time finding the door otherwise. Sat at the bar the first time and I'd recommend doing that at least once. Its fun to watch the bartenders put together each drink with such attention to detail and care. Also helps that our bartender was pretty hot and very sweet and helpful. And we were very happy with the drinks he made and the knowledge he shared. Sat at a table the second time. Again, service was great. Got our drinks quickly and the server was great. The ambiance is chill and I loved the overall feel of the place. So go.
