We were in Chicago the weekend before our anniversary, so we decided to have a big night out while we were in town. I've been wanting to try Frontera Grill the next time we were in Chicago, so we made sure it happened. We arrived at 4pm to line up, but there was no line yet. We walked around until about 4:30 and came back and were the third party in line. By the time the doors opened a little after 5 the line was around the block, so I'd say we had pretty good timing. All the drinks we had were delicious, my favorite being the champagne margarita. It did however pack quite the punch - I don't think I would have remembered the night if I had more than one. We ordered the bacon guac, shrimp pillows, carne asada, mole trio, and flan dessert between the two of us. Everything was delicious, but the star for me were the sweet plantains with sour cream that came on the side of my carne asada - best. plantains. ever. I could have made a meal out of just this little side. Everything else was pretty perfect - great flavors and prepared perfectly. It was a solid meal, but the thing I'll really remember is the plantains. I wish I could give the 5th star, but thebestplantainsever unfortunately don't quuuiiite warrant it.
