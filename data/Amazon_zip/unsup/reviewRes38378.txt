The debate rages on, what's better pie, Chicago or NYC? I happen to be more partial to our more Eastern slice brethren. Midwestern 'za, however, is still pretty awesome. The deep dish here, is chock full of fresh ingredients, flavors, and, of course - depth. When you need to go deep, like Sammy used to at Wrigley, go Giordano's.
