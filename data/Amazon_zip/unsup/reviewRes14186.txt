I went here on a crowded Friday night and put my name in for a table and expected to wait for 2 hours to eat a hamburger. I must say I am not a fan of the no reservations policies at these cool new "buzz" places. For me, the cool thing about Chicago, was that it never took itself so seriously. If you think you are going to need room for more tables build a bigger restaurant. Heck, I know it is not cheap to get a building in this area, but come on! So, as you can see I started out cranky. Well, I waited and my friend showed up and we stood at the bar and waited like vultures behind a couple we noticed was done eating. They were nice enough to give us their seats and we sat down. We tried the bacon popcorn, then ordered a pizza and a burger. I had the burger. It was good. I ordered one with pulled pork on top. I think the burger was 10 ounces. I have to say that I tossed the bun, ate the meat, and that was about it. The burger was giant, and pretty good, but I am not a fan of mega-burgers, so I wish they had something a bit smaller on the burger side. The pizza was good, but I like the pizzas at Small Bar a bit more although the options were quite good in terms of toppings. The beer was wonderful. I think they put most of the thought into this and it shows. All and all, a good place to visit, but I was not blown away. Perhaps when the crowds die down this place will be worth another visit. I love the logos, and wish they incorporated pictures of Lenin, Marx, and Che since they borrowed all that Soviet imagery in the logos to sell beer. By the time they called me, we were done with dinner and walking out. It was a fun place with ok food and great beer. When it becomes a part of the hood, I think it will be a great place to go.
