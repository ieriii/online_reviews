This was something of a disappointment, the food was fine but definitely didn't live up to the hype, I found nothing here that would entice me to go back again. The much vaunted laid-back, hip athmosphere can slide into the outright annoying at times. Its good to be informed about the food but when everybody has made choices from the menu, and is ready to order, that is not the time for the server to launch into a speil which relentlessly ploughs through everything on the menu, before getting to the triffling matter of finding out what the customer actually wants at this point. Really it may be a much hyped destination, but I am not here to listen to speeches from my server. Note to servers, do not touch the customers, repeat, do not touch the customers. If you're on a date, having a chatty, oversharing server grope your date while rambling on endlessly about his favorite items on the menu is not a good start to the meal.
