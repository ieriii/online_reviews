This may not be a very popular amount of stars for this review, but to be honest it's partially my fault. We showed up 20 minutes before closing and were told as such. We were on our way out anyway, but at a few minutes after ten they turned up the lights like it was bar-time. Come on now...where's the love? I thought the crepe was so-so (Icosium crepe). The soup was delicious. I had the lamb stew (less of a stew, more of a soup if you ask me). My boyfriend had a sweet crepe that was good. I just feel like i've had better crepes. These were just a-ok...!
