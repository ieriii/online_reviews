90 minutes for delivery when I was quoted 45. ONLY 4 RANGOONS in an order?!!!! Look, the food is not bad. The rangoons were tasty (but ONLY FOUR!!!!!). The Kuai maki was pretty good. The Pad See Eiw was good, and the Bay Beach fried rice was above average..... HOWEVER...... They would have all been a lot better if they were actually HOT when they got to me.  Ironically, they comped my sodas and my roll - the two things that I actually wanted cold. I am sure under normal circumstances, this place could be pretty good, but you do not get my repeat business when you deliver cold food to me.
