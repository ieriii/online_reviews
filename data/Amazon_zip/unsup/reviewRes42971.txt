Went here on Sat night. I called two hours ahead for a table for 2....it was the Duke/WV game and the night before Easter so they were able to accommodate us, but we still had to wait 10 min. I ordered a Grey Goose dirty martini, but they only have organic? or obscure vodka which I've never heard of but was promised was delicious. It was! The bartender listened to my request for it to not be very dirty and was overall really great. The fresh oranges to use the peel and as zest is a nice touch on other drinks, too! We started off with the beet salad. It was great, my only complaint is that there needs to be more of those delicious almonds in it! We decided to split an entree after seeing a piece of pie come by our table. We split the mussels which, while a decent portion, the mussels, themselves, were small. They were, however, in a unique, but great broth that had onions, vermouth, lemon and some herbs. For a side we had the blackened cauliflower which had capers, red onions and some chili which was outstanding. I'm still thinking about it. Honestly, everything on the vegetable side looked incredible. The pie--OMG, awesome- Lemon meringue which is my favorite! It was huge and great! Overall, loved it here. Cool, open space and decor. Looks like more of a date night place, dimmed lights, but a very friendly unpretentious vibe which also suits a little larger party. I love that you can see into the kitchen and if you want can sit at a kitchen counter where you talk with the chefs and learn more about what you're eating. I will definitely be coming back.
