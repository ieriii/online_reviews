Welcome to Nana's. They serve seasonal dishes made with locally grown ingredients. Your experience is bound to be different from mine or even the second time you go since their dishes change regularly. I've been here plenty of times, sometimes I like my food sometimes I don't, a couple times I've loved the food. Don't come here expecting a tiny check, this is not cheap food. Also don't come here if you're in a hurry. Its a nice sit down place to spend the evening. The staff is friendly and the pork tostones and mac and cheese, I could eat everyday if I was rich. I am not one of those fru fru only eat organic stuffs kind of person. In fact, I prefer non-organic foods most of the time. I still like this place though. It's well made food for a moderate price. Lots of parking too This is the only place i ever had purple carrots. And no they were not yams. I also recommend their chips with queso dip thing. Forgot what its called but so yummy! My favorite entree is the steak with chimichurri. They also serve monthly specials thats like a dish with a wine pairing. They look neat. I had their cocktails and they are amazing! The appleseed contract has homemade apple butter and its sooo good. The spiked lemonade taste like a delicious lemonade with no spike.
