The second-best thing about vacation is going to brunch on a weekday. While all reviews pointed to an hour-long wait (or more) at this trendy Bucktown joint, we waited just five minutes for a table around 11 am on a Friday. I ordered the breakfast burrito with a side of bacon . Full of fresh avocado and topped with a layer of melted cheese, Bongo Room's version was delicious and quite satisfying. My friend had the breakfast sandwich and a side of sausage. Basic and tasty. So, what's the best thing about vacation? Day drinking, of course. And to start the day out right, we both ordered mimosas with our food. At $7, they were a little pricey -- until I saw our waitress make them. Approximately eight ounces of champagne, one ounce of juice. Bonus! We ordered two rounds, drank about five cups of coffee, stuffed ourselves, and then immediately went for a walk through Wicker Park to another bar. And I repeat, my kidneys fucking hate me.
