First impression: Damn, the owners must be loaded. Gorgeous 5-year-old The Gage, situated in prime space across from Millennium Park, feels upscale yet remains unpretentious, and is furnished with rich wood and bright sage tile. The 300-seat restaurant bustles with lively conversation and friendly servers clad in black. Though it's owned by the same father-son team that brought Chicago two successful pubs (The Irish Oak and The Grafton), The Gage has much more to offer than its older siblings. The large, handsome bar is stocked with whiskies of all sorts - namely Irish and Scotch - as well as interesting beers on tap and solid wines. Aside from Caesar salad and chicken noodle soup, Chef Dirk Flanigan's menu doesn't bore, but it also avoids the fussy and unfamiliar; I'd gladly try everything without alterations, and just might if I can manage it in the future. Unfortunately, due to a heavy breakfast, I wouldn't have been able to stomach the popular Scotch egg, wild boar poutine or venison burger that I wanted to, and so stuck with lighter fare. Gazpacho, the soup du jour, was zesty and delicious but marred by stringy strands of red onion. I thought the cress and radicchio in my roasted mushroom sandwich would clash with the truffle mayo, but it melded together nicely. Best was a glorified BLT, starring house-smoked salmon and amplified by the fresh crunch of cucumber and a pickle aioli. Nothing special about the fries (I had expected some herbs and/or coarse salt) but at least they were hot and crisp. It all went down well with a glass of Adami prosecco, a pleasant surprise for this Champagne snob. Can't wait for next time.
