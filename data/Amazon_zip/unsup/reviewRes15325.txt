I have been here several times. The food is always good and of good value. The reason will not return is due to continued poor service. Our last experience was probably the worst. It took over 10 minutes for our server to come to the table. When he did, he simply said, are you ready? We never received refills on our beverages, he didn't check on our food and took over 15 minutes to come back with our change.
