This place is a bomb !!!!!!!!! I was surprised at how busy it was when I walked in. I had the Bad boy Buddha with beef. It was delicious and totally worth it. I am so glad I looked at all these positive reviews here and got to Crisp, even though I had to take a long way there on a cold night. But it was so delicious and worth it. I STRONGLY recommend
