Great breakfast spot. It's always busy but the wait never seems to be too long. I would recommend getting their strawberry-orange juice, it's always fresh and delicious. The food is great. I have liked everything I've tried but am a fan of the eggs benedict and the tour de France, which comes with three different types of french toast. They also offer other food for if you aren't in a breakfast mood. The service is pretty good most of the time, however, they can get pretty busy so it's best to try to order right away.
