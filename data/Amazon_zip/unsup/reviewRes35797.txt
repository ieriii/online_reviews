Go right for oysters and clam bar. Go left for the entire ocean. I had oysters, chopped Cesar salad (even the anchovy was fresh) and king crab legs ("we get them from the guys on the discovery channel"). Some of the most succulent I have ever munched on. There is an amazing variety of seafood including stone crab (best enjoyed cold with mustard sauce) and Copperhead river salmon (i.e. didn't swim in its own shit for 8 months on a fish farm). Atmosphere on the right side is a total bar scene, noisy and packed. Atmosphere on the left is busy, refined, restored warehouse, feel. Great choice if you love fresh seafood.
