The best pizza I've ever had when I visited Chicago last winter. I am from Florida and most pizzeria's around here are pretty much franchised and nothing compared to the quality of Gino's pizza. Definitely worth trying out a deep dish pizza if you're in Chicago and want to stop out here. Prices are moderate, but definitely worth the pinch to the pocket.
