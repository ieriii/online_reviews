This place is top notch. Also the food is immaculate as well as the service and atmosphere. Your classic Italian restaurant. The owner of the restaurant is wonderful and really tends to his customers his name is victor. They have a nice bar with a really cool bartender.......i love the kiddy cocktails. ITS a sit down cozy place with a feel of modern Italy. The desserts are to die for!!!! A must go you will be hooked!!!!
