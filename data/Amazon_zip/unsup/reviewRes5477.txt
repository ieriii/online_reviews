the pig's ear was ridiculously good. mix it with fried kale, pickled peppers and fried egg, and you've got yourself a killer dish. and it comes in a tiny piggy bowl. and it's only $6! it's one of the best new restaurants in america this year, and as result, the waits are longer (there's always been a wait though). the wait staff and bartenders are friendly, and they really take their time explaining the menu items, since some of them are not familiar to the regular palate. don't be afraid to ask for their recommendations. my other favorite thing about this place is the wine list. really extensive, very well thought out, and lots of affordable choices. their piedmont wines, in particular, are really good.
