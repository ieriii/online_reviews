Definitely the best place in Chicago for seafood. I had the Red King Crab and the Filet Mignon combination. They one upped every place Ive ever eaten a Caesar Salad by placing real Anchovies as a topping. I didnt think I was gonna like it but I ended up eating the whole bowl, Anchovies and all. They were nice enough to start off my crab with a crack so I didnt have to work so hard. The portions were good but I still think they charged a little too much for what I got. So far so good on the meal, so I decide to go for dessert. I chose the Creme Brulee and it was AWESOME!. All in all it was a near perfect dinner, other than the price being too high and my Filet Mignon being slightly undercooked from the medium I ordered, I would've given this place a 5 star rating.
