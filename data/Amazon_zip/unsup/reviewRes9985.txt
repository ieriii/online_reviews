July 15 2011 Dinner on the patio / 7 pm reservations Overall experience was great for wife and I. Asked for patio space and waited about 25 mins for that. This would have been an issue except they were already very busy. Superb appetizers - one was tomato/basil/mozzarella the other procuirtio & fig. Entrees: ribeye medium was almost too close to medium but very good; My wife has poached whole with fennel and then they filleted it. Moist and tasty Dessert - great cappuccino and home made biscotti - really good. Coctsils a bit expensive at$27 (including tip) and overall, just ok. Fantastic ambience on patio, great eergy and vibe without bring noisy. Very friendly and mostly attentive wSit staff. High recommendation for authentic Italian. (written on my iPhone)
