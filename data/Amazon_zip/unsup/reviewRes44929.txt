It's Chicago deep-dish pizza, so how can it be any better!? Giordano's is, all in all, pretty good. It's somewhat similar to Edwardo's in Hyde Park, which is fine with me because I'm a big fan of Edwardo's.  This place has lunch specials that consist of individual-size deep dish pizzas that come out of the oven pretty quickly, so if you don't want to wait an hour for pizza then you can eat quickly. The service here is pretty good and pretty consistent, but it can get very, very busy. All in all, this is a pretty good pizza place!
