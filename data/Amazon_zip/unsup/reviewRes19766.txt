Rick Bayless! We got to see him working in the kitchen and he even walked by our table - I was soclose to him I could have reached out and touched his hair if I were that creepy. It's awesome to see a super successful and famous chef still getting his hands dirty (not literally I'm sure his hands are always very clean) at his local restaurant. But now on to the food:  Chips and guacamole - fresh, crisp and delicious! Chicken pozole - my least fav dish :( tasted like there was too much of one herb in the soup although I can't figure out what it is. sorry rick bayless but i'm gonna have to give this one to my bf's mom. Ahogada torta - yummy although the sauce was a little on the vinegary side Churros - unbelievably DELICIOUS!! like heaven melted in your mouth Hot chocolate - i'm sure this was really authentic and well-made but personally I thought it was a little too thick Not everything was perfect but the dishes I liked were REALLY good. Will most definitely be back for the chips/guac, tortas and the churros!
