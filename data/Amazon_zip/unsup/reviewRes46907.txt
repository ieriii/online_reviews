Visited this place with my family after much fanfare from my dinner club (the one dinner club I missed). And they were right, this place is worth finding someone with a car to drive my butt up to Edgewater.  - Mediteranian app was a great start and hint of what was to come- warm babaganoush, hummos, and mint tzatziki, with toasted pita points and marinated olives (my fave). All seasoned perfectly. - I had the "fried" chicken but removed the skin to a perfectly plump, juicy breast with the best succotash (veggie mix) I've had in a while. So good. - Mom had the bacon wrapped meatloaf (to raves) - BF had the braised beef and I snuck a taste of his mashed potatoes. Delish! Great beer selection, my mom ordered two of their fresh watermellon mojitos (that means it's really good) and the decor was very tastefull and inviting. The place also managed to appear child-friendly and there was a stage for bands to play. That, plus the rooftop garden (for true organic fresh veggies in the dishes) proved that this place had it all. Oh, and one of us commented that it was the best waiter we've ever had. Not the cheapest meal I've had in a while but definitely you get much more than you pay for with Uncommon Ground. A+ I'll be back next time I'm in the hood.
