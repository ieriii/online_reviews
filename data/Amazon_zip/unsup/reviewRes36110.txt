Much much better the second time around. Here's what changed: 1) The crazy blonde girl wasn't there and I pray to whatever controls this universe that she was fired because she was a nasty awful girl filled with hostess hate. 2) We got there at about 9:30, which got us seated immediately and without harrassment (see #1) 3) The Halloween specials were tremendous including the pumpkin pancakes and mummy skillet To summarize, 2nd time was as close to perfect as could be. If I was trendy or hip, I'd have foodie type comments but I don't know what a whisk is or where truffle oil comes from so just enjoy the delicious food.
