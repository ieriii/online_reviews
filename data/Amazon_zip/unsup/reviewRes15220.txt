This place probably doesn't need any more reviews, but I couldn't resist leaving the 1,000th. (Is there some kind of prize for that, yelp?) I've been to speakeasies in West Michigan, and they don't hold a candle to this place. Without a sign or highly visible door, it's easy to pass. And I love their rules! It was so nice to not be surrounded by everyone playing on their cell phones. If you're tired of your SO ignoring you for a cell phone, bring him or her here for date night. Sit at the bar and watch them make the drinks--I was mesmerized. It's like a show. Our bartender seemed highly competent (although a bit reticent when we asked for suggestions, maybe this isn't that kind of place) and mixed me a Balaton deliciously. Drinks are $12 each, and they have appetizer-sized dishes ranging from $5 to $8. We tried the herb gnocchi for $6: fantastic. I will certainly return.
