So here it is Restaurant Week so lets go try something new. Mr. Man said check the list for a Brazilian Steakhouse. So here we go. Out of the 300 restaurants of Restaurant Week he wants that. Don't tell him but I am happy with his choice. As a non-meat eater I am always banished to the salad bar of Brazilian Steakhouses. I could not be happier!! This was by far the BEST salad bar I have been to. Ready? goat cheese, artichoke hearts, orzo salad, quinoa salad, smoked provolone, sushi, ahi tuna, HOT rice, beans, mushrooms, fish and of course all the salad stuff. But hello? ahi tuna??!?! My only complaint is the layout. They are in a pretty big space but for some reason the salad bar is at the front of the restaurant and not in the middle. So while Mr. Man sat and gorged himself on every cut of meat possible I burned 500 calories hoofing it up to the front. I will say that we made a reservation on a Friday night 30 minutes earlier hence the back table but I still feel they should have placed it in the middle. But for sure next time Mr. Man says Brazzaz I will be shouting for Texas De Brazil. Worth it. Even for a pescatarian.
