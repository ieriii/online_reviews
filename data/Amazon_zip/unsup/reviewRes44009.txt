I was a bit skeptical of Kinzie Chop House having walked by it a few times.. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but I'm glad I tried it. Compared to other steakhouses I think the cuts of meat are at least the same size, if not bigger and very well prepared. They have a good flavor to them, unlike some steakhouses where the steak just tastes like cooked meat. The price is more reasonable than say Ruth's Chris or somewhere comparable and the wine selection is very thorough. We went during Valentine's day and on top of the great service we received complimentary champagne and chocolates. Why Kinzie has not become more prominent in the steakhouse "scene" I'm not sure, but it's a great little secret!
