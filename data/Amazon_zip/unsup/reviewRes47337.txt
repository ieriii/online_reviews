First off I try to avoid any place during peak hours. I am not interested in seeing who is out, I am not interested in what is cool. Lockdown is pretty cool, especially on Mondays, 1/2 price on most burgers, $1.75 PBR, Burger beer in cans. That my friends means you can get one hell of a burger with really soggy ass fries and shitty beer for $20.00 I had the make your own, sharp cheddar, caramelized onions and apple wood smoked bacon medium rare and that was delivered perfectly Med rare! My fries were an abomination, soggy, oily, salty. My girl had some burger with carnitas, avocado and queso fresco also med rare, this burger was excellent, it really shined next to the soggy slimy shitty fries. Cheep beer was a perfect accompaniment because it was cheep.  Even though I am complaining about the fries i am sure if you mentioned your fries were the worst shit ever, they would make you new ones. I was not that interested in the fries so I let it slide hence the 4 stars. I have been to Lockdown before and they have a very good beer list, but sometimes you just don't have the scratch. Mondays there is no better deal in town. Don't forget Fridays is free beer for anyone with an earplug and a sleeve tattoo! Kidding, they would go broke with that kind of insanity.
