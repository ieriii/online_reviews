I'll give a mixed review to this one. First of all the parking space is small but you can get a spot for sure. They open late I think until 4 A.M. ? Divided booths that provide a little bit of privacy. Serving Kirin Beer which is great. I forgot the Korean name of what we ordered but it's marinated beef for BBQueing. The BEST part is when the waitress served different small side dishes in front of you. Although she dropped those saucers like a group of drunk aliens landing on your table, the combination of different colors and textures is so appetizing. Then the main aircraft came in, a plate of marinated beef and a container filled with live charcoal. Be very watchful if you have kids trying to join the fun 'cause they wont refund your money if someone's get burned. THE WAIT IS NOT BAD. THE SERVICE IS PATHETIC. THE FOOD IS SO GOOOOOOOD. THE PRICE IS REASONABLE. THE ATMOSPHERE IS VERY BBQUEY.
