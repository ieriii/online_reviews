I remember going here about 2 1/2 year ago. Although I can't remember what all I ordered aside from Tuna Roll and the Tuna Tartare: tuna cubes in ginger wasabi sauce with sesame chip. I feel that it speaks volumes that I still remember vividly the name of the restaurant and my favorite item that I ordered off the menu. But I must say both of them ..especially the Tuna Tartare were not only uber fresh but extremely good. I know I had a few more roll, especially because I remember dropping about $40 bucks on my to-go order.  SN: There is a long story intertwined with this, but the reason it gets 4/5 starts is because on a Sunday is when I went, and I called to find out what time they closed thinking that I would be able to enjoy the ambience and drink some warm sake since the receptionist said they were open until midnight. And when I got there and 9:40p.m. I was told that the person was mistaken because they closed at 10p.m. and stopped seating people at 9:30p.m. So I wasn't too happy about carrying all that food back to Midland. Bottom Line: I know for a fact if I ever find myself back in the Chi, I will not be leaving until I get to experience Coast Sushi Bar in it's entirety! Believe that!
