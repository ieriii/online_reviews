Ill keep this short. The food is amazing. I went with a great group of friends and we got one big family style platter and it was amazing. We had a yelp coupon and so it was an awesome deal too. Ill be back, many many times. There was live music too, although this could be improved since it was just a guy on a keyboard playing strange music. And I don't think it was "ethiopian" music. Service was nice, only one bathroom but I guess they were working on the other one. It was busy, so make a reservation on the weekends. If you can, find a great group of friends like I did.
