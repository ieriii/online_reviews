Highly recommend the Grand Lux Cafe. I went here with my family to celebrate, they don't take reservations, but we only had to wait 15 minutes when we got there at 5:30 on a Saturday night. The atmosphere is fun, the service was phenomenal and the food was very delicious! They have very large portions, so I ended up taking over half my food home. It was a GREAT experience!
