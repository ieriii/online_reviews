I'm a fan. Great brews that rival any local Chicago brew-pub but the food is about 5x better than those other spots. I had the pork, my wife had the meatloaf and now we can't wait to go back. The prics are reasonable and I've always been a fan of the "Growler to Go" option with many local brew-pups, so since Revolution is not far from my house it has become a fav of mine.
