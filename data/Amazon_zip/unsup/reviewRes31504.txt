3.5 stars. First off, this place is very trendy and BEAUTIFUL inside. Seriously, if you want to impress, this is a great place to go! The menu is extensive and I loved the variety and everything looked liked it would be SO yummy... but I was a tad disappointed in some of the dishes, I will have to admit. Or maybe my expectations were just a little too high going in since I have heard many rave reviews. Overall, it was pretty good but not exceptional, and it was a bit pricey at the end of everything for what you get. We ordered a bunch of plates to share, which was what was recommended... it is my favorite way to dine! Here is what was on our menu: Brussel Sprout salad - yummy, definitely different and tasty Rock Shrimp - delicious, the shrimp were a bit small but the flavor was great. Sliced Kobe Beef Carpacciao - It is kobe beef, how can you go wrong? So tender and fatty, the way I like it! Pork Belly - WAY too salty. It was almost hard to eat Seabass - The fish was good but not great and the side of cauliflower was just weird... too mushy Green Beans - a nice side dish Oxtail Potstickers - was nicely pan-fried and I liked the tender ox-tail, but I thought it was an odd filling for the dumpling. Maybe just not used to it. Duck Hash - It was honestly just okay... and what was the hash? I thought there would be something with potatoes, and I also didn't taste a daikon cake. It was a good tasting of food for 5 people, and we left satisfied but not totally full. And it is a "night out" place since it is so trendy and $$. I would love to go back but next time I will definitely try the sushi rolls.
