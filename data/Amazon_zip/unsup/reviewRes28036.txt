So last night I ate at GE at the bar. Let me say that my overall impression is that the food seems good, but not fantastic. I'm not dying to go back any time soon. I sat at the bar, and the bartender was a joy as is the cocktail menu. For food I had the fried pickles which are fried pickle spears served with a buttermilk ranch dipping sauce, I also had the kobe beef tartare which I thought could have used a little more acid to it, but was otherwise quite good, and the buffalo chicken which was about as bland as can be.
