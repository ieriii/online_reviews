A bunch of us decided to go on a Friday night before painting the town blue (or red?). Waited in line for 45 minutes behind a thick curtain in side some nondescript dingy area. Finally got seated, ordered food and drinks and waited...and waited. A while later, food came. Absolutely amazing! Begrudgingly, I was willing to give this place a chance. Then the drinks came...I have never tasted anything so complex, flavorful, and wonderfully alcoholic in my life. I know that sounds like an exaggeration but it's not--the best drinks I have ever had are from this establishment. I watched a bartender make a drink from scratch and it took him about 10 minutes to measure, construct, taste, and serve. And he was going at a frantic pace! Do not be desuaded by the long wait and pricey items, this place is worth every minute and every dollar. Also, they have different punch bowl offerings that are around $30 or so but contain 8-10 servings. They are the "penny-saver" items.
