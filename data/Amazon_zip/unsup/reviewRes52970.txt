Parking at 90 Miles was surprisingly challenging on a Tuesday night, but once inside you realize why it was so. When you first walk in, the main dining area looks like a takeout joint with the open kitchen and fast-food joint decor, but the majority of the dining tables and seating were located in the all-season outdoor tent and busy. There's an interesting faux fireplace that warms the entire tent and a large flat screen television over We shared several tasty appetizers and entrees--the portions are very generous. The pork tamal appetizer was fresh, moist and delicious, the yuca fritas had a great texture, and the trio plate of empanadas (guava, chorizo and beef) were scrumptious. Of the three entrees (fried pork, lechon and rabo), rabo which was stewed Cuban-style oxtail was my favorite. Each came with sides of blackened rice and maduros or white rice, blackened beans and maduros. The prices were reasonable and the restaurant is a BYOB.
