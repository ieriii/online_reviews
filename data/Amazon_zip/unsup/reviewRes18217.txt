This is our Italian place now.  The best parts are BYOB and fresh homemade pasta. We tried this place because I love homemade pasta. It really makes such a big difference! We had the gnocchi (tomato cream sauce filled with basil and gongozola) and the pasta with creamy carbonara. They were so delicious that I want to go back now! I also really really like the bread where they give you garlic, red pepper and grated parmasan cheese. What a great idea and it was so good.
