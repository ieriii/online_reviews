I went on a Friday with a reservation for a friend's birthday. Even with a reservation, we had to wait at least 20 minutes. As a hostess for four years (high school/college job), this always pisses me off. Once we were seated, it took forever to get our wine opened, forever to get menus, forever to order appetizers, and forever to order food. It would have been all well and good if we simply had the wine right away. I understand Fridays are busy, and I can wait for a very long time if slightly sedated. The steak was disappointing. I was sharing with a friend and we ordered medium rare at her request. Medium rare is the most well done I like my steak, and it came out medium well. Gross. Chewy, a little dry, poorly seasoned... nothing special. Then, when we finally wanted to leave, it took forever to get the bill. Three hours of dining for a bland steak.
