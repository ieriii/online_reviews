I got a little worried after reading the most recent reviews. But they all seemed to complain about the service and somewhat about the food. Well, I thought they were all a bit off. I had a great meal last night, and living near a hipster neighborhood in Brooklyn, the service was no different than I get back home, so I was accustomed to the blaze attitude.  But it really was the food that shined as the star here. The wife and I started with the yellow-tail crudo which was light and refreshing. Following this was the delicious soft shell crab with a tomato cucumber salad. Then came the fig salad with burrata, so tasty. The dishes progressively got better, until....the Ham Chop...it was Legen....wait for it...dary! This thing was one of the most amazing combinations of ham, sauce, peaches and pecans ever created.  The beverage program is focused heavily on beer. I grabbed a draught selection of a summery pale ale and the wife had a belgiuan wheat.  It is definitely worth the trip for the food. Another notable dish seen on many other tables was the chicken and fries. Looked yummy.
