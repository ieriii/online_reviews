Sorry - nothing appealing here. Getting past Garcia's college cafeteria atmosphere and the "Who's on First" service, the food should be the reason to come here. It's not. Tasteless chips - the kind I suffered through for nine years of terrible Mexican restaurants in New York City. The cheapest bag of chips at Treasure Island has more flavor. The salsa matched the chips - bland and boring. Our food portions were good size, but very ordinary. Yes, I could taste the chicken in the enchilada. And in the collapsed taco. But no personality to the beans, tasteless rice, etc, etc. Even generous splashes of their generic-Tabasco sauce didn't help.  Bulk food at reasonable prices - that's their niche. The Dos Equis was good - and cheap.
