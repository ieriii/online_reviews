My wife and I attended a wedding in Chicago last week and stayed at the new radisson Blue Aqua hotel. They're building one in our home town of Minneapolis, and we wanted to see what it would be like. It was fantastic! Incrediblly beautiful building,and remarkably chic rooms. Everybody has a number one priority in hotels, and mine is having a perfectly quiet room. This was remarkable in that regard. You'd never know that anyone else was on the floor, and yet we could see that every room had a Do Not Distrub sign on the door. Another high priority is a good work-out room. Many top of the line hotels have exercise facilities that contain only a few manchines....the Radisson Blue ha was seemed like acres of state of the art machines...and even an indoor track (which was good, because it wss rainng.)We expected to see a glamorous new hotel, and we did, but the reason I'll go back is the guarantee of a quiet night's sleep, and the incredibly good exercise facilities.Our stay ws a delight.
