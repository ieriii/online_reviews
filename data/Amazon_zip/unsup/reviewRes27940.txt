Unlike most of the reviews of this place, I am reviewing the thin crust pizza instead of the pan. The thin crust is very good--not too crackery, with just the right bit of chewiness. The toppings are yummy and plentiful, and the sausage and mushroom combo is my favorite. What's weird though, is that Pequod's is the ONLY pizza I've ever eaten that I add salt to. One would think that between the cheese, sausage, and pepperoni it would be almost too salty, but no! Bizarre, but true for me every time I've had it.
