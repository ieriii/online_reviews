I love the food at Chicago Diner, even though it seems a little expensive. The service, though, will keep me from eating there again. It has been poor and inefficient in the past, but my last trip took the cake. I was told to wait in a cold vestibule while my friend parked the car. This would be understandable in a busy restaurant, but the diner was half-full and there was plenty of room for me to wait without disturbing the diners. Also, as I entered at 9:15 I was told brusquely that the restaurant closed at 10:00 and that they didn't seat incomplete parties. I know they often have a wait and are in demand, but who is going to discourage diners in a half-empty restaurant in late December during a recession?
