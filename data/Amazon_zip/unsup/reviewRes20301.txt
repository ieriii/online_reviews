When I booked my flights to visit my friend in Chicago, we immediately made plans to go to Xoco. As much as I would love to go to Frontera or to Topolobompo, we thought we'd keep it relatively simple and go with Mr. bayless' tortas. First off, he WAS THERE! In SF, the celebrity/chef owner hasn't really been around unless its a new opening. I was so pleasantly surprised to see Rick standing 3 feet away from me. We ordered the churros w/ soft serve to share, which was delicious! The churros weren't greasy feeling and were light. The soft serve "dip" was perfect for a hot summer day. I got the cochinita pibil torta, forgetting that habanero salsa means really spicy. I put a little too much salsa onto the first bite and had to wait a bit to let the fire in my mouth go down, but the rest of the torta was great. Fantastic flavor and textures w/ the pickled onions and a wonderfully crusty bread. I also got their hibiscus lemongrass drink, which was refreshing and perfect for the day. Now I need to get my raise so I can eat at one of Rick's other restaurants!
