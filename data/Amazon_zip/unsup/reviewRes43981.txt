I came here during Yelp Eats Week, and I am a huge fan. I wanted to try something different from my usual hub of restaurants, and Eats week was the perfect opportunity to branch out. Just a note, I'm not a steak person, so this review is based on fish. The food was very good. I enjoyed the bruschetta appetizer, and friends enjoyed the calamari. Both were very good. The pan seared mahi mahi was done to perfection. It was a nice meaty fish, with a lot of flavor. I especially liked the chocolate cake at the end, it was a great finishing touch. I ate way to much food that night, but that's what eats week is about, right? :)
