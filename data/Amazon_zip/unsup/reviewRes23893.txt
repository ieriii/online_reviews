Mmmm ... crepeie. I've been to Icosium Kafe twice now -- once for a girls night out and once for brunch -- and have been completely pleased both times. The wait staff was friendly and attentive, the savory and sweet crepes were both out-of-this-world, and the little touches (such as the paper umbrella in my raspberry-nutella crepe or the cucumber slices in my iced water) didn't go unnoticed. I will definitely be back!
