EVERYTHING I DISLIKE ABOUT LINCOLN PARK This place reminds me of all the things I dislike about Lincoln Park. Crowded, overpriced, no parking, sub-par food, and filled with bug-eyed glasses-clad, LV purse-clutching chicks a few pitchers of margaritas away from oblivion. The margaritas are good, but nothing special. The food is forgettable and they messed up my order TWICE. I ordered chicken enchiladas and got steak. Sent it back and then got 1/2 chicken and 1/2 steak. I give up. On Lincoln Park and on Mexican food in Chicago.
