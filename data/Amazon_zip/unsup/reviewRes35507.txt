I have never had a bad time at this restaurant. Shaw's is a wonderful place that is broken down into two different types of restaurants. The fine dining side and the oyster lounge.  They have the best selection of oysters in the city. Their crab cakes are made with lump crab meat and small amounts of filling. The lobster bisc is incredible and so is the calmarie, which is lightly battered (It doesn't come out with more fried batter than squid). What surpised me the most was the sushi...it ranks with some of the best in the city.  I recommend coming here for the 3rd-5th date or with some friends and sitting on the oyster lounge side. Get a bottle of wine, a dozen of oysters, a sushi platter, and then split some crab cakes.
