I love this place! My friends & I found this place by accident. We were sick of waiting in lines to get into a bar on St. Patty's Day and well this place was right next door and no one was in there. We've been going back ever since. The wait staff are so friendly!! You have 3 people taking care of you and they remember you every time you go back. Their food is delicious. I'm a big fan of their chimichanga's and their pineapple margaritas. I love Tuesday & Thursday's there because their marges are half off!! Definitely have to get there early on those days because the place is packed! I've read reviews on how pricey this place is. I think its reasonable priced! Its cheaper then Tarasca's or Uncle Julios for sure!
