Spicy chinese! Love it!  The eggrolls are de-lish. So are the crab rangoon. Ordered the Sichuan Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Chicken Fried Rice. The Sichuan Chicken was wonderfully spicy without me having to preface just how spicy I wanted it. I love spicy foods. I wasnt really impressed with the Mongolian beef but it was still very tasty. The chicken fried rice was a bit soggy and over bean sprouted. I think I got more bean sprouts in a bite than rice.  Overall, the servers were really helpful and I havent had any complaints. I've been here 3 times already and just found time to write my review today.
