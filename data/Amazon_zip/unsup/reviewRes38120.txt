Classic Chicago deep dish. One slice will feed a small army. This place is filled with tourists, but its nice for that really classic Italian vibe with checkered table cloths and cold beers. We shared a 10" deep dish with spinach and mushrooms. It was super cheesy, but mild (in a good way) and didn't seem too greasy. I do wish there was a little more sauce and that the crust was more substantial, but still good. I still like Lou's better.
