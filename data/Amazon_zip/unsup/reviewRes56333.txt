Getting lunch for under $20 for two people, which includes a drink, salad, soup, entree, starch and fresh fruit for dessert is unbelievable. My boyfriend and I went here before a trip to the Lincoln Park Zoo...it's in comfortable walking distance and the food is so good. He had the veggie curry, I had the sate chili calamari...both were AMAZING, the calamari in particular. The food is fresh, flavorful and the service is friendly. Great for a date, lunch with friends or dinner with a big group, because it's BYOB!
