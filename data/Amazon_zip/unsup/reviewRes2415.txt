I'm going to be the negative reviewer for Hot Doug's. I waited in a 2.5 hour line on my Birthday for what I thought was going to be the best hot dog I've ever had. Not only were they out of what I went there for, but when I asked for cheese, it was cheez whiz, not sprinkled cheeze like I imagined and it totally ruined the dog. Maybe it was a bad day, it was a Holiday weekend, but I was just disappointed and was hoping for so much more. I want that 2.5 hours of my life back, lol.
