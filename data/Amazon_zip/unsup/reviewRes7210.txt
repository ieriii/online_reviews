I'd have to agree with most of the reviews and say that this place has GREAT food and service. Our server was John, and he was great all around. We went there for a birthday party and all of us seemed to enjoy it. The only problem was that the private room was tiny and we had to split up and sit at different tables. It would have been nice to sit together and enjoy our meals together, but I guess it's understandable given the size of the room. I ordered the grilled calimari, mussels in white sauce, and the milk and honey ribs. All were awesome! My girlfriend ordered the caprese salad and the bass filet and those were great too.. This is a place I would visit again, and I think you should give it a try if you're looking for an Italian restaurant with great food and service.
