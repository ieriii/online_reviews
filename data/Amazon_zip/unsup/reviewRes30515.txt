My experience (and my colleagues -- we were there on a business lunch) was ruined by a very odd visit from the manager, who was responding to my nut allergy info passed on by our waiter. The manager wanted me to know that I had no reasonable expectation of having a nut free meal, because Frontera is a "live kitchen" -- they use a lot of knives, they grind a lot of things, there's a distinct possibility that this equipment could be use to cut/grind something with nuts, and then be used for my meal. He asked me if I had an epipen on me "just in case." Then he told me that he couldn't assure me that there would be no nuts in my food, and if I chose to eat there I was doing it "at my own risk." And his demeanor was kind of scolding. The message was -- look, it's unreasonable for you to come in here and try to eat safely (he kept using the phrase "live kitchen") but if you do and something bad happens -- well shame on you for coming in the first place! I've never had anybody treat me that way -- and I've never had a restaurant basically say Hey -- you have an allergy? Too bad. This seems to be a policy change (or at least an atmosphere change) because the last several times I've been to Topo, at least, the manager has guided me to safe foods and it's been fine. Maybe because of that -- the food was ok, but not worth the lecture on "live kitchens" from the manager.
