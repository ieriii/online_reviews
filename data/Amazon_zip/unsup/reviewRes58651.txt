WORST BLOODY MARY EVER!!!!If a good bloody mary (or two) is an integral part of your brunch experience, skip Nana. Their bloody mary is a simply awful concoction based on pablano pepper/pickle juice. We discussed it with our server who said that the chef has stubbornly defended this drink in the face of multiple customer complaints saying Why would we want to be like everyplace else?  ummmmm, maybe because it's better to give people what they want than to make a sucky version of a classic drink. Get over how hip you are and offer a classic bloddy as an alternative to your terrible house bloddy mary.The food was good, but overpriced. If you go, stick to the main menu and avoid the specials.  The specials kind of follow the bloody mary experience, the chef showing us how cool they are by screwing around with classics....and not doing it very well.A good seetting, a good idea, but one that misses the mark. By trying to stand out, they in fact, made themselves mediocre.
