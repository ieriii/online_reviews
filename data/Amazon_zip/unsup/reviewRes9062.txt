We went here for restaurant week. It was good I had the banh cuon, ga xao XA ot and Banana wonton. banh cuon Steamed Vietnamese ravioli of chicken & mushrooms,with chili lime garlic sauce : It was ok just seemed like a steamed dumpling to me and I never tasted the mushrooms. I tasted a lot of bamboo shoots. ga xao XA ot Wok-seared lemongrass chicken breast strips with PORTOBELLO mushrooms, & a basil chili sauce: Tasted like any other Asian woked chicken. There was nothing that really stood out. I did not taste the chili sauce. Crispy banana wonton With crme anglaise & DARK CHOCOLATE SAUCE. Was the most delicious part of the meal. It was nice to try someplace different however now that I have I will not be going back. I was not impressed by the hostess when I called to confirm the reservation the night of. She seemed to not be able to find my name when I had made the reservation on Open table and confirmed with someone over the phone.
