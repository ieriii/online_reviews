We ventured in for Sunday brunch to check the place out. We called ahead to find out hours and how busy and it was recommended to have a reservation (which he made). Upon arrival, everyone was friendly and helpful. Even though we were a bit early and the kitchen wasn't opened, our waitress greeted us and got us drinks. The fresh squeezed juice was very fresh and tasty (and not too much pulp). We both ordered the red wine poached eggs (their version of eggs benedict), the side of hash browns and shared their maple bacon. My boyfriend told me that my eyes were bigger than my stomach - but with the food here, I was up for the challenge. The poached eggs in red wine were different but really tasty and served over toasted sourdough bread. The meal also came with fresh greens and tasty, lean, proscuitto. Yummy!!! My eyes were probably bigger than my stomach and yet I couldn't put my fork down. It was a laid back and cool atmosphere. As it got more crowded, it got to be very loud and might not be the best place after a late night out. It is also a bit more pricey for brunch, but well worth it once and a while. A note: they have some nice outdoor seating as well.
