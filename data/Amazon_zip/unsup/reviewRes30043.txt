This was the restaurant I had been lusting after in Chicago for 4 years, but I can't say that it fulfilled my expectations. The service was great and the atmosphere was unpretentious, but the food wasn't as flavorful as I had anticipated. However, the presentation of the food was very nice. I think if my hopes weren't so high, I would have given it 4 stars. Still a must eat if you're in Chicago.
