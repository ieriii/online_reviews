Perhaps it's me or perhaps the days I am going there but I've never been impressed by Rick's cooking.  I think he stretches the bounds of traditional Mexican cooking which is how he bills Frontera.  My recent visit was today with a good sized group for lunch.  We started with guacamole for the table. The guac was good, but for the cost and the place, I was expecting better. It pales in comparison to Adobo's table side guac.  A few folks had the tortilla soup but they mentioned it was very much like french onion.  For lunch, I had pork tacos made al pastor style.  These were not anything like al pastor - they were dry, not flavorful, lacking the pineapple relish and I had to ask for limes.  The refried beans that came with the dish were the highlight of the meal.   A few folks had the seafood stew which they said reminded them of cioppino and looked good and they said tasted good. To top it off, (as I noticed at other places) service was slow with the group.  I've noticed this happen at many places when the tip is guaranteed.  It took 90 minutes for having lunch which downtown seems like an eternity.
