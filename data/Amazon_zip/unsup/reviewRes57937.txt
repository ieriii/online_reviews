Good bread and good polentaEverything else poor quality. Stuffed chicken was greasy and strangely spiced.Coupon for $50 off menu for $20 wound up costing an additional $33.00 for a total I'd $53.00 out of pocket.Will never go back and will unsubscribe Yelp for ridiculous 4 1/2 star rating of this restaurant .Also felt 18% tip for mediocre service was  Over the top
