I happened to go during the Stanley Cup finals, where the place was packed with people watching the game. I sat outside which was a really nice area, but the tables are a bit close together. The pulled pork was not was tender as I would have liked, but the fries were good. Come here for solid bar food. I get that it was packed on the day I went, but the staff member taking reservations for indoor seating was really rude. Luckily, the hostess for the outdoor area was great and very friendly.
