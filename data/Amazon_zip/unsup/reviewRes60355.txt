I have always been a fan of Giordano's and this review is NOT for their pizza, because it is always delicious, but it's for the treatment that we had. I ate here with a business convention group of about 10 people. It was in the middle of the day at around 2pm and honestly, we could not get our waiters attention even if we searched and asked around. We had two extra guests come and they were waiting for 20 minutes for the waiter to notice and bring extra chairs and plates. The thing is, they were not even busy so it doesn't make sense why it took another 20 minutes for our water to come. Maybe this location is not good or just this waiter, but it was just unacceptable service. but don't get me wrong, the pizza is always amazing, this review is solely for the service.
