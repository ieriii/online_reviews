Simply It? Simply delicious! Ordered two banh mi (veggie and tilapia), octopus salad, chicken dumplings and bubble teas via grubhub. Shortly after placing our order, they called to let us know they were out of octopus, so we subbed in the beef salad. Everything was FRESH - no frozen potstickers or hard baguettes here. Gigantic bubble teas made with real fruit.The beef in my salad was seared, a pleasant surprise for me, but if you prefer your steak cooked medium or more, make sure to ask. Very refreshing change from staples like thai & sushi!
