Hate to say it, but it reminds me of the Cheesecake factory, although everything is a dollar or two more expensive. I think it's own by the Cheesecake Factory too. But anyways... The restaurant has a great ambiance, but the menu is reflective of most restaurants in the same genre as The Grand Lux. We had a great waiter who was very attentive and helpful when we asked specifically for different sides and such. And, the food was delicious. I had the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich. My friend had the chicken pot pie which looked great, however, he didn't like it after a few bites and said it tasted odd. In addition, my other friend had an allergic reaction to it because she has a nut allergy. My other friend had the Asian chicken salad, and chicken alfredo pasta. Why 4 stars? My friend had an allergic reaction to the chicken pot pie because of her peanut allergy. We had asked if there was supposed to be nuts in there, but the waiter reassured us that no nuts were in the pot pie. And so we asked for a manager . She came by and told us that the pot pie was cooked in an oven and prepared on a table that was not near the handling of nuts. Of course, that doesn't matter since my friend, in fact, had an allergic reaction. In the end, the manager didn't do anything for us at all, not even take a percentage of the bill off like a sympathetic person would do. However, the rest of us thought our food was great. I will return here soon.
