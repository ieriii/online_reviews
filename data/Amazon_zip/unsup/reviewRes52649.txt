I received a Brazzaz twofer coupon in the mail so tonight took a friend there to dinner. When I made the reservation I was asked "Will you be using a coupon?". When the hostess seated us she asked "Will you be using a coupon?". When the waiter greeted us he asked "Will you be using a coupon?". The value of our two dinners without the coupon would have been about $100 so my intention was go give a $15 tip although our check with twofer came to about $50. When the check arrived it included the cost of the dinners, tax, and a $14.50 "gratuity"---plus a line for me to write in the "tip". If the purpose of the mailed coupon was to give me a nice feeling about the restaurant, the ploy was sabotaged by what happened at the restaurant, and I will remain ever-true to Fogo, sans coupon.
