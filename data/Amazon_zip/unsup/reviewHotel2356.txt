We used Priceline to get a deal here - this was the most expensive hotel on my vacation, and it wasn't worth the extra cost, but everything costs more in Chicago anyway. Internet charges, bag hold charges, insane parking charges... these things are pretty standard for an expensive hotel (I'm paying more, so give me less! Logic!) Cheaper parking is available at surrounding garages for about $25 overnight. We did however LOVE that our two-bed room had two bathrooms. Greatest thing ever. We also got a decent view of the Sears Tower. If you get a good deal here, go for it.
