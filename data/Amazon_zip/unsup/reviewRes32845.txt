The first time we went here there was a slinky, jazz singer with huge sunglasses in a hand knit beret accompanied by a keyboardist performing by the door. Before dinner was served a loud, crazy guy barged in and screamed at some waitresses, ensuing them to call the police. All this was background to the quality of the food. We went for the: choose some veggies, meats and that can include a fish option option. All the choices were great, I really liked the fish. The extra Inerja is nice, cuz I always feel bad when I have to ask for more. Nice service, happy to have it in the neighborhood.
