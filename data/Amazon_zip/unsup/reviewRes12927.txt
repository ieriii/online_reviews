Hostess got a star knocked off by claiming she was giving us a "romantic" table, and trying to seat us between the silverware/water area and the check kiosk. Other than that, everything was amazing. The parking, $12 was reasonable, but keep in mind, they give a 20 minute wait to get your car. The waiters and servers are nice, very knowledgeable, and the decor is great. But the food, oh the food. The buffet was my favorite, fancy meats and cheeses, sushi, salads, and soups. Try the lobster bisque! The meats were amazing, with the bacon wrapped fillet mignon (sp?) was the winner of the night. Oh, and I could eat a whole meal of the goat cheese and the orange marmalade red pepper stuff. I would go back for lunch buffet in a heartbeat, but only because I am not much of a meat eater. Would also love to see more seafood.
