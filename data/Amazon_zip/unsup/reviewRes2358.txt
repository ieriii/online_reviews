If you are in to gourmet sausages, Hot Doug's is the place for you. Make sure you are ready to wait in line for periods of up to 2 hours outside. It's worth the wait people. Doug has the usual staple dogs on the menu and also rotates his specials on a weekly basis. There are many flavors to choose from and haven't had a sausage that I didn't devour yet.
