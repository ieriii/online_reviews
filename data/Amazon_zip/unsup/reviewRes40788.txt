45: minutes it took for us to get the first course! Yet... 20: minutes was the time count that it took the tables arriving after us to get their initial pheasant egg salad. Insert furrowed brow here. 4 or 7: number of courses you can choose from for your prix fixe meal. 1: bottle of wine we sipped over the meal. It could have easily been 2 bottles. BYOB!  3: hours the modest 4-course meal took. 3.5: number of bites each plate delivered. While it tasted good, it did not blow us away. In fact, the food was not even served hot; rather, it was room temperature, which was disappointing. So, in summary, to dine here, make sure that you have 3 things: time, money, and dining buddies you want to be around.
