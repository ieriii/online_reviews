I love Hot Doug's. I have been eating there pretty much since the day he opened his current location on California. My company, RIchardson Seating, manufactured his retro style chrome diner chairs. I actually prefer his regular fries, so I usually end up going on weekdays right when he opens. I would rather eat at an off time than wait in line. The sausages are fantastic. These are not your usual sausages. They have elk, boar, alligator, rib eye, and other non traditional sausages. There are specials all of the time so the menu is usually different each time you go back. They also carry your standard hot dogs and polish sausages. I usually split three sausages and a fry with one other person. The meal comes out to about $25.00 for both of us and that leaves us very stuffed. Most people prefer the duck fat fries so if you want to give them a try, make sure to go on a weekend.
