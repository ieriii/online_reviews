This place could very well be my new favorite restaurant. Went here two nights in a row - had to go again just to make sure it was real! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Well decorated and is actually quite intimate even though it is so loud inside. I guess my only complaint is that it is a bit too dark... can be difficult to read the menu. Definitely make a reservation or expect a wait. We lucked out both nights with seats at the kitchen bar and at the "communal" table. I ordered the truffle pasta, the butternut squash gnocchi, and the blackened cauliflower as a side dish. The truffle pasta was absolute favorite. Probably the only thing I'll order there from now on. Don't get me wrong - everything was amazing, that was just my favorite. I'll definitely be back. Also - check out Curio downstairs when you get a chance. It's pretty friggin sweet.
