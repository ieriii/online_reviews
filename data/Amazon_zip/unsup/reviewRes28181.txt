Loved it & can't wait to go back! My girlfriend and I decided to go the other night for dinner. After we got the chips, salsa, peppers and chicken soup we had to decide on what we wanted to actually eat for dinner. We couldn't make up our minds on just two entrees so we ordered three & split one as our appetizer. One was a wet burrito (smothered it in mole & cheese) my girlfriend had been trying to find since she left LA.  Even though it was our waitresses first day she did a good job, but did have to ask another waitress for help once to clarify what we wanted with regards to the wet burrito.
