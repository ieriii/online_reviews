Had people visiting. We had 40 min wait but the bar was great in meantime. There are many interesting items on menu. It is designed as small plates, so We ordered several items and shared them. Our server was outstanding! She answered questions and offered ideas. We mentioned we loved Brie so, although not on the menu for the cheese plate, she knew the chef had in back so brought it for us on our cheese plate. Definitely the best server I have encountered in Chicago since moving here almost a year ago. I work at luxury hotel on the northshore and have been spreading the word about my experience and the excellent service. iWould definitely go back.
