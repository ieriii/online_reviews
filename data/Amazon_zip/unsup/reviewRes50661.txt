I was at Big Jones on Saturday; I wanted a Beignet first and it was unclear whether you needed to order some or if they were on the way; after a transcendental moment of uncertainty I was going to ask the rushed waiter if I needed to place the order but he had them in hand. He could have easily said something like "Beignets are on the way" - I figured we were getting some as every table had them -it seemed to be un-even who got their Beignets. But alas I was happy to enjoy them. I ordered the Carolina Shrimp Burger which had far fewer shrimp than I would have liked to have had; seemed to be too have to many components that for me got in the way of enjoying the Shrimp; the fries were good especially for dunken in the Cajun sauce. Overall I thought the food was good but thought the service was challenged because there were not enough to service the brunch rush. Our waiter was pleasant but was seemingly rushed; I thought the price points a bit high. The flavors were a nice coastal Cajun expression transplanted to this north Chicago neighborhood.
