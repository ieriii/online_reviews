************* REVIEW 144 **************** I've been coming here for 8 years now for dinner & the cocktail at the bar. It's 1 of the most consistent family runs resto ever. This is also the best decor out of all 3 Le Colonial in San Francisco & New York. The food here is great, authentic & all their Northern Vietnamese dishes are wonderful. - GOI GA XOAI - Grilled chicken with mango, tomatoes, cucumber, & tamarind dressing - refreshing dish. - BO LUC LAC - shakin beef version - Salad of warm, seared filet mignon over watercress with red wine vinaigrette - excellent dish to try. - BANH CUON - Steamed Vietnamese ravioli of chicken & mushrooms, with chili lime garlic sauce - so authentic Vietnamese appetizer dish. - GA XAO XA OT - Wok-seared lemongrass chicken breast strips with portobello mushrooms, & a basil chili sauce - a MUST TRY dish, a bit spicy gives you that extra kick on the bite, very nice with jasmin rice. - CA NUONG LA CHUOI - Grilled trout with oyster mushrooms, dried mushrooms & cellophane noodles, served steamed in a banana leaf with curry sauce on the side - my FAV dish of all here for entree. The fish is buttery taste, the banana leave gives it this wonderful aroma, brings me back to my childhood in Vietnam. Overall: 4 stars For value 4 stars For Food: 4 stars For Service: 4stars For ambiance: bring you back to Vietnam during French Colony time. Romantic, exotic & welcoming. For location: 1 of the hottest spots of the Gold Coast.
