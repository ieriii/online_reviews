Tasty food at a restaurant you're treated like royalty!My fiance and I went here on our 1-year anniversary three months ago and I swore I would eventually create a Yelp account just for this review! I'm still thinking about that meal. What a treat Graham Elliot was!!! From start to finish, impeccable. We were greeted warmly at the door and treated like VIP guests. The hostess escorted us to our table, where the busboy promptly served us water out of a special bottle -- very swanky -- and left it at the table. After we ordered, the server brought us a little black basket of hot popcorn drizzled in butter and garlic with a dash of salt. All very impressive in the first five minutes!I ordered the Cesar Salad on recommendation -- it came out with the Romaine leaves whole, covered in Parmesan cheese and a greenish Cesar dressing! A bit strange at first glance but just succulent. For my main course, I chose the Short Ribs (also on recommendation from a friend) -- they just fell apart when I touched my fork to them! No need for a knife! And the little bed of mushrooms underneath were delicious -- and I don't like all mushrooms.For dessert... I don't remember what we had, but it was delicious, and for a desert drink I had some sort of sweet concoction served in a martini glass with a PRETZEL-DUSTED rim!And let me just say... each time one of us left to use the restroom, we came back to a perfectly folded napkin at our place setting. Too luxurious!As we were leaving, we were handed an autographed menu from the chef himself!Amazing music (by the way), great ambiance, top-notch service! Definitely go there to celebrate any of your special occasions, or just to treat yourself!!!
