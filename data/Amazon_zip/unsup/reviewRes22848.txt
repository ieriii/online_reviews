Greek Islands has been a semi-regular spot for me. I must have been there 10-15 times, and I've loved it each time. Good food, reasonably priced, and a fun atmosphere. The lamb dishes are really tasty and filling - the kokkinisto (braised lamb) is my favorite. Other dishes I've tried are the gyros (great), and the combination plate, which includes roast leg of lamb, mousaka, dolmades, meatball, vegetables, and potatoes (also very good). Some other things to try are the flaming saganaki cheese appetizer and the grilled octopus! (I'm actually a big octopus fan). The atmosphere is fun and lively (and somewhat casual, depending on time of day, etc.), and the different rooms in the restaurant each have a different feel. Finally, you simply cannot beat the free valet parking! I don't know many other restaurants that do that in Chicago.
