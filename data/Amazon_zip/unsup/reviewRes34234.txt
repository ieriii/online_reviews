I had a great brunch at Yolk! Usually I am not a huge brunch place person, but I was pleasantly surprised by Yolk's extensive selection. I opted for a Skillet dish, which was quite tasty! (Don't know if my hungry hungover state had to do too much with it...) The portion was quite filling and it came with a choice of an english muffin, toast, or pancakes. It was a cool atmosphere, too, really bright and open. But it was a little loud in there so be prepared to speak loudly. I would definitely go back!
