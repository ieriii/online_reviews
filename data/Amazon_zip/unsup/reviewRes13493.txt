I'm not a brunchie, never have been and, God willing, never will be. I went to Glenn's Diner for one reason--fish. Arrived on a Saturday afternoon (12:30) while the brunchies were slowly filtering out. Requested a table for 2 and was seated immediately. My friend and I were both pretty hungry so we didn't fool with the menu and ordered off the fresh fish board. Friend went with the Sea Bass, and I went with the Arctic Char. The 2 best fish dishes I have ever had in Chicago. Both were cooked perfectly, the Diablo sauce that came with my Char was perfection...a nice, tasty, heat. The dishes came with a potato pancake (a little soggy, but I really didn't care) and asparagus. Service was good. Ambience was pleasant. Fish is fresh and delicious. I will be back. Often.
