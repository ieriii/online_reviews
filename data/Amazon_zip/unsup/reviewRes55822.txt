This Place is Great! One of my Favorite Italian restaurants. They have awesome ribs special Sunday - Wednesday. I mean its pretty reasonable and you get a choice of soup or salad and a side of pasta with your order.Lasty, they have a huge Free Parking lot, which is kind of a rarity for a city restaurant.
