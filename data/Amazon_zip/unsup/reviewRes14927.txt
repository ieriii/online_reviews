This place is really really really good. My wife had the fettucini alfredo and I had manicotti. We both loved our meals. It's a little on the pricey side when the bill comes but if you think of what you get it's well worth it. I particularly like the oil and grated parmesan on the table. The pizza bread is awesome and the portions are enormous! You will have left overs! One thing I should point out that's very obvious is how authentic the sauces are! OH! I almost forgot the minestrone! It was so good I want it right now. Love Sabatino's! --Oh, Don't park in their parking lot, that's for valet only.
