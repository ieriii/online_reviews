We had the Sliced Beef and Maw Szechuan Style, Lamb with Cumin, Chicken w/ Three-Chiles, and stir-fried green beans. I'd absolutely recommend all but the first (just didn't enjoy it because of the high spice factor*), but if you're feeling less of a wuss--go for it. I loved the options we chose--great combination of flavors/textures and would definitely recommend being adventurous with the option available. I know next time it will be even harder to decide since we already have a couple of favorites but have so much more to try... *Full disclosure: I'm a tremendous wuss when it comes to truly spicy food, and found some of the food too much for my taste, but it was flavorful spicy, not just spicy like a dare...you dig?
