Not sure how it is that I haven't reviewed this place yet. This was pretty incredible. We did the 24 course menu, which is pretty much the same experience as everyone else has already reported. This is definitely molecular gastronomy in its purest form. I learned quickly that I am not nearly as much a fan of it as is my boyfriend, but regardless of whether you prefer the style, you should try alinea at least once in your life. Everyone needs to have this kind of experience to get a better understanding of the culinary arts in general. Incredible experience.
