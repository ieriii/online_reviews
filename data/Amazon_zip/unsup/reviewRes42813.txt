I can't even rate the food here because I never received it... I placed an online order one night after carefully reviewing the delivery boundaries that Fogo 2 Go listed on their website knowing that it was a bit of a hike from their restaurant to my place. After confirming that I was within the boundaries, I placed my order and then got a call about 40 minutes later saying that my food was ready but that they couldn't deliver to my house, despite what their website said. I asked them about their website's explicit delivery boundaries and they answered "yes, we need to fix this." Umm... shouldn't you have alerted me to this before you made all of my food? They tried to convince me to come pick it up, even offering a discount. This was a nice gesture, but I requested delivery because I live a half hour away via L and don't have a car... if I wanted to do carry out, I would have requested that. I also would have figured that since it was their mistake and the food was already made, they would have just sucked it up and delivered it this time so that they could avoid covering the cost of the food, but that was not the case. The clueless guy on the phone finally agreed to refund my money, but when I didn't see the refund a week later I called the restaurant again and spoke with a manager who had no idea that this whole incident had taken place and that I was promised a refund. She fulfilled that request shortly after we spoke, which I certainly appreciated, but the original experience and the poor response to it really left a bad taste in my mouth.
