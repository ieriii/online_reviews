The crepes were very good and there was a good selection of fillings when I went for a late lunch. I had the Icosium crepe which I got because it had goat cheese in it (my new favorite cheese... just edging out brie this week).  (NOTE: another reviewer said that the Icosium had feta but I think that was the Greek crepe.)  Also tasted some of the coconut and chocolate dessert crepe which was excellent. It's cool that this is an Algerian flared menu with french basics (I have only had crepes at French places so the change was welcome (the French colonized Algeria, right?)). I would say however that the service could have be better. I had to ask for water to be refilled which these days usually just happens without request, and the wait staff could have been friendlier. However it wasn't bad enough to keep me away for another visit.
