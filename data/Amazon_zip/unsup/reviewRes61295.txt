I was really excited about going here as I live in the South Loop and don't make it out here alot. The atmosphere was good, nice vibe and crowd. After that, it went down hill. The waiter was nice but not quick about taking our order or getting the food out. Our appetizers arrived just after the entrees. First, my fish was a whole fish. They would not fillet it and I ended up sending it back. The empanadas were okay but I would not re-order because it was just ok. As for my friend, he order plantain chips and they were awful. Deep fried hockey pucks. We each ate one and left the rest, really bad. My friend had the Cuban hamburger which he said was the best piece of seasoned meat he ever had and that he didn't need condiments because of it (good thing, since they didn't offer any). overall, a bad experience. Poor service, bad explanation of the food, mixed results on the food. I might give it another chance but only if I'm in the neighborhood and my friends overcome my objections.
