What a fun place! At first I was really overwhelmed by the line, but after awhile it really just became part of the experience. My friends and I started chatting with everyone in line and we all jsut got really excited about Hot Doug's!  The hot dogs are beyond amazing. I didn't even know gormet hot dogs could possibly exist before I went here -- but after going I can say with complete certainty that they do! All of the flavors and ingredients come together perfectly. My friends and I each ordered about 2-3 differnt kinds of hot dogs, cut them up, and sampled all the different kinds. My favorite was one that had saffron and smoked gouda. We also had the duck fat fries and they were absolutely amazing. I would reccomend this place to anyone looking for a fun and delicious Chicago experience but just make sure it's nice weather and you've got some time because the line goes wayyyyy out the door!
