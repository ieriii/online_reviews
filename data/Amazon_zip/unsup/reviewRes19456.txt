As promised, I did go back to try other things on the menu (besides the churros) and let me tell you that I don't like to add to the hype of a place-- in fact, I like to deflate the hype, but after eating a Pepito sandwich last night, I just can't bring myself to say anything bad about XOCO. Rick Bayless may have found himself a new fan. Now back to the Pepito--braised shortribs, caramelized onions, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos and tomatillo salsa on the side--whooooooaaaaa mama! Let's start with the bread--hollowed out toasted baguette, crunchy on the outside and soft from the shortrib juices inside. Shortribs--perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. Caramelized onions--I am NOT an onion person, I avoid onions like the plague--but these onions didn't taste like onion, they tasted like cabbage, I ate every single last piece. The pickled jalapenos and tomatillo salsa gave the whole thing a nice little kick! Guacamole and chips were fantastic, chips had a hint of lime and guacamole was tasty, smooth, and creamy. This time I paired my churros with an almond-flavored hot chocolate--good but a little too thick and syrupy for my taste. The almond flavor is really strong--it's an acquired taste. Service was excellent from the hostess who directed us to our seats to the bus boys who brought out the food and made sure we had everything we needed. Seating is extremely limited so I suggest going during the week--I didn't have to wait in line even at 6 pm. Luckily, some of the hype has died down so it's less crowded. Menu is small but for good reason, each item is packed with so many different flavors and done to perfection. I may become a regular here.
