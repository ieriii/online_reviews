So far, everyone who's reviewed this place has hit up the romantic card pretty hard, and I won't be one to disagree, but Geja's also proved to work well for a little meeting of the in-laws my husband and I hosted not too long ago. We had a table of 10 that night and the overall service was still impeccable! We waited at the bar for about 20 minutes until all of the party had arrived--the bar area isn't too large, but they offer crackers, pretzles and cheese while you wait, so who am I to complain? Between the live guitar and the friendly waitress, not to mention the enormous amounts of food we consumed, I can safely say the night was a complete success. For those who do seek a romantic dinner for two, I recommend making a reservation (especially for Valentine's Day--seriously, call a few months prior!). Also, go to the website and sign up for their mailing list. We regularly get discount coupons and that definitely keeps up coming back!
