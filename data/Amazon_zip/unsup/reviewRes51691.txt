This is the grungier little brother to the Garcia's on Lincoln Ave. All the food tastes pretty much the same , but it's kind of like a ghost town there. I've never been there when there were more than 5 people in there. It is way easier finding parking at this location , so at some point I would have easily switched alliances to this place from the Lincoln ave spot. The folks here just aren't consistent , sometimes the burritos were loaded with lettuce , sometimes there was little to no cheese on the refried beans. Look , the food tastes good , though not consistently so ,but the recipes are sound and I have no idea how service will be there any time you're there.
