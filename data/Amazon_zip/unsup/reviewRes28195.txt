I hit up this place after Top Chef Masters... obviously being impressed with Graham's performance on the show and his flavor selection. However, the service was definitely less than ideal and the food was just pretty good. I was the happiest with the truffle oil popcorn (which we had to ask for) and the split pea soup with the lilac-infused marshmallow. Yum.
