This is a tough one to rate. I say two stars for the room and six(!) for the view. I was here in mid-Oct for a conference and my company placed me here so I gave no idea of the price. The room itself wasn't particularly memorable. Better than a Motel 6 but less than a Hyatt. Good bed and furniture but a bit noisy with a janky sink and an old, stained bathtub. Ick. The location was good, not far from the train, subway, or Millennium Park. The convention center was a $10 cab ride away. Not sure if the hotels north of the river like near 'Miracle Mile' were better. The view was insane, though. I had a view straight down the river from the 31st floor. I've never had a view that spectacular. All my associates had better hotel rooms a few blocks north but they were all amazed with the view. It more than made up for the room quality.
