A friendly brunch place serving delicious food. I got the horseradish omelet with chicken sausage - definitely tasty. My boyfriend got the rib-eye sausage omelet which was delicious!! I definitely recommend getting a dish that contains one of their house-made sausages. The waitress made that recommendation to me, and after trying my boyfriend's rib-eye sausage omelet I wish I had taken her advice. The juices are great too!
