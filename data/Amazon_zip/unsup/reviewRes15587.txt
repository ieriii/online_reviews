Violet Hour is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. What I enjoy most is that they keep the bar dark, quiet, and only seat enough people per chair in order to avoid overcrowding. There are a wide range of specialty drinks to choose from which are fantastic, everything is made fresh at the bar. (I really like their selections of rye whiskeys). The servers also give great recommendations if you are unsure what to select due to the large selection. Be forewarned that the drinks tend to be very strong. Also expect to pay a premium as well, most drinks average between $10-$12.  I like to reserve Violet Hour for special occasions such as a date or outings with close friends. I highly recommend going on the weekdays versus weekends due to their seating policy, wait times tend to be long. They do not take reservations either, so plan accordingly. Definitely a spot to check out if you want to do something outside the normal bar/lounge scene.
