Our first taste of a Chicago Vienna all beef hot dog and OMG, it was so incredible. Had to buy the sweatshirt to wear back in NC. My grandson is a vegetarian and had the grilled cheese and if was great. Just have to stop by and have a true Chicago classic. Yummy! This is a true old fashion drive-in or walk up and order T the window. Which adds to the classic vintage experience.
