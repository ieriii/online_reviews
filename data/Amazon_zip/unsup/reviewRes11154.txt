Just Brunch you say?  Its nice to find a place in your favorite neighborhood that is open for a good quality Brunch. The Bongo Room was on my list of places to try. I went on a Sunday just before noon. The Menu is full of delicious described sweet and savory breakfast and lunch dishes. Next time I will be sure to order the Pancakes but I was very happy with my Omelet. They use very fresh ingredients and are very generous with the servings. Bring your appetite and smile. If your coming in after 12 bring your patience, the fairly large dinning room fills up fast.
