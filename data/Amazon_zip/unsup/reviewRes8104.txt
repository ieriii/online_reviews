Oh, Fogo. I really can't say anything bad about you. A group of buddies and I try and make a semiannual outing to Fogo de Chao. We spend an average of two hours eating the most delicious cuts of meat in the area. We normally start out by cleansing our pallets with a little salad action. The salad bar is a nice size with very fresh produce and a variety of dressings. But salad is not the reason to come here. The cuts are exquisite. A few of my favorites are the lamb, pork ribs, beef ribs, and bacon wrapped filet mignon. There has been only one occasion where I have had enough room in my stomach to have dessert. I got the creme brulee and it was scrumptious. I'm curious to how their other desserts taste... Staff is amazing. Every time we dine, there is one waiter who recognizes us and greets us. It is nice to be acknowledged by staff, even though we only make it out to Fogo twice a year. I'd have to say that Fogo de Chao is the best Brazilian steakhouse in the Chicagoland area. Their cuts are far more superior than the competition.
