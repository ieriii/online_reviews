I've been coming to Indie since I moved to Edgewater in 2006. I absolutely love the food. I have my trusted favorites but I also love trying their specials, especially the appetizers. My personal favorites: pad see ewe, panang curry with chicken and crispy noodles, spicy tuna roll, dragon maki, Thai iced tea and, of course, their crab rangoon. On the weekends, it's unfortunately now necessary to make a reservation, as the restaurant is very popular. (It's very easy to spot new Indie goers getting off the red line, as they are clearly bewildered at finding themselves anywhere north of Addison in search of a good meal.) I will say that Indie's wait staff is not nearly as attentive as they were a few years ago and that the quality of the food declines on the weekend - most likely because they are so busy. If you want Indie at its classic best, go on a weekday or Sunday afternoon - the experience will be heaven. That doesn't mean that the food will be bad on Friday or Saturday - it just won't have the same level of care that those who know and love Indie have come to expect. An unfortunate consequence of success. Still, this restaurant is not to be missed.
