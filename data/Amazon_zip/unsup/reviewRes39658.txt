One of the yummiest korean bbq places I've ever been to. What's even better is that this place is a late night joint. I've been here numerous times and loved every second of it. I love the Kalbi and bulgogi. The side dishes are SO plentiful you won't have a need to ask for more. A couple things to note. Make sure you leave any clothing in your car such as jackets and/or purses that you do not want smelling like bbq. It will if you end up bringing it in there. Make sure you are ready to spend a bit. This is one of the more expensive Korean BBQ places I've been to. I guess you get what you pay for.
