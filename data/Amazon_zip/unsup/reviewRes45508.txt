The ambiance at Wilde is great. There is a library, antique-looking woodwork, and writings/old artwork on the walls. The prices, however, are not reasonable for the food and drinks you get. Three of us went out for dinner the other night and ordered crab cakes for an appetizer. It was a $13 appetizer, yet we only received ONE tiny crab cake. We thought it would be sharable, but it turned out we each got one bite of the tiny cake. $4.33 per bite!  Their wine list is extremely overpriced for the selection, with the average price at $10 a glass. Sorry Wilde, you aren't a wine bar! The bussers kept trying to take our plates before we were finished. It happened 6 times! The waitress was attentive at first and then she seemingly forgot about us. All-in-all, the food is decent, but not worth the price. You can cook what they serve here at home easily for FAR cheaper. At Wilde, you're paying for ambiance, not service or food.
