I've had better Mexican but this was with a twist. All the dishes surrounding us was tempting and that's always the best part, you want to come back to try what she/he had. The service was quick and I felt quite pressured to leave. The servers were clearing/cleaning before we even left the table. It's a small place that can get crowded so it's a lot of squeezing through stools. Other than that, worth a try! I'll be back for sure, but most probably during slow times of the day. I don't like eating under pressure.
