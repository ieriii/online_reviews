We frequent Nuevo Leon once or twice per month or whenever we crave for it. Often we go at late night, which is much better in terms of service and the noncrowdiness. Last sunday we went: Started waiting in line @ 7:30 PM. Sat down at a shared table @ 7:50 PM (could be much longer if it's not shared table) Salsa came @ 7:55 PM Water @ 8:15 PM CHIPS @ 8:20 PM Free appetizer @ 8:30 Order placed @ 8:40 PM... Food came @ 9:00 PM.. Fajitas and breakfast egg were tasty as usual, but by the time it came out, we were already full from eating the chips and salsa during the time we were waiting waiting and waiting... wait staff was nice but helplessly busy. Don't go during dinner time coz it gets soo crazy!!!
