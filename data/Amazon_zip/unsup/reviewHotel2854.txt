This is a good hotel. We got a good deal, so we enjoyed the comfy beds and comfy lobby seating. As well I should, since my friend neglected to put my name on the room list, as I waited in the lobby for a return call from him. The hotel staff was strict in not letting me in.  As I waited in the hallway for my travel mate I heard an intense love making session that got my blood pumping; spankings and anguished moans? I'm in. Inside our room though, I couldn't hear a sound. Expensive food options but you are in such a good location just make a walk to the EL - less than a mile, and you'll be good to go in Chicago. Ask for a river view room. Close to everything if you arn't afraid of some brisk but simple Chicago native foot action.
