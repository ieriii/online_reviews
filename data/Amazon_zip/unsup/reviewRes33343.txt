A surprising and scrumptious evening! Felt transported to a different place and time. Truly a dining experience with food delectable from start to finish. The caesar salad was the perfect balance of cream and spice. The beef ribeye, absolutely divine! Chocolate ganache was light, moist and rich. Incredibly friendly service, and an owner with a personality for miles.  What a gem! Will certainly be back, and bring those who visit me in Chicago, for this is what Chicago is all about.
