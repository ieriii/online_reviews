This is the best Chinese food i've had in Chicago so far.  The dumpling soup was delicious.  The potstickers were awesome. a spicy lamb something dish - awesome. and a mild mixed vegetable dish which was good and balanced out the rest of the spice, but wasn't fabulous. The wait to be seated for Sunday night dinner was about 15 minutes, but once we sat it took for ever for the food to come. They definitely made it spicy too. no skimping there. I will certainly return.
