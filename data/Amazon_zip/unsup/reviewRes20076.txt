I ended up here on an ill fated attempt at going to the campus bookstore in pouring (January) rain and inevitably found myself at the bar. It happens a lot that way. I had class (next door) and stuck to water (sheds tear) and sat by my lonesome at the very nice, smooth bar. The architecture and decor was great, nice tiling, painted tin ceilings and not to aggressive sports shows (on mute, thank you) up in the corners. Had the basic salad, which is my one true tests of how the rest of the food will add up. Tasty bread an butter. Another weakness. Not so fond of the pricing for the portion. A $9 salad that wasn't necessarily eye appealing or significant, but good, but kind of small. I saw other portions and they also looked on the small side...but maybe their rich gastro-pub-whathaveyou goodness would make up for that. I'll give it a shot again for drinks, or if someone wants to buy me $40 worth of Irish food.
