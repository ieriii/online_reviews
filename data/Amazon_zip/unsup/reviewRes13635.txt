Glenn's is totally _not_ a diner. I have no idea why they call it that. FYI, Glenn, diners do not serve $17 lobster bisque pasta dishes! Diners serve $6 open faced turkey sandwiches smothered in gravy! I just find the misnomer slightly annoying. On to what Glenn's is: a bustling, neighborhood fancy brunch spot and seafood restaurant. For brunch, they've got a kitschy offering of cereal and milk -- up to three bowls for somewhere around $5. I don't really see the point of this. I am a pretty bad cook, but even I can pour sugary flakes into a bowl with some milk. The bright cereal boxes do make a cute decoration though. I think seafood is really the way to go at Glenns. I have had the shrimp po-boy on a few occasions, and that sandwich is perfection. The bread is so flaky and good, and the shrimp are really well seasoned. The red onion is a good compliment to the other flavors. I wasn't wowed by brunch yesterday. I had the spinach and tomato benedict -- poached eggs over sauteed spinach and tomato slices on an English muffin with hollandaise sauce. I have had better versions of this dish, sadly. My eggs were over-cooked and the yolks were dry and pulpy. The sauce was good, though. And the potato pancake side was delicious. I think they make it with something delightfully unhealthy like sour cream? They had a yummy tart flavor. The upshot? I would go again to eat fish. I would not go for eggs or other regular brunch items.
