Despite RJ Grunts being a Chicago legend, I'd never been here until this past weekend, and now I can safely say that I haven't been missing anything. It's average. Very, very average. The food? Average. The salad bar? Average. The atmosphere? Average. The menu is fun, in a 70s kitsch sort of way, and our server was very polite and prompt. As for the chocolate chips in cream cheese that everyone was raving about, it tasted exactly like...chocolate chips in cream cheese. It was not the ethereal experience I was hoping for. Both my husband and I felt a little unwell after eating here. Not sick to our stomachs but just...blah. We both had the Buffalo Nachos and the Cookie Bowl, so maybe it was one of those things. If I'm in the neighborhood and I'm with someone who's craving a burger, I'd try RJ Grunts again.
