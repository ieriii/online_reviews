Ready (for a Bib Gourmand) or not? Decidedly not! I ate here for the first time yesterday, with family from out of town. While The Purple Pig offered some good food the service and servers ranged from indifferent to rude. As we were standing in line to leave one server physically pushed us in to each other (think linebacker). No apologies, he actually got in our face when we asked him not to push. His confrontational behavior was sadly underscored by a manager in-charge who was not available and a floor manager who excused the server's behavior based on the (admittedly) crowded working conditions. Clearly the folks at this eatery aren't ready for their Michelin rating and think it's our privilege to dine with them. There are always marvelous choices in Chicago and you can easily do better than The Purple Pig. Blech.
