Holy hotdogs, batman. Hot D's was amazing-- ate it for long-awaited lunch my first day back visiting beloved chicago. Five stars--fully dude. Doug was there to take our orders, and his staff's much-deserved tips as well. I had the Kiera Knightley(aka the Jeniffer Garner)-- a hotlink with everything (onions, mustard, relish, pickle, tomato, and celery salt) and effing aye it was krontastic(very good). Although i'm over Kiera and i think i should be called the Jessica Alba... But maybe it's just not spicy enough for that title, and who wants a dog that's gonna burn you... twice. All in all, YUM!
