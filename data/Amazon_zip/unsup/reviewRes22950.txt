2 facts about me: 1. I am part Latin 2. I am not a fan of many Latin foods 3. I love Irazu Ok that was 3 but who is counting?! I have lived about 300 feet away from Irazu for 7 months and just finally got here Saturday night. Crazy, I know. My dining companion and I got seated at a little table in the corner outside and realized it's BYOB...so we got a bottle of Red from Red&White across the street. Of course we started off with chips and guac, good, not great. I got chicken and rice, spicy, for my entree and DAYUM it was gooooood. DC had some sort of steak dish and while I didn't even get a chance to try it, it must have been good because he practically inhaled it. The server was really friendly and we had a good chat with him, rather, dining companion had a chat with him. But he was a real cool guy talking with us about peasant food and how it is in demand and making jokes with us. Food-great Service-awesome Atmosphere-relaxed and fun Overall-4 stars, minus one because it is cash only and because it is really small and the wait can be a long one.
