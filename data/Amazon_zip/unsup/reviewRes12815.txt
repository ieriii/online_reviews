I went to Cafe 28 for the first time tonight. There were six of us and so we had a bit of a wait, but it was well worth it. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the service was good. I had the Carne a la Parilla, which was very good, and a side of congri, which was delicious. We had a baked goat cheese appetizer which was also good, and my friends raved about the calamari. The only thing they weren't crazy about were their mojitos. Everything else was great including the bread baskets, which had a tasty flavored butter, and the dessert. I look forward to coming back here!
