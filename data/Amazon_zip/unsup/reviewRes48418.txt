I had dinner here on a Tuesday. Although I was there at prime time (7:30), the wait was an hour and 20 minutes. On a Tuesday! That says something of the popularity of the place. The staff from the get go was attentive and courteous. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. The beer selection was really good. The food was better. Over the evening sampled was the cheese selection blue cheese, the oysters (the PEI were my faves), the Octopus w/ farro and sausage, the Serrano ham, and finally the lamb sausage with sides of pickles and the marinated kale. My friend and I can eat...but all the plates are manageable. The server/bartender was great too. Well done Publican!
