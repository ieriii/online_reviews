Something that I've always loved about Chicago is that there are many restaurants are BYOB, something we Washingtonians don't get to experience. This is one of those places which definitely makes it a 5-star review. The roll options were unique, the sashimi was plentiful, the vegetarian gyoza was popping with flavor, and pretty much everything my friend and I ate was amazing. It was a bit expensive but some of the freshest fish we've had in Chicago. Dinner (3 apps, 10pc sashimi plate, 2 rolls) with 3 glasses of house wine ($5 ea) was $98 after tax but still reasonable if you take the BYOB option. Again - so tasty I'd say it was worth the extra few dollars. Enjoyed the ambiance as well
