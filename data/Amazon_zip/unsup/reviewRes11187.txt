2 stars for the red pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms (comes with mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce already on it) 4 stars for the white pizza with mashed potatoes (it comes with garlic, olive oil, and mozzarella cheese already on it) 5 stars for the dessert pizza with chocolate hazelnut sauce and mascarpone cheese. This is our second time back to Piece. Even though I really like the dessert pizza, I am not sure if this is a place I would frequent because it's really a-ok place for the pizza in the city of great pizza places! Also, one of my criteria for me to be a big fan of a pizza joint is good cold left over pizza the next day. This place fell short of that. Nevertheless, the service was great (despite the 50 minutes wait on the dessert pizza) and the beer is good.
