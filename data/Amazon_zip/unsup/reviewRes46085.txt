The Grand Lux Cafe and the Cheesecake Factory are owned by the same company(which is why there is often a similar feel). Ive attended a few birthday celebrations at the Grand Lux, and the food is good(but not great), especially the bread(and I am NOT a bread person) but there arent that many options for vegetarians. Grand Lux is truly known for their desserts, which are TO DIE FOR! Most of them are baked to order, and are rich and decadent. If you love sweets this is the place for you. I must warn everyone, that the restaurants portions are HUGE and if you are looking to keep your calories/fat content down this is not the place to go(which is one of the reasons I only go there for special occasions). There is no point in attempting to go to Grand Lux if you want to watch your calories.......you would be missing out on some of the best items they have to offer. So I say, go for special events, and enjoy whatever you want without guilt.
