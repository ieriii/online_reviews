sceney and a bit cheesy... 4 of us visited sunda during opening week. i really hope that they don't continue to pack the restaurant to overcapacity - it really does compromise your dining experience. we enjoyed our time at the bar more so than our dining experience. all tables were full but it was actually really nice dining in the lounge. passed around were a tuna sashimi dish and devil-hot crab (warning - they are bathing in chili peppers that i could smell from miles away). the "toast and jam" and the wok-fired peppers were the biggest hits at our table. all of it was good... not amazing... but i really do believe it has the potential of being amazing. the good selection of wines and beers will keep me coming back for drinks and apps. when the hype dies down, the kinks are worked out and the sceney peeps find another hangout to invade, i'll give dinner another shot, try out some vegi items and re-review.
