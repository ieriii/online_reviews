LOVE this place, and I'm no pork lover--I'm a vegetarian. The vegetable dishes are fabulous and certainly no afterthought as they are at many restaurants that focus on meat. Wonderful selection to choose from, especially loved the salted beets and whipped feta smear. Bread is great, waiter kindly brought more when we ran out. My husband loved the tuna, I ate the spinach that came on the side which was very very good.For dessert we had the nutella sandwich, perfect ending to great dinner. We will definitely be back sooner rather then later.
