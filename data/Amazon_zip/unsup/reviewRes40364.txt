I'm sure if our lazy asses had gotten out of bed a bit sooner they would not have run out of the tantalizing dishes I wanted to try and this would be a 4 star review. Oh well. Sunday brunch with the girls in the blustery rain and Lula's wait was 90 friggin minutes - we braced ourselves and trekked over here and I'm glad we did. So it was about 12:30 but we only had to wait 15-20 min for a table - awesome since we were all starving. L&E Shanty is awesome! I am not a fan of the Leinenkugel's Shanty but the sound of Bell's Oberon draft and house-made lemonade was intriguing. Really great brunch drink option for a girl who hates bloody marys and is a bit tired of mimosa combos. Unfortunately, they were out of the duck hash & peekytoe crab benedict so I opted for the croque madam. Fried egg placement on top is ingenious - loved the sandwich! Should have chosen the b-fast potatoes instead of the mixed greens though ... My friend had the morel, aspragus & fromage blanc omelet - very delicious. Warning - the salmon tartare is great and looks beautiful but really shouldn't be listed under the sandwiches. The portion is clearly appetizer size. Service was prompt but without much personality and the one host guy was getting on my nerves a bit. I know he was trying to be all clever and funny but we were starving and disheveled from the windy, drenching walk so I wasn't really feeling it. That being said, I still would love to try brunch again, albeit earlier, and definitely dinner - great food!
