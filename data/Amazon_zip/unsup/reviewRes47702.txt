The food is amazing and the bartender was very friendly and helpful but when we sat down the server (Jeremy) was HORRENDOUS!!!! he took 20 min for our drink (wine) and the place was empty (it was x-mas eve) I mean seriously? I gave him a 10 min time limit and if he didn't make it back by then we were just gonna go back to the bar. He made it back with 1 min to spare...not joking kept a eye on my phone clock. I would go back just because I like rodizio dining but if i get him again I am asking for another server
