Can't go wrong. Brazilian steakhouses are unreal, and Fogo is superb. I have been to others, so Fogo had a lot to live up to, and it did a pretty good job... the salad bar left a little to be desired compared to other's I've had. Everything cold = easier to keep up with I suppose... Meat was incredible. Loved the top sirloin and filet, and even the bone-in chicken was delicious. As far as the sides go, the mashed potatoes and plantains are far superior to the fried polenta (which tasted like deep fryer oil only...). Got a dessert on the house, but how anyone saves room for that menu I'll never know! Recommend pacing yourself, plenty of time, and enough food to go around for however long you want to last! Fun for dates or groups.
