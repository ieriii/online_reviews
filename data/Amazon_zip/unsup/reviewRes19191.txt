I went to the Bad Apple last night after passing it many times and hearing of the charms of its burgers. My friends and I were definitely not disappointed! There was something for everyone, and I think we all ate and drank just a little more than was necessary. The beer list was out of this world, including one hard to find beer that I've been searching high and low for since stumbling upon it earlier this summer. My friends also tried their mead, which, how many bars actually have mead? Two thumbs up. The burgers were, as promised, to die for--I had the Frenchie which incorporates brie, truffles, and frizzled onions, all some of my favorite things. If I could do anything differently, I would have gotten seasoning on my fries, but I certainly can't complain about the service, food, or ambiance! I'll be back, probably sooner than I should.
