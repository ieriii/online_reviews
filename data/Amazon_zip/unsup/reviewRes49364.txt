What's left to say that hasn't been said already? I tend to lean toward the sweeter side of wines so I was pleased to have a good reisling. High notes: I'm a sucka for truffle! That basket of warm gourgeres (cheese puffs) w/truffle honey were other-worldly! I don't usually like hummus (sorry, but it usually reminds me of grinded shoe), but this yummity hum? Yes, please to fresh tomatos and garlic hummus on flatbread! Service was quick and friendly... This is a nice after theater/date spot.
