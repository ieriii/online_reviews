This is a wonderful place to enjoy a leisurely meal after visiting the Art Institute down the street. The first museum visit, we all just had cocktails, and I am now addicted to the Capone. Great selection of beers too. The decor is warm, all dark wood, subway tiles, sleek but in a cosy way, and it was really comfy up at the bar. They're also very courteous to everyone regardless of whether they're in tourist-wear or business suit. I was so impressed I vowed to return soon. Fast forward one week and 3 other bars later, all serving a similar "cucumber" drink. NOT the same, cucumber juice is just not the same as mashed cucumber. Best at the Gage! So, dying for another Capone, I raced back today with my girlfriend in tow after another day at the museum. Picked outdoor seating, very pleasant, very friendly service. Very good food. We both started with the soup, a chilled bosc pear soup - heavenly. Just heavenly. I got the special - a corned beef sandwich on pumpernickel, which was excellent. My girlfriend got the brisket, which was a big open-faced sandwich piled with arugula. I didn't love it, but I think it was personal preference - I'm not hot on braised brisket to begin with. Girlfriend loved it, so there ya go. The clouds were starting to roll in, and a few drops were falling, so we skipped dessert, which I will absolutely remedy the next time I go. Very soon. One cocktail, soup, main and tip was $45 each. There's a great $13 value of cup of soup and half sandwich if cost is a factor. Highly recommended.
