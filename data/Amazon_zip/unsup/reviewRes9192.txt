i arrived home tonight tired and starving with a fridge full of random crap that could possibly have resembled a meal with an amount of effort i was not willing to put forth. enter grub hub. living in the irving park area does not lend itself to a plethora of delivery options and ever since semiramis' delivery dude moved back to lebanon (what's that about?) i've basically given up on the lovely idea of having delicious middle eastern food delivered to my door. but today... i see on grub hub that not only does noon-o deliver to my house, but they also have online ordering. i probably haven't mentioned it before, but i hate nothing more than ordering food by phone; i will go to great lengths to avoid talking to an actual human being. anyhoo... i place my order, take the dog for a walk and voila, delicious persian foods arrive at my door. i never had to leave my house OR talk to a person... what's better than that? they're slightly more expensive that i'd like, but the food is quite good. i highly recommend the beefy, spinachy stew thing... great with the dill rice.
