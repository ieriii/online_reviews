Okay, the only reason I decided to write a review is because of all the negative ones that have been posted recently...and I feel like I have to defend! Violet Hour is by far my favorite bar in Chicago but I have to say that I NEVER go on Friday or Saturday nights which seem like a completely different scene there. First of all, the drinks are delicious and fairly priced. I know a lot of people complain about paying $11 for a drink but I'm from New York City so $11 for a friggin strong cocktail seems like a steal to me. The Diablo and Dark & Stormy are my standbys. The food is delicious too (the deviled eggs and meatballs are amazing!). Secondly, I think that the interior design of this place is beautiful, great color palette and layout. You definitely would not want to go here if you're in a rowdy mood but it's perfect if you just feel like having a chill, relaxing evening. Lastly, I LOVE the staff here. The doormen are always nice (which must be hard because I've seen some of the assholes that go there sometimes). The servers are sweet and really good at helping you find a drink after you tell them what you like (Laura is awesome with this!). If you sit at the bar, the bartenders are also good at giving you some drink recommendations (and some of them are cuties as well!). I mean, yeah, if you go here on a Friday or Saturday it's gonna suck cause you're going to have to wait in line for an hour or so. But go on any other night and I promise you'll have a great time.
