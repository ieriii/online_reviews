I must say, this is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. From service, to wine expertise, to the food, it doesn't get any better than this. I love that the dishes are rather simple, yet profound in taste. Weekdays are much more chilled than weekends, and if you have never been, you MUST sit outside once - at least in the summer. The only oddity I feel is that the service is... interesting. When they are tending to you, they are VERY attentive. But then, they sometimes go away for awhile not to be seen. Not at other tables they are tending. They just sometimes... disappear. Still, 5 stars in my book.
