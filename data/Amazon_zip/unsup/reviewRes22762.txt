The people in Szechuan, China love spicey food. And by spicey, I mean ATOMIC spicey, hurts to eat spicey, numbs your entire mouth spicey, has you on the toilet the next day for 30-minutes in pain spicey. So yeah, if you come here looking for some Cantonese stir-fry or sweet battered chicken, you're totally in the wrong spot. Similarly, if you order a dish here and it isn't tinged in red with hot chili oil and/or swarmed with dried red chilis, you've probably ventured off the Szechuan path and ended up in a bad bad place. Top of the line is the Ma La hot pot. It's a great way to share an hour or two with friends, dunking fresh veges, meats, tofu, and glass noodles into an evil, evil boiling broth. A word of warning... the broth gets spicier and spicier as it reduces, so you might want to ask for a bit of water to re-balance the heat level. For you "foodies" who love your television cooking personalities, Ma La hotpot was featured on Tony Bourdain's travel show awhile back. It hurt him -- badly. As for the standard menu offerings, I'm not sure what it's called on the menu in English, but there's a Szechuan cuisine classic that literally translates to "water cooked beef" that is done really well here -- it might scare you to look at it, but that stuff swimming in the pool of red is pure unadulterated deliciousness. The Ma Po Tofu here would make the legendary Old Lady Ma smile, and it definitely puts the watered-down imitators across the city to shame.  Of course, as mentioned before, there are physical consequences to food this enjoyable... your morning trip to the porcelain throne will probably take a little longer than usual and you might just feel some odd sensations like numbness in your bowels or a tingling here and there... but if you're looking for a no-holds-barred Szechuan food experience, it may all be well worth the pain.
