Gluten-free menu! Gluten-free menu! I am just happy when I can eat out! But I still remember the days of eating anything, and in comparison this food is still good! I have only tried g/f items but my vegan friends have always liked what they got too. Minus one star because first time I went here the service was rather rude. But it happens - usually they are super nice.
