This review is probably a long time coming but I do love this place. I've had all of their recent brews and can honestly say they are all amazing! The 10th anniversary beer is to die for (although be careful, its 10%ABV!!) The pizza is very tasty, not my usual style being from Chicago. It is a little greasy but overall really good and fresh tasting. Reasonably priced and a nice atmosphere make this a great place. Be prepared to wait on a weekend, its a big restaurant but fills up fast!
