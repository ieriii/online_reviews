Meh..food could have been better but it was sooooo cheap I really didnt care. Folks, I got a tamale plate for $5 bucks!!! Comes with rice and some of the tastiest beans I've had in a while. So while I have had much better tamales, for five bucks what can I complain about? Was not in love but if Im looking for a cheap place to scarf on some mexican..then I would probably go back.
