I've been here a few times for the open mic. I am so timid, so I am really impressed by people who get in front of a small crowd and put their hearts into their music! And some of the people are actually quite talented! I always get the goat cheese fondue sweet potato fries (so yummy!)...between those, the potato vodka cocktails and the live music, it's a good time! I haven't tried anything else, but whenever I go with friends, they always seem happy. I don't go out of my way to frequent the place, but it's solid!  One more thing: the waitstaff is sometimes super nice and sometimes snotty...depends on the night, but one night, a teenage (maybe a freshman in college...maybe...) hostess actually asked me if I was okay to drive because I was giggling with my BFF. I sort of appreciate the concern, but had she talked to my server and figured out I'd had a total of one cocktail, an hour prior, perhaps she could have avoided looking foolish. I'm a lightweight for sure, but one drink before dinner does not an impaired driver make.
