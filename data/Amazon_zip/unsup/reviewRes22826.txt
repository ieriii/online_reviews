I finally went back to Irazu last weekend, after being struck by plantain-cupid's arrows almost two years ago. MAN! I want Anthony Bourdain to come back to Chicago just to get him to eat here and then validate my love with his supreme wisdom and snark, because I'm sure he'd give this place the 4 star, solid thumbs up review. The plantains are indescribably perfect. The beans and rice heavenly. The oatmeal "shake" was much more like a horchata slushie and much less like a milk shake than I expected, but was still great.  I don't recall what I ordered the first time I visited Irazu, but I do recall thinking there wasn't a dining room. Can you imagine my delight when told that there actually Is a dining room when I called Saturday? You can't? Jump up and down more. They don't take cards so make sure you have at least $25 if you're paying for two. My lady and I paid around $22 for a shake, the incredible Potato Taco dish with both Mole and Guacamole and the refreshing and wonderful Palmito Salad. We also carried in a six-pack and paid a $0 corking/bottle fee. I even liked their menu with it's stories and glossary and their website, which is one of the more useful and tasteful online restaurant menus I've seen. Re-commence the jumping up and down. I can't wait to go back (sooner than two years from now).
