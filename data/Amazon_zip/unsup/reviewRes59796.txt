The Art of Pizza has some plaque on their wall declaring them a winner of a Zagat award at some point in recent history. They probably deserved it. Of all the "slices to go" places I have been, The Art of Pizza is the hands down winner.The slices are never stale or old. One time, being gluttonous, I asked for a specific slice (by far, the largest I could see). They weren't too busy, so the gentleman behind the counter took the time to tell me that it was actually older than those on the rack above, and would I care for a fresher slice? Yes, yes I would...thank you Art of Pizza!They have side salads pre-made and ready to go for people like myself who want to pretend we're being somewhat healthy. I know iceberg lettuce does nothing for you, but it makes me feel better. They also have slices of cake ready to go for those that want to take it some low places.They regularly feature quick "no-nonsense-but-still-friendly service," and boast regular (not inflated, which they could probably get away with) prices. Only con is they're not open ridiculously late like Chicago's, but I bet it's because they're tired from spending all day caring about their pizza so much.Lastly, there are a bunch of tables pulled together with newspapers scattered about that are usually occupied by a seemingly random group of people. I guess it's a good place to come in and sit down as well.
