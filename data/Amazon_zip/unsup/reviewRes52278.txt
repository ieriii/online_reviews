Went to Gino's based on a friends recommendation....I am giving it 3 out of 5 stars because I thought it was fine...not bad not fabulous....the kids thought the graffiti and the building was cool....the wait for the pizza was a bit long (45 min)....the minestrone was not traditional minestrone but it was good (more like a stew or chowder)..the pizza was o.k (again not bad but not fabulous) I really have no comparison for a deep dish pizza .I wished I had tried a canolli but we were heading to Ghiradelli's for dessert.
