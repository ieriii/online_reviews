I went here for dinner recently. One star for the quiet and cozy atmosphere. One star for the attentive and friendly service. Minus three stars for the sketchy, cringe-inducing, cartilage-ridden chicken. Other reviews seem very positive about brunch so if I try it out I will be sure to (1) avoid any chicken dishes and (2) update my review.
