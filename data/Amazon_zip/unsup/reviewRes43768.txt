I was in Chicago late October for a work conference. I arrived a day early and stopped in at Kinzie for lunch. I sat in the bar area which had neat leather seats and a darker vibe going on. It was about 2pm and there was about 6 people eating in the bar. I had the steak salad which was awesome. Had a bottle of pinot noir as well (was with coworker). Had a very nice lunch here. Service was very friendly. I look forward to stopping in here next time im in Chicago.
