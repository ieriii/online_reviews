The food is good and they give u a lot of food! Prices are reasonable though. The place is beautiful, great atmosphere. Tends to get pretty loud.From the 3 times I've been here, the wait is awfully and unfortunately long. Worst thing is they won't allow u to call and make a reservation unless it's for 4+ people.Service is good though. Not a bad place to go for good food.
