great blood sausage paired with picked dijon; pork rind with cheddar didn't make the mark :( The octopus was good, just I don't like how it is paird with barely-cooked lentils Went there with my girl friends and were served with friendly waiters! BUT they are so eager to clean your food even though we are apparently working on it!
