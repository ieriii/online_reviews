As a newbie in town, I was excited to find Indie right around the corner. I was drawn in by the twinkle lights in the window, but stayed in for the food. Excellent red curry and the sushi selection is great. I also love that you can customize your dish with your meat of choice or with tofu for us veg-heads.
