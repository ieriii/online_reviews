I love Uncommon Ground. It is really close to my apartment, so I can walk there, which is nice for me as I don't often get in my car to go find food. I have never been unhappy with the service or the food, and they have a separate dining room which often features live music, which can be a lot of fun. It is clean and has a very homey feel to it. I don't really know what else to sa
