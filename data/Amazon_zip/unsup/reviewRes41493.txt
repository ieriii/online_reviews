The food here is exceptional, on a par with that of any of the well-known haute cusine restaurants in Chicago. The place is very small and intimate. The flavor combinations are fantastic, and presentations are thoughtful and creative. But here's the beef: Patrick, our waiter, was really annoying. He was aloof to the point of not caring - his whole attitude was like "you're just lucky to be dining here and to have me serving you." His demeanor put a damper on an otherwise excellent meal. His answers to questions were condescending, and he was dismissive of our wine choice (it's BYOB, and one has no idea of the menu, so we brought a few choices just to cover bases). Dude, lighten up and at least pretend to be enjoying yourself!
