Went to Uncommon Ground for the first time after much anticipation of it arriving in the Rogers Park neighborhood. Went for breakfast, and almost everything on the menu looked terrific. I had the Montana omelet and my boyfriend had the Uncommon huevos. Both came with potatoes and mine came with toast as well. The food was fantastic - fresh, well-seasoned, and innovative. The uncommon huevos came on top of a black bean corn cake - with a terrific ancho chili sauce. the omelet was large and packed with bacon and cheese. we had coffee, which was good and the service was very attentive. they came to fill water, coffee and take plates promptly. it seems like a very cool/cozy place to hang out - with brick walls and a fireplace. they had a small bar up front with a unique selection of beers and it's already smoke-free! the only draw-back is that the prices seemed a little high at first glance (especially for the neighborhood) but the quantity and quality did merit it. I'll definitely be back.
