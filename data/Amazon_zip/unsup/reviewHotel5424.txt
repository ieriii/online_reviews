My son and I stayed here for a Cubs baseball trip . It's location is great about a mile from Wrigley Field . You can walk it or catch the bus . It had been a Comfort Inn years ago . Check in was quick and the room we occupied # 112 a bit dated . The neighborhood Lincoln Pk/Lakeview offers alot to do . So we did not spend alot of time in the room . The room was however clean and nothing I could complain about . Water pressure was fine and there was plenty of hot water . Contnl breakfast was cereal,juice,muffins, toast and fresh coffee . For the price of $ 109.00 two beds I thought was fair . Yes we would stay there again .
