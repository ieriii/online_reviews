Plan on staying awhile if you're doing weekend dinner, but the evening should be great. Order a round of delicious house-brewed specialties (never filtered, never kegged), grab a spot in the bullpen near the fireplace (Phil J. style) and wait for your chance at the great food. Sure it might take a bit, but that is part of the experience as you take in the sights of the brewery and eclectic patrons. The sounds and smells are true to pub form, yet Revolution Brewing seems to take it to the next level. With the new second-story stage and bar being installed, Rev is sure to be taking it to 11 in the near future. Get your Growler card for fresh refills and specialty releases, and do not forget to try whatever is on the engine tap. Sign up for a brewery tour with complimentary sample brew, and stay for lunch. I have tried the Cheddar Ale Soup, Smoked Pulled Pork Sandwich, and the Farm Burger with the ever friendly fried egg topper. Its always a great time with great beer created by excellent local brewers. A list of every brew they have ever made: http://revbrew.com/allbe
