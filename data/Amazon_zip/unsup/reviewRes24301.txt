My boyfriend and I got a Groupon for this place. Overall, we had a nice dinner and the food was fine. However, a couple key things kind of made the night awkward. First off, the place smells bad when you walk in. And when you leave, you smell like fried seafood. If we hadn't been going directly home, this would have really ruined the evening. Still, I have to get my outfit dry cleaned now. Kind of unfortunate. Second, it's really dark and maze-like. This would be fine if there were clear paths, but people at tables had chairs really far out and visibility was poor. It could have easily ended in hot oil being spilled on someone in a collision. Third, you don't really get a choice in cheese with the dinners and the cheese they served was a bit much for my taste. Lastly, the chairs were ripped and old and cheap quality. For a place that boasts a romantic evening, this was just an awkward claim. For fondue, I would suggest the Melting Pot. They're well-ventilated and you won't go home smelling like a fryer, you'll be safer in their well-lit restaurant with locking pots and staff that announce when they're rounding corners, you have more choice and the restaurants are less worn down. It was a nice evening, but I really did not appreciate leaving feeling gross.
