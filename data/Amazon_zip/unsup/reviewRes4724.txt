My friend and I went to dinner here in April 2012 on a Wednesday night. It was still a little chilly outside, but they have a great outdoor set up. The outdoor area is tented and has plenty of heaters. We were willing to sit outside due to the heaters, and I think this significantly decreased our wait. In general, I'm pretty frustrated by places that don't take reservations. I usually try to get around the crazy crowds by going during the week or at a later time. This approach didn't help too much with the Purple Pig. At 8 pm on a Wednesday, we still waited a good 45 minutes. This is definitely better than the other time I waited almost 2 hours (we ended up leaving because the wait was just ridiculous). All reservation complaints aside, the meal was fantastic. We had an artichoke salad to start, which was incredible. Then we had roasted bone marrow with herbs. I was initially a little freaked out by the look of the bone marrow, but it was so flavorful and perfectly prepared. Then we had Porko Bucco, a pork osso bucco. It was also delicious. The waiter kept emphasizing that we could take our time, and we ordered each dish one at a time. While it was nice to not feel like we're being rushed out the door, I'm more of a fan of ordering everything and getting out of there. The waiter also encouraged us to stay, have some coffee, sit, etc. I'm guessing that this relaxed attitude contributes to the crazy wait times and no reservation policy. Overall, I enjoyed my meal. However, my style doesn't totally jive with Purple Pig, and I would be more inclined to go somewhere with reservations and a timeline.
