Boo F&O.  In the couple of months that i have lived here, I've been to Fox & Obel a handful of times. To say the least the quality has gone downhill with each visit. Most visits occur in the breakfast hour, after a late night of working at the nearby hospital. Dining experiences have been limited to the cafe, which in the recent past has changed it's format from self-serve/order at the register and sit, to sit and be served (which in my opinion is a big mistake).  The bang for your buck is favorable, but still takes a little getting used to (coming from little upstate NY suburbia), but this gourmet marketplace is pretty comparable to the Streeterville prices. i.e 8.99 pre-tax for a [meatless] breakfast panini, thick potato wedges and fruit cup. Hearty and generally enough for 2 people. First visit was excellent: fresh flavorful foods (delish fruit cup gave me a great first impression-blackberries yum)..since then, quality has gone way down - fruit cup was obviously used with 'sell-by date' fruits (some moldy grapes-should warrant no more than 2 stars!!), potatoes that were under the broiler too long, and service that was sub-par (please stop with the exasperated sigh everytime you approach the table). Take away message: A couple of months ago I wanted to bring all my visitors to F&O for the Chicago brunch deluxe experience. Now .. not so sure. Come here if you need to splurge on some delish pastries and cakes to take away, chocolates and yummy craft teas. Go to West Egg if you're looking for service.
