I've had a really good time every time I've come here. I've only ever sat at the bar and the bartenders have always been very pleasant and not nearly as intimidating as they seem. That could be that whoever was serving us was trying (and succeeding) to flirt with whichever girlfriend I had with me at the time, but no matter.  I give four stars because I can't really get behind the whole pretentious vibe. I understand that it's supposed to be sort of a hidden gem, speakeasy type of place, but I don't really think that speakeasies were so pretentious back during prohibition. They've got the whole secretive, quiet vibe down, and I like that. I like the fancy drinks, and I like all the thought and effort that is put into them, but I don't like the $12 price tag and I don't like that it takes 15 minutes to make each one. This is still a bar, I would like to chat with my friends over drinks, I don't want to be waiting for mine the entire time my companion is drinking theirs. My favorite experience involved the head bartender spending the same amount of time making a non-alcoholic drink for my boyfriend, who doesn't drink, as he did making the rest of our drinks from off the menu. He seemed to put a lot of thought into it and even asked my boyfriend if he was okay with him adding bitters to the drink, since he knew it would add a nice flavor but also knew that technically they are alcoholic. His drink was just as good as ours and you could barely even tell it was the non-alcoholic one in the bunch. A very nice experience, but only for every once in awhile. You'll go broke drinking $12 4oz cocktails every night.
