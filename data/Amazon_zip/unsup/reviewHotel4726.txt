WARNING....DO NOT STAY HERE! THE ROOMS ARE SO TINY, beyond belief and don't let them know that you booked through Priceline or Hotwire, etc. They treated us like crap, the room had a view of plastic tarps & an alley. NO AMENITIES in the room, queen bed went almost to the walls, no closet, no minibar, no counter in bathroom - SO uncomfortable and staff is trained to say it's a boutique hotel. Then they lost our car in the private valet lot for an hour for $42 a day!!! Will NEVER stay here again.
