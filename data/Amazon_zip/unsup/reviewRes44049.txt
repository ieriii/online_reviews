Let me start by saying, the sushi is excellent. Not the very best, in terms of portion, and freshness/qualtiy, but certainly excellent. So why the two stars? I'll explain. The price. Relative to many of the other sushi restaurants in the area, this place by far and away is the most expensive. In fact, I am trying to understand why, after taking into account portions and quality, people are willing to spend so much for their sushi, regardless of what form you would prefer. The only thing I can think is that they love the bells and whistles. For example, I always order in. They use very high quality plastic containers. Their soy sauce comes in little plastic screw top bottles, and the they come in quite expensive earth friendly small shopping bags with the name of the restaurant on it. How nice ! But you pay for it. Why pay for these bells and whistles. Gimme the old Styrofoam containers and put them in a plain old plastic bad like the ones you get at Jewel or Walgreen's, and I'll be happy. Now, is the above the only reason that the prices are so high? I don't know. I really don't. But...one thing is for certain, relative to other sushi restaurants in the neighbor hood, and after quality and portion are taken into consideration, this place has seen the last of my business. As to the others that like over paying and then handing out 4 and 5 stars because they are clueless, well....good for them. JIM HO
