When you want it spicy go to Opart. Lovely interiors and BYOB! What more do u need in a thai place? Oh yes - the food.... it was soooo good and they have many options to pick and choose from. Very flexible with the addition n subtraction of veggies to any of the entree. Jus opp to the western Brown line and there is a liquor store within a block! Try the Pad Prik for me!
