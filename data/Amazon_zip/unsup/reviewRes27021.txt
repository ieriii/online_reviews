The food was delicious! We love Rick Bayless and have made at leats 50 of his recipes in the past year. The only reason I am not giving Frontera Grill a 5 star rating is due to service. Our waiter was friendly, but very inattentive. We sat with no drinks, not even water for the majority of the meal, we were charged with guacamole that we did not order, our waiter "forgot" to order our ceviche then, charged us for it even though after waiting 40 minutes for it we finally had to ask him were it was in order to get it (which by the way, he tried to talk us out of it by saying "but, your food is up,are you sure you want it?"), lastly, our waiter offered to bring us more tortillas (which we needed about half way through our entrees) then never came back to our table to check on us or deliver the tortillas. :( With all that said, I do believe I love Rick's food enough to consider going back. I just really hope they can take care of the service issues.
