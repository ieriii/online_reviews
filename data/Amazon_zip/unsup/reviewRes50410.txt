This place greatly exceeded my expectations! I figured they would have typical bar fare with a slight twist to it, but it was more than that. It was indulgent comfort food very well done. We started with the some wings (boneless) as they are highly rated and highly recommended. They were full of flavor and not excessively glazed. For the main course, I had the cuban sandwich with a side of mac and cheese and it was delightful! Cocktail options were impressive as well. I had a couple of chili mango margaritas that I really enjoyed. The cocktails are $10 for a full large glass. Food portions are generous as well. The service was very good, and this was on a Saturday night. I would definitely return.
