I am a food tourist. I don't consider service, location or ambiance in my recommendations (check my website). I look for exceptional food at fair value prices. Having said that... The gorganzola gnocchi is what puts this place on the radar for me. Words will not do this dish justice, but here goes: soft, supple, fluffy soft gnocchi, harboring a mild, creamy gorganzola filling and smothered in a light tomato cream sauce that just ignites the senses! (angels singing...). They have a parking lot up the street. However, the pizza is so-so (best pizza in my opinion is Pizano's, Uno's, and Malnati's).
