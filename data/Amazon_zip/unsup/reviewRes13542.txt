Cougar Alert! Not sure which suburban cougar website has pinned Revolution's many hipsters as willing bait for cougs, but two separate parties of old blondes, way too dressed up for Revolution, descended hungrily upon young men at the bar when we were there. It was pretty frightening. And entertaining. Revolution is celebrating their one-year anniversary by having all 18 of their past beers on tap (until they run out, I imagine). It's busy as ever, and I heard that not even the Blizzard of 2011 changed that. We were quoted a 2 1/2 hour wait, but snagged seats at the bar and were eating within an hour of our arrival. -Mussels- big steaming bowl of garlicky mussels in a flavorful broth. I'm not an expert but I enjoyed them a lot. -Pulled Pork sandwich- Nice big pieces of pork, the bun is hefty too, and never failed to hold together. Nice! This is a spicy take on pulled pork, so be mindful if you're spicily challenged. Get the garlic mashed potatoes to go with it. -Calzone- is absolutely huge! Smoky pasta sauce and fresh fillings a nice touch. -Paired well with the TV IPA- a nice mildly hoppy IPA with some fruit notes. There's lots left on the menu at Revolution I would love to try, and I'm going to make more of an effort to stop in from time to time. This is a great addition to making Logan Square a destination for hip dining and fun drinking.
