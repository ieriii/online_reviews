I went to Bin 36 because a close friend of mine's son recommended it to me. I was taken immediately by the friendly professional staff and there comprehensive knowledge of the wine list.  As a man who has been to few countries and more than one wine bar, they have a fair wine list. This is a compliment. The staff actually could speak intelligently about the wines they have and the wines they have were all reasonably priced. Nothing outrageous nor out of place. Good wines for a good value. I strongly recommend this to anyone and I will be back. Thanks for the good time and the excellent service.Frank
