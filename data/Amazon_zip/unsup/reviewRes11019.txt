Solid pizza and beer at this thin crust pizza alternative in the land of deep dish. Came on a Friday night to face a 30 minute wait and packed house.  Waited at the bar and tried one of their award-winning beers, the Golden Arm, at the bartender's suggestion, as well as the Lindeman's Framboise (which they had on tap!).  The build-your-own menu offers white, red, and New Haven style pizza - and I was tempted go back to my New Haven roots and get the white with mashed potatos but we ended up getting the red with artichoke hearts and mushrooms. The sauce was a good balance of sweet, salty, tart and had a garlicky bite.  Seating is a mix of bench and high-chair seating - and to make room for the large pie pans tables are bigger/longer than usual, making it sometimes dificult to hold a conversation across the table, on top of the fact that the noise level is really high.
