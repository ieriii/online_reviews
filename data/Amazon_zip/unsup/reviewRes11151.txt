There won't be a single "Piece" left on your plate when you dine at this tasty pizzeria! They have good beer to get your drink on too. Just get there early on weekends to beat the crowd or you might be waitin' a while for a seat. If you're there on Saturdays, you could partake in some Live Band Karaoke while you're waitin!
