LOVE this place! Delicious food, great drinks and a trendy atmosphere. If you don't want to sit at the bar or communal table you'll need to a reservation far in advance but it's worth it! Everything I've tired has been amazing but a few favorites aside from the sushi (it's really fresh) include the oxtail pot sickers and roasted duck hash. They also have a great happy hour from 5- 7pm if you want to sit the bar/lounge area.
