I wanted to see if Superdawg lived up to all the hype. The service was terrible - it took way too long to get our food, and people were not friendly. The fries were just ok, and the fish sandwich was pretty tasty. However, it was kind of pricey for what you get. There are so many other hot dog places that serve better food and have friendlier employees than Superdawg. If you're looking for a nostalgic sort of hot dog stand, this would be the place to go. Just be willing to sacrifice on service and taste, somewhat, and to dig a little deeper in your pocket than normal.
