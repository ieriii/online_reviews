The pizza is good. The ambiance, wait, overstretched servers are okay. The spinach stick appetizers were not cooked all the way, and I would've informed our server but he was missing in action until our pizza arrived. (For the record: breaded cold in the middle cheesy spinach is pretty gross.) Beer selection is sparse. I'll probably only return when I bring other out-of-townies. (2.5 stars, if I could)
