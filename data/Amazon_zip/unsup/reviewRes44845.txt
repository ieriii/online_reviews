I. Heart. Stuffed. Chicago. Pizza. Alrighty, now that we're straight to the point, my review is from 2005 - present. When I lived in Chicago, this was my go-to place for pizza. I've been to the other "deep-dish, authentic" local spots and big name chains (I see you Gino's...eww) but this is the real deal, stuffed pizza. There is a difference between "stuffed" and "deep-dish" pizza...I could school you but you should figure it out yourselves. All I will say is get yourself a stuffed super veggie with extra sauce and you'll taste the difference! Giordano's may be a tourist's haven but their reason is in their pizza. Best in Chicago! But go ahead and try the others...you'll be back for some of their real deal stuffed pizza!
