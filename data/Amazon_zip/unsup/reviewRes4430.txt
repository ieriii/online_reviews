The music was GREAT but boy was I surprised how rude the waitress and bartenders were there. I went to the Green Mill on a Sat night and it was packed but we finally got to sit at the bar. The drinks were tiny and expensive. The waiter definitely kept shushing people and yet at the same time told this one customer to speak up when he was ordering because he couldn't hear him... eh....ok. Well, the waitress kept b*tching to the bartender about her customers who were supposedly too noisy. But they were sitting right behind her!!!! Could you say it a little louder? I just couldn't sit back and relax because I think I was too agitated by the staff. Next time I will make sure to get there early and sit as far away as possible from the bartender and waitress.
