I had heard so many great things about this place, but really came in not knowing what to expect. I showed up at about 8:30 for a few drinks with friends, and didn't have to wait in line, though there was a 20+ person line when I left two hours later. The entire time I was there, the place was open and not at all crowded. Huge bonus to them for not packing the place and thereby ruining the atmosphere. The space was huge and airy, yet at the same time really intimate. I never got a whiff of pretension from anyone, especially not the girl at the door checking IDs. She was without a doubt the friendliest ID-checker-person I've come across. Waitresses were the same way, and were good about making sure we understood that the drinks take a while to make. The drinks themselves were all really interesting and tasty too. Nothing watered-down, nothing bland, and nothing extraneous. I was impressed by the creativity and surprised by how good the drinks were. It's easy to be intimidated, but try something crazy and you won't regret it. My favorite involved Laphroig in some context... I think it was a Cognac base. While this isn't a place I would go to regularly, it does a perfect job of being what it is, and I will always be happy to go back.
