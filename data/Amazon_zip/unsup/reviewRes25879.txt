This pizza rocks! It's funny that they call it a pan pizza (and it is), when you order it they correct you and call it deep dish. Whatever, it's called is carmelized cheese crusty goodness. These slices are no joke, they are just as filling as a deep dish should be. Had sausage and mushroom and it was yummy. Their sausage means meat, not those rinky dink sausage balls. Even though I really, really, really love deep dish this stuff is tops! I'd come back again and again. The line can be ridiculous, but they do a good job of getting people in and out. The option to start your order ahead of time also helps. This pizza is worth it.
