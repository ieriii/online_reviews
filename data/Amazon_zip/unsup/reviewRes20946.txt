this would be a five star place if it were stuck in the middle of a less than touristy spot. it really is quality food, cooked with care and thought, splashed with love(tainted with the scent of tourists as they are everywhere including in my shoes as I confess am one of them as I do not live within blocks of this location) the hype simply does not meet my expectations. so I erased those and started over. enjoyed my company as we waited and looked over the menu items which kept changing as time passed and finally upon ordering decided on a little bit of everything to share and to taste and to fill the belly she got hungry while she waited. its good. its not wait so long good. but its stop by abuelita's place for some grubs and hugs good. que bueno
