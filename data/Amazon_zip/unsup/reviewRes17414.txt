I loved this place. It's not crowded inside because they don't let everyone in at one time. I know waiting in line can be shitty but, it makes the place more enjoyable for you and your significant other or friends once inside. After having dinner at Spring me and the wife stopped in for a drink. Although, she likes R&B and dance and I like all types of music we had a good time. Were are going to bring our friends with us on our next visit. One thing that I would change about the place is the drink selection. It could include the new school of vodatinis. I would have given it 5 stars. My wife and I are fans of the newer sweet drinks. Don't let that fact stop you from visiting this place, it definitely has a cool cosmopolitan vibe.
