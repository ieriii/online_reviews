I am generally not a fan of the deep dish, but Gino's has changed my mind. We stopped in during a snow storm so the place wasn't busy at all. Due to the 45 minute wait for the pizza, we went with some beer and an appetizer. Probably shouldn't have wasted our time on the mozzarella sticks because we needed all the room for the pizza itself. It was huge, but so delicious...a beautiful combination of cornbread dough, sauce, and a mountain of cheese. Sure I could hear my arteries clogging with every greasy bite, but if my heart had seized and that had been my last meal, I would have died a happy woman. It's best that I don't live in Chicago, though. I'd likely gain 300 lbs from my frequent trips to this place!
