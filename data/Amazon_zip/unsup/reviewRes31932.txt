OH. MY. GOD. Sunda is amazingly delicious. It's not just sushi, but an Asian fusion restaurant so you get to try a little of everything. I came here during happy hour, and at least 20 things are on the hh menu plus a different drink every day. The food is out of this world. You have to get the corn fritters, the pork belly buns, the firecracker roll, and the ridiculous dessert which is....ridiculously good. 5 stars!
