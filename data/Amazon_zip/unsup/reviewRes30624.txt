I was in Chicago for an association meeting and one of the companies that we do business with offered to take a bunch of us out to dinner. This place is fantastic! I had the filet and it was tender, juicy and full of flavor. Nothing like mid-western corn fed beef. We had a bunch of side dishes that were excellent. The only negative thing about this is that the sizes of the steaks were huge.  I highly recommend this place if you are in Chicago.
