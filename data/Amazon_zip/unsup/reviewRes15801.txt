I LOVE this place. Its one of those places where staring at the light fixtures will take your attention away from the bill. Those ceilings have to literally be 100 feet high lol. I LOVE their waiters, they are ALL very well in tune with the menu and will help you in choosing a great meal/drink. I've been three times and each time I ALWAYS get the Ropa Vieja appetizer, i think that alone will keep the doors revolving. I've had the Pork Adobo twice and the Arrachera. My I ordered, by waiters recommendation, the Aged Rum Flight 14- Ron Matusalem 15 year, Dominican Republic. INSTANT BUZZ. We shared a chocolate mud-esque w/ ice cream dessert and it was so good we convinced the party next to us to get the same thing. I haven't rated it 5 stars even with visiting 3 times because I want to try other entree's out of my comfort zone to see if I enjoy them just as much. But on a scale of horrible to best of MY comfortableness I give it 5 stars.
