YUM! We came here for breakfast Saturday morning and we were so happy we decided to venture over to Division street. We were given a number and told it would be about 20 minutes for a table, fast forward 3 minutes and we had a table outside before we had even ordered! Awesome! We split the Orange French Toast and the Huevos Rancheros and both were delicious. I have definitely never had huevos the way it was served here, but it was a great idea with the tortilla chips, black beans, tomatoes/onions topped with scrambled eggs and cheese then baked. The Orange french toast was equally as delish with slivered almonds on top. It was not overly sweet, which I thought it might be. The fresh squeezed orange juice was just right, I usually water down my juices, but there was no need for that here. I would love to check out their lunch menu next.
