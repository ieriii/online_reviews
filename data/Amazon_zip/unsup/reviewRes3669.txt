i tried crisp for the first time about a year ago, and decided that a labor day weekend hangover was the perfect opportunity to get another taste of some fried korean goodness. holy crap. it's a good thing that the parking situation is such a nightmare and they don't deliver to me- this shit is amazing! i walked in, grabbed a menu, and immediately had a super friendly (and cute) employee helping me make decisions. my chicken sandwich with sassy sauce was stellar, the wing i tried was huge and extra crispy, and only the onion rings were bland and below average (my fault for ordering them- i should have made room for more wings instead)! the cutie behind the counter explained all their sauces in detail, and even put samples of each one in my to-go bag. for the record: sassy is the best, close second is the tangy bbq, and i'll pass on the creamy lookin red one. we'll meet again, crisp.
