This was definitely an experience. To the people who gave this place 1-star because they couldn't get a reservation, all I say, is that you didn't try hard enough. Keep calling and you never know. We were able to get a 5:30 reservation which seemed early but when you are at a magnificent dinner for 2 1/2 hours, it worked out perfectly. The food was incredible---and that is an understatement. If you are keen on snotty waiters and soft classical music, try somewhere else. This is a place to hear solid music, eat food that will blow you away and have fun. Every course was amazing, enough said. My favorite (and by the way the most creative thing I have ever seen) was the Smores/Campfire beef---genius. The BYOB aspect also is a very nice addition. Chefs were nice and passionate about their craft and I will be doing my best to get another reservation. Well done guys.
