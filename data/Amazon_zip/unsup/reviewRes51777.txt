i have been going here since i was a kid when we lived in lincoln square, i miss lincoln square, before the remodel. now with the remodel its even more pleasant to sit enjoy chips salsa, corona, and chicken enchiladas with the red sauce. most people i know go for the steak burrito, i think its great, but i can get a burrito anywhere but the chicken enchiladas is good. my hispanic friends say "my mom makes it better", but my mom doesnt make it period, so to me its the best i have had in any mexician resturant. great food reasonable priced, full bar, great location what else more can you ask for???
