If I had to list my top 10 favorite foods anywhere, Irazu has to be at the top of this list. Their food is delicious and their Oatmeal Shakes are TO DIE FOR. I have seriously thought about intentionally missing my connecting flight when I have layovers in Chicago now for the opportunity to hop on the train and grab a shake. Seriously... its an addiction.
