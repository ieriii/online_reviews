This is an excellent and authentic Korean BBQ restaurant. Not only is it open late, but the beer, soju, and sake are all good quality. This place has serious appeal for carnivores who enjoy the cathartic burning of their own meat and vegetarians who like flavorful and pungent veggie offerings. The meats we ordered came with the option to have them marinated in a spicier sauce than normal. The servers brought no fewer than 16 delicious small side dishes that complimented the flavors of the chicken and Kalbi beef marinades well. Some examples are a mellow shredded seaweed, a sweet and creamy potato salad, a tart spinach and onion mix and a powerfully spicy kimchee dish. The white tofu miso soup was well-prepared and a savory sensation. The restaurant itself is incredibly clean and grease/soot free for a grill-it-yourself establishment. The grill firepot was delivered promptly and professionally. Everything was fresh and incredibly tasty. It was an absolutely authentic Korean BBQ experience and made me pine for my days in Seoul. People who complained about the service must be mistaking busyness for rudeness, because everyone working there was working hard and on the move constantly. But then again I don't go to restaurants to have my butt kissed. If my water glass is full and my food gets to me, I'm happy. Try the red snapper tempura!
