My wife and I went to The Gage during a business trip last October on the recommendation of the concierge at The Renaissance and we loved everything, repeat everything about this eatery. The service was attentive and very personable, the menu was both diverse and eclectic, the wine list was excellent, and the atmosphere was what I hoped for and expected at a downtown Chicago gastropub on a Friday night. My wife had a seasonal risotto and I had a regional sausage & peppers dish which were both fabulous. If you are visiting Chicago and want a true 'taste' of current Chicago restaurant fare, treat yourself to The Gage.
