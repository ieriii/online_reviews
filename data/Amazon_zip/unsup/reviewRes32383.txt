Not being a vegan or vegetarian I have to say that their food is pretty good...depending on what you get. I LOVE their nachos and lasagna, they had me thinking I was eating real meat for a second. The nachos will make u wanna slap someone!!! Lol The place is really small, but the staff is really nice and considerate. I will definitely keep going back.
