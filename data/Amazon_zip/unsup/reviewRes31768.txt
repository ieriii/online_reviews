Oh I can't say enough wonderful things about this place, so I'll try to keep it short. If you've never been here, you must go. I've gone to Chicago Diner with plenty of meat-eaters over the years and they've always been impressed. The Radical Reuben is divine! I have dreams about it sometimes. I've never had a bad experience here. Try the chocolate mousse cake. It's the best cake I've ever had and it just happens to be vegan. They have delicious shakes as well. Just go. You'll like it. :)
