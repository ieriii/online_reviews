Definitely worth the wait. Duck sausage with foie gras is amazing...and have been impressed with anything I have ordered off the menu. Staff is extremely friendly...Doug is always there to take your order! If you stop by on a Saturday, plan to wait 1+ hours outside...I have had good luck stopping by after 2pm during the week, and the wait is only 15 min.
