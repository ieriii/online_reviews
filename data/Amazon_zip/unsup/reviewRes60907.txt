I've been here several times on various trips to Chicago so I figured now was the time to write about it. They have two things that make this place worth 4 stars, without these two things the restaurant would be a 3 star place.1. The cheese plate menu- The Fat Cat is probably the best but others are really amazing as well.2. The truffle honey that the cheese puffs are dipped in. Both of those things elevate this place to a higher level. The service is entirely dependent on how busy the restaurant is. On nights that are less busy the service can be excellent. However, on nights where things are a little more crowded I have found the services slipping quickly. Otherwise, the food is general good and the wine list is extensive. If you have never been I would suggest you go.
