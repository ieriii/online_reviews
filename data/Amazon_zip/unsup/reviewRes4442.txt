If you haven't been to the Green Mill, or if you have, treat yourself to a visit when you have a free night. The place is every inch an old-world, endearingly aged classic jazz bar. Every time I've been there, I've been floored by the musical talent. My husband and I tend to be the annoying talkers at concerts and movies, and I for one am glad the Green Mill has a policy to deal with people like us: no talking while the musicians are playing. Fortunately, I haven't yet incurred the penalty for violating this policy; the music has been just too good for me to be taken by any urge other than to simply sip on my drink , sit back, and listen. A word to the wise: get there early on weekend nights to secure a table or--better yet--a clamshell-shaped booth.
