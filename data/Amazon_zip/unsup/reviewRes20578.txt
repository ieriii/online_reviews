Delicious & authentic, with great spice & creative use of local ingredients. Guac was good but not quite enough for the amount of chips supplied; torta (cochinita pibil) was great with actually spicy habinero sauce. I had the carnitas caldo and it was just perfect, even on a hot summer day. A couple of tasty beers put the meal over the top. Re: the space - this place seems designed for takeout more than dining in-house. We were there off-peak (3ish) and it wasn't crowded at all but I can see it filling up fast. The seating they do have isn't terribly comfortable - we gave up our coveted table to a pair of new mothers who just weren't going to make it sitting at the narrow bar. Overall, totally worth it but next time we'll try Frontera for the full Bayless experience.
