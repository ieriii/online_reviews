There is this never ending battle btw who has the best deep dish. Giordano's, Gino's, Lou's....to me, Giordano's wins every time. The key is to get it delivered and order it an hour before you are dying of hunger, or to just pick it up. I don't like eating there b/c there are way too many tourists and then I end up hating them for a ton of reasons (the main one being not knowing how to walk at a decent pace). Stick to the deep dish. The crust is the best IMO and it's just plain old cheesy, gooey, goodness.
