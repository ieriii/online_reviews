Took the wife to dinner here last night. It was our third visit. Once again we enjoyed the delicious pizza, friendly service and attractive dining areas. Every time we go, actual Italian people are talking to each other--in Italian! It feels totally authentic. We ate outside. It's somewhat swanky and you pay for that. The immediate area is a slightly down at the heels industrial corridor so in my mind I am expecting to hear some bittersweet accordion music and see some guys chasing a bicycle thief, yelling in Italian. This was kind of an off night for SpaNa. Our salad was generous and tasty. The grilled 'n' chilled vegetables featured peppers, eggplant and zucchini with plenty of garlic. But my funghi e salsiccia pizza had plain ol' grocery store mushrooms instead of something more interesting like portobellos. Wife's broccolletta + salsiccia was quite good. Rapini is bitter and tangy, I think you have to like it. Both of our pizzas had fresh moz and that wonderful crust. Our waitress was very pleasant but failed to mention their specials. Minus .000001 pts for that. The owner came around to offer impromptu slices of tartuffo pizza. I love truffles and was tempted to grab three slices. The pizzas have a little puddle of moisture at the center. That's just how they do it, get over it and enjoy the fresh flavors. I'm talking to you, people at the next table. Good selection of tasty and pricy wines, bottle or glass. We split an excellent tiramisu. Our decaf americanos were perfect. For us it breaks down like this. At the moment we actually prefer the flavor and value of Pizza D.O.C., about 10 minutes drive from Spacca Napoli. But SN is the better choice for a quiet romantic dinner. So if you're out with the kids or didn't get your hair did, it's D.O.C. But if you're wearing your grownup clothes Spacca Napoli.
