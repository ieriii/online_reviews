This was a fantastic experience. A small plate restaurant, you can share and try many things without committing to an entire dish. I highly recommend the beets which come with goat cheese and pistachios, pork shoulder braised in milk, and the house made sausage. Excellent service, and a real unrushed feeling while dinning. I'll be back for sure!
