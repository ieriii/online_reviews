I really wanted to be amazed by this place since I hadn't been here in quite a while, but it was not quite there. Service is fabulous and the atmosphere is incredible, but the food is hit or miss. The cocktail list is nice and the zico I had was yummy. The apps we had were 50/50 tasty but tough ribs and amazing spring rolls that you make into lettuce wraps. The fresh hot towels with lemon between courses were very necessary and a nice touch! The entrees were a miss. The filet with sate sauce was not good and the pork slices with fish sauce not any better. Meat was tough, sauces over-bearing and noodles and rice seemed rushed. Dessert was a fried wonton banana that was okay as we'll, but could have used a little spice inside.  Overall, $170 for five drinks, two apps, two entrees, one dessert and coffee is not bad. I have a feeling that there is a more incredible experience up on Argyle for far less, though!
