Okay, first and formost, Piece is a microbrewery. That is why it was created. They have won awards for their beer and they are excellent brewers. If you are a regular and don't drink their microbrews, shame on you. SHAME. Secondly, yes, the pizza is really good and refreshingly different from the regular pizza you get elsewhere. I like the white pizza best, but honeslty it is all really good. This could easily be one of my favorite places in the city except the crowd ruins it for me everytime. This is not a frat party people, college is over. Put down your miller lite and drink adult beer. YOU ARE IN A MICROBREWERY! There is nothing worse than being in a microbrewery and realizing you are the only one there drinking their beers.  My suggestion for real beer drinkers is to go early in the evening (4 or 5) or during the day on the weekend to sit at the bar and drink the good beer and avoid the frat party.  Oktoberfest was a wierd experience because the crowd once again rained on the beer loving parade. The brewmaster got all of the local Oktoberfest brews from the area for 5 dollars a pint. This was such a great opportunity to have the local beers and they invited the Polkaholics to bring in a little festivities. The Polkaholics are a great energetic polka-rock band. However, they were not "cool enough" for the crowd. People literally just started to leave once they started playing. This was a relief to me and my crowd because the people who stayed enjoyed the beers and had fun with the music. But I have never seen the place so empty before.
