Went here for Sunday brunch and I was quite impressed. We had a nice cozy table next to the fireplace, and didn't have to wait for a table (for two). Our server was one of the most attentive servers I've had in the city (which says a lot.. because I've had a lot of shitty servers).  The coffee was great, and my companion's Winter Scramble looked delicious. I had the homemade granola, which was a hearty portion with lots of good fruit.  We got the food incredibly fast... almost too fast. We were planning for a lazy brunch and we were finished pretty quickly, but the food was great. Split the bill and it was less than $30.00, which for the atmosphere and service, it was well worth it.
