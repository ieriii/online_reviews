i stayed here for a conference in May 2010 and the hotel was fabulous. the service was exceptional. i stayed here for 2 nights and from the moment i checked in to the day i checked out the the staff were very accommodating. the lounge area was incredible, the crowd seemed to be having a super time and provided good food and drinks. the room itself was good, i did not request a view that was not of any importance to me. i will consider staying at the W for future visits as the location of the hotel is excellent! overall, the service of the staff was the selling point.
