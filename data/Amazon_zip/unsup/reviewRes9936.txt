The food here was wonderful. I started with the gnocchi invernali, which were plump, well-cooked and stuffed with both potato and spinach: delicious. They bathed in a lovely tomato and mushroom sauce that really made the dish. But it was my entree, the ravioli "piccolo sogno" that really surprised and delighted me. With the exception of Celeste in NY, I haven't found a restaurant that serves a truly spectacular ravioli - Piccolo Sogno is it. As I ate, I kept telling my fellow diners the the ravioli was "divine." After the gnocchi, as you can imagine, I was stuffed, but the ravioli, with its beautiful butter and marsala glaze, smattered with pine nuts, was simply too good to put down. It was heaven. Really. If I was rating the food alone, Piccolo Sogno would certainly receive four stars. The food was not only authentic (which is so difficult to find), but absolutely delicious as well. But the service was a bit lacking - our waiter seemed neither interested in impressing us, nor particularly keen to serve us. He did not bother to walk us through the specials, and at several points we had to ask other members of the waitstaff for additional drinks. And while the decor was pleasant, it was a bit boring for my taste. There was nothing memorable about the decor whatsoever. I could have just as easily have been sitting at half a dozen other restaurants in Chicago. I would happily give Piccolo Sogno another go, however. The food is certainly worth a repeat visit.
