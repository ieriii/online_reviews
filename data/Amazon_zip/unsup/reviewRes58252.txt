How can you go wrong at place who's slogan is Cheese, Swine & Wine?...and it's boldly erected in metal on the front gate as you walk through the entrance! My wife and I chose The Purple Pig for our date night a coupe weeks ago because it was newer place we had never been to and not to mention that it is backed by some Chicago heavy hitter chef's from Spiaggia, Heaven on Seven & Mia Francesca (all places we love).We happened to be staying downtown so we were able to walk to the PP as it is located basically on Michigan Ave..we had no reservations, we were just talking our time because we were in no hurry. The patio, right outside the front door, was hopping.Fate was on our side because we got two seats at the bar, which is where we wanted to be. The bartender (who basically serves drinks 2 feet from the chef in the open kitchen, hence a very small place) was friendly, informative on the menu and attentive. The main dining room is small with communal tables which I thought was cool and different.Wine lovers, the wine list is vast and categorized by regions of the world... and they have great import beers on tap.The menu is mostly small plates with a different concept than most places...choices of cured meets, artisan cheeses, and smears of different flavor combinations to spread on little toasts...the whole menu reads well.The best thing we ate had to be the beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinairgrette...the pork fried almonds and chorizo-stuffed olives were also original and delicious too. I did see a lot of bone marrows being made and served throughout...they looked awesome. This is one establishment that you can truly recognize and experience amazing flavors!!Overall, a very cool, different, upbeat place with fantastic food and an unbelievable wine list. The atmosphere is busy but very enjoyable. Again the food is so good I cannot wait to go back. We simply loved it and talk about it regularly.
