Bit of a wait on a Tuesday night but that's because it was half off burgers. The burger was awesome and the mac and cheese was bomb. Despite the loud metal concert playing in the background on the tvs (I have nothing against Iron Maiden but I just needed to hear the person next me), everyone was very nice and the manager was very attentive and courteous. I WILL BE returning to this place soon. Especially to try "The Jail Break" a.k.a. the Fat Elvis and some wings. You'll know when you see the menu. I just wish it was a little bigger, but I can't knock them for real estate space in Chicago.
