Beautiful, mysterious, stylish, distinctive - these words only begin to describe the kind of experience the Violet Hour can be. The bartenders, servers, and hostesses are amazing and do their best to cater to your desires. The drinks are an experience - a one-of-a-kind experience that you don't want to miss out on. They are $12 and worth it in their quality and effect. The food is also reasonably priced and equally distinctive. The decor is lavish, as is the atmosphere. The music is versatile (I especially loved the Talking Heads play). There is a wait at the door usually (rarely over 30 min), but well worth it. The Violet Hour is an experience you desperately want over the mundane you've encountered at almost every other place you've been in your life.
