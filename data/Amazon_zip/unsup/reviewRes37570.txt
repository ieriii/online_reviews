Very nice upper end grocery store, very good prepared food (sushi!) section and bread and pastries (the focaccia is a great value, ham and cheese croissant a great breakfast), great selection of vinegars! Prices are on the high side, avoid buying normal items that you can get at other grocery stores (like Soda, condiments, etc) since it will cost you an arm and a leg. The take out sushi here is head and shoulders above most grocery store sushi, and great for a lunch.
