I'm giving it two stars for the environment they have created inside not for the service or the food. Now to the food, first off my order was messed up and instead of turkey I got lamb, I don't see how that could have been done. Secondly it took unusually long for the food considering it's just ONE crepe.There was no apology as to the mess up in the order. I went to the place hoping to make it one of my favorite spots after reading so many good reviews but sadly I will not be going there again.
