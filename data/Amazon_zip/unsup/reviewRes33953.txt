Well, was having a night where nothing sounded good, so I decided to try Sultan's Market, which I've been meaning to try for a long time.  I was in a munchy mood, and nothing was going to satisfy me, so I thought, why not try something new and see if that'll help me. Well Sultan's Market came to the rescue. For just over $10, my food salvation was found. Having never really ventured into middle eastern food (occasionally sampled small bits, and absolutely love hummus), I looked at the menu and decided on the chicken shawerma. What an awesome meal I got. I ordered some hummus for the week, plus the chicken shawerma, and having just finished it, I am so happy I did. I have plenty left over for dinner tomorrow, and it was amazing! I think I've found a new go to, for comforting the ADD food cravings!
