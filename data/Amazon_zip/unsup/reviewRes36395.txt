"Why the hell did you get a sandwich? - Meil's is known for breakfast!". I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just hungry and discovered this place while walking down Halsted with some friends.   Oh Meli, your Sun-dried tomato Panini with avocado, fresh mozzarella, and garlic aioli could bring me down on one knee and propose to you. But I won't, cuz that'll be weird. Aside from awkward moments, I think Meli is a staple to what a good lunch is suppose to be in Chicago. And I'm sure its also a staple for breakfast/brunch.  It's only about 3 blocks from the UIC-Halsted Blue Line and at the end-trails of Greek-town.
