What a disappointing experience! Save for my experience at the bar, I would totally skip it in the future. The view over Michigan Ave and the park are amazing, but the food and service were lacking in the refinement one would expect from a place like this. I went with a friend to try their "dine around" menu prior to the GFF. I was immediately impressed that they offered to accommodate my dairy sensitivity, but that fell flat. Courses were served unevenly, at one point they sent a rabbit ravioli with cream to my dining partner and I received roasted spring onions. Sorry but that just doesn't even come close to a relative substitute. Between the 2nd and 3rd course they completely forgot about us for 45 minutes. Not even the waitress came by to check on us. When you're treated that poorly, no matter how good the food is (and in this case, it wasn't) I'd rather spend my fine dining dollars elsewhere.
