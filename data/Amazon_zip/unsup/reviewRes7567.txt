Ah, just went to this place to celebrate finishing my step 1 with my wife who helped me with everything. First Salad bar and sides: not bad. To be honest, it was way less than what Plataforma had. However, I think they should never be judged with the quality of salad bar, so I will pass. They have three sides for free (cooked bananas, polenta and potato mash). They were pretty good. Meat: It was quite good, but not that great. I liked the Filet MIgnon (very tender) and the lamb rack (Perfectly cooked; the best dish I had today). However, their sirloin wasn't as great. Ribeye was ok, but not spectacular. Pork wasn't that good overall. It was bland and dry. Service: Very good. Quite satisfied. From the hostess to the servers they were very attentive, and my server even offered us some spicy sauce, recognizing we were from East Asia.  Overall, It was a good dining experience. 3.5 for food and a plus point with their service. I would recommend this place, but with some discretion in meat selection.
