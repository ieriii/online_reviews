Along with the Yelp reviews and personal recommendations, I had to go to experience the hype. My personal highlights: 1) Beer, beer, and beer The server actually had great suggestions based on mainstream beers I liked. My Swedish Guinness was damn good. 2) Pork Rinds Great munchie especially since it's pretty light tasting considering how they cooked it. 3) Mussels Even my shellfish-hatin' wife tried two. 4) Ambiance The vibe was awesome. Great for a date since the night I went wasn't that loud even though it was 3/4 full.  Go in big groups though. You get to sample a ton more.
