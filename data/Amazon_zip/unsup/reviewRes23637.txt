I'm not a big fan of crepes usually, but Icosium Kafe is great! I really like that is vegetarian friendly, so my veg friends don't get pissy when we choose to eat here! :) The food presentation is very nice and so is the waitstaff. If you're craving a sweet crepe, my favorite is the banana and nutella. If you're craving a savory crepe, I choose the Crepe de roma since I absolutely love portebello mushrooms.
