Called yesterday morning to see if it was possible they even had a turkey to pick-up later in the day, Thanksgiving. The person on the other end said they had 3 turkeys left and took our order. I went in the afternoon to pick it up and the place was packed! The gentlman who took the order remembered my name and couldn't have been more helpful. As I waited for my order to be filled I enjoyed a cold beer and watched all the action going on. I saw MY turkey come out from back and went up front to have it weighed. When I brought it home and tasted a sampling I couldn't believe it....the turkey was the most juiciest bird and the most flavorfull I ever tasted! As we sat down for dinner a couple of hours later my phone rang....It was Sun Wah saying my turkey was ready for pick-up! I told them I was already enjoying it! This bird matched in flavor any bird I have ever cooked and I have been griling turkey on the Weber grill for over 30 yrs. Thanks Sun Wah....YOU saved Thanksgiving
