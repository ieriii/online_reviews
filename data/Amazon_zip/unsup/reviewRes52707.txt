Went to Brazzaz last night for dinner. It was my second time there in the past year. (If you go during the week, they have a buy one get one coupon which always helps). I only allowed myself one trip to the salad bar in fear that I wouldn't have enough room in my stomach to try all of the meats. The seared ahi tuna was really good as were the assorted deli meats, cheeses, and oysters. The actual meat portion of the dinner was good. I think there were 13 or 15 different meats. My favorites were the pork ribs, filet wrapped in bacon, and the shrimp. Walking out of there I can honestly say my roommate and I were both full. Which for two 6 foot 220 pound guys is not easy to do. My only complaint is that the shrimp guy would only walk around once every 10 minutes. Clearly, everyone in the restaurant was waiting for him to come back to their table. They should have 2 shrimp guys walking around. But for $40 each after tip and tax, it was worth it and I will be back.
