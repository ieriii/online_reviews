Wow! This place is truly awesome! I had heard about this place for several years. Today 5 of us went there, for this special treat. We arrived at 12:50, we waited in line almost exactly an hour. As is usual Doug took our order. He was a pleasure to deal with. Despite it being a typical crazy day he was great. Since this was our first time we wanted to try as many things as possible. So in addition to each of us selecting one we also ordered 3 additional items. Two of us had the foie gras and duck sausage. This was very good. It was incredibly rich. Other items we tried were the Rueben/ tueben hot dog ( my wife loved it, me not so much). We also had the Thai sausage, this was unreal. In addition we had the cheese with chipotle mayo. Really good! The Sonora dog another winner. someone else had the chipotle buffalo sausage, they loved it. Three cheese sausage also good. For $1.50 we had to order a corn dog, fun treat. It was Saturday, we had an obligation to order duck fat fries.........OMG! These were truly a heavenly treat! While not an inexpensive lunch, this place is worth the wait, worth the calories and worth the cost! Chicago is the home of great hot dogs, this is the temple of encased meats! Wait in line, over order and enjoy the hell out of this great culinary experience!!
