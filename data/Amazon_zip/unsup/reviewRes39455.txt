One of the best meals I've had...maybe ever. We arrived around 8ish. The wait was about an hour, which gave us time to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink. I'm not a whiskey drinker, but figured when in Rome (or Logan Square) and deferred to the bartender to make me a whiskey drink I could handle. He confidently told me he makes the best Whiskey sour in town, so I rolled the dice. I was not disappointed. Perhaps there is a whiskey drinker inside me after all... At our table, we started with the Slagle family meatballs. These were so good, that I feel like I should send the Slagles a thank you card. I could have eaten 2 more bowls of them. Next up was the pretzel with welsh rarebit - also exceptional. Then, the gnuddi - which was really good...but tiny. Seared scallops with braised oxtail to finish. Outstanding. Scallops were cooked to perfection and the oxtail and gnocchi complemented them perfectly. My friend wanted the chocolate tort so we had dessert. I had a few bites and it didn't do much for me, but I'm not that into sweets. The table next to us had the donught things. They looked awesome. Service was good. I had anticipated some pretentious hipster attitude, and I'm pleased to report there was none of that. Everyone was awesome, and the space is cozy and cool. Congrats on your much deserved Michelin Star, L&E. Can't wait to come back.
