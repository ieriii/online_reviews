Could this be the best, valued restaurant in Chicago? Well, if BBQ is a cuisine of choice, it just might be. That's a heck of a statement given the reputation and the current perception of the restaurant scene in our city, but let me point out some observations and realities that just might persuade your consideration.High quality organic meats. Detail in preparation. Savory tastes from top to bottom of menu. Exceptional wine pairing list (Zin + BBQ = Fun) Friendly/knowledgeable staff. Great ambience. Deference to the competition. GREAT value. Lee Ann Whippen.You're probably like, it's only a BBQ place, dude. Chill out!Well, you'll have to check it out.  That's all I can really say.
