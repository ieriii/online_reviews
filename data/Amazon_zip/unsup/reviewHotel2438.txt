There is no doubt that the Hilton Chicago sits in an ideal location of Chicago. It is in walking distance from the Art Institute, Grant & Millennium Parks, the L, and likely the best coffee in Chicago, Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea. However, the hotel itself leaves a lot to be desired. While historic and magnificent in its own right, it's functionality leaves little to be desired. I found the plumbing to be poor (low water pressure), fixtures gaudy (gold and tarnished), and sadly, the overall cleanliness questionable. I'd rather spend a bit more for the W or perhaps even settle for the hostel around the corner. Love you, Chicago. Don't love you, Hilton Chicago :(.
