Lockdown, Lockdown.... How do I love thee? Let me count the ways: 1 - peanut butter, 2 - bacon, 3 - banana, 4 - delicious juicy burger, 5 - squishy soft delicious pretzel roll. Yes friends, I'm talking about the Jailhouse Rock (AKA Fat Elvis) burger. I wake up craving this thing. If you haven't tried this thing yet - go. Now. I know I already gave you 5 stars, Lockdown, but you get another 5 - but this one is for Elvis.
