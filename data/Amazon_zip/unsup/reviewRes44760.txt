Wow, bombalicious pizza, man! That's how I remember the Giordano's pie. The pizza is super thick, and baked tall like cheesecake. Layers and layers, like lasagna baby! I've tried pizza in: Italy...super thin, crackerlike crust Da Left Coast...hate it Regularly now in New York City...average pizza joint has 'bout 1/2 inch or so crust But the hype I heard iz Giordano's is da bomb for Chicago T-H-I-C-K style pizza...yo, belee da hype Yo, if this joint were to plop a shop in Manhattan or just about anywhere else in New York City, it'd be instant success! Gimme a shout out, if any of y'all know a pizza joint like Giordano's in New York City.
