Wow. I was prepared for a "food as a chemistry set / circus" experience and while chemistry was a big part of it, I was blown away at the taste sensations and just plain great food. Everything was super. We did the 12 course with wine. Mind boggling good. Service was top notch. Jaw droppingly expensive of course but worth it.
