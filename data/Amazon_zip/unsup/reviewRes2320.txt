What can I say about this place that hasn't been said before? It's really that awesome. I am a vegetarian about 99% of the time but I just can't resist this place. I have had the Rattlesnake, the Alligator, the Kiera Knightley and about 5 or 6 other. My fave is definitely the Swiss Pork Weisswurst with Vincent Van Gogh cheese. It melted in my mouth and was nothing short of amazing. If you get here before noon on the week days the lines aren't bad. You will still wait but not nearly as long, about 15-20 minutes at top. They serve fries cooked in duck fat on the weekend and the wait is painfully long. I stuck it out once just to try them and have to say that I won't wait that long again. I really couldn't tell the difference. Whether its your first time in Chicago or you are a local, definitely give Hot Doug's a chance.
