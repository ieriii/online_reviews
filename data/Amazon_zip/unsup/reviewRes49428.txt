I've never eaten here, but I stopped by for a drink with my friend. We found the couch area near the bar very "romantic." And then we made out. No, just kidding. We did order some white wine flights. Unlike its name, the "Express Yourself" did not disappoint. The server instructed us to taste from left to right. The first wine was just meh, but each glass got progressively better. My favorite was the Dr. Loosen Riesling. This particular selection was on the sweet side, which was nice right after dinner. I would come back to try some more wine flights. It was a surprisingly good value at $14 for about two glasses. Nice buzz, too.
