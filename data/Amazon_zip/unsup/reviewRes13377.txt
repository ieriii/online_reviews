I was pleasantly surprised by Revolution Brewing Co. Stopped in with my boyfriend, brother and siblings-in-law because it was, well, there. And we were down the street and hungry. Cons: The place is a little too Chicago-bro-y for me. Like, big flatscreen TV's showing sports games and stuff. My brother-in-law really liked his margherita pizza. My brother was not-so-wowed by his mushroom pizza. Too few non-alcoholic beverages available for those of us not interested in boozing before 10am (not that there's anything wrong with that). Pros: Fair number of vegetarian options, which was surprising. The tofu scramble that I shared with the bf was delicious. And filling. And delicious. But a little too expensive for the quantity of food we received. Looking forward to coming back and trying some of those beers.
