The Bad Apple is actually pretty good in my book! I think they have a great beer and food menu and am looking forward to going back and trying something else. I had a hard time deciding which sandwich to order but finally went for something different: the duck confit sandwich. It was very tasty and I liked how it was not the typical burger or chicken sandwich. It came with fries, too, which were tasty... definitely better than most places. The portions are huge and the price is reasonable. Also, it is a pretty big space in there and would be a good place to have a large gathering or you can probably even rent out a private room. I can't wait to go back!
