I have been here five times so far. I should really go more often. Each time I have orders a seafood related dish so I can only advise on their seafood selection. I have gotten the Seafood Alfredo, Clam Chowder, Rainbow Trout, Yellow Perch, and all you can eat shrimp. I have to say your eyes are bigger than your mouth. Those shrimps were yummy, but you really need to like something to get all you can eat. Every time I have gone here I have had a wonderful experience. So far my favorites are the Seafood Alfredo, Clam Chowder, and Rainbow Trout. I have to say I was never a hug fan of Clam Chowder, but since I had it here I not make sure to order it every time :) The seafood Alfredo I could not get over how the scallops seemed to melt in my mouth like butter. (making myself hungry). Lastly the Rainbow Trout. It is quite different from what I traditionally eat. Never thought I would like brown sugar on fish, but it works wonderfully. Really wish they had bottomless clam chowder as an option, that would be awesome. I could eat that as my whole meal. Service is pretty good. Just takes some time for them to get around to everyone, especially when there is seating outside during the summer. Also the interior does have a very good diner feel, but last time got a wobbly table by the door. Not a big deal, but just a bit annoying. Still love their food. Also you gotta love a place that has a sign saying "Unattended children will be given free coffee, and a puppy", lol.
