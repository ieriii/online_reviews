Any other day, I probably would give this place 3 stars but I'm feeling generous today. This place reminds me a lot of the Cheesecake Factory. It has a great atmosphere and this place is very nicely done. I came here for lunch with my dept. Our group had 16 people and the service was handled nicely for a large group. We all ordered what we wanted, apps, entree, and dessert and everything came out fine. Overall this place was great, I just thought the food was okay. I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade to drink and it was sooooo sweet, almost syrupy. My entree was the Crispy Carmel Chicken, it was pretty good, it had a little spice that made it really good. My dessert was the Rustic Apple Pie, this, I was not a fan of.  I didn't like the crust, so ended up eating just the apple and the ice cream.  I would probably come back and try their sandwiches one day but most likely opt for Cheesecake Factory.
