Delicious. At everyone else's suggestion I got a sandwich, and two sides (fried plantains, and a cheese and chorizo emapanada). It was way too much food for one person, but somehow I ate all 3 trays without noticing. Thanks to them for putting the water jug, and cups outside. I'd finished my soda about halfway through the meal and didn't want to pay for another drink. You'll need to pair frequent appearances here w/ frequent appearances at Xsport. I spent 2 hours after my visit in a food coma on my couch, thinking about what I had done, but nonetheless pleased w/ myself.
