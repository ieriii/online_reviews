Tank Noodle is one of my favorite spots on the North side to grab a fast, thoroughly enjoyable meal with a friend or two. My pals and I come here at least once a week. It is affordable, service is usually very quick, and it has a great casual atmosphere. A typical visit for me begins with the spring rolls, preferably with just shrimp (menu #7). Lately I have been all about menu #83, which is beef, pork, shrimp and an egg roll on top of noodles. Not only are the flavors in the meats really unique (a lemony beef, amazing bbq pork), it is a cooler (temperature wise) option than the normal soups I order. Also, the portion size is more reasonable than the sometimes overwhelming bowls of soup (That being said! I love the soups here. My favorite is the seafood soup with rice noodles, I forget the menu #). While I don't normally get desert here, the one time I did, it was really great. petite and light was the banana sweetie baby (the name is why we ordered it). The only real draw back to Tank Noodle is that the service often times leaves something to be desired. While food comes out quickly, you may be left sitting for ten or so minutes before your order is taken, water is refilled, or something like that. BUT! It's so tasty and cheap, its worth the experience.
