I feel that Superdawg is overrated. Their hot dogs and Whoopercheesies are decent, but they overprice everything. You come here for the experience of going to a drive-in. Usually on a hot summer night. In a car with a bunch of your closest friends. That, I will give them, is pretty cool. Especially if you pick the time when there's a bunch of people sitting in sweet antique cars. Come here as a tourist, but if you're a native Chicagoan, don't waste your time coming back.
