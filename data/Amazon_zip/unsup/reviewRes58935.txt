Place was extremely overpriced for the quality of food your getting. Had the sushi and it was average at best. Do yourself a favor go down the street and grab it at Sushi Samba instead. It will be cheaper and taste better. Cool decor but that will only get you so far when you leave feeling like you didn't get any value for the high price you paid.
