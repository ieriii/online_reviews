I've been here a couple of times... one for a Ford party and another for the Glamourama afterparty. Both times were fun so i have nothing negative to say bout the place. It's very spacious and I had fun!! I don't know how much the drinks were since they were free. THo I wasn't overly impressed since I haven't been back!
