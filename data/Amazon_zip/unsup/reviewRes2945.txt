I went here with my boyfriend for their dessert menu. We were seated in the lounge and our table was already set. The decor is very cool, modern and fancy at the same time. We had the dessert tasting menu and each ordered a dish! They were all so good and fun to try. Our waiter was especially nice and attentive to the both of us. The desserts was soo good, I am looking forward to coming back and trying their fixed dinner menu!
