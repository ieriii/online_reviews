I came here for a birthday party on a Friday night and boy was it packed! I can't remember the last time I went out and had someone pretty much up against my back while I ate. That being said, we waited about five minutes for our reservation and then we were all seated. I also love craft beer so this was the place for me! We started out with the Red pizza which includes traditional tomato sauce and mozzarella pizza. We also had the White pizza with plain crust brushed with olive oil, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese. For beer we had to try the Golden Arm and the Dysfunctionale. I never make it out to this area of Chicago often but I'm very glad that I was able to leave Lincoln Park behind for a little while and indulge! I will be back, hopefully sooner rather than later.
