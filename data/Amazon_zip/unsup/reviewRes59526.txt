This place is overpriced for what you get. The food is ok at best and the service stinks. I went on night with friends for late night grub and they were really stingy with the banchan and the grill barely worked. I wouldn't go back to this place. In fact I curse the place every time I drive by it to my girlfriend. She thinks it's hilarious, ha-ha.
