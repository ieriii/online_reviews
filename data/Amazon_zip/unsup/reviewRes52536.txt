My first experience at a Brazilian steakhouse. Service was excellent. All of the staff was polite and attentive.  The meats were all quite good. The lamb and filet were very solid. The flank steak was damn near perfect. The ribs could have used work. They weren't awful, but definitely need to be cooked at a lower temp for a longer period of time (I love pork). The salad bar section brought this down. Just 'meh.' Nothing was awful, but nothing was above average either. For the cost, it'd be nice if they didn't skimp it here. The wine selection seemed to be good enough for my wife (I don't know a damn thing about wine. I just drink what she tells me to.) The beer selection was just OK.  I don't live in Chicago, but if I visit again, I likely won't go again. It wasn't a bad experience, but for what we paid, I know I can find better.
