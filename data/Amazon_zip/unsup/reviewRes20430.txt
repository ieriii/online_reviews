I had an outstanding meal tonight at The Gage. This was a last-minute find for me on Yelp as I'm visiting from San Francisco. I was suppose to have dinner elsewhere with work colleagues but our timing was off.  While the burgers and fish & chips I saw on other tables looked amazing, I was trying to keep it on the lighter-side due tonight. I started with the Sliced Hamachi (w/celery/red chile/sherry gastrique) followed by a special of the day, White Gazpacho cucumber/grapes/cumin) with Crab & Cuttlefish Tobiko. Perfect food for a warm evening. My real splurge item was the Eel & Foie Gras Terrine. Fantastic! This was a great and unusual pairing of two of my favorite food items. They served this with some beautiful and unusual crackers which were tanned and glossy with some herbs embedded in them. I actually also ate this with some of the delicious multi-grain sourdough (my guess) bread which came to my table steaming hot. My server Amanda was so pleasant and helpful. The rest of the staff also took great care of everyone.  I hope to return to The Gage the next time I'm in town.
