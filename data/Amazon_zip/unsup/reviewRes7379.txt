We got a coupon in the mail for a $68 four course dinner, including a bottle of wine. Obviously, we were weren't going to turn THAT down. We had the bruschetta, caesar salad, rigatoni caprese, spaghetti with veal meatballs, and tiramisu. All were fantastic. We half-expected that the bottle of wine would be kind of crappy........um, no. It was great. And my husband is a wine snob, so I'm not talking about some Yellowtail crap or anything. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the pasta dishes themselves seemed a bit overly salted. But I'd definitely come back again!
