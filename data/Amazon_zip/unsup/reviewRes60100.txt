Some friends drug me here during Mardi Gras, in spite of my many reservations. Being pescetarian, the "Coastal Southern Cooking" intrigued me, but I sensed there would be some form of pork in everything, and if there's one thing I can't stand, it's greasy pork. I was assured that the menu would be very eclectic, and being in Andersonville, they'd have at least a couple of veggie options.Well call me a fan, there was a lot to choose from! I wound up going with a mushroom etouffee on the Mardi Gras menu, and my friends got a po boy and two others split a sampler. I can't speak for teh sampler, because there was pork in some of it, but I did taste the vegetarian beans and they were smoky, spicy. My etouffee was awesome, rich and flavorful, and the fried oyster I snuck reminded me of why I miss the whole belly clams back home - crisp on the outside, perfectly juicy on the inside, with a nice briny flavor.The best part of the meal was our server, she was such a sweetheart taking her time with me, going over my many options, offering special things off the menu for a non meat-eater, and being really patient with me, and ended up smiling and saying "great choice" when I just settled for the etouffee.They have an interesting drink list I'll be back sometime to explore - but I did really enjoy a simple hurricane, not a traditional interpretation, but sweet, well-spiked, and tasty!
