We arrived here at 6:40 on a weeknight, and were told it would be an hour and a half to two hours. No biggie, we'll walk around and hang out, but can you call me if something opens up sooner than the hour and a half? The hostess says they will take down my number, but I doubt anything will open up before then, so just show up after an hour and a half and let us know when you're back. Quite snottily, I might add. So, after an hour and 15 minutes, we get a call from a very nice lady that there's an open table. Rick Bayless definitely lives up to the hype. Ceviche trio is awesome. I know it wasn't a full order of each ceviche, but I do wish the Yucatean had more shrimp in it. Frontera ceviche sounds like an odd mix, with olives, tomato, and green chile, but it was so good. And the Tropical Tuna was great and super fresh and tasty as well. Also delicious, were the duck carnita flautas. Crispy and saucy goodness, the meat was soft and delicious. And when you visit a Bayless restaurant, you need to order something with mole. Mole poblano enchiladas? Yes please. Even my sister who isn't into moles said it was good. Every minute of waiting was worth the food that came out in the end.
