This place lived up to the hype, and then some! It might just be my new favorite place in all of Chicago. The hostess greeted us with a warm smile and took my cell phone number, telling me that it would about a half hour wait. And in almost exactly 30 minutes, I got a call from her informing me that our table was ready. While we didn't get seated at the very back, which would have been ideal, we still were conveniently perched on some high chairs across from the wood oven pizza section. We were able to observe the people seated immediately adjacent to us and get a sense as to what we might or might not order. Upon our waitress' recommendation, we tried the Greco white wine (which was delicious) and very affordable. Our plates consisted of the tomato and mozzarella salad (she was right -- the mozza might just be the best I've tasted outside of Italy), the pork belly (simply divine), the rigatoni (mouth watering), and the grilled chicken (which took awhile but was well worth the wait -- tender and spiced *just* right). We topped this off with an amazing chocolate hazelnut dessert. The evening lasted about three hours (but felt more like an hour and a half) and cost less than $80 for everything above. I've eaten in Rome, and believe it or not, this meal actually bested anything I ate there. I can't wait to go back.
