We had a really bad service experience here the other day, 97.8% of it the as a result of a lousy performance from our server... Might have been new, might have had a [really] bad day, not sure. Throw in a few minor missteps from the kitchen and it was frustrating to the point of just having to laugh. Still, having been to Big Jones a few times before and LOVING it every time, we knew this wasn't the way things normally go -- the exception rather than the rule. Why 5 stars? Because the issues were pointed out to the Chef and he took care of everything -- made it all right. This is the sign of a professionally run kitchen that knows the meaning of customer service. And for that reason, I'll continue to recommend the restaurant to others and patronize it myself.  I do have to wonder the reason for having no bartender. It seems the servers would just have a better time at things with a little support staff. I'd love if someone from the restaurant would PM me and tell me the reasoning behind that. Just curious.
