KFC really stands for Korean Fried Chicken. Picking up the little man from the Southport Trick or Treat and the Android Yelp App comes across Crisp and it was on. Here was the family order: Seoul Sassy Whole Fried Chicken Seoul Steak Bowl Side of Kim Chee and Onion Rings? The meal really hit the spot. Thank goodness we ordered take out, brought it home, and had an extra pot of rice waiting. The Seoul Sassy sauce was awesome. The Seoul Steak Bowl did not stand a chance for the kiddies were starving. Thank you Crisp and Yelp Android App. You make the family trips to the city all the more reason to keep coming back.
