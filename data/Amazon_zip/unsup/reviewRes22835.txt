Last fall, my fiance and I came here for dinner when we were scoping out Chicago as a place to move to from SF. Greek Islands made me think that I can live in Chicago since I love Greek food and we didn't have much in SF. Sometimes my world evolves around what lunch is.... We got the prix fixe dinner which was a great deal by SF standards and it was fun (yes, fun first) and delicious. It was fun because of the saganaki (fried cheese..opa!) and the insane amount of food. We have gone back since we moved here and it is not the wonder that it once was. I think it is because there are so many Greek restaurants here and they are all pretty tasty and fun. I also had an experience here where our waiter established an efficiency record but at the same time made us feel like we were being pushed out at 6pm on a Sunday night. Don't get the house red.
