I've visited The Publican twice and had two different dining experiences. My first visit was over a year ago. I ordered wine, oysters, and some type of steak (which may no longer be on the menu), and a chocolate cake for dessert. The wine was good but not memorable. The oysters were AMAZING. The steak was fine but not evenly cooked. I expected more consistent preparation, but alas, no. The chocolate cake was also just good -- nothing memorable. My date had the roasted chicken, which was a bit dry. French (or possibly Belgian?) fries accompanied the chicken, which were also AMAZING. I quickly concluded that if I were to return, I should stick to beer, oysters, and fries. Just returned last night to The Publican with no existing reservation and was able to score seats immediately at the bar. My friend and I ordered beer and the chef's selection of oysters. DELICIOUS. The chef's selection included three oysters each from the West and East Coasts. The kusshi and lady chatterlay were my favorites. My beer (Bellegems Bruin) was sour, savory, and gratifying with the oysters. All servers that we encountered were helpful and gracious -- even when our oysters took awhile to come out of the kitchen. So, considering the steep prices and lackluster food, why would I return? The atmosphere is great at Publican. I like the decor and energy. I think that it's not a dinner spot for me, but a place that I can end the night after a gallery opening or begin the night on my way to a club. I like that I can be spontaneous and just show up at Publican and have a seat at the bar and enjoy clean, briny, salty, meaty oysters and wash them down with wide selection of refreshing beers. It would be a simple, semi-occasional pleasure.
