Las tablas is a great columbian eatery. My server was very friendly and suggestive. I think that a table of three should definitely get more than one app. if everyone is hungry. The entree portions are good. The flavor comes out big time especially , with the skirt steak and pork loin. Corkage fee waived on Mondays. I will be back with a nice bottle of Malbec.
