Love Big Jones! They have by far the best ginger beer I've ever had. Go there and get this! They make it from scratch. I usually have at least 2 glasses That's before I start drinking the other craft cocktails. YUM! Oh and the service and food are so so so good. It's a wonderful indulgence to go to Big Jones and a great addition to the neighborhood! Popovers with your eggs benedict! Woohoo! Shrimp and grits! Yeah! I think I want to go here tonight for our date night :)
