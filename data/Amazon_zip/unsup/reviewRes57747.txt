Janet has a great place here. I am new to Chicago and 3rd Coast was the brunch selection of a first date. Sunday brunch was a little hectic, but the owner got us seated in about 10 minutes. I can't say much more than what has already been said. It's not in my neighborhood, but worth the trip. I look forward to getting back soon.
