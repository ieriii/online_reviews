Came here on a Saturday night with a party of 12, we waited in the lounge area just outside of the main restaurant while they prepared our table. We sat in the sitting area which was very limited since there was so many people waiting to be seated, there is more space in a mini bar they have then in the actual waiting/mingling area. As we entered the main restaurant your greeted with a multi color architectural high ceiling restaurant. As you walk your almost drawn to keep your head up so much just because your starring at everything since their is a lot of detail inside. We ordered a few apps for the table that included: Empanadas: had great taste but wasn't something I got a wow effect from. Puertorican Pasteles: it was plated very fancy, but the taste was not as authentic. Guacamole: was pretty good, they got the concept of adding the lemon juice and giving it that extra taste. Now onto dinner... I few of my friends went with a house special which was the flank steak with all the trimmings. I observed as the plates came and the only thing I thought was..... we should have ordered more apps because the portions were pretty small. I actually had a shrimp, mussel and scallop dish ( kind of like a paella ) which i thought had some pretty good highlights. The service for a table this large was not bad, they were coming by and asking how things were, we only asked a few times for re-fills. We didn't send anything back to the kitchen which is always a good thing.
