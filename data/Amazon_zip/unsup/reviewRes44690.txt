Y U NO PUT ENOUGH MARINARA SAUCE IN YOUR DEEP DISH PIZZA?!?! Also, the crust was... hard? My knife was really struggling to get in there and cut you. Don't worry, knife; you are not alone. my teeth also struggled. The cheese to sauce ratio was way off. It's like the gum to tooth ratio. There are some times when you'll lower your standards because hey, you like them enough to look past those superficial "flaws." You love their personality. But let's get real, Giordanos, you didn't quite have the personality to allow me to look past your outer flaws. Your pizza personality was nothing special, and your looks were just not doing it for me. Also, I think the waitress was having an off day. I don't know if she was slightly rude or if that was one of your cute little idiosyncrasies you were hoping I'd brush off. Sorry, bro. This date's over. Forever.
