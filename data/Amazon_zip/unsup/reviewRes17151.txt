I was dying to go to this place for months after passing it on 90/94 multiple times and hearing great reviews from friends. The restaurant is a little pricey so I saved it for a special occasion, my birthday. Between drinks, appetizers and food (very small portions by the way) the bill was about $130 for two people before tip. The food was tasty but didn't live up to my high expectations. If based on the food alone, I might give the place 4 stars, but it is way overpriced and definitely has an air of pretension when you walk in the door. Also the place was really crowded, and it felt like we were sitting on top of our fellow diners. Not the best place for a romantic date but probably more fun for a group. I'm not running back to this place any time soon, especially when there are so many other great and affordable Latino fusion restaurants in Chicago.
