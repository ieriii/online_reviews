Pros: Ambiance, sizzling steaks on 500 degree plates, sweet potato casserole, made to order au ju. Cons: Service What you should know: Opentable Member, United Milesplus triple point dining. I wanted to having a nice evening with my friends and decided on this establishment. It was 9pm and the restaurant only had four tables filled. So we expected fast prompt service as their were two servers working five tables including ours. However that was not true. Server came back only a few times, forgot to bring us appetizer plates and we had to ask twice. Steak was good but not as good as Morton's. However the sizzling steak plates made it different then others. The best side dish was the sweet potato casserole. Creamed spinach was disappointing. Desserts were OK.
