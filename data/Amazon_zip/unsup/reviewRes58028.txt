Just OK, If you are trying their gluten free items I would say don't. I had a pasta dish, the only things gluten free and I went home with it after and added things to it from my own fridge. Rice pasta doesn't really taste too much different than real pasta. The amount of things in the dish were minimal and I know for a fact that I could make a better pasta dish gluten free. The bar is great and had my favorite gin, which is important. I don't suggest going here for their gluten free items, if you can't eat gluten. It really is not worth it.
