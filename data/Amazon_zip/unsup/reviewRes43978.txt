Been here twice-both time, excellent dishes and friendly service. First time snagged a table outside on a gorgeous day, great BLT so 5 stars. Today waited for a half hour to be seated by yuppies and screaming kids, but wonderful vegetarian chili and the tastiest apple cider ever, so 3 or 4 stars. I'll be back, just earlier in the day-it's good food and a great choice when it's warm for their outdoor seating.
