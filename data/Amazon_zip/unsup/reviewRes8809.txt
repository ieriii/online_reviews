I love this place! My husband and I have been there twice and have enjoyed each meal. For an appetizer we ordered the Grigliata di Verdure (grilled veggies)...it's delicious. Even people who don't care for vegetables is sure to enjoy this appetizer. Also, the Salsiccia and Prosciutto e Arucola pizze are fantastic. We have tried a few other places that serve authentic style pizze...nothing comes close to Spacca Napoli's pizze. This place is truly one of a kind! It will have you coming back for more soon!
