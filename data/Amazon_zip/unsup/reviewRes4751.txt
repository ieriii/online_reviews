We visited the Purple Pig in April on a VERY rainy night. The outdoor tented area was getting pounded with rain and high winds. This place came HIGHLY recommended by other Industry people at other bars and restaurants. We had to try it. Wine Selection was EXCELLENT and the Food - while seemingly focused on it's name sake - Pig, was tremendous. We are fans of Spanish style Tapas and figured that a Greek/Mediterrean take on the concept wouldnt be to far fetched. It's been a few months since our visit, but there's one dish that still makes my mouth water... The Pig Jawls, served with a fried egg on top... The pork just melted in your mouth and was a blast of flavor. There was also a Foie Gras and Quince Smear that was reminiscent of a high-end PBJ! A great dinner, atmosphere and price point. Only negative... I wasn't crazy about the service. Our waitress seemed to have disappeared. I'm sure that's not the norm. This place is a DEFINITE stop on my next visit to Chicago!
