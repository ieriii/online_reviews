I recently went to piece to celebrate my birthday with some friends. We didn't make a reservation, because that's not how we typically roll, and it was a last minute decision. The staff was extremely accommodating, and friendly. Mark, the host was more than happy to help us, and Ryan our server was delightful, even though he was kind of busy. The food and the beer were fantastic. I don't have one bad thing to say about this place...if you're thinking about going, stop thinking, and just go.
