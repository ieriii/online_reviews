Have to admit have been here a few times now, and it is way over priced, and the food is at best average. You will have to wait awhile because the kitchen is slow, and people like to sit around for awhile after eating to just hang out. Maybe their best item is the bloody mary. Drink a bunch of these because you wont want to taste your food. I won't be going back to eat anytime soon.
