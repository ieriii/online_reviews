Oh, Allerton, you disappointed me. We booked the Allerton off of a deal we saw on travelocity. Our flight+hotel only for 300 dollars for the weekend? Omg, why not?? Allerton has great location. 701 N. Michigan Ave, right across from the Zara. A girl's best dream ever. But man, that hotel is small and old. The second floor is nice- they have a nice "M" lounge, complete with drinks and food. The tiny elevators took us up to our room and we entered. The room was okay. Came with a tv, desk, fridge, full size bed, and bathroom. It was just.... not that great. I mean, I've stayed (and lived) in much much worse, but the pictures are sure deceiving. It was a pretty old- the doors to the closet, the carpet, the windows, and the BATHROOM. The toilet had one of those flush handles you see in public bathrooms. You know, the ones where you use your foot to step on it to flush? The heavy duty ones? Omg. And there was no counterspace! I also wished they have provided amenities besides the shampoo and conditioner and soap. Like...some lotion? I was ready to give Allerton three stars until I saw what housekeeping did. Okay, they did not give us any washcloths. Big deal (not really). But OUR TOOTHBRUSHES. We had put our toothbrushes in the cups (as we usually do). We come back to the room Saturday night, to find our toothbrushes not in their cup but LYING in the bathroom. They were behind the bathroom faucet. EWWWWWWWW!! I'm not a germaphobe, but REALLY?!! Who KNOWS where those toothbrushes have been or where they have touched!! Disgusting. BLEH. I rinsed my in hot water for about a minute before sticking it in my mouth. Overall, good location, and it's fine. But if you're looking to pamper yourself? No way. Bad housekeeping will keep me far away from this place again.
