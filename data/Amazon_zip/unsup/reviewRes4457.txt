pros: historical cozy late night spot to enjoy some organ jazz and vocal jazz standards cons: i've never seen cocktail glasses so small. Small servings yet high prices. I once paid $17 for white russian... and it wasn't even made right. the only reason i gave it such a decent rating was because I value atmosphere more than price of drinks. But some people might not.
