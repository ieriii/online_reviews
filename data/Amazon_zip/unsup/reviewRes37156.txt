If your are staying in a hotel in the near by area then this place is great to pop into for lunch, breakfast or a sit down dinner. The restaurant was a pleasant surprise with a great view and varied menu but the taste of the food was just better than average. The prices for a pre made sandwich about 7.99 and really, I have had better at the Subway across the street. There are many speciality gourmet items, especially the candy. I love little stores like this as it really reminds me of the gourmet stores I am use to in Napa and SF.
