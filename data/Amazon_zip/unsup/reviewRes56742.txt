Wow is all I can say. My roommate and I came in for dinner on a Monday night and were treated to their family style dinner night. You pick 2 appetizers, 2 soups/salads, 3 entrees and a dessert. The apps arrived before we even placed our order with the server, we were thinking it was an error but when he arrived back with the wine he assured us it was correct. Not sure how they did that but it was fast and the avocado crostini was fabulous, as was the bruschetta. The caprese salad and butternut squash soup were also amazing and the portion sizes were just right. Not too much , just enough to satiate you and get you prepped for the next course. Our three entrees were caprese pasta, rigatoni bolognese and spaghetti with meatballs and sausage. The pasta was definitely made on site, fresh and that delightful chewiness you only get with freshness. The tiramisu was melt in your mouth fantastic. I highly recommend this as an amazing value and authentic Italian cooking which will make your taste buds sing.
