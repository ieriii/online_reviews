I live in the suburbs and my BF and I were going to the city for a night on the town and decided to get a room for the evening so we didn't have to worry about driving back. We looked at a few options and the location and price were the big selling points. We have stayed at The Hilton and Hard Rock and the Whitehall was about 30% less. We booked about 3 days in advance and it was about $150 for the night. The hallways were narrow and the front lobby and elevators were realitivly small. I already had the prenotation the rooms were going to be tiny, but to my suprise the rooms were really spacious! Super comfy bed with a bear skin blaket throw. The room was bigger than The Hard Rock and the Hilton. There wasnt a fridge but most hotels downtown dont have refrigerators. The location was su-purb! It was about a 2 block walk to the red line. We partied that evening in Lincoln Park and it was about a $12 cab ride back to the hotel.
