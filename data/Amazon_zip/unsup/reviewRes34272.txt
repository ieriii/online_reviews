Eggs Benedict, South of the Border Benny's, Crepes, The Farm House biscuits and gravy... where can you get so much good food for such a decent price? This is one of my favorite brunch places in the city, the food and the service are top notch. It does get busy during the typical weekend brunch time, but they get everyone in and out fairly quickly. I prefer stopping in during the week of course to have a little quiet with my big brunch.
