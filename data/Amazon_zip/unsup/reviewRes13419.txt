eee i couldn't wait to write this review because i jumped on this bandwagon hard and i'm in love. there was quite a wait for a wednesday night, but we had a group of four and each tried a new beer. this place is gorgeous. i loved the ambiance, and how you could see the kitchen..the waiting area, the wood..the bar. your must trys: get the garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes iron fist ipa!! LOVE. we bought a growler :) - growlers are relatively cheap here!! make sure to take one home. all of the food we had was great! a mix of burgers and pizza - and of course we tried their bacon fat popcorn that everyone raves about. the service was great - i can't wait to go back and eat and drink again and again.
