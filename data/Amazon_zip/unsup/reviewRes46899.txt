I can't believe I've never reviewed Uncommon Ground. I love this location, it's so cozy, like some lodge you want to go to after a long a day of skiing or hiking. It's also spacious enough that even when it's packed you don't feel overcrowded. I definitely prefer it to the Lakeview location (plus they have an organic garden on the roof...hello fresh veggies in the kinder months!). I've been here many times for both dinner and brunch and have never had a less than excellent experience. The meatloaf and various preparations of gnocchi are among my favorite dishes at dinner time. Most recently I went for brunch with a few friends at prime time on a Saturday morning. We were seated within moments of our arrival (which is awesome for a Chicago brunch spot). Between the four of us we had the Uncommon Huevos (x2), the Eggs Benedict (which was the special) and the breakfast scramble (which had leeks, broccoli and chedder on this particular Saturday). Everything was fantastic! The diner who ordered the Eggs Benedict is still raving about it over a week later! Plus our server was super friendly and attentive (I've actually had her before and she is always this way), which in my eyes is the icing on the cake. All in all, Uncommon Ground is a great place, whether you go in the evening and enjoy some live music or on a weekend morning for a fantastic brunch.
