Chicago, hands down, has the most amazing encased meats in the nation. It truly is a meaty heaven. I went to Hot Dougs after seeing it on the travel channel. Wanting to try as much as possible I ordered a regular hot dog, an Italian sausage, and had the man at the counter pick one off their special list for me. He surprised me with the foie gras dog. I told the man to fix all the dogs as if he were making them for his family. I wasn't disappointed. I began with the regular dog which upon seeing it wasn't sure on my plan of attack. It took the steadiness of a jenga expert to balance the pickle, tomato, and peppers. The dog was amazing. From the very first bite I knew Chicago wasn't serving your ordinary Oscar Meyers. The flavors from all the toppings melded into something magical. The second one to go was the Italian sausage. Crazy deliciousness. Just the right amount of spices in the sausage and so good I ate it too fast to tell you what they put on top. The final leg of my hot dog trek was the unknown foie gras dog. I've only herd about the fatty liver from shows like Top Chef and I was about it eat it for the first time on a hot dog. The sausage along with the foie gras and the creamy sauce on top make for something toe curling. First, foie gras to me was like a creamy well seasoned rich butter. And secondly, it is something I doubt you can get anywhere else. You must try this dog if you go there. Even if you don't like liver, which I don't, put the thought in the back of your mind and order it. You won't regret it.
