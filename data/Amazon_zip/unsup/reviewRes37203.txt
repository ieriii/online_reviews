Hopleaf combines great beer and great food in a wonderful setting. Whenever I'm faced with an extensive beer list I try to go for something local so I chose Finch's Dirty Bird and was pleased. I started with the cheese trio of the day and a selection of charcuterie. The cheese was good. For the charcuterie I chose the duck breast prosciutto, rabbit rillette, and lardo and all were very nice. For my entree I had the pork belly and head on prawns. The pork belly was amazing, the prawns were flavorful, but I didn't get much out of the head when I tried to suck the brains out. For dessert I ordered the Bourbon County Stout chocolate mousse. I had apparently ordered the last one they had and the bartender decided the glass it was served in wasn't clean enough and sent it back. Instead I received an Oatmeal Stout Brownie and it was very good. The only thing that disappointed me was discovering that the staff aren't allowed to taste the food. How are they supposed to know how to sell it?
