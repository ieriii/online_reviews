Pathetic really! We'd heard about this place from a friend, but we forgot about it for a long time. On the day we chose to go here we spent over 45 minutes trying to find its name, only remembering that it had a silly sounding name. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader if the name suits the place. Big Jones (argh! I need to know the story behind it) is not a Frat Bar or even restaurant. Sorry people that's what your name evokes. It is a REALLY REALLY good restaurant. There are other items on their menu that I intend to taste again but on my first visit the sirloin steak's description caught the eye, while the missus tried their signature catfish. We were both blown away by how good our meals were. Since it is a cajun joint it would be a crime not to eat some Gumbo which we did. I part regretted eating this because I wanted more but needed to save room for dinner. Finally and as important, the service was efficient, friendly and unobtrusive. Bottom line, why on earth did it take me this long!?
