Recipe for a delicious time: 1. Go to Crisp 2. Order the 5 Wings, get 3 seoul sassy and 2 BBQ 3. Make it a combo! 4. Eat, Eat, Eat, Eat, wash it down with a grape soda. 5. Go wash the sauce off your face and hands 6. Naptime Honestly though, excellent fried chicken...as the name implies, it's crisp, but also delicious, tangy, juicy, and pretty much perfect. the fries are also good, it's aways fresh and not very expensive. i'm not a fan of the bowls or burritos, but who really cares - the wings are to die for.
