So my boyfriend and I were disappointed in this place. He had been here before for beer and oysters at the bar since he couldn't get a seat. At that point he thought it was decent so he wanted to try dinner. We had a plate with different meats (forgot the name), the pig ear salad, the plate with rabbit, and the suckling pig. My fav was the pig ear salad, but that wasn't amazing by any means. The rabbit plate was some weird sausage thing that tasted more like very salty ham than anything else. The suckling pig was also too salty. With three beers, our bill was $110 and our experience (notably loud while bumping elbows with our neighbors in the communal searing) was definitely not worth that...maybe half that. Will not eat here again.
