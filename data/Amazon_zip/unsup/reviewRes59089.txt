For over two years my husband and I went to Yolk in the S. Loop almost every weekend, sometimes twice a weekend. Often we waited the 45 minutes-an hour as we always enjoyed our food. I recently called to make a reservation for my husbands 30th birthday and even offered to pay a deposit as they apaprently changed their reservation policy and do not take them anymore. The hostess told me that my best bet was to carry out. I think that everyone would agree that eggs are not the most practical of "take out" foods. I wanted to give the owner feedback as someone who has patronized his restaurant regularily since it opened that this response left a sour taste in my mouth. Instead of saying "thank you" he responded by saying that they serve 1200 people per weekend and that they don't need the aggrevation of reservations or our $500 breakfast bill. I was dumbfounded that an owner would actually say this to a regular customer.There are SO many amazing places to dine in this city. I will never give someone with this much arrogance a dime of my money again. Clearly he does not value loyal customers. If I were you I would take your money and spend it elsewhere. hash Browns, Bongo Room, and Gioco all serve great brunch in the S. Loop as well.
