Well the service was very very nice. Hot Doug's offers a nice warm welcome and takes your order with care. The dog was.....well....SKINNY. I actually get more out of a dog at Cosco when they offer the thick Vienna dogs. BUT, the dog was good, nice fluffy steamed bun, and fries were skinny too. Friendly place and I think the friendly-ness is the big feature here. Dog's are good, just not what I consider to be the best. Line moves fast - so don't let that deter you, just give it a try ya might just love it!
