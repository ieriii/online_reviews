In Chicago there is no shortage of pizza places....albeit, many of them very good. Everybody knows about the staples Lou Malnatis and such but honestly Pequods is hands down the best Chicago style pizza in town. Their sauce is incredible, the crust is perfect and the Carmelized cheese on the crust may be the perfect bite of pizza. Do yourself a favor and try Pequods if you have not already. There is a good chance that you will not want pizza from any other restaurant in town!!!
