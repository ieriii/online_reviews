Best bar I've ever been to. Period. I wouldn't even call it a bar. It's more like a time portal to a place with the best mixed drinks from all of history. We sat at the bar and the manager, Michael, gave us a mini-dissertation on several of the alcohols in what we ordered. We learned about the 17th century monks who first created Chartreuse, and the French government's attempt to steal the recipe of the 130 herbs and spices used in its production. The monks apparently fled to Spain for several years to preserve the secret. History lessons aside, the drinks absolutely blew my mind. I started with The Art of Choke, a drink that made me fell like real man without having to order something with Jack Daniels in it. This mixed drink would never have an umbrella. For a change-up I asked Michael to make me a "Fruit based drink, but not necessarily sweet. And I don't like grapefruit." He came back with a variation of an 18th century Cuban concoction, which fit my request even better than I'd hoped. I didn't know cocktails could taste like this. My friends tell me Violet Hour has been rated as one of the best bars in the world, and I believe it. The place only lets in as many people as they have actual seats for, so it's never crowded once you get through the line. With high back chairs and booths and comfortable stools at the bar, if I lived in Chicago I would come here at least once a week. Great place for a date -- just assure him or her the wait is worth it and neither of you will be disappointed.
