Ok, I've only been once, but considering I had my doubts (Feed the Beast was lame) I was pleasantly surprised. I know it's different owners, so I'm not sure where my preconceived notions came from, but regardless... The beer list is REALLY good. A lot of places are trying to be that gastro-pubby, wanna-be Hopleaf or Map Room, but I felt this beer list was pretty Midwestern focused. And no Delirium on tap, so hopefully that will keep the frat boys away. (P.S. Thanks frat boys for ruining Delirium for all of us.) We were so excited to see not the usual beers from New Holland, Two Brothers, Great Lakes Dortmunder (3.50!!), and even a bottled beer from our beloved Tyranena. I've only ever had it at the brewery in Lake Mills, WI. On to the food. I did not have a burger, sounds like some of the reviewers weren't thrilled with the burgers. I did, however, have the sandwich equivalent of crack. The Late Breakfast. Fried egg, bacon, provolone, pickles. So damn good. I did change my order from the pretzel roll it comes on to an english muffin. Even the bartender said "oh that sounds good!" Hello, it's breakfast! And honestly I'm over the pretzel roll. I know it's yummy, because it's 500 calories. But it's just TOO much. Even at Kuma's I can only eat half the bun. Enough with the bun, give me the meat! My hubby's pork sandwich was more pot roast than pulled pork, which he was sorta surprised by, but he still ate it all. Oh, and our fries were good. Crisp and salty. I'll go back for sure.
