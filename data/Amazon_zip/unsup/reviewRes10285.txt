I went there on a Saturday night without reservations and there was about an hour wait. Since the bar wasn't too big, we decided to run across the street to Emmit's pub. (That was a good idea... nice and low-key.. for a beer to kill the time.) We headed back over there and sat at the bar for a little bit and ordered wine. The bartender took our order. About 10 minutes later, the hostess seated us but our wine wasn't here and it turns out the bartender didn't even put our order in. So we get seated and our service for food was not that much better. Our waiter was nice and everything, but just wasn't attentive enough for this type of restaurant. It wasn't the worst service, but let's just say that I am definitely docking points due to being disappointed by the service. Let's talk about the food now. The food was tasty, but we were not overly impressed by it. We started with a beet salad that had ricotta cheese on it. The idea was good, but the cheese pairing wasn't right. The sweetness of the beet needed a stronger cheese to offset it. Then we tried a special ravioli purse that was filled with shredded beef. The flavor was good and it was nicely presented. We also got the crispy pork entree, which was nice and fatty... the way I like it! And it came with rosemary potatoes on the side. Bonus! Now onto the atmosphere. I felt like I was in a fancy, eclectic house. There were fancy crystal chandeliers and brightly colored blue walls. It was different, but in a good way. The room was pretty intimate and cozy. I would definitely like to go during the summer and try out the nice outdoor patio. The clientele, I would say, is more along the lines of older people with money. I did feel a little younger and also under dressed. It is not fancy in there, but people did dress a little nicer. Overall, it was a good dining experience. I think it would have been better if the service was a notch up. I did like that a lot of the people who worked there were speaking Italian.
