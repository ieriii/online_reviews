I honestly don't remember what I ordered here. I tried to look at their menu to see if I recall any of the items. Out of the menu items, I think the only thing I would have ordered would've been the peppercorn steak.  I've heard from friends that this restaurant was pretty good. I didn't think so. After all those years, passing by and wondering how that restaurant was, I realized I wasn't missing anything.  I think it's mostly like a vegetarian type restaurant.  The only thing I did like was the corn bread. It just fell apart in your hands. LOL. Maybe the biscuits too with some butter. But other than that, I don't think I'll come back again.  Maybe I will try a salad or something if I ever do come back. But not anytime soon. The restaurant itself is nice. It is very spacious with wood benches and seats. There are a lot of paintings of food and vegetables and chickens and hens on the walls. There are a lot of like statue things of chickens and farm animals. I thought that was nice.
