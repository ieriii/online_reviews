I've tried to get to this place to see what the "hype" was about 3 times now. Each time there is a freakin' line down the block. Are you kidding me? NO hot dog & fry is THAT good to wait in line for 30 minutes! Come on people! Just because everyone brags about it doesn't mean you have to go here too! It's like a restaurant that is on "Check Please". Oh my....once you're on that show.......let the lines and curiosity begin!! But I finally decided to wait it out last week...........I had my ipod on and stood in line like the rest of the fools. Well i was off work so I had the day to myself! The dog, was a hot dog. It was good....nothing special but it was OK. It's a HOT DOG! The fries were good though. Bottom line......I am sorry, its not like i am waiting in line for a fine dining experience for a nice steak or Italian dinner! You're getting a freakin' hot dog and fry! I will not wait 30 minutes again for a dog.........that's just nuts! Sorry guys!
