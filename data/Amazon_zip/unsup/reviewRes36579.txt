This place is super cute and the flatware is adorable, but . . . I don't know. I wasn't as impressed with the food as all those who gave the place five stars. I came with a friend and we both loved their menu and were so excited by all the maki choices, so we ended up ordering four rolls (yes, we were that excited) and some good ol' pad thai. The rolls were good, but not great (not to the extent which they were named). And the pad thai was tasty, but not the best I've ever had. I was so hungry that night so I thought everything would taste amazing to me . . . but since it didn't, my only explanation is that either their food was off or my taste buds were. Still, it's a nice place and I'd most likely come back if I was in the area.
