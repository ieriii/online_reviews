I've wanted to check this place out for a long time and when Restaurant Week came around, this was #1 on my list. And it absolutely didn't disappoint. I even converted two friends into fans and I cannot wait to go back. The main dining area is pretty small and tables are close together but I can imagine in summer when the patio is open how amazing of a place it is to eat. My appetizer of roasted pears, baby arugula, goat cheese and lemon oil was good but not totally memorable. But it was a nice, light salad to get the meal started. My friend also had the twice-cooked vegetable bread soup and liked it but it was definitely different but slightly overcooked. But there were absolutely no complaints about the main dish. I had the wide noodles with spiced wild boar soup. It was incredible. It tasted like pot roast and egg noodles but a billion times better. My friend had the roman style pork and that was also to die for. She was talking about it for DAYS. I would absolutely go back just for those dishes. Unreal. For dessert, I got the panna cotta and it was okay but a little gelatinous. The chocolate hazelnut dessert was really great though so I would definitely get that next time. Overall, it was just a really great meal. We were talking about it for days and I absolutely cannot wait to go back.
