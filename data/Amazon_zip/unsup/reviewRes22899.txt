Food: always serviceable to good (but I think all the restaurants in Greektown share the same kitchen and they use those vacuum tubes like at the drive-in bank to transport the food items to the individual restaurants). I do wonder why they give you rice AND potatoes -- are their customers just not fat enough? Service: efficient but impersonal.  Room: pleasant, bustling. But the best: free valet parking (although you can get this at any restaurant in Greektown).
