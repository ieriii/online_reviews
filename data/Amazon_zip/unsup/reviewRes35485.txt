There are two sides to the restaurant. One side is more formal and the other is on the casual side. I went here on a first date, met in the bar where you first walk in and ate in the formal dining area. I started off with a Pom. cocktail at the bar which was scrumptious - typical pricing for cocktails at a formal bar. Bartenders were very nice - not asshole like at some nicer rest's in the area. After a couple drinks we sat for dinner. Started off with oysters. I had never had one before so my review will not be critical but I enjoyed them for my first time. I also ordered the Lobster Bisque which was AMAZING. Perfectly creamy with lumps of lobster. my mouth waters thinking about it. Also had the nantucket scallops - yumfest! We were probably the youngest people in the formal dining area but it wasn't uncomfortable.  Great service, great food. Wouldn't go there on a date again, but recommend for a business lunch or with older groups such as parents, etc.
