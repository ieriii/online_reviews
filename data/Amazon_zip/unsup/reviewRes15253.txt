I felt like I was in The Godfather or Good Fellas. The decor of this place is very 70's supper club like. There are dark rooms lit with candles and white table cloths. The Private booths were so cozy too. The servers wear tuxedo like uniforms. Enough about the decor-- the food was delicious! It began with a pizza bread and then a loaf of bread to soak up with olive oil and Parmesan cheese. We got the mussels for an appetizer, but before we knew it we had enough food to feed 5 people. All the entrees come with soup and salad and a side of pasta with the entree. I have never tasted anything as delicious as this veal dish. I forget the name of it, but the veal was wrapped in italian sausage and prosciutto that came with a mushroom gravy. OMG. It was amazing. Ask the server about it if you ever go!! It was such a great time, but don't be in a hurry. I think the average dining time there is about 2 1/2 hours. It's a place to enjoy the food, the crowd and of course your company.
