Want to have a delicious locally and sustainably sourced meal before a White Sox game?  Walk on over to Nana! In an otherwise kind of depressing looking neighborhood, this restaurant was a sight to see! The decor is clean and modern with lots of exposed brick and natural light. The beer list looked nearly perfect and our sandwiches (the oyster po' boy and burger) were delicious! I Loved the way the oysters were cooked up - Yyyyuuuummmmm. I wasn't too excited about the side duck fat fries- maybe if the potatoes were julienned instead of just sliced in half and had a bit more salt I would have eaten all of them... but who needs to eat That many potatoes? Maybe I'll get a side salad instead next time.
