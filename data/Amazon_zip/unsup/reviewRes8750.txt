Noon O Kabab is definitely one of the best Persian restaurants I have ever eaten at! My wife and I were looking for a place to have dinner as we drove by. I remembered someone telling me about Noon O Kabab, so we decided to pay visit. If I have one negative, it was the fact that the entrance is a bit confusing especially when there was no one greeting us upon entering the dining room. But after that brieft moment, it all good! We started out with a large order of the hummus. I definitely would not have ordered a large had I known how big the portions are. The hummus was silky smooth and wonderfully flavored. For my entree, I went with the Koubideh and my wife with with the Noon O Joujeh. Both were outstanding. The meat on both dishes was perfectly cooked. The dill rice visually stunning and most certainly the way to go. Our server was very friendly and stopped by regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. Overall, an excellent experience! Notes: They do deliver based on mileage. Also, there is a small parking lot next to the restaurant between the main dining room and their catering/carryout building.
