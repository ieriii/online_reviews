First of all, any place that doesn't take reservations, and considers itself a real restaurant, is a joke. We waited 2 hours for a table, when we were finally seated, they sat us at some sorry, crooked table. The table was so crooked that when my girlfriend put her drink on it, it spilled. When we asked for another table, we were told that we would have to wait another 45 minutes. Upon showing our displeasure, and speaking with the manager, we were still not accomodated. Rick Bayless should be ashamed to be associated with this place. Rude management, and a unfounded long wait time. I will never go to another Rick Bayless restaurant again!
