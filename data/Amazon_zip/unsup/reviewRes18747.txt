Bad Apple, I'm sorry, I wanted to like you, I really did. Your decor was bleak, your seating was uncomfortable, and you don't have turkey burgers - what gives? I tried the earthly and my better half had the slow burn. When we exchanged opinions, it was an easy "ehhh". Your beer menu was OK, there was ample diversity among the listed breweries but only 1 or two beers each. I don't know, maybe I'm a micro-brew snob but it left me wanting more... I'll probably try it again... they have a variety of fries and I'm curious about the "hop & honey" flavor.
