India House will not disappoint but stick to the vegetarian options such as the paneer tikka masala. There is a break between the lunch buffet and dinner so around 5 people start lining up at the door to be let in. Giving them 4 stars due to prices being a bit high but not uncommon for indian retaurants in general also the menu is quite extensive and at times unclear so it would be nice to have pics or further explanations added.
