MMM! If you are looking for great comfort food The Pasta Bowl is the place to go! They have creative as well as classic pasta combinations that are pretty much as good as it gets! Prices are very reasonable, there is always a weekday special on pasta and drinks and service is quick! I have tried their more creative dishes which are excellent and recently checked out the speghetti and meatballs...I have NEVER experienced just joy eating such a simple dish. I'm not sure what they do or how they do it but it really is the best. Set up is a little small and tight at times, but the food is worth it.
