The food would probably get four stars (the majority of the courses were tasty, creative and seasonal with only one huge flop-- oyster fritter with blackberry was tasteless) but the service knocks it down a star. Our meal started out at a brisk pace, when you have eight courses to get through there has to be little lag time between or you are there for three hours... like we were. Three hours. That wasn't nearly as bad as having to deal with one of the wait staff who had horrific body odor issues. I mean, whenever he came to the table to deliver a dish I held my breath. It ruined what was in front of you for a few minutes while you waited for the stench to abate. I've never seen such a nice restaurant employ someone with such bad hygiene. This obviously knocked it down another star.  Its a shame, we've been there before with better, more efficient, not to mention hygienic service. I'm hoping this was a fluke.
