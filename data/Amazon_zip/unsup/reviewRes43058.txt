i always stop in when im around to just grab a slice or two....huge greasy slices of pizza..the toppings and ingredients are real good quality, small place idk what it is with these tiny little restaurants with that cramped environment but they always seem to be the best type of places, first time i went inside they had carnival from a Brazilian station i guess through satellite TV....nice little touch on yo Brazilian pizza experience...i thought so anyway...im a fan...and id be a fan even without pizza they do that chicken RIGHT!
