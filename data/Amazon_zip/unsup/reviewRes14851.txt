Awesome! The place is small & cozy, best italian food, I had the terre de marre linguini in marinara with clams, mussels, shrimp, lobster, scallops & squid. It was perfectly seasoned and the portion was huge! For starters they give bread with tomato sauce & cheese as well as a loaf of Italian bread hot & fresh! No need for appetizers the portions are generous & huge. All meals come with soup & salad! Over will eat there again & again!!
