Everythign from the food to the service and options (vegetarian and non-vegetarian) is amazing. We have been there a few times by ourselves and have taken friends and family when they visited from out of town and they loved it too. Plus they have their own parking which helps. If you have not tried persian food and would like to start someplace this is where you should go.
