Decent place to stay in, but the views were fantastic. It was really nice to stay in and just enjoy the Chicago city view! At night, it was quite enchanting. Rooms were somewhat small which was expected, the restroom was even smaller. Cleaning service was good. Pools were always packed with kids and families (which wasnt a problem for us because we were always out anyways). But the restaurant in the Inn was super great. Food was very delicious, best steak I ever had. We had a great chef, that was why. Nice place. I would not mind booking here again.
