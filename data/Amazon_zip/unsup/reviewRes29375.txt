I'm in love with the Farfalle Pollo. There...I've said it. I'm in love. It's bowtie pasta with chicken, tomatoes (both fresh & sun-dried), mushrooms, basil, and cheese in a white cream sauce. You need to do yourself a favor and try it. It just melts in your mouth. I've tried a couple other pastas, and they were tasty too, but I always go back to my Farfalle Pollo. What else...the Spinach Salad makes an awesome starter (so good). However, was not terribly fond of their Garlic Cheese Bread. I thought it tasted a little funny. Oh well...no biggie. Oh, and this place is great for take-out, delivery, or eat-in.
