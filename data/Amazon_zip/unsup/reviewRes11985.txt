This place always has a line extending out the door for brunch, and for good reason - it's yummy! Unfortunately this means I'm not a regular here because when I want to eat, I want to eat. However, one Saturday morning we found ourselves awake unnaturally early and made it over soon after they opened to snag a table without a wait. The menu is intense - lots of heavy, sweet treats. I'm not really a huge sweet breakfast food person, but my boyfriend was in heaven. The wait-staff was incredibly friendly and the ambience was adorable. Everything was very tasty... only complaint is that the tables are super cramped, so you're definitely on top of the people next to you and it's not really the kind of place to linger over coffee for a leisurely morning. What a great special treat brunch experience though!
