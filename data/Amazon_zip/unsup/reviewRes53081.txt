Feeling frisky, so the hubs and I decided to check this place out. Im not usually one for hype, but this place is well deserving of the praise. The service was thorough, the ambiance was casual, and the food was excellent. It wouldn't be a true Cuban experience without the black and white revolutionary film playing in the background. I can't wait for the weather to act right, so I can hit up their patio!
