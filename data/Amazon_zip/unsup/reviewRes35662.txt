Ducks, chickens, slabs of I don't know what kind of meat, all on hooks right in the front window...Doesn't that call you in to try the food? It didn't for my husband, but it did for me! I dragged my white meat and potatoes husband to come a try Sun Wah. The decor is much nicer than the window would suggest it to be. Pretty modern for the area.  We came in on a Friday night at about 8pm. Prime time, so if you don't want to wait, I'd suggest you to come earlier. We ordered the Peking Duck. Not on the menu, but everyone seemed to be ordering the dish. The Server didn't tell us exactly what it came with, we had to figure this out on our own. The duck came rolled out by a "carver" and he painstakingly took his sweet old time carving the duck into thin slices. We then were presented with the buns, onions, and "pickles" as I called them. Then the Duck fried rice and duck soup arrived.  All in all it was a delicious/greasy meal. I'm glad to not have overordered. The peking duck should not be missed!
