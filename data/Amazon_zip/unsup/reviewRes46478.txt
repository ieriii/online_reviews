Came for the chicken wings only because I was craving some deep fried food. I got a takeaway for the BBQ and the Hot chicken wings. With all honesty, the description says "onion rings" served on the side. These aren't onion rings! They're like deep fried onion threads! The BBQ was OK but not as tender as I'd like - was SLIGHTLY dry for my taste. As for the hot chicken wings? I should've opted for the super hot, because I'm asian and I couldn't taste the spiciness anywhere. They even give you an whole uncut jalapeno on the side - what's up with that?? Even the jalapeno was spicier than the wings. I'm not coming back for the wings -- I'm not impressed.
