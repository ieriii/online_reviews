I will be the first to admit that I had fairly high expectations for Frontera Grill. And it was just an all-around disappointment. The service was ridiculously slow, which I can deal with on a busy night if the food is good, but the food wasn't. Every single dish except for one came out lukewarm at best and the flavors were ok, but not stellar. The only two dishes that came out both warm and flavorful were the brothy corn esquites and the poc chuc (grilled pork). The poc chuc was my favorite dish of the evening - the spicy black bean soup was really good and the pork itself was very tasty. The smoked chicken queso fundido was near inedible (or it would have been if we hadn't been STARVING after waiting so long) as it was room temperature and congealed. Plus the cheddar was just too sharp for fundido and overwhelmed the flavor of the chicken and the salsa. The fresh corn tamales would have been tasty if served hot or even warm, but they were delivered to us room temperature. The duck enchiladas were warm and ok, but they were really sweet. I really like pineapple, but it was literally all you could taste. The traditional guacamole was fine, as were the chips served along side the guacamole, but overall the restaurant wasreally "meh." I hope it was just an off night with both the kitchen and the wait staff or maybe we just ordered all of the wrong dishes (with the exception of the pork).
