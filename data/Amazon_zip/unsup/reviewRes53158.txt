ambiance-7 price-7 food-5 well it was fun and the music was great and the wait staff was nice and i liked the feel of the place. However the food was not so good! I had the avacado salad which i did like and was easy to make and would get again. however i also had the ropa vieja and it was not good. It was all sauce and too much bread and too little meat. Too many other better restaurants therefore i will not go back
