This place has a very nice atmosphere and they serve high quality food. I went there with my boyfriend and aunt the other night for dinner and we were satisfied in general. I had a bowl of butternut squash soup that was divine, but there was not very much of it! I also had the insalata stella that looked much more bountiful than it actually was--just some greens, some thin slices of apple, pine nuts, and Belgian endive. My aunt had the linguine with clams which she said was good and very garlicky, but she couldn't finish it. My boyfriend had the gnocchi, which looked beautiful and delicious, but he was left feeling weirdly and uncomfortably full, giving him stomach issues until the next morning! He suspected there was something weird in the way they prepared it, or something. Overall, Sapori is good, but not out of this world. The service was very good though and we enjoyed our meal there!
