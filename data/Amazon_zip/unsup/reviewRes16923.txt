The ropa viejo appetizer is amazing and I can't wait to go back for more. That is the most important thing I can say about Carnivale, but I will say a little more... A friend and I came here for dinner and decided to sit in the bar area rather than wait for a table to open up. We thought the atmosphere was really fun and lively, without being horribly loud. I had a mojito, which was good but a little light on the liquor. The service was very good.
