Innovative and creative dogs. I got the rosemary and garlic one and added grilled onions to it. Maybe it's just me, but I felt like the flavors weren't executed well and tasted a little too sour/tangy for my liking. Maybe I should've ordered the classic instead. =/ On the plus side, I did enjoy the snap of the casing when biting into it though. Tip: Cash only.
