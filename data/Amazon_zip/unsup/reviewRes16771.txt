I've just been going to India House a lot more because it always ends up being the more universally acceptable friends' choice! My best friend absolutely loves their baingan bhartha (eggplant) dish and the paneer bhurji (minced cottage cheese), which I always find too spicy to handle even when requesting mild! Their bhel puri is not bad, although does have a little too much chutney maybe. I have also done their weekend buffet a couple of times and still not a fan, because their food is overall too rich for my liking (I did enjoy their matar paneer quite a bit though).
