went to this place on a wednesday night so we didn't plan to order a lot... we ended up ordering entree for each of us and shared the dessert. entree: Cappellacci all'Aragosta - i orderd this and didn't know what to expect but hoping it will be good. sure enough it is very delicious. Spaghetti allo Scoglio - my friend ordered this. i tried some of it and honestly i had never had any pasta in marinara sauce as delicious as this! dessert: we had the tiramisu. honestly, it's a bit of a let down after the super delicioius entrees. verdict: i'll definitely come back to this place again. it is one of the best italian restaurant i've been to in chicago.
