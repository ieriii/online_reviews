The main reason I go to Wishbone is that it is open on holidays, when nothing else is open. Not saying that I have Christmas dinner here, but hungover breakfast on New Years, hungover lunch on July 4th, etc. are often spent at Wishbone. There is nothing particularly wrong with Wishbone. Except perhaps that they only have Cobb Salad on Mondays. Very disappointing, as I am a Cobb Salad connoisseur. Oh well. I'm not deducting stars for that reason. The reason I deduct stars is that there's nothing particularly great about this place. The food is of average deliciouses, at an average price, served by average quality waitstaff. Thus, average rating.  On a completely unrelated and pointless note, they decorate the walls with cocks.
