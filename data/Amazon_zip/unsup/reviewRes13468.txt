Fresh fish and a cereal smorgasbord are an odd couple, but those seem to be the staples at Glenn's. Please don't bother ordering their calamari app. It's bland and their cocktail sauce tasted like watered down ketchup. Their cioppino was tasty, but served without a spoon and it took way too long to get our server's attention to ask for one. The shrimp was tough and overcooked, but the broth was stellar. They served it with garlic bread that was just too too. How am I supposed to enjoy your food, Glenn, if you've deadened my taste buds with garlic bread? All and all, it was over-priced. I will try again during the lunch hour or M-F when they seemed to have some more reasonably priced specials. BEST part of dinner was the Hoosier Mama strawberry pie that we ordered for dessert. AMAZING! But unfortunately I don't think they can take much credit for that.
