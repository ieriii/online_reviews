The non alcoholic drinks could be stronger but than again I ordered a drink at noon. Maybe they didnt realize I was already drunk? I guess thats not there fault. Try the green mole. Its the best dish on the menu IMO. As far as resturaunt mole goes this is the best I have had. Unfortunatly I have had better. Hellloooo married to a Mexican, Duh. Service was on point.
