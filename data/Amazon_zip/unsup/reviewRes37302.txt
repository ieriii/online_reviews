Rolled into Fox and Obel Saturday during the rain and ugly weather looking for a wonderful triple chocolate cake I've heard great things about for my b-day cake. So here's the low low... 1) Yes they are a bit pricey but you can find all sorts of Italian goodies not offered at your local markets. Then again, I usually find all of those things at Euro Fresh or Angelo Caputo's for a fraction of the price. 2) They have the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever!!!!!! We snacked on snickerdoodles samples while deciding what to buy at the bakery counter. So goooood! I couldn't decide on just one so we bought a little of everything that looked good. Carrot and double chocolate cupcakes, key lime tart, dulce de leche cheescake, snickerdoodle and chocolate chip cookies. Didnt care for the lime tart( wheat crust guys? Come on!!) or the dry, flavorless cupcakes. That dulce de leche cheesecake...that thing right there? Right there? Too good! My man inhaled his promptly after claiming no cobbs!!(meaning no samples/not sharing for you guys who don't know) 3) Samples of salami, italian deli meats, chicken salad were tasty. We grabbed a couple of honey aged salami sticks for my carniverous nephew, cheese, sopressata, proscuitto, 2 bottles of wine and we bounced. So I never got my special B-day cake but discovered another place to buy specialty items and fantastic oatmeal cookies too!
