Was craving some late night food and drinks and was tired of the typical Chicago bar/sports bar in Lincoln Park/Lakeview where I live. This place has been on my list of places to try for a while. Definitely was worth the drive to Logan Square. Went after midnight on a weeknight so no issues with wait. I work in a restaurant and am somewhat of a foodie, but I have nothing but good things to say about this place and my experience. The entrees are a little pricey for pub fare and I was looking to be budget friendly so I went with the burger. Definitely one of the better burgers I have had in Chicago in a while. Was served with a good sharp cheddar, Nueske's bacon, and beef fat fries. Burger was cooked med rare as asked, was juicy, well seasoned, tasted great. My buddy had the Sloppy Joe. Sloppy Joe was awesome; the crispy sage they use added great flavor. Kick ass drink menu, $ 3 dollar whiskey shots, and cans of PBR which was cool because I was looking to be cheap but they have a great selection of micro and craft beers if you are looking to step it up. I did break down and try their house Old Fashioned. Specialty cocktails were $8 which I think is very reasonable. Was definitely a really tasty Old Fashioned. If you like whiskey, you will be in heaven here as this place has a ridiculous selection. Cool vibe, unpretentious, chill place at least late night during the week. Sure this place is rocking during prime time. Service was friendly, informative, food and drinks arrived quickly. Again, have nothing but good things to say, Would definitely recommend this place and would like to return and try other menu items both food and beverages. Brunch looked really good as well.
