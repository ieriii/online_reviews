I can't believe I forgot to rate this place. The food is pretty tastey... for your choice of sausage. Kangaroo sausage is damn good.... it reminds me of my time in Australia. 'roos are like deer here, so no biggie to eat one there. I love the crazy combinations, if I worked close to there, I would go once a week for the game of the week. It would be great. But since I don't, I just read it every Tuesday morning on their web-site. Its pretty pathetic, but whatever. There are a few things that I can gripe about though: 1. The hours suck. I wish they were open later. 2. Sometimes $8 for a sausage is too much, but soo good. Yes I know they got the usual hot dog for $2 or so. But there are better places for a plain dog IMO. 3. The line is long, but that means its popular, right? I had to change it to 5 stars... after I wrote the review thats all I can think about.... that means its 5 star good
