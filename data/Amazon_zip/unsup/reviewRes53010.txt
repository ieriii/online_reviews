If it wasn't for the delicious flavors, I wouldn't give this place a second chance. The service was some of the worst I've ever had. Let me explain: First, our appetizers came out after our dinner. The only other time this happened to me was at an Applebees in college - and I would expect that from them. Second, every time the waitress came by our table she greeted us with "I'm so sorry...". I really don't care how busy a place is. When you approach us with sorry this and sorry that, I feel like my night is being ruined even if I don't care that you haven't been seen in twenty minutes. Third, my "medium rare" steak was well done. Fortunately, it wasn't tough or dry so I have no further reason to complain. Fourth, the waitress took our credit card only to come back ten minutes later asking us if this was our card before disappearing again. In a nutshell, the service here blows. The empanadas (goat cheese and chorizo rock) and my skirt steak were delicious. It's fairly priced and the outdoor dining is amazing. On a night like tonight, I could have sat outside enjoying my company for a few more hours. This alone would get me back. With improved service 90 miles would feel a little bit more like 10
