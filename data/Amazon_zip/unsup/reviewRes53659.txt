Okay, this place has so many five star reviews it doesn't really need mine, but I can't resist.  I have been to Schwa three times now, and although there has been a little repetition in the menu, I have never minded because their dishes are nearly all out-of-this-world.  I highly recommend the nine course option -- yes, it's $110 per person for the food -- but you can bring your own wine, and there's no better spot in the city to splurge on a special occasion with your significant other or a small group of good friends.  Unlike other high-end Chicago spots where the outsized staff hovers over you to the point of annoyance, Schwa is relaxed and fun, and you are actually served by the chefs themselves. And yes, the food is better (in my opinion) than Alinea, Tru and the rest.  Enjoy this little Chicago gem!!
