I've been a Diner customer for ten years and am proud to rate them 5 stars. After 800+ reviews, maybe they don't need another. However, after eating at several vegetarian diners from coast-to-coast, The Chicago Diner is still #1 and deserves to be hailed as such. One reason they are so great is variety. Their menu features vegetarian, vegan, local, and raw items. With specials and an ever-changing menu, you can always try something new here. The changing menu doesn't always work for the best, as I've seen great foods come and go (you had BEST veggie hot dog ever), but largely their sink or swim tactic has left The Diner with an all star cast, particularly the Reuben, gyros, and Dagwood sandwich. If you are a vegetarian or veggie-friendly and in the Chicago-land area, The Chicago Diner is a must eat. Warning: afterward, you'll never look at your local vegetarian restaurants the same again.
