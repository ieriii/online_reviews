A simply amazing meal. As another reviewer noted, the menu is simplified, and while Pookie and I were there it was 12 courses or 23. The wine pairings were quite exotic and international, and varied from very good to spectacular for my taste. The food was consistently spectacular. This is an experience, not just a meal. We started the 23 course tour at 9:30pm and finished at about 2:00am. The bill was about $700. We sat in the downstairs dining area where there were 5 tables. Not sure how big upstairs is. Extremely attentive service, relaxed and elegant atmosphere and above all the food and wine is unreal. Highly recommended if you can swing the $.
