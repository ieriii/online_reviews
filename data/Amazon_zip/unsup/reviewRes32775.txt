We were in Chicago for a wedding and we are from San Ramon Ca. My brother in law took us to this rest. As we enter the place, I knew right away that we are in for a treat. The manager Aeron came to our table to introduced himself which I thought was very nice of him to do that. We had an absolute great time in this restaurant. The Pancit Canton and Kobe Beef on crispy rice is tom die for. I will give this place 7 stars. Can't wait to go back next year.
