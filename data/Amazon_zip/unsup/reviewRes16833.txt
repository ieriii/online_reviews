I've only been there once for their lunch buffet, but it was easily the best indian buffet I've come across. The food is fresh and well seasoned, and they bring tandoori chicken to your table as well. The sauces in the dishes are thick and flavorful, and if it weren't for the nan, I would be licking the plate. There was something like murg makhani (butter chicken) on the buffet, but I can't remember the name...that was mouthwatering. Service was also excellent, literally taking my plate as I would scoop the last bite.  5 stars for the buffet alone, I have not eaten there for dinner though.
