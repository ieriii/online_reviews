Hello Pequod's. You are my new close friend.  After a long, cold walk through the city we finally made it to Pequod's for a taste of their famous deep dish pizza. At 7:00 on a Saturday, we were seated immediately upon arrival, which is surprising since this place was so busy.  We started with a garlic bread appetizer and had a small taste of what was to come with their tasty sauce. The pizza came out soon afterward and was quite delicious. The crust was seriously perfect. So crisp. So tasty. And the price really wasn't bad at all. Overall a near perfect evening.
