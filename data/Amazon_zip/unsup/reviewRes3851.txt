I like you! This is not a real restauraunt, or so my friend and i were told when we wandered in and began to study the menu for some time. The man who turned out to be on of the co-owners quickly clarified and said, i mean this is like fast food korean with american twist (ok don't sue, don't quite remember what the exact words were but you get the idea). With this warning in mind i ordered the baby buddha bowl and he gave me a free side of kimchi. It was good, filling and cheap. I prefer the real Bimbimbop (however thats spelled). But as this was fast food it was pretty tasty. 3 stars for the buddha Bowl but the kimchi was AWESOMENESS. (Yes in all Caps) so Crisp gets bumped up to 4 stars.
