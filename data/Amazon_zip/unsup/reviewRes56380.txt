Recently, we had catering from Simply It for a company party. Half of our attendees were vegetarian, the other half being ravenous meat-eaters. I called about a week in advance to work out everything with the owner to make sure that it worked out smoothly for both groups. Thankfully, it worked out splendidly!For a group of 30, we got 5 different appetizers: avocado wontons, chicken puff pastry, shrimp spring rolls, seafood egg rolls, and the chicken avocado. Within the first hour of mingling and eating, all of the appetizers were gone. With the help of a couple employees from Simply It, we were able to change out the appetizers quickly with the entrees. They were extremely helpful and made sure that I was left with as little to do as possible regarding all of the food.Our entrees included the Asian Vegetables on Crispy Noodles, Lemongrass Chicken, Grilled Salmon Noodles, Lemongrass Chicken, Beef Ribs, Vegetable Fried Rice, and Seafood Noodles. Although we ordered an incredible amount, I had everyone take home a bit, while saving some for myself as well. The food tastes delicious as leftovers as well; that must say something!But I'd like to thank Simply It for making the evening go swimmingly well. I'll be sure to call again when I need to plan another party!
