Our server did not introduce herself, and asked us if we've ever been here before. When we said "no" , she replied by saying-oh, so you didn't bring any alcohol. No mentioning of specials or any info about the food. She was quite pushy about drinks-I ordered hot tea. It came in a paper cup, no sugar on the table. I ordered a shrimp appetizer and a fish soup, she took my order but ignored my husband and left. The soup was ok, but when I took a bite of my "shrimp" I was sure I was eating pork ( I do not eat meat). The server argued that it's shrimp, she took it back and then came back and told us that the manager "took it apart" and it was indeed shrimp, it's just been boiled a lot?! she just left it on the table and left. My husband ordered a cuban sandwich to go-it was his impression that he had a choice of 3 sides-but the server did not offer any choices-and when asked told us she was nit sure it came with anything at all. Overall it was quite a disaster:(
