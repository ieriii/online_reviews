My girlfriend and I had the craziest Indian food craving for a couple of weeks, and thanks to yelp and all you yelpers, found India House. First impression: Very nice set-up! Decor was good, layout wasn't too cramped and noise was very tolerable. 1/1 star Food: Great variety! I'm not going to lie though, I judge a lot of indian restaurants based only on two items - The Naan and the Saag - everything else is just a bonus. The verdict at India house? Awesome! The Naan had just enough flavor and wasn't over powered by oil. The taste was light and subtle...the way I like it. The Saag was as close to perfect as I could imagine. 2/2 stars Drink: I had the India House Signature and what a good call that was. With most alcoholic drinks, most places seem to over power it with alcohol so that is all you really taste. Not this drink! While you can smell and taste the vodka, it goes down very smooth thanks to the aid of mango and orange juice. Very nice concoction! One of the better drinks I've had in a while. 1/1 star Service: For the most part, it was decent. It's a lunch buffet, what do you really expect? The waiters were attentive and changed plates when needed too. They filled water when I needed it (and I must say, they have got some serious water-filling skills! No drops on the table!) However, the lady who sat us and picked up our check kinda ruined it for me. She seemed very unhappy and like she didn't want to be there. *Don't bring me down with you! * She also had a bruise above her eye...maybe that was why she was unhappy? Who knows?! As a result - 0/1 stars India House has some solid indian food, IMHO, and I will be going back. Their buffet is a little pricey, at $15/person, but good food is worth something to everybody!
