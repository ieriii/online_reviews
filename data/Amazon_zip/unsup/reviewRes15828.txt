What a fun, trendy spot with delicious, unique food! I was visiting a friend in Chicago and we chose Carnivale for Saturday night because I read about it on Epicurious and here on Yelp. Great choice. True to the other reviews, we did have to wait 15 minutes for our table. We thought arriving early would help but it didn't because we waited 15 minutes after our reservation time. We were lucky enough to snag seats at the bar so we were fine waiting. We each ordered a drink- my friend loved her margarita and my drink was just ok. For dinner, we decided to go with all small plates. We started with the ceviche trio of shrimp, salmon and hirimasa. All three were good, but the shrimp was our favorite. The sauce was so flavorful and delicious. Next up was the pork appetizer which was beyond yummy. We about licked the plate. A cheese tortilla item was next. It was supposed to have squash blossoms on it (our reason for ordering it), but it had edible orchid instead. Kinda weird and disappointing. However it was so good that we didn't care. Lastly we ordered the ropa. Again super tasty...a little sweetness added to the meaty flavor. Everything was so good! And the atmosphere is fun, colorful and trendy. It is a very big space which is not for everyone, but if you are ok with it, I'd highly recommend this spot.
