This place is good at what it does~! The salad bar is not as good as Brazzaz, for sure, but the quality of the meat and the selection of sides at your table is really great. We went for an early Sunday dinner, and if you'd like to avoid incidents like the 3 unruly children who wouldn't stop screaming...then, I suggest a later dinner. The staff is very attentive and pleasant. Dinner for two with 1 drink each is about $130 pre-tip.
