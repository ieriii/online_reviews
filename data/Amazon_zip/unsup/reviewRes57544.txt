This was a huge disappointment. I did not have any expectations because this a gathering to celebrate a special occasion and I was just along for the ride, but we had a party of 9 with a reservation. The place is extremely dark (what are they hiding?) and tight. They pack you in there and I seriously can't imagine they have not had any lawsuits with all the flames and oil flying around. The prices were outrageous. I find it amazing they charge $40 + for them to put the raw food in front of you so you can cook it yourself. They seem to pride themselves on the premium seafood and meat. It's too bad that it gets ruined by having to cook it in oil. And it's so damn dark that you can not see if your food is actually cooked or not! Nice effect. Beside the horrible seating (chairs look to have been taken from a bad banquet hall) and dingy setting, why overpriced food, we found the staff to be arrogant and nasty. We waited over 30 min. for half our party to be seated and they seemed to be fine with pushing us into the way too crowded bar where waitstaff seemed miffed to have to go around us. The bar - wine staff we dealt with was a real jerk to top it off. My brother dropped over $600 at this place and in the end we could have gone to so many other amazing places in Chicago at that price without having to cook our own food and come out smelling like we went to Bennihana! Couples -- this is not romantic. Save your money for Le Colonial, IL Mulino, Cafe Spaggio.
