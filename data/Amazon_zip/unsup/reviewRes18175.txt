If only the host was nicer, this place (probably) would have gotten 4 stars. I went to caro mio with a group of friend's for my buddy's birthday. They told us beforehand that all 7 of us had to be there at 6:15 or our table would be given away. Well... if you've heard of a thing called "asian time" you can see how this might be a problem. Surprisingly, everyone got there by 6:20 (possibly due to threatening emails sent out in days past). Nonetheless, the host gave us a hard time and didn't enjoy our sense(s) of humor. He made us feel horrible for changing it to 5 people and then back to 6. Someone made a joke like, "We're full of surprises" and he stuck his nose up in a french way and said something snotty, although I forgot what. Anyhow, as the night progressed my star count got higher. The waitress was nice, the ambiance was fun, and the food was pretty good. I don't think there was one thing I tried that I absolutely DIDN'T like, but I definitely think their strong suit is noodles, not meats and fishies.
