Overall: Decent pizza, good beer selection, sports bar atmosphere Pluses:  * Takes pride in their "New Haven"-style non-cheese pizza and a lot of toppings were on offer; I thought it was pretty good but it's not hard to impress me when it comes to pizza  * House beers were delicious and they have a bunch of other choices as well  * Friendly service: they were nice enough to offer to store my roller bag behind the host area (I was coming from the airport) Minuses:  * Hard alcohol selection is pretty weak: a lot of subpar choices like White Label for whiskey, although I remember one good scotch.  * This is my personal feeling, but TVs detract from atmosphere and make it hard to actually interact with the people you are with. There are a lot of 'em. (My three stars rather than two are because the pizza offsets the TVs)
