Great Persian Food! The nice thing about this place is that besides being a great choice for people who are very familiar with Persian food it is also a great choice for people who haven't had Persian food before (or perhaps have only had Rezas). The waitstaff is very friendly and happy to help if people aren't familiar with the menu. Overall: Best Persian food in Chicago Food you MUST try: -Gormeh Sabzi (an amazing herb stew) - best in Chicago -Mast Moosir (yogurt w/ shallots) - again best in Chicago -Especially good and flavorful kebab Environment: -great for groups (large round tables) -great for couples -great for a quite conversation or a loud conversation -friendly service Price: Cheaper than other Persian options in Chicago but w/ better food! Drinks: BYOB
