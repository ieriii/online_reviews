Yes its a chain- a branch of the Cheesecake Factory, but the food is a step up from there. I fell in love with the he caramel chicken.  I'm not big on sweets, but the after dinner coffees they offer are addictive.  For a simple night out downtown with my girlfriends this is the place I love. The staff are incredibly nice and let you eat in peace. I hate places where I'm "being checked in on" as soon as I put a bite of food in my mouth. The wait staff is very well trained and seems to have extensive knowledge of every dish on the menu, granted all I order is the Chicken, I dare myself every time I go in, but see that on the menu and begin salivating. Highly recommend it as a special occasion place, not a typical meal- It can be a it pricey for a Wednesday night dinner.
