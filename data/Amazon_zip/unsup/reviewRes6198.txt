I like the concept of the restaurant, but the food just didn't do it for me. I am not a big fan of Italian food to begin with, but sometimes an amazing restaurant can convert me. Not this one. The polenta just didn't cut it for me.. the tomatoes and mozzarella were extremely soupy. My grilled steak was over done..blah The only reason I give it 3 stars -- the pasta with crab and sea urchin was very good along with the wine (which is retail price btw) other than that, not much to write home about..
