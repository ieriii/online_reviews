My husband and I ate there Saturday 07/22/12 at about 6 p.m. Service was not good. The place was less than 1/4 full but the waitress kept pressuring us to order food after we ordered drinks even after we told her we wanted to enjoy our drinks first and would let her know when we were ready to order, and I had to ask her for a water refill that she never brought, although she did wander past our table filling other people's water glasses after that. My margarita tasted great, although rather skimpy for the price. The food was average to below average; ground beef tacos, chile relenos and spinach enchiladas practically tasteless. The chicken tostada was delicious; crisp, well seasoned grilled chicken. At 7 p.m. when we were leaving the place filled up and was terribly loud (nothing to absorb sound) from voices and over-charged, bland, loud Mexican music, you could not carry on a conversation in a normal voice. Price was not expensive. Since we don't live very near this area, we are not going to go out of our way to come here again.
