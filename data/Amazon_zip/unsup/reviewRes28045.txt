I went here with a group after hearing good things about this place. The decor at the time was very contemporary and nice (I hear he changes it with his menu to alter the experience). The waitstaff educated us on the menu and the Parmesan popcorn on the table is a great snack while you wait. Beer selection was OK, wine selection better. I got a causal fine-dining vibe, which made me feel like dress code was open, but the prices were going to be fine-dining prices. The dishes we had were great, you just wish the portion size was more. The fish was cooked about as perfect as you could ask for...but again...very small fillet. I left the place thinking, all that money and I'm still really hungry, McDonalds anyone? Great food and terrific for the tastebuds, but more like a snack for me.
