Oh Bongo Room and Derek, how I miss you! Are you sure you don't want to open a location in Minneapolis? Please! One will be hard pressed to find a better hollandaise sauce, and believe me I have tried to no avail. It is rich, but not too rich, light and lemony. It is perfection! Paired with perfectly poached eggs, their eggs benedict is a must! If you're like me and like a little sweet with your savory try one of their pancakes or french toast. They're like dessert for breakfast, no syrup necessary. In fact, to add syrup would ruin it. Not in the mood for either? Then try one of two breakfast burritos. Large and stuffed with either sweet potatoes and black beans or traditional eggs and guacamole these two options will definitely leave you full and happy. With regards to the complaints about wait time: Good things come to those who wait! So wait it out and you won't be disappointed! Quick Tip: Both the pancakes and french toast can be ordered in single servings eliminating the need to pick just one!! To summarize: Although I miss living in Chicago, I really, really miss weekend brunches at the Bongo Room and have yet to find any place comparable in Minneapolis or otherwise.
