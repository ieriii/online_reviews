I went here with my wife who wanted some authentic Chicago deep dish while we were in town. We ordered a Veggie/Spinach split deep dish pizza. One thing to keep in mind here is that with the amount of cheese and sauce on the pizza, you should probably order less then you would normally. The pizza was more cheesy than Gino's but had less sauce. I enjoyed this place a little more than Gino's in terms of Pizza. The ambiance was more family Italian than hole-in-the-wall pizza place. I think I preferred Gino's graffiti style decor. Overall, I really enjoyed and would recommend to those just passing through Chicago. If you want something less "chain-y", I think you should ask a native Chicagoian and find out the local spots.
