I am relieved to know I am not the only person who didn't like this place at all! I am pregnant and very into pizza lately! So, we decided to venture up to Spacca Napoli where I was sure we'd get delicious pizza! We went last Saturday night (5/19) and only waited 10 minutes. The outside area was nice and it was a beautiful night but they said they weren't serving out there. You could order food to go and then seat yourself. Anyway, we had a nice table by the window and my husband ordered the "funghi" pizza and I got the basic margarhita. The place is VERY noisy so we had to actually yell to hear each other. My husband figured that was done intentionally so that patrons don't sit and linger for too long. Our pizzas came out and were terrible, disgusting, probably the worst I've ever had. Dominos would have been better that point! Mine, in particular, was wet/soggy and had little to no taste. The buffalo mozzerella was good, I will say that. The sauce which seemed to be evaporating off the pizza was nothing special either. We will obviously not be back- I am still on a quest to find some good thin crust. I think we'll try Pizza D.O.C.
