I don't really get the seeming trend of Thai and Japanese/Sushi at several places in this general area (north side). I do, however, have a strong opinion on how to make it work - great food! I've tried Indie twice and am already a fan. We gone early (with Grandma) and have had terrific meals. The curries are exceedingly tasty, the crag rangoon are much-talked-about for good reason and Grandma has enjoyed her Ginger Fish immensely. They also have a great touch with duck - have tried two dishes and they were both cooked perfectly. Finish the meal with their Mango with Sticky Rice. The mango is generous, and ours have been ripe and wonderful. Will be back when I am next in Chicago.
