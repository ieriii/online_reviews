Love this hotel. Front desk, parking guys and the blonde guy who gave us a ride in the hotels bike cab....all great. I met the manager in the lobby and he watched my dog while I got a coffee from the best coffee place in Chicago. Courtesy from the top down!! This place is not to be missed when you visit Chicago
