Ehh . . . it was okay. It was completely packed when I arrived. The food did come out quickly and the potato pancake was very good, but I can't say I'd rave about the food.  I had an omelette, so maybe breakfast isn't really their thing since I saw a lot of lunch and dinner selections. Maybe I'd give it another try, but wouldn't go out of my way to go there when there are so many other place on the North Side to try.
