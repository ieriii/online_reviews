I am So Glad that Nuevo Leon was recommended to me by numerous people, including my Mexican friends from Columbus and people all the way across the country. Having lived in Chicago for a good amt. of time, I felt like an idiot having not been here. We stopped in today and were super impressed by everything about this amazing restaurant. I've uploaded pics, this place was so good. For less than twenty dollars, yes, less than twenty dollars, my cousin and I got two amazing meals plus chips and guacamole AND chicken soup. My cousin ordered the combination plate, and I ordered the flautas, and we were both beside ourselves with how good this food was. The refried beans were the best I've ever had out. The service was also fast and there were lots of Mexican families at this restaurant, which is a good sign. The place was hoppin,' but there was no wait, and service was amazing. This was such a good experience; I can't believe I didn't come to Nuevo Leon until now.
