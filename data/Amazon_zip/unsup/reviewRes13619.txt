I had been meaning to stop by this place for months, heard nothing but good things, and I'm very happy to say that they did not disappoint. The good peeps at Revolution Brew have an excellent selection of bottled beers and a decent assortment of stuff on tap. I wasn't a fan of the Rosa, but I loved the Eugene and Iron Fist. Also, the bartender, Brit (I think), was a cutie who knew her stuff. Twas fun chatting with her about craft beers. I went on a weekday afternoon, so the crowd was small. If you're not into huge crowds I wouldnt recommend it on the weekend. The place is usually packed. Now I understand why. Great spot. I'll be back to try the food for sure. Cheers!
