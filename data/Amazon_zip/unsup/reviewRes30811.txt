After all the hype I've heard about this place, I was not impressed. The decor is nice and the service was good, but we have some complaints about the food. Our "Bang Bang salad" didn't have any dressing on it. Seriously, how can you forget to put dressing on the salad? There wasn't even a drizzle and without the dressing, it was favorless. The other big thing was the "jasmine rice"; it was undercooked. We're asian. We eat rice pretty much everyday; we know when rice is not cooked well. This rice was wet so it was sticky and it was crunchy. The main complaint that my husband had, though, was the pork belly. We were expecting a good amount of fat on the piece. Sunda's pork belly is so trimmed that there was only a hint of fat. If you like that sort of thing, that's great, but we were very disappointed. On the plus side, the "Adobo braised pork belly "was cooked very nicely; crunchy on the outside and tender inside. It tasted more like char siu sauce than adobo, though, but I didn't mind it. The "Shaking beef" was awesome. Cooked to the medium rare specification perfectly. The sushi was decent; we had the "summer of sunda roll", which tasted fine, but it was not rolled very tightly and the filling kept spilling out, no matter how I held it with the chopsticks. I actually dropped a whole piece in the soy sauce because it fell apart. The "spicy tail of two tunas" was awesome though. No complaints on that at all.
