This place is ridiculously crowded, and there isn't much room for people standing and waiting for a table. My friend and I were crammed against another table while they were eating and it was an uncomfortable situation for all of us. That said, we had the best pizza ever while here. It sounded like it was going to be a disaster when we ordered it, but we really chowed down once we got it: white pizza, broccoli, goat cheese, and mashed potatoes. Phenomenal. We saved some room for the chocolate dessert pizza, and that was certainly worth it. the dessert pizza is way too big for two people and is expensive for a small group, but if you want to splurge or just really need your chocolate fix, order it. We offered some to a couple guys as they were leaving and I think they almost stole it from us. We won't do that next time.
