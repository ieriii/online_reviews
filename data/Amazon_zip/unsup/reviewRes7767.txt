Nice place - cozy and good food, but a bit pricey - unless you get the coupon in one of those neighborhood mailers. For $50 (or $55 now I think) you get an appetizer, a salad and a pasta entree plus a bottle of house wine and a dessert - great deal! You can choose any pasta for this deal, even the lobster one (I've had it three times now - it rocks!!!) which makes this offer all that much better. I now regularly scout out the mailers just for a coupon to this place.
