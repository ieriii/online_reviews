For the price at Art of Pizza, you probably can't find a better deal. The deep dish here is incredible--I was especially a fan of how super-cheesy this deep dish is. The last time I ordered it was a particularly busy night for pizza (vice prez debate night), but the pizza arrived with zippy speed and was piping hot. Definitely not a place to go for ambiance--stick to the take-out and enjoy. I've only had the deep dish here, and it was tantalizing.
