I have always enjoyed the food here.  However, a couple of weeks ago I took some friends that were visiting from out of town to this location and had an awful experience. The waitress came to our table a total of 2 times throughout the meal, once to give us our bill (on which we were charged 75 cents for the lemons we had requested for our water). After going through some difficulty in locating someone to make payment to due to our waitresses' neglect, I was talked back to by our waitress who continuously rolled her eyes at me as well. In addition, she charged our credit cards the wrong amounts and the manager told me he "had 6 things going on and no time to hear what I had to say". I have never been treated so poorly at ANY dining establishment. I have emailed the establishment with no response or explanation for their poor service. I would recommend that if you are craving Chicago style pizza, you go down the street to Uno's or Due's which both have exponentially better service.
