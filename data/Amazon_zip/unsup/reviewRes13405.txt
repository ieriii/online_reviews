I've been here a bunch of times, and I still think its one of better brewery restaurants in Chicago...  I'm a big fan of Three Floyds, but this place brews beer slightly better then them... " Anti-hero" is solid, and you can't go wrong with the award winning "Golden Cross"....  They serve upscale burgers and sandwiches, and the food is pretty good, just not unique.... But lets face it, you're here for beer.
