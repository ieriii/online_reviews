Haven't been disappointed here yet. Dined here for my husband's birthday on a hideous rainy evening. Had trouble finding parking nearby, but once we got to the restaurant all of that faded away. Delicious appetizers (I had polenta with kale) and wonderful entrees. My husband had duck breast for his entree and said it was excellent. I had skatewing and it too was delicious. Save room for dessert especially the chocolate hazlenut tart. We had wine by the glass which worked out just fine. My only complaint with this place is that the tables are SO CLOSE together that you fear that you will knock things off your own or the table next to you being seated. Cost per person, including dessert and wine by the glass was about $75 per person.
