This was my first time at 90 Miles and I loved the ambiance. It was very relaxed and friendly. We had a group of 12 people for a birthday dinner and the service was excellent with such a large group. We had a lot of appetizers....Maduros (sweet plantains), Mariquitas (plantain chips), Papa Rellena (stuffed potato), Empanadas w/ beef, w/ chorizo, w/ goat cheese....so delicious! And for the main course, I had the Lechon sandwich...and the pork was so juicy and was perfectly complimented with fried plantains. They also had fries on the side and it was in this awesome garlic sauce and I love garlic, so enough said. Everything had such great flavor! I will definitely go here again, but probably in a smaller group. hehe
