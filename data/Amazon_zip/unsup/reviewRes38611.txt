Been going for a dozen years or so. Still the best beer bar in Chicago (fuck you, Beer Advocate, no way the Map Room is higher), but fading slowly. Certainly has changed, obviously with the restaurant addition, but more so due to the neighborhood (see "Sir Spa", across the street).  The original charm of the bar was in its conversational nature (that one tiny tv in the corner is still funny). Yes it's true, the majority of the servers are, have been, and will always be rude. Just a situation where inevitable popularity and growth causes fundamental change over time.
