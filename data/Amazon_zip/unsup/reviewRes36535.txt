I used to love this place! I had a bad experience that has started to change my mind. I ordered an omelet and when it came, one ingredient was missing. I had eaten about a quarter of it before noticing, and when I did notice, I asked the server. She got a menu to check and came back to say "yes the ingredient is missing." Then stared at me blankly...I just said "ok, fine I guess..."a little flabbergasted that she didn't just take it back or offer to comp. We all know breakfast food isn't that expensive to make, so making another omelet would not have been a huge issue. I have a hard time sending things back in general because I'm scared of what might happen in the kitchen. I also received ONE piece of toast. Last time I checked around town, the standard is two pieces. I left still hungry and completely dissatisfied. Maybe I'll go to the Wells location instead. I haven't encountered this service there. I wish our server had known what to do, but oh well...
