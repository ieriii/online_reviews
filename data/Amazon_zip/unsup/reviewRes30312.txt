Unexpectedly awesome! I went to Sunda for a work dinner with a group of 8 people. I didn't pick the restaurant so I didn't have any real expectations. This place was so good I wanted to jump up and scream "Can I get a witness?!?!" The food is served family style so going with a group is great so you can try lots of different things. Here are my recommendations: - Oh No You Didn't roll: it's fun to order, and it was honestly one of the best sushi rolls I've ever had. - Crispy Brussell Sprout salad: I would never normally order Brussell sprouts, but this salad was outstanding. Everyone at the table was raving about it. - Oxtail pot stickers: so delicious that one guy in our group ate them...even though he had not eaten meat in over 12 years. Yes they were that good. - Lemongrass Beef Lollipops: excellent. We powered through two orders almost immediately. - Rock Shrimp Tempura: rocked my world - Garlic noodles: solid, above average - Pan roasted Duck Breast: not a crowd favorite, could be skipped. Overall I will definitely be going back to Sunda. I would also recommend the Nautilus Sauvignon Blanc, super tasty.
