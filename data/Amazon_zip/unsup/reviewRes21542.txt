Granted, not a 100% traditional Chicago hot dog. I know I know, too expensive, not Vienna Beef, etc. You can probably get a better hot dog for $0.99 somewhere else. But c'mon, a real drive-in with a big hot dog on the roof? You have to eat here at least once. As seen on everything, Superdawg is really fantastic. The out of the way location is hard to reach via public transportation. Spend a few minutes in the car to get the full drive-in experience, the tray hanging on your window, using the little call box. Good stuff. Hot dogs arrive in a cute little box with fries. Shakes are good as well.
