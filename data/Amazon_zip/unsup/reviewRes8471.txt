Love this place! Finally was able to try this place last night. We made a large reservation for 10 people the about 2 hours before arriving. Unfortunately our table was not ready for us when we had requested.....but they felt sorry and totally made up for it! The food was amazing! The closest to real Italian pizza I have found in Chicago. I am not Italian, but I did live in Italy for five months, so I know their pizza. Definitely going back and you should too!
