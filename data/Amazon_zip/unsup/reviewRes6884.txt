Got a coupon to this place for my birthday so came to check it out with a friend. The bread was warm and crusty, and the olive oil bright and fruity. I almost filled myself up on bread alone. Friend's seafood risotto was excellent, my squid ink gnocchi was dry and tasteless. Maybe I just didn't order the right dish? The atmosphere in the restaurant was very romantic.
