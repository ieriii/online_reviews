It took me a long time to finally try Irazu considering several of my friends would rave about it. I finally went there one day after work to meet a friend and loved it. A few months ago my mother wanted food and we were driving by when she said "how about there?" and I immediately pulled over. Don't have to ask me twice!  I don't even remember everything I've tried from there, but oh man, the food is so good. The last time I went I asked one of the guys behind the counter what dishes he might recommend, but more importantly, which empandas he thought were the best. There are quite a few, and I probably should have written this review a lot sooner than I am, but oh man, those empanadas were delicious. I believe one of them was spinach and something. All I can say it, that guy didn't lie! I believe one of the things he recommended was the veggie burrito, but the best part was "I'm not gonna lie, the veggie (insert actual food item here) is delicious. Seriously, for veggies....yeah."  I really like the sandwiches from here, but the best thing is definitely the Oatmeal shake! Everyone I know that's been here doesn't have a bad thing to say.  The food is flavorful, quick and attentive service and the patio is perfect for those really nice days.
