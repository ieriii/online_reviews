Food - great! Noise - earsplitting. I will never come back to this place. My friend and I could not talk to each other without shouting. The room acoustic is so "live" that everthing from kitchen noise to table noise to conversation noise is so amplified that it made my "dining experience" totally horrible.My table was in about the same spot the stage was at the old "Madrigal's" male stripper bar. It was less noisy then even though there were drunk people stuffing money into g-strings.Best of luck. If you need me, I'll be at Calo.
