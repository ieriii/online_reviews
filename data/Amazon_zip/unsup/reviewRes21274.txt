The Cubana sandwich is pretty awesome, but make sure you (or someone who will let you try a bite) get the Cochinita Pibil. The habanero dipping sauce is definitely a heat that builds, but it's one of the best things I've ever eaten. The pickled onions, the porky goodness...my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Make sure you finish with the churros, too...a great (and not inexpensive, but definitely worth the $$) place for a very filling lunch.
