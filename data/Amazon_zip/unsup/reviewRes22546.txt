Any fucking malaka can light some cheese on fire, shout a few "opas" and claim to run a Greek restaurant. Greek Islands is the real deal though. In fact, Greek Islands is the highest grossing Greek restaurant in the U.S. My favorite thing about Greek Islands is consistency. I know when I order the Chicken Riganati, or the Gigantes (Giant Lima Beans), the Bacalao, or the arni fournou that my food is going to taste as good as it did the last 200 times I had it. Some people claim that Santorini across the street is a little fresher and a little cleaner, and that my be true. However, when I head to Greek Town I head to one place - - Greek Islands. I recommend everything I mentioned above as well as the unbelievably overpriced lamb chops. For a better deal order the lamb riblets by the pound. You can find these in the back of the menu under "from the grill." The avgolemono is superb as well as the fasolada (bean soup) offered on certain days. Whatever you do, watch out for the skordalia. If you are on a date avoid the stuff - the shit is a potato and garlic combo, heavy on the garlic - and if you are going on a date within the next few days, avoid it as well. All in all, you will not be disappointed at Greek Islands.
