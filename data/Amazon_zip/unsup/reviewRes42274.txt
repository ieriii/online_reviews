Think Marie Antoinette style dinner with fewer cakes and more bone marrow and smashed potatoes with house made chicken jus. If you order things other than pasta (not that there's anything wrong with pasta) like the mussels, the beef tartar, the bone marrow, blackened cauliflower, pork belly with some sort of grain tossed with asparagus and a fruit glaze of some sort- raspberry comes to mind, red skinned smashed potatoes with lots of garlic, cream and chicken jus, corn bread with scallions, couple fancy cocktails, a bottle of Malbec, cookie dough ice cream, and a slice of light as air coconut cream pie it's a guaranteed gastronomic paradise. For real. This menu is not for the faint at heart, literally, if you have high cholesterol or need to watch your weight don't come it's nearly 2 days worth of calories. But well worth it. For 4 of us each having about 2-3 drinks and sharing a few apps and entrees, plus dessert the total including tip was about $260 bones. It's a bit pricey, I couldn't do it all the time, but for an occasion or out of town guests it'll do the trick. Go forth and eat!
