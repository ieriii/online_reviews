I HEART Carnivale. Love love love it. I love the atmosphere number one. It has a dance floor too. I love the decor; it's exciting and beautiful. I LOVE the food.  Everything you order will be absolutely amazing. But I can't resist ordering the best thing on the menu: the Churrasco. Also excellent is their ceviche platter, and for dessert, get the pineapple ice cream sundae it's out of this world.
