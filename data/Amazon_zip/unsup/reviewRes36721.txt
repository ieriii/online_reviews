Indie Cafe has a nice and sleek interior with a menu featuring Thai and Japanese dishes. The food is beautifully presented at Indie. My Thai lunch special is probably the most basic thing on the menu (the physical menu is really cool, almost like an art swatch) so my order had a simple look to it. I had chicken pad see-ew (fun to say?) with miso soup and mini vegetable egg rolls, a well-rounded lunch though none of the choices were awe-inspiring. My friend had seaweed salad, beautifully served in a martini glass along with a cutesy paper umbrella. The salmon and spinach rolls were not bad considering I do not even like seafood. Sushi is again elegantly displayed, a work of art in presentation and apparently taste too though my friend said it was not spicy enough.
