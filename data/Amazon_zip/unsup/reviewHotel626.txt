I am not impressed with the Doubletree. The first room we tried smelled like an ash tray. Not very appealing when you specifically reqeust a non-smoking room. We headed back down to the front desk and luckily scored another room. This room was fine - ok, kind of clean, not sparkly and new...just meh. The parking was over $40 and it was self-park! Ridiculous!!! The breakfast for HH members was the continental buffet only, but don't be fooled, you can order off the menu (we didn't know this until we heard another customer ask). The cont. buffet was depressing-The best item was the Dannon Yogurt and the muffins tasted like saw dust. We did not spend any time downtown, so perhaps my review would be better if we were looking for an excellent location near Michigan Ave. I think I am becoming a hotel snob!
