I've been to The Gage three times now but have neglected to write a review. Tsk. Shame on me. But let me make amends now. Both the indoor and outdoor seating areas feel special. Last night I dined outdoors. The plants that surround the exterior dining area provide some privacy from the throngs of tourists on Michigan Ave. The interior is fairly simple and attractive. Service is always friendly from the hostesses right down to the bus boys. The waiters always have a recommendation for drinks or food. They are knowledgeable and efficient. The food is pretty darn good too. Last night I came here with a friend and we had the house cured salmon, which has smoked salmon (obviously), crme frache, cucumber, capers, caviar, and is served with caraway crackers. Yum. A fine choice for a hot Memorial Day Weekend outing. We also shared the mixed green salad with cashews, smoked cheddar, apple, dried cherries and ginger vinaigrette. I want to eat this salad every single day! Further, we shared a burger. It was a smidge overcooked--we asked for med rare but got medium--but it was very good. Overall this was the perfect amount of food for two people. Add three glasses of prosecco plus two Moscow Mules and we were at about $108. I didn't have this last night (it felt too hot out for this item--but I highly recommend the Mussels Vindaloo. It may sound rather off-putting but I assure you this is pure deliciousness. I will order it again when the temperature is under 95 degrees. So overall, you can't lose by dining at The Gage. I'll definitely be back!
