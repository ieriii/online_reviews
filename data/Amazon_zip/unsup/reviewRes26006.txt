This place is pretty cool. I keep forgetting to BYOB it so I'm stuck drinking their delicious tea instead - such is life. I've ordered the clay pot chicken a couple times, and it's so good that the next time we fight a war in the South Pacific, I'll be on their side. BONUS: sit by the window for a view of the drunk trixies passing by
