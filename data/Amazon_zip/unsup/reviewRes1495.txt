Clearly I'm not writing anything new here with so many reviews. Hot Doug's serves the best hot dogs ever. Period. I don't know what more I can tell you. There's a wide array of hot dogs to get and I suggest getting several and the "duck fat fries," if they're available on the day you're there. You gotta get the classic Chicago dog, all toppings, no catchup, with a poppyseed bun. I also got the daily special, which was a bacon and chicken hot dog with a delicious mess of toppings. Unbelievable. Doug, the owner (and hot dog connoisseur), personally takes each of the orders himself. He told me "I don't care if there's a boot on the menu. If it's fried in duck fat, you order it."
