I adore this place. The owner and the wait staff are super nice, and give very personal service. I always get the Beef Pho, because it's delicious and has tons of bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, hot peppers, sauces, etc to put on top. The lunch special is fantastic at a very reasonable price. As far as other dishes, I can't recommend others obviously, but I've had bites of my friends' and they were all delicious. If anything goes in the least bit wrong (which it doesn't, usually) with your visit the staff are the nicer about it than any restaurant I've ever been to. I messed up my take-out order one time and THEY felt bad about it and gave me extra stuff and a drink while I waited...so nice! One of my favorite places to eat in Chicago.
