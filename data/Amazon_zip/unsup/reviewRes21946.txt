We keep going back for the great service and margaritas! Last week we went in for dinner and drinks and found the place packed, as usual! We are regulars, so we usually ask for a table up front. In this case it was going to be a long wait so the owner suggested we go to the back. We were seated at a table in the middle of the room, surrounded by 4 VERY large groups, and it was loud to say the least! The waiter took our order to get it in ahead of the group, so we wouldn't have to wait, which was very considerate. We usually eat and have several drinks afterward, but in this case it was just too loud. We paid our bill and went back to the bar to stand and have another drink. The owner, upon seeing us, offered a table up front(ahead of waiting patrons), we declined as not to take away from people waiting to eat. After having a drink, the owner insisted on buying another round for us for being considerate, I guess! We will continue to go back to the Mayan Palace for the great drinks, exceptionally friendly service and good food, pretty much in that order. Don't miss out on this place!
