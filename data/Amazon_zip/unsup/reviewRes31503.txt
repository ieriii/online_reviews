Was in Chicago visiting from California and Nana's was highly recommended from a close relative. I am very particular about food having full flavor, and Nana's did not disappoint! My mouth waters recollecting the dishes I was fortunate to taste. Enjoyed it so much I went back to try their dinner/lunch menu as well. Every once in a while the chef will experiment with different foods, and I was lucky to get a taste of his twist of New Orleans beignets. *YUM* Excellent gourmet food, for a reasonable price!  Everyone made you feel like part of the family. It is family run business with a professional appeal. Local artwork decorates the restaurant walls which are available for purchase. Trisha was our server and did an exceptional job! A cheery disposition--she made excellent recommendations, and was happy to take the time to explain any menu items. We also had the opportunity to meet "Nana" herself! A very warm and welcoming woman. If you're from out of town definitely check out Nana's--a local restaurant away from the touristy locale.
