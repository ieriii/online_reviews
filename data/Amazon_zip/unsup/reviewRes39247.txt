How you doing tonight? Me? I smell like meat smoke and kimchee but you know what? I'm doing awesome. Now. Now that I've experienced Sam Soo Gab San. So many plates, so much meat. Time flew by as we tore into the glorious offerings and before we knew it, everything was gone and what wasn't completely gone, was being picked at. Remember the last time you had a new food experience? First time you had curry? Or caviar? Or Thai food? It's like all that (presuming they were good experiences) rolled into one. Lettuce-wrapped beef, bean paste, various goodies. It's that simple and that perfect. Between the amazing company, the confluence of timelines that allowed us to all be together, the food... a glorious night indeed. I cannot wait to go back.
