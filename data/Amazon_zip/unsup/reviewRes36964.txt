nice place for beers. tons of selections! food was okay. salmon tartar was good. cheese platter was yummy! great selections of cheese. entrees were so so. had great expectations that mussels will be delicious...but ill pass on that next time. there were lots of unopened mussels in the pot...A big NO NO!! pomme frittes were good though....and portions were huge! brisket was way too dry. served with side of slaw, mustard, and mac n cheese. brisket was calling for some au jus! ill just go back for drinks next time...
