I knew as soon as I walked in that Sabatino's was going to be the real deal. Why you ask? The restaurant and bar was packed with fat Italians. It was almost like Jersey Shore meets old school Chicago. With no reservations, there was about a 45 minute wait. It didn't seem that long, as I was entertained at the bar, while sipping on Effen martinis, which were made perfect.  A few sips into my second martini, we were seated. The menu is fairly extensive, and priced right, especially considering the amount of food you get. I chose some veal and prosciutto entree in which I couldn't pronounce, and wifey opted for the usual: Chicken Parmigiana. My veal dish was the absolute best that I've ever consumed. I tried wifey's chicken, which was amazing as well. A few glasses of Cline, priced reasonably at $7.25 made the dinner as good as it gets. Excellent service, and amazing food will definitely bring me back. Soon!
