My first hotel review? I think? Just remember when checking in that the entrance is not on Michigan, but on East Wacker. When you walk in, it kinda has that rock star quality to it, a snazzy bar, cool seating area and young staff. I am cool with that, I am hip with it. ;-0 The staff actually were very helpful, patient, and eager to answer your questions...so that was a plus. Also a plus was that they kept part of that beautiful lobby/elevator area not as renovated, which looked great. The rooms were ok, clean, newly renovated (most of them), so the decor was nice. Be ready for the reminders that you are in a Hard Rock hotel, so eg guitar embroidered on pillowcase, posters of artists around the room, and such. In our bathroom, David Bowie watched me brush my teeth, so that was, well, different. Two cool factors, and even then, other than location, the hotel was just ok: every floor represents a different artist and has a piece of their memorabilia. That provided a little entertainment for us. (We were on the Cheap Trick floor, if you ask the front desk they have a whole list.) Also, they lend out guitars (electric and acoustic) for free, first come first serve, so you can have a little jam session in your room. Otherwise, I am just glad they kept their gimmicky stuff in the store so we could enjoy our stay.
