Probably the first place I didn't have a good time at. Not because of the music or the atmosphere, but because of a bunch of other things that happened that left a bad taste in my mouth. I came here on a wednesday, and it was the house band playing. I was looking for jazz or blues, what I got was bluegrass. I was also charged a cover to get in, $6. Next, the drinks were fast and the service good, but I couldn't open a tab unless I had an American Express card, you have got to be kidding me right? And then we were told we have to keep silent, even though we were really far from where the band was playing and talking relatively quiet. If I wasn't in love with Chicago, this place would get 2 stars. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
