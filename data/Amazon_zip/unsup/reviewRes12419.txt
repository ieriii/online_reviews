I went last night and my dinner was ok. the ribeye was a bit flat and so was the tamale cubano. but my friends dinners were amazing! the honey pork chops were just amazing and huge! holy cow. dont get me wrong, the food is good but it didnt amaze, i didnt like the fact i was battling the outside elements inside. bugs.......i had one crawling up my shoulder and flys on our table. i had to ask where my left overs were and they brought me someone elses dinner. i was hoping for someone else's pork chops to be honest. they brought me my meal wiht new ribeye smoking hot and telling me this was my left overs. amazing how it was so much warmer an hour after i sent it to be wrapped and the wrong cut of steak.......... the upside pineapple cake was just killer. very very good.
