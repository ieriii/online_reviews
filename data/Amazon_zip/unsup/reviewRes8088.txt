I think Fogo de Chao is completely overpriced and I hate how I cannot go there without ending up with a $100 bill at the end. But there are three reasons why I keep returning: 1. Unlimited lamb chops - granted the lamb chop guy comes by less often than, say, the picanha guy, but when he does i make sure to get at least three at a time. The lamb chops aren't the best I've eaten, but the key word here is "unlimited" 2. The Picanha - I've learned to say 'no thanks" to all the other meats other than the lamb chops and the picanha. The picanha is always seasoned well and its so tender that it melts in your mouth. The Picanha is, in fact, probably the reason why I cough up the extra $20 instead of just sticking with the salad bar. 3. Those warm cheese puffs - I had a vision of Heaven the other day, and it involved lounging on a pile of those wonderful cheesy buttery puffs. I wish I could stuff my face with more of these little guys, but I didn't pay $50 to have unlimited bread. Oh, the angst! The reality is that I will keep returning to Fogo and I will continue parting with my Franklins, but in all honesty I cannot think of any other place where I would consistently tolerate such behavior.
