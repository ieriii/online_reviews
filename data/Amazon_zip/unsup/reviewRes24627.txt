Went here and wont be coming back unless i happen to be in the area and want to stop in for some cheese fondue. I have always been dying to go here and my girlfriend and i got a groupon so we hit it up. First off you only get one choice of cheese for your fondue which is some type of swiss, brie combo. I am not a fan of swiss but it wasn't horrible, it was very intense but good. You do not get a choice of broth/oil to cook your food in so even though the food they bring was very fresh, it had no flavor and you HAD to dip it in one of the sauces. The reason they are getting such a low score is not the food, nor the service, which was actually pretty decent, but the seating. We were about 5 inches from the guitar player seated on a raised platform. This not only made it difficult to hear each other but it was very awkward knowing that the guy is able to hear every word we say. The seating arrangement's are absolutely horrible and you are at such a tiny table that it makes it difficult to eat. If you are into dessert fondue, its not horrible but again you only get the one option of dark chocolate with a light orange rum that they burn off. They sent us a $25 coupon and we wont be back to use it. On top of everything, i think their food is way way over priced. Save yourself the torment and treat yourself to a nice time a the melting pot where the seating is more than adequate, the atmosphere is enjoyable, you're not burning up, and you actually have a choice in what you get to eat.
