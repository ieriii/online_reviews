First day in Chicago, I tried Lou Malnati's Chicago pizza and thought it was good.2nd day in Chicago, I explored Rush Street and decided to try Giordano's pizza. Giordano's for the win!The crust is thick. The cheese is a mountain. You get to pre-order so its ready to go when your table is.The atmosphere was fun, esp with it being happy hour on Friday.I will be back.
