I never liked deep dish stuffed pizza until I came to Art of Pizza. The crust is so delicious, chewy, and not too flaky. Their sauce is tart and perfectly spiced. Ahhhh! My mouth is drooling.  I wish I could move them to Arizona, but every time I come home I order a pizza just for myself. Spinach and cheese deep dish is a must!
