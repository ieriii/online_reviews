I went to Calo's a few weeks ago with some colleagues from work. For anywhere between twelve and twenty dollars a plate, the food is plentiful and tasty. I can't remember the name of what I ordered, but it was a simple pasta and chicken dish with a creamy basil sauce. There wasn't anything totally remarkable about the food. It was good. One of my friends from work ordered the ribs and was making some noises about it that made me wish I ordered them. Now, for a group of about 16, with people coming and going and ordering as they showed up, the service staff did a great job. There was however a breaking point during the evening when they decided that it was time for us to leave and stopped coming to our table. I'd have to say, they put up with a lot of English teachers who like to talk with volume, but I wasn't happy with how they decided to end our evening. All that aside, I'd go back in a heartbeat. Sure, it's a pain in the ass to get up to Andersonville from where I live, but it's worth the trip.
