Pros: Great atmosphere, friendly hostesses, lively bar scene (though tables too packed in so no standing space), live music, good drinks, black or white napkin option, follow up call the next day by the hostess. Cons: Had a terrible waiter (Eric). He was rude and seemed put-out by any questions we asked. I ordered a filet mignon cooked medium. It arrived medium well to well done. And this was immediate, as in as soon as I cut into it I saw that it was way overcooked. Eric did not stick around to ask us if our steaks were cooked ok, which to me, is basic serving skills at a steak restaurant. 25 minutes later he finally came to check on us and I told him my steak was overdone but since everybody else was done with their entree I didn't want a new one. He actually came over to me and instead of apologizing like any good waiter would do, he told me that I let it sit on the plate too long and it continued to cook. Um no, it was like that immediately but you wouldn't know because you waited 25 minutes to ask. And if the plates DO cook the steak more then you need to bring it out under-cooked. I don't know anybody who eats their 8 oz. steak in one bite. It's going to sit there as they enjoy their dinner. So I went to the restaurant for a good steak and didn't even get to eat an entree. I got the follow up call the next day, which is a nice gesture. I told them what happened and the girl on the phone was very apologetic and said she appreciated the feedback and would have a manager call me. If that had happened I absolutely would've given the place a 2nd chance. But never got a call. Bottom line: There are many other steak houses to go to in this great city with better service and better food. I will not be going back to this one.
