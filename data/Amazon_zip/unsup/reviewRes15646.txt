Finally, a pizza place my husband and I can agree on! The deep dish has a super buttery crust and a ton of cheese (for him) and the thin crust veggie is cracker thin, crispy, and completely loaded with veggies (for me.) Our delicious pizzas were delivered promptly and the driver was so nice. We'd sworn off ordering pizza since we could never agree on a place until Calo. We've now ordered from here two weekends in a row...and will probably make it three!
