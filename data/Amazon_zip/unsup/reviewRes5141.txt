Swine n' Wine! Great service! Purple! My favorite color! Pig! My favorite flavor! This place could not have been more appealing, but then I went in biased to like it. Me, the Oenophile dilettante (I love wine, I'm just not sure what to order - so I brought someone who did!) and the porcine . . . ophile as well. Salami, jamon, prosciutto, tongue, head cheese . . . all fancy words for FANCY MEAT, baby! Big platter of MEAT! Carnivores rejoice and bare your canine teeth! The salami . . . wow. They smoke and make a lot of their meat here, how is this possible to have a smokehouse here in Michigan Ave., but they do, and it is beautiful. Deviled egg. Now, I love the ova of Lucifer as much as the next siren, but this was particularly decadent. I called it "A Scotch Egg, but deviled!". Hard boiled egg, deviled, and DEEP FRIED with a crispy crust. Inside, creamy, warm and . . . mmmfff. Unexpected deviled egg, but yum. The best deviled egg, indeed. Reclining atop a bed of greens with a delicate vinegarette (there's the greens with all this meat). Don't miss this one. Another appetizer . . . "Bait". Deep fried . . . something like white anchovies? People who know me, know I'm a fool for the anchovy, and these were . . . well, something similar to them, and just as delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed myself here. Stellar company, MEAT and wine. And our waitress could not have been more friendly, cute and charming. Even the hardworking manager came out for a chat. Great addition to the Avenue. Will be back SOON. Updated to add: OMG, I forgot the Bone Marrow. Suffice it to say, I want to lay in a vat of this stuff while I dip bread in this marrow bath and stuff myself with 100% fat until I die of a coronary or get stuck in aforementioned tub. Yummmmm . . . Anthony Bourdain says bone marrow would be his last meal, but I'm gonna eat it again and again, baby! In fact, eating bone marrow WITH Anthony Bourdain. Well, that thought will get me thru many a dull evening . . . mmmmmm
