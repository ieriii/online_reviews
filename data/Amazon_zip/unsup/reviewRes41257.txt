Dear Ruth Chris: I wasn't sure what to expect ... a steak house is a steak house ... RIGHT? um ... no. So far, I've been to at least 3 here in the Chicago area, and - while they were good, last night, they were just undone. Not since Clinkerdagger, Bakerstaff & Petts in Tacoma, WA a LIFETIME ago, have I had Medium Rare Steak as good as I was privileged to devour for my Birthday!! I got the Petite Filet with Shrimp and I could have cut it with my FORK it was so tender and succulent!  The crab stuffed mushrooms? to DIE for!  Le Piece de Resistance? my desert - complete with lit candle. Yes - I truly felt like Queen for a Day for my Birthday Celebration!! I am in love - I will forever turn to Ruth Chris for my future special occasions. I am -now- a loyal fan! The staff was SO incredible, I want to adopt them all!! Marci was positively the *best* server I have encountered in a LONG time!! Thank you -- Thank you -- Thank you !!
