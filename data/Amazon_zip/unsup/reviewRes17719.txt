Let me preface this by saying: The food is delicious! However, the service is sub-par. I've been here about 3 times now, and have had waiters be inattentive, in some cases bringing out the wrong dish. Most of the time it's hard to get the waiter to come when I want to ask a question or put in another order... and general unfriendliness is common amongst the wait staff. That being said, when I have my cravings for Indian food I definitely consider going here. They also deliver through http://Diningin.com
