This is an excellent Thai restaurant. I met a friend here for dinner on a Saturday night. They sat us in the front portion of the restaurant, which was not as "nice" as the back part, which had exposed brick and seemed like a more intimate dining area. That aside, the prices here are very reasonable and the food tastes really flavorful and fresh. Rice doesn't come with the dishes, however, and in my opinion they don't give you enough with the side order. At least not enough to bring home with your leftovers of you dish. We had fair service, though I think it could have been a bit quicker in taking our order and our payment. I would definitely make a return visit here, especially I lived in the neighborhood or was around for something else. Not sure it is worth a "special trip" to Lincoln Square, however, just to eat here.
