I came here after dinner for dessert and drinks, but apparently people come here for all sorts of reasons. I saw people eating dinner, studying, drinking coffee, having a meeting (at 11pm). It was cool that this place makes everyone feel comfortable like that..  The chocolate cake was OK, it was not warmed up so it was like eating a cold brownie. The raspberry chocolate port was different... in a good way. It was like drinking juice and eating a chocolate bar at the same time. I would drink it again.
