Let's cut to the entrees. The 1/2 roasted duck (anatra arrosto) and rosemary lamb (Angello al rosmarino) was unsatisfactory. The fennel sausage and polenta that accompanied the duck was quite nice but I didn't order this dish for the sides, did I? Quite frankly, I would have been much happier with peking duck from Chinatown. As far as the rosemary lamb, it wasn't a total disaster, but I would still rank it in the bottom 20th percentile of lamb dishes I have had. While I am still on my rant, I'm gonna have to say service was disorganized. The servers kept coming to our table with the wrong orders and bottles of wine that we never ordered. It's a harsh start, but I wanted to end the review on a good note. The greeter honored our reservation and we were seated immediately on the outdoor patio. To start, the calamari was done well and the batter was not too heavy. The funghi tartufati pizza was commendable. But it was the pasta dishes that really won me over. The stracci di farro was refreshing. The pasta is made with imported farro flour and tossed with asparagus tips and mushrooms, then topped with truffle oil and parmesan curls.  The spaghetti nero "frutti di marre" was my favorite of the night. The black spaghetti melded with the thick san marzano tomato sauce and there was just enough green chile to stimulate your palate with every bite. Hidden throughout the dark strands were the array of fresh seafood.  As far as ambiance: Dining al fresco under the fig trees with a glimpse of the night sky was just sublime. This experience ranks up there with the outdoor cabanas at Volo. I guess this is as close to dining on the Italian countryside I can get for now...sigh*
