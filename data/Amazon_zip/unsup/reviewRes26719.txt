Haven't eaten in the restaurant but ordered pizza from here. Wait was a little long but we live a little trek away so it took us that time to get down there. Loved the thin crust. Deep dish was good but a bit bready for my taste. Carmelized crust runs on borderline burnt. Sauce was the winner for me. All-in-all, a sturdy place to order pizza.
