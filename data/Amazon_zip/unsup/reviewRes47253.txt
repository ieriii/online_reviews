I would love to love this place, good beer selection, excellent food, but the service is absolute garbage. My girlfriend and I both placed a beer order, and had yet to decide on food. Our waitress never brought us our beers, even after having been reminded upon ordering our food 20 minutes later. While watching our waitress do shots and smoke, wondering where our drinks were, we were delivered our food from the busboy. The food was amazing. Our burgers were under cooked which is okay considering I always order medium rare and receive medium well. The bottom line is, I'll take shitty food and good service over no service and fantastic food any day. I work in the industry and always tip, usually 20% minimum, but had no qualms leaving almost no tip. Kuma's frozen fries, and mediocre burgers put this place to shame, unfortunately. I would suggest McDonald's or your run of the mill greek joint if you are in the mood for a burger, at least you know someone will attempt contact with you the hour plus you are there. If you enjoy watching the person you are potentially paying to bring you food and drink, do shots, smoke, carry on, and otherwise do pretty much anything other than acknowledge you whatsoever, then lockdown is the place for you! The food is great, the service makes this place a last resort at best!
