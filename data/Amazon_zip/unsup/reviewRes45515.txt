What a great place to enjoy a bottle of wine and a hamburger! This place has great atmosphere and fun sayings all over the walls. I went with a few friends and enjoyed a massive burger and huge helping of fries. We had a bottle of wine from a server that hailed from San Diego, Ca. I especially enjoyed the massive window that allowed for a view of Broadway in the evening. Over all my friends had some other bar food and they were satisfied as well. I found that they make their own mayonnaise with cracked peppercorn, YUM!  Over all a great experience, nothing like when St. Patrick's Day is in full swing but, great for a quick bite before heading out!
