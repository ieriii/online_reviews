Stopped in for lunch today. Great bargain! For $7.95 you get a choice of four items from a lunch list. The choices included collared greens, two types of lentils, cabbage, potatoes and carrots, three different beef dishes and a few other vegetarian options. The portions were great, the food came out fast and I left full and happy.
