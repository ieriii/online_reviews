The best restaurant I have eaten at to date. I have never tasted Mexican food so good in my life and I live in Arizona! So much to say about this place. What makes it the best ever for me is that the food is no question from a James Beard, Top Chef Master's winner and it is not priced as such! Half the price of Fleur de lis in Vegas. Also I have made some of Rick Bayless' dishes at home and they were still amazing! I wished I lived in Chicago I'd eat there every week.
