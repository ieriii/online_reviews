Garcia's a nice change from your average greasy spoon Mexican restaurants. The food isn't anything to rave about. The portions are incredibly huge (burritos are larger than your head). If one Chipotle burrito isn't enough to satisfy your appetite, then Garcia's will. There are mucho vegetarian options (there's even a separate section). Prices are moderate, but you're really getting two meals in one (I heart leftovers). The drinks are strong, always a good thing (you're getting ripped off otherwise). I freakin' love mole sauce. There's something about this weird, brownish-purple thick liquid. There's not much like it. Garcia's mole sauce had a weird aftertaste, but it was okay. It wasn't very flavorful. I didn't even ask if they used chicken stock (let's hope not). I've had much better elsewhere (Blind Faith Cafe's gardein mole dish is spectacular).
