Lovely interior, cozy and great for dinners or watching afternoon games on tv at the bar. Place is huge and good for dates, family dinners or larger parties. LOVE their gorgonzolla gnocchi, only place I've ever been able to get it, my mouth is watering as I type this! They have a grilled seafood appetizer that is DEELISH. Also a prosciutto wrapped mozzerella appetizer served on top of a small tomato salad drizzled in balsamic....YUMMMM. Thin crust pizza is also good. Go if you want delicious Italian food and a warm cozy atmosphere. Plus free parking in the lot across the street!
