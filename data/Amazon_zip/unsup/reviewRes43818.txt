As I've reviewed several steak/chophouses in Chicago, and I make my way to reviewing them all, I found Kinzie Chophouse to be high on the list.  I have to add though that I wasn't really focused on the food on the evening on which I ate there. I have lived in Chicago for 4 1/2 years and my best friend had never visited me. (I'll let her off the hook since she did have a baby in that period of time.) She surprised me that night and was sitting at the table when we arrived. I was so excited I barely knew what I was eating. However, I will add a few comments from what I recall. The steak was cooked perfectly and really had a nice flavor. The sauteed mushrooms were fresh, but had a LOT of garlic. The drinks were SMALL. We all ordered martinis and they were good, but very small; for a chophouse this was disappoointing, but then again, I can't complain about being overserved! It might actually have saved me from myself. Since my mind was elsewhere, I'll leave my review at that. I will return to try it again, and my friend has promised to come visit Chicago again as well.
