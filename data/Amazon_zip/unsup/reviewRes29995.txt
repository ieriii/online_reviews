So this place is a bit of a mindfu** for meatatarians like myself... My friend invites me out saying we are going to this really good vegan place. My response is "should I eat before I go?" She was not pleased haha.. They have a pretty cool back dining tent area, it was raining hard too..I really enjoyed sitting out there being able to hear the rain. Such a relaxing dinner. I had the dagwood sandwich. I was really surprised with how good it was for not being real meat. I did have to add a fair amount of extra seasonings to bring the taste up a bit...but still very impressed. The really killer was the mac and cheese that wasnt made with cheese. Some of the best mac and cheese I have had. Blows my mind! The wait to be seated can be long, and service seemed a tad slow..par for the course with more popular places like this I suppose.
