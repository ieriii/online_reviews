Awesome food, and this coming from a carnivore. I love this place. Only loses a star because of frequent waits (but hey, it's cozy and popular, what do you expect?) and being slightly pricey (again, it's sort of boutique, in a way, being vegetarian/vegan, and the servings are big enough to share, but not cheap all the same). Delicious.
