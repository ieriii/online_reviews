Best Columbian Steakhouse I've been too. We first went to Las Tablas because they were participating in Restuarant Week. I'm glad we did becuase we've been back three times in the past two months. You can taste every bite of your food, and its all good. The servers are prompt, but not annoying. The mood is romantic, but great for large parties as well. Portions are large, and worth every penny. Bonus, they have half price pitchers of Sangria (so good) M-W. That's just $12.
