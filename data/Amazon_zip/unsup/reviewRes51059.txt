I've eaten here several times for brunch and dinner. I don't want to overdo the superlatives, but really it's that good. They're generous with anniversary and birthday certificates (free drink AND dessert!). And the fried chicken, offered on Tuesday nights, is phenomenal. I take half home, because it's a huge portion and because I can't forgo the red velvet cake made with beets. Inspired cooking and service.
