I went here with a few of my friends for a spring opening wine tasting and we all wanted to dig into the 5 course menu To start things off, bonsoiree is a bit innocuous from the outside. If you aren't specifically looking for it, you may miss it. The decor on the inside is very comforting and modern at the same time. The seating looked to be around 25-30 people, so it isn't big, but it isn't cramped either as there was room to move around and enjoy when I made reservations we settled on the 5 course menu since there were only going to be a couple of us and we weren't going to have a lot of wine. Bonsoiree had been recommended to me by one of my friends that was there with us and we figured that it would satisfy our needs I don't fully remember course by course, but the service was excellent throughout the meal with good pacing of the courses. The scallops in cheese were tremendous and the plating design was great as well. The only slight knock on one of the dishes was that the pork was a bit too dry, but all of the other dishes more then made up for that. Most importantly, we all left without being stuffed but weren't hungry either, the portions were spot on and I liked how the dishes slightly pushed the envelope without going too far out. Everything was more of a modern take on french dishes and everything was presented in a way that made sense and was user friendly which can sometimes be a problem with places that go more modern. I will certainly try the 8 course or 13 course dinners at some point in the future, and best of all, zero corkage. The prices for the meals are all extremely reasonable for higher end dining and that helps make this a destination to check out
