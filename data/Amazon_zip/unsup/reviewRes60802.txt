I friggen LOOOOVE this place. HOT HOT HOT staff, awesome service, plenty of booz and to top it off it has a GREAT unique twist on bar food. I spend tons of time here. I can't help it...I'm in love with one of the waitresses!Oh yeah...I also wanted to add that one of the owners, PJ, is the sweetest ham I've met in Chicago in my 3 years here. GO LOCKDOWN! I'm IN!
