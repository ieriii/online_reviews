Pizza is decent I guess. Little heavy on the crust if you ask me. We get it... its cornmeal, now can I taste the rest of the pizza please?! Most of the staff needs a reality check. Little too much attitude from my waitress tonight. No, I didnt call ahead to have my pizza ready. Maybe I was meeting my party there and weve got more urgent business than whats on our pizza. Really youd think the staff would be excited to see the people who didnt call ahead. After all, its an automatic 45 minutes of chowing on appetizers and/or ordering drinks. Which btw the appetizers were totally mediocre and two of my three drinks came in spotty, less than clean glasses. The 3 stars is for decent prices (for this part of Chicago at least) and the good location. All in all, theres much better options available...
