My boyfried took my here recently. He is 5 yrs older than me and had talked about this place for awhile. I really think the outdoor deck upstairs offers something nice in this area. I also like the selection of food and wine. I did like being able to go up and my own food at the salad bar but sometimes it got a litttle crowed up there. We went on a Saturday at 8 so I guess that's to be expected. One thing I would say is the waitstaff is one of the best I have been around. Super friendly yet knoweldgable. I did not feel funny asking about different wines when I was not familiar with them. I think all in all this was a very good experience and would come back. It is just a little pricey for my taste.
