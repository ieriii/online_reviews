Milk & Honey was good, but not great. We walked in and ordered and were seated pretty quickly. I had the Turkey Reuben and others at my table enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros and the Breakfast Panini. The huevos rancheros looked delicious and made me wish I like eggs. My Turkey Panini was good. Our food came very quickly and the service was fine. I think the reason I give Milk & Honey 3/5 stars is that it's just not my kind of place. I think brunch should be a relaxing and enjoyable mood. The moment you walk into Milk & Honey you are rushed to order as there is a crowd of people in line. They also make you get your own coffee, water, silverware, napkins, etc. Part of the enjoyment of brunch is being served. They also have a sign on the wall encouraging patrons NOT to take their time on the weekends so other people can sit down. There's nothing wrong with Milk & Honey but it's just not my kind of place.
