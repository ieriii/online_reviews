My friends and I went here last night and the staff was extremely accommodating (there were 10 of us) and the service was excellent. One person in our group waited in line for about 45 minutes but we got our name in and they called us shortly after that. We really enjoyed the setting - the ambiance is very cool and it's nice to go to a place where you're not jostling and elbowing people for floor space or seats. Note that I wouldn't go here to see and be seen 1) because it's pretty dark inside and 2) the layout / seating doesn't really lend itself to meeting new people unless you sit at the bar. This of course was fine with us because we were celebrating my friend's birthday and just wanted to hang out together in a cool space.  On to the drinks - some were awesome (I highly recommend the Gilded Cage, the Clapless Belle, and the Old Fashioned) and some will knock you on your ass (I'm talking about Heads You Lose).  Overall it's an awesome place and I definitely will go back.
