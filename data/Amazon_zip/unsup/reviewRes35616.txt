I've only eaten in the lounge, which I think is the way to go. The lounge, or oyster bar, is a little slice of what makes America great. You walk in, and there's a happy buzz. The hostess is friendly and takes you to a high top wooden table, or you go by yourself and sit, shame-free, with the other workers of the world, at the bar. The food is fantastic -- the crab cakes, the soups, the fish, the calamari. The Cubs are playing (maybe even winning) on the HD TVs they have around the place, and there's a live jazz band 6 nights a week. You feel like you've earned your beer. Shaw's is awesome.
