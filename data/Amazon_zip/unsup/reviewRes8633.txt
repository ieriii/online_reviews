All the reviews are correct - this place has such good pizza. It is kind of hidden, so I'm so happy it got recommended to me or I never would have known about it. I definitely recommend making a reservation. We went on a Sunday night and the place was packed. Good thing we had the reservation b/c we got seated right away. The white pizza we got was fantastic. The fresh mozzarella appetizer was so good too. I will definitely be going back to fill my pizza craving.
