I'm knocking off a star for adding a couple bucks onto the tip. I think on a $84.35 base, a total tab after tip of $96.35 is fine. But my cc statement says $98.35. I really don't think restaurants/servers should do this. I don't know why that behavior is so pervasive. I guess it's only a couple bucks, but kinda annoying. Obv I could have made a mistake and written the number wrong on my duplicate receipt, but not likely. I'm cheap. I get it. Too bad. Good food. Bad morals.
