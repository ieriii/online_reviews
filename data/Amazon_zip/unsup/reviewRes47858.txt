Excellent Brazilian style steakhouse with an upscale twist! I had a friend take me here on a recent visit to Chicago, I love Brazilian steakhouses so I was more than happy to go. This was easily the best Brazilian style steakhouse I've ever been to. Everything was cooked just right, medium rare, and not overcooked like sometimes happens at these type of restaurants. The cuts were much more imaginative and exotic than these type of restaurants typically have with individual sauces and dips for most cuts, and the "salad bar" was great as well. The meal price was spot on at $42, all you can eat, which is about average for this type of restaurant. Overall 5 stars, if you enjoy meat don't walk, run to this place!
