In an attempt to dodge the crowds at Navy Pier a friend and I stopped at the Market Bistro for dinner on our way to Chicago Shakespeare theater. I am so happy we did! After a long and arduous work week it was so nice to relax with great food, great wine, and great service (Oscar you rock!). We both ordered the special of the night which our waiter, Oscar, recommended since he had just tasted it (something to the extent of pan seared ahi on top of a wasabi dijon mustard sauce with sugar snap peas on red cabbage). It was excellent! The flavors were just right. Before heading out we shopped in the market for dessert and our intermission treat. Both the caramel pecan dark chocolate clusters and the oatmeal raisin cookie with a surprise of dried apple was a nice sweet treat to end on.
