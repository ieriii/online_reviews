I've been to Yolk twice and ever since I have steered anyone looking for breakfast in that area to Yolk. For good reason. The food here is not only phenomenal, it's served in incredibly generous portions and quickly. The egg fritattas all good. I've either ordered them or tasted them off of other peoples plates. The belgian waffle was delicious (although could have used a litte more powdered sugar treatment than what I received). The service has always been friendly and pretty quick, so I have no complaints and I really like the decor. Funky diner meets half finished restaurant?  Not sure how to describe it exactly. Haha. The only word of warning I have about Yolk is that the line is almost always long, so plan on eating there taking a while. We went during the week once for a late brunch and still waited nearly half an hour.
