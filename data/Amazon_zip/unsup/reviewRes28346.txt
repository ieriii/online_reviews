I have to agree with other yelpers that the food at GH are creative and intensely flavorful. The combination of flavors and infusion of unusual ingredients make the dining experience really fun. After every dish, you're anticipating for what will come next. The truffle popcorn was definitely unique and the flavors were great; however it was stale. I wonder how awesome it would be if it came out freshly popped.  We had the corn bisque and the sweet bread as starters. They were both very good. For the entree, we had the halibut and the duck. The halibut outshined all the dishes. I just loved the harmony of flavors that came from the cous cous and the smoked egg plant. The earthly flavors just married so well with the grilled halibut (so fresh by the way). I don't know what spices were used but everything just worked. The duck was great too and I loved the presentation, which kind of looked like a paint palette. If you're into sweet and sour kind of intense Asian flavors then you will like the duck. However, the halibut was memorable. I do appreciate that GH is going for haute cuisine without the stuffy, intimidating atmosphere. The servers were very attentive and our glasses were filled after every other sip it seemed like. They also offer free in-house sparkling water. Every dish is served with an explanation of the ingredients. The prices were also haute cuisine and I felt it was a bit inflated though. As far as the atmosphere, it's has an open-space lofty feel and very modern decor. The music was blasting like it was a club lounge so if you want to have an intimidate discussion over dinner, forget about it. I did enjoy the choices of music though, it was rocking the party that was going on in my mouth.
