Mmmmmmm I love the food here! I've only tried the lunch buffet, and it is so tasty. I haven't been for a couple months now, so I honestly can't tell you the names of any of the dishes, but try them all. I put a mound of rice on the center of my plate and strategically dish out the sauces in order to fit as much as possible yet taste everything on its own. I am not a fan of the soup or the flavor of the vegetables on the first buffet platter, but everything else is delicious. The chicken and naan that is brought out at the beginning of the meal is SO good and much needed to cool the mouth down in between spicy bites. Even the dessert is worth going back for seconds, and I normally don't eat anything too sweet. They offer rice pudding, mango ice cream and some sort of moist sugary cake ball thing, and I love it all. The service has always been excellent. The waiters are attentive and the hostess is remembered for being genuinely nice. Now, I like to eat giant meals when I'm hungover, but don't come here for that. You want to taste the flavors and experience all of the different dishes in the right state of palate. You walk out an hour later, $20 lighter and so full you think you'll blow, but it's definitely worth it.
