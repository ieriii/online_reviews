Restaurants like this are becoming a rare breed. Very old school, filled with locals, big portions, very extensive menu (everything from pasta to chicken to steaks to veal to seafood to....you get the picture...anyone can find something to eat here), soup/salad/potato included (am I the only one sick of paying a lot for a dinner that comes with jack squat?) - and everything is so reasonably priced. It's fabulous that a friend and I can eat here, leave stuffed, and pay $25 or $30 a piece, including the tax and tip...AND have enough food left over for lunch the next day. I have always had good service here, too. My only complaint would be that it does get crowded, and I would expect to wait for a table without a reservation, unless you get there early (like, 5pm on a Saturday). But, I can't blame the restaurant for attracting a crowd... If you are a gnocchi fan, the spinach gnocchi is a must-try.
