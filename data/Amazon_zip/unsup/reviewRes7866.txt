I spent some time in Croatia late last summer and one of the things I fell in love with, aside from the gorgeous scenery and amazing people, was the food. Since Croatia is just across the Adriatic sea from Italy, that Mediterranean food is very present in the Croatian cuisine. One of the places I especially loved was the Napoleon style, wood-grilled pizzas from Galija in downtown Split. That really thin, kinda burnt crust topped with a light sauce, easy cheese and fresh toppings was so amazing that I went there twice on the same vacation. By far one of my favorite meals. Needless to say I was SO happy to find the pizza at Spacca Napoli was pretty comparable to what I had in Croatia. I wouldn't say it's the real thing, but it's a satisfying substitute. My order was the Prosciutto e Rucola: Provola, prosciutto di parma, arugula, parmesan, and olive oil, except instead of the olive oil, I got the marinara sauce. It's basically an arugula salad on top of a pizza and it's GREAT. I like eating salad with my pizza; I think it cuts through the greasiness of the cheese. The Prosciutto pizza was perfect for my tastes. The service definitely lost a star for me, though. Our waitress was fairly absent. It's a good thing I'm not a high maintenance diner. Just keep my wine glass full and check in on me within the first minute or two of dropping of my dinner and I'm a pretty happy camper. But I'm not most people and it's pretty exasperating to feel like you're waiting such a long time to get your drink orders, apps, entrees and then another long period of time for the check to be dropped off and then processed. Dinner extended several hours. Good if you're not in a hurry. Bad if you need to get somewhere quickly. I will most certainly be back to Spacca Napoli for a nice, leisurely dinner.
