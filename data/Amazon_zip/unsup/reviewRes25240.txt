This place is pretty damn good, but I cant give it a five star because the servers seemed off their game - a little clueless at times, although perfectly friendly.  The sangria here is top notch, and I had a few tapas that were awesome - I cant remember what they were now, I ate there about three weeks ago. But the highlight was a whole roasted pig, served at the table! It was really a sight and a taste too- cooked perfectly, it seemed to me.  The place is a scene, very loud, but the big windows looking over Michigan Avenue give the room a grand feel.  This is a good fancy date destination, and a good fancy large party destination. Spied Harold Ramis here. Cool dude.
