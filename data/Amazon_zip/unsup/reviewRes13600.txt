So I've been wanting to go here for MONTHS, and I finally went last week. Didn't try any of the beers, so I'd like to go back to do that. We started with the sweet potato fritters as an appetizer - those were pretty good. My dinner of Fish and chips looked awesome, however that's where my happiness with the meal ended. The fish was completely bland. I'm not sure what could have made it better, but I'm fairly confident it was one of the most disappointing experiences with that entree I've ever had. My boyfriend had a burger and he loved it, so maybe next time I'll stick with one of those. So many people like this place, so I'll definitely give it another go, but as far as first impressions go...not so hot.
