we accidentally went on a "fight night" i had called a few days before to see if we'd need reservations and also checked on their website to see what events were coming up. this "fight night" wasn't listed on there. there were 5 of us, and we managed to grab 2 tables on the patio next to each other since we got there earlier in the night and the inside was completely packed, not a seat left. our waitress was forgetful, and somehow we had 2 different ones? the burgers were just ok. i think everyone had ordered medium and not a single burger was cooked medium. they also didn't really have that much flavor. the ideas behind the toppings are good, and if they could bring the quality of the burgers up i would go back. our waitress(es?) also didn't know which burgers were which? and somehow we got each others food, but its hard to tell whats what with everything that comes on them. its right in the neighborhood, so i really wanted a local burger joint to like, and its priced decently, so if they improved their actual burgers i'd give it another shot. there are def better burger places not too far away i'd hit up first
