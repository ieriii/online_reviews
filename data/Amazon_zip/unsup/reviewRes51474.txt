Ugh, really bad if you're looking for decent Americanized Mexican food. I ordered chicken enchiladas and what I got was cubes of chicken wrapped in tortillas, covered with a watery orange sauce and topped with a ridiculous amount of cheese. This may have been OK but it had so little flavor. The worst part is the $10 I wasted on this bad attempt at enchiladas when I could have just gone down the road to Albany Park and gotten something way better at half the cost.
