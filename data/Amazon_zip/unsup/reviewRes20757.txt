Was expecting more hype than substance, but the food really was outstanding. I wasn't impressed with any of Bayless's other restaurants (especially the rip-off that is Topolobampo) but I'd say this is definitely the best of the lot.  I have no idea how this place operates when busy, the whole system is chaos. I would think this place would move with the efficiency of the DMV or your local post office. You go in to stand in line until the almost creepy super-smiley girl tells you what number you are. Then you can order and go sit in that numbered seat you were given, and hope they bring you your churros. Me? The super-smiley girl made me go get in a non-existent line, then whispered us our number right after following us there. And I had to fight for my churros. The food came out fine but they really didn't want to give them to me. They had turned around an entire table (sit, eat, get dessert, leave) in the span of time it took them to get me some churros. And it was not busy, and there was not a churro shortage as plates of them kept passing me by. And it wasn't like i sat there and did nothing. I asked the servers about my churros but they kept blowing me off.  In the end, I got my churros from the manager only after demanding them at the counter. And they were delicious.
