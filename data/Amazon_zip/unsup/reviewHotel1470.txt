We stayed her one night and it was a great decision. Phenomenal location, we walked to everything. The room was nice, with a comfy bed. Good room service, with an unbelievably kind and accommodating staff. We would stay again for sure just for the location. It's an Added bonus for the suburban people that can just take the L down there and save the $49 a day valet fee.
