Fries & beer. 2 of my most favorite things.  After a short stint working in Belgium, I fell in love in with Leffe Brune and could not find it anywhere stateside (the Blonde seems to be more popular). So, after hearing that Hopleaf had some of the best fries (w/ aioli) and my Leffe Brune on DRAFT I had to check it out. With the wall of different glasses (for each type of beer) and the fries in the oversized paper cones - this bar would make a Belgian proud. Service was great and we were able to find a seat in the bar area right away. I was not really blown away with the mussels but I really did not come for that anyways. Slightly pricier compared to your typical neignborhood bar, but for great beer and a casual night out I would highly recommend. I just wish this place was closer.
