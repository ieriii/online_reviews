For my Cumpleanos!!! I wanted good beer, good food, and a fun and lively place...This place was perfect for just that. Great selection I must say to the person that choose this(Myself) :) Went yesterday, which was a Thursday night, I knew it was going to be a busy night due to it being kareokee. The wait was only 30-40 min at 8pm. Perfect for slamming to pitchers (Goldern arm = delic and Fornicator = delic but a lil heavier) I stuck w/ Golden arm bc my whole intent was 2 booze and still have room to eat some pie! Got seated w/in the timeframe and went with two apps right off the bat.  Goat cheese and Spinach tomato. Both were decent and of good quality. In the meantime 2 more pitchers were taken down w/in our party. The place was packed and hands down our waitor was nothing but great! He was quick on the refills of non-acholic beverages and making sure we had enough beer to drink. The food came out in a very reasonable time for how busy they were actually. Ordered one red w/ sausage and half of it w/ mushroom. Then one white w/ fresh tomatoe, broccoli, and ricotta.  Both pizzas rocked! The ingredients were super fresh, I really really liked the white pizza. It was tasty but light at the sametime.  It was a great thin crust Za w/ great crispy crust!! They also offer different, unique and funky ingredients to get on your own pizza. Which kinda fits the neighborhood that it is located in. "Pizza w/ a lil edge"...Just another great restaurant in my fav neighb in the city!
