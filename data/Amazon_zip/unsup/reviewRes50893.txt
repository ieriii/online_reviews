This place is good but not AS good as everyone had warned me about. I think it's because I measure how good a diner is by how good their pancakes are and I wasn't very impressed with Wishbone's cakes. The Denver Omelet I had was pretty good. Big chunks of sausage and the cheese distribution was perfect. Our waiter suggested next time to substitute the cheese with cream cheese.. it's supposed to be amazing that way. This place serves grits. Enough said there. This place does NOT serve corn beef hash. Enough said here. I really liked our server. I've actually been here twice and placed with the same server both times. He was pretty friendly, gave me free coffee.. 3 cups of free coffee. Downside of Wishbone is the long wait (especially weekends) and price. Food IS good don't get me wrong but I think I have had better for less.
