ok so all i have to say is ARRRIIIBBAAA i love this place i am hispanic and have not really tried too many spanish resturants here in chicago ( i am from NJ originally) but if they are all like this place- i am in heaven. It is always packed so give your name to the hostes and relax. order the guac and a pitcher of margarita''s you will not be disappointed~ it is really good and strong! YUM! than order your food - w.e. you want. I usggest the burrito and get it loaded with all the stuff...you wont regret it all in all. go to garcia's and drink up and eat up! save some for me :)
