Dim the lights baby. Romantic date spot check. I would say the combination of dark wood, exposed brick, and unique lighting were elevating my expectations that this would be a great dinner spot.  We arrived and were not greeted (for what seemed like an eternity) by the hostess who was busy talking to the bartender (I even had time to suggest we go some place else). When we were finally seated the noise level started to sink in, the obnoxiously loud background music playing was terrible as all the hubby and I could do was stare longingly at one another trying to lip read. I guess if you have nothing to say to your dinner companion, this is the place to bring em. We started with the squash salad. It turned out to be more of a grain "salad". I wasn't a huge fan. When there is more grain than squash...it really should be called a grain salad because that's what you get. For dinner we split a pizza D.O.C. It was okay. We didn't have any libations, perhaps it would have made the experience better.
