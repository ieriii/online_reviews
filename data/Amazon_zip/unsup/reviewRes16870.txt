I'm very happy that the people who are in any way unimpressed with this place won't return. They can go right back to their classless meatmarket or their uber-hip $2 PBRs while I drink the best cocktails in the city. The best in the city. The bartenders are at the top of their game. They were hired because they know quite a bit more about their craft than you do. That's why you pay them to make your drinks for you. If that makes you uncomfortable, make your own cocktails at home or go back to your local dive for a hastily thrown-together gin and tonic made with well liquor. There you can feel much more at home steeping in the smell of urine and rat feces. Plus, you can definitely drink good beer or wine for $5 or $7, respectively. This means you can go with friends and not break the bank, although you do yourself a disservice by not exploring their cocktails or full whiskey selection. And the bartenders will make you a special cocktail customized to your tastes if you ask politely. This is worth the money. The bartenders are highly skilled, open to conversation, and will allow you to sample liquors with which you are unfamiliar to prevent you from ordering something displeasing. How is that pretentious?
