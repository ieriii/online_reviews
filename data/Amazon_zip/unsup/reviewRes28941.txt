I finally made my way to Frontera Grill one Friday afternoon with two California guests. Since this place doesn't take reservations, I knew it would be key to visit the restaurant on a weekday right when they open. We got there about 11:45 and were able to find seats in the bar. Seating setup is unfriendly for odd-numbered groups (seats were in twos and fours), but the staff let us push two tables together - saving the three of us from huddling around a table meant for two. What dismayed us was the LONG wait we had to endure for our food! I think they were understaffed, because the lunch crowd seemed manageable, yet we had to wait for 45 minutes before we got our appetizers. I split the Entrems Surtido appetizer platter and pork tacos with my friend. I HIGHLY recommend the appetizer platter. It lets you try mini portions of their quesadillas, chicken taquitos, ceviche tostadas and jcama salad. Because I was thinking of ordering each of these items for my entree, the appetizer platter let me try all the dishes and still try something else! My favorite was the jicama salad - it had mangoes and the tangy dressing provided a nice complement to the sweet mangoes and crunchy jicama. Even though we had to wait again for our entrees, it was definitely worth it! The pork was marinated to perfection. Featuring notes of red chile, pineapple, bacon and onion, it was a fiesta in my mouth. Each ingredient balanced the others. Seriously, it was friggin' awesome. I'm not a big meat eater, but I will gladly eat a whole bowl of this stuff everyday if I could. We were also served six tortillas so it's perfect to split. I will be back to Frontera Grill. I have to dock one star for the slow service, but seriously - five star food. Give me pork!!
