This place was great! We came on a Friday night after purchasing a Living Social Deal. The place wasn't too crowded and it had a nice intimate feel to it. Live jazz music filled the room and served as wonderful ambiance. We each ordered an entree and the staff was very polite. The owner came over and offered us a free appetizer because he thought the wait for out entrees was taking too long. The food was great and everyone was so friendly. This is a great date night place--a bit pricey but the rest of the evening helped us forget this!
