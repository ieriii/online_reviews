We were able to get a last minute reservation (thank you Chicago Four Seasons!) much to our delight. I've been a huge fan of Rick Bayless for years and was so excited to finally taste his food! First of all, the margaritas were awesome... and I'm very picky about my margaritas. We started with the trio of Ceviche. Ceviche de Atun "Chamony" was my fav. We also ordered the small Tamale filled with pork... which I've noticed is gone from this upcoming month's menu. For entrees we ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano and the Flank steak... both were so tasty and filling. However, I do have to admit I was expecting a bit more from the Mole after all the hype I've heard about it! The atmosphere was lively and we also had a great waiter... never waited more then 2 minutes to have our margaritas filled which was surprising since the bar was absolutely packed! I can't wait to try Topolobampo next time I'm in town!
