Went to the launch party of this hotel last night. It's very cool. It's a mix of Asian fusion. They have a sushi bar with delicious selections of different maki rolls or nigiri. The tuna sashimi was very fresh and delish. The rooms although small are cozy and luxurious. Flat screen tvs and feather beds are a plus, while the bathroom leaves a little to be desired on the layout. The only thing blocking the shower or toilet from sight of the rest of the room is a curtain that opens from the OUTSIDE. (Make sure you aren't here with any pranksters, or you could be in for a very embarrassing moment!) Also, the only way to close the bathroom door is to slide open the clost, which I find very intrusive and impractical. Not a great design. Some of the rooms have a small balcony, and they all seem to have an unfinished concrete ceiling which is clever and though not my taste, is original. There is a spa with several different treatment packages, and I do look forward to taking advantage of it. The staff seems friendly and do not at all have your typical snootiness in a downtown hotel. There is a steakhouse, but I only tried a sampling of mediocre beef. I can't pass judgement on that. All in all this is sure to be another overpriced hotel that will be a great place to "be seen" if you're into that sort of thing. Luckily, I'm not.
