I've had Fogo 2 Go twice, and it is absolutely phenomenal!the service is wonderful, and I can tell that all of the staff truly want to make you feel at home. but let's get to the food.oh, their wonderful, wonderful food!My favorite pizza is the Margherita pizza, which is oh-so-fresh, even after delivery!the prices are practically unbeatable for food of this quality.the only bad thing i would say is that once, they forgot to deliver our sides, and my dad called, and they were SUPER nice and apologetic about it. It was just once, and it can happen to anybody- not something to bump it down a star for!never been to the actual restaurant, but based on pictures and other reviews, the atmosphere seems lovely. RECOMMEND!
