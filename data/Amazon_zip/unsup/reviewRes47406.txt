The fianc and I went here on half-price burger Tuesday for our last unmarried date before our wedding this weekend, and we managed to stuff ourselves and have a fabulous night for a whopping $16 (I seem to remember our early-relationship dates costing more...haha). When we got there at 8 we were quoted 45 minutes to an hour wait. We decided to suck it up and headed to the bar for a beer. Before we even had a chance to order, the owner swooped in behind us and offered us two beers on the house! Score. We had just taken a few sips when the host came by to seat us, after only 15 minutes. Nice. The place is definitely loud, and we had to yell to talk over our long-seeming table, but not the end of the world. Major huge bonus - they give you a basket of house chips with some amazing garlicy mayo dipping sauce. We scarfed them in about 3 minutes. Our waitress was really attentive, and we ultimately ordered the Arson and the Boarder Patrol, and upgraded one side of fries to Mac and cheese for $2, with the intent to split everything. Our server warned us profusely that the Arson was unbearably hot...yeah, she wasn't lying. That one about killed us, but the Boarder Patrol was a good antidote. The burgers certainly aren't at Kuma level, but they're solid and the toppings are fun. The Mac and cheese was awesome. Basically just Velveeta on steroids, and I say that in the most loving way. For our second beer we had cans of some random beer for like $1.50 - can't go wrong! Overall great place!
