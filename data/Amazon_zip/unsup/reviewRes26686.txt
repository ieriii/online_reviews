I came here on a Tuesday night for the cooking class. It was my favorite type of cooking class because it didnt require me to get up and do anything! It was basically more like a demonstration. The demonstration lasted from 6pm to 7:30pm. After the demonstration, we dug into a buffet dinner. The PHO was OUTSTANDING. We were only given one bowl of it though. I really wish that were unlimited. The buffet dinner consisted of a chicken and veggie dish, a veggie dish, and a salmon dish. The salmon dish was REALLY REALLY good. The other dishes were only okay. But the rating comes from the customer service they provide here. It was sooo exceptional. The servers were constantly refilling our drinks. They even gave us smoothies! I tried the watermelon and the mango smoothie. Definitely go for the watermelon one. Afterwards when we left, one of the owners asked us for our names and thanked us so much for coming. He was such a happy funny man! If I lived in this area I would definitely come here all the time. Food is authentic and made with passion, especially that PHO broth soup!
