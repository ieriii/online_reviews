We got a great deal through http://priceline.com ($70 on a Saturday night) and got more than we expected. The room was super nice with a flat screen tv, view of Grant Park and close to everything (Art Institute Musem, A great sushi restaurant called Tamarind 3 blocks away, and a less than $10 cab ride to Lincoln Park).Only thing is parking in their garage was $37 ovenight with in and out privileges. Down one block west on S. Holden Street were 2 other parking areas one on the right hand side was outdoors unattended lot for $16 for 24 hours (we chose this one and our car was fine. Meter takes credit cards, most Chicago street parking does). On the left was a garage attended for $17 for 24 hours.
