Hands down the best Chicago style deep dish pizza AND lunch special in the city! Monday- Friday until 3pm, you can order a personal pizza and a soda/draft beer for a measly $5! You can't beat that! But let's talk about what makes the pizza magical. It's all in the crust! How I have dreamed of only devouring the crust! It will blow your mind! Everyone that I know who has experienced the magic of Pequods will agree. Also, considering that Pequods is also a bar, you wouldn't expect top quality customer service, but that's what I have gotten here. I don't eat pork but love pepperoni...turkey that is. I actually called Pequods and asked them if they would be ok with me brining in my own turkey pepperoni. Most restaurants have never obliged, but Pequods was more Han happy to meet my request. I was pleasantly surprised and even more enamored by the delicious food but wonderful customer service. Oh, they now deliver and even delivered to my home though I was a little outside their delivery range because they weren't busy at that moment. That's customer service at its best!
