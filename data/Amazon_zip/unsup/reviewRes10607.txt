Love this place. Tony Priolo keeps it real and authentic. The atmosphere is lively. The food is amazing - especially the Medit Sea Bass and all of the rissottos. Great service. I'm glad they finally found a great restaurant for the busy Grand/Milwaukee/Halsted corner. Thyme wasn't bad but Piccolo Sogno is great.
