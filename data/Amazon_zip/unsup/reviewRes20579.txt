agree with all the other reviews - it's big, dark, modern and sleek looking. yes, you'll want a reservation. yes, it's delicious & byob. if you do come without a reservation and plan to wait a bit in the reception space, BYOWK&G too. translation: bring your own wine key & glasses. they had neither while my friend and i were waiting on friday night which made for a tricky "grab a drink" and wait experience.
