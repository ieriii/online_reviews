I hate to review this place, because every time I've been to Garcia's it's well after midnight, on a weekend, after a long night of...playing monopoly. And sometimes after playing Monopoly for several hours, you sometimes are not thinking as clearly as nights when I haven't been...playing monopoly. That being said, I like this place. The other night I stopped in for 2 tacos (steak), chips and guac, and a quesadilla. The steak tacos were tasty, not dry or rubbery, and loaded with meat. The quesadilla was small (it's only $1.50) made out of a taco shell (should have gotten 2) with warm, melted, flavorful cheese. The second time we went we got nachos covered in beans, cheese, guac, and sour cream. Very good. At the end, we actually ran out of chips. "How often does that happen?" I could be way off base, like I said, I had been playing Monopoly at a friends house before going to a show, and then played Monopoly while at the show (Bloc Party-Aweseome), so maybe my senses were a little off, but everything was very delicious.
