This might be a little biased as during my first trip to Chicago, this place was recommended to me by the awesome staff at Equinox. Thus, it's technically my first Chicago deep dish ever. Nonetheless, Pequod's is ridiculously good for a deep dish pizza. I'm a die hard thin crust lover, but Pequod's made me think twice. I decided to order a small deep dish sausage and mushroom for myself. Good lord, I could barely finish 3/4 of my pizza. Great thick crust with a nice touch of crunchiness at the bottom. The part that really did it for me was the crust. It has a cheesy, garlicy taste that was ridiculously good. I honestly could just eat the crust alone. Great place, and now I have serious food coma.
