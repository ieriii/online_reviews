Followed Mike K's lead on the ribs + salad + pasta for $9.99. Boy, am I glad I followed that lead. It was a sweet deal like insider trading! The ribs were so tender, sweet, perhaps there was touch of honey to the sauce. Really can't go wrong with this special! Go now! Well, between Sun -Th. Oh, deep dish was not too bad as well. One of the better ones I've had in the Chi.
