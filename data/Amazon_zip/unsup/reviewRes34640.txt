Good classic breakfast that doesn't include a stench of grease or dessert horribly disguised as breakfast. I'm glad I went here before reading about other people's experiences. Maybe going later on a weekday morning was a wise choice. I was seriously impressed with this place from start to finish. The decor is nice and bright and puts off an aura of freshness to the place. Open kitchen is another HUGE bonus (we all like to see where our food is coming from). Our waiter was an art school student with excellent charisma. He was very attentive and offered good suggestions. The menu is overwhelming but as someone who doesn't eat meat, I appreciate the options. My bf and I shared the South Beach Delight which includes a half pineapple filled with diced fruit, yogurt, and granola. A choice of their homemade muffins came with it, the orange cranberry was flavorful and served warm enough for butter to melt on it. YUM! I have the scrambler option with their well-seasoned red potatoes and delicious pancakes. Some may think all cakes are the same but these had an honest, kind of malted flavor that made them tasty without being bathed in syrup. I tried their strawberry-orange juice to drink....sooo good with chunks of strawberry! This may seem random but I like how the decor flowed into the bathrooms. It just shows that they put some thought into this place and made the concept flow. Parking in the garage next door is only $5 with validation!
