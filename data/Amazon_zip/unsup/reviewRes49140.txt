First of all, note that i am rating this place for the breakfast only, and NOT the cheese/wine. We got a voucher to eat breakfast here, so of course we took advantage. We had orange juice with our prosciutto eggs benedict and smoked salmon eggs benedict. I have to say that I wasn't a fan of either. Both were salty, even the smoked salmon one. And the home fries they were served with were even saltier! Blech. I left some of the eggs benedict on my plate and ate very little of the home fries. If you know me, you know that I don't leave very much on my plates... I wanted to save my appetite for the other goodness that Chicago had to offer.
