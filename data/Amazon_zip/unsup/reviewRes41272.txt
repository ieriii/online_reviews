it's been a couple months since i have been but saw some bad reviews on this place and thought I would throw my two cents in. This place is not for everyone for sure but I found the flavors to be top notch and on par with Tru.  The BYOB factor makes a great meal even less expensive while allowing you to bring your own wine and not limited to what's on the menu. Of course it's not really "underground" anymore, especially with dinner now with dinner service multiple days.
