On the plus side, food was great, so good that I didn't mind the price too much. We had reservations so we were seated immediately. The service was also good, not particularly attentive but quite adequate.Negative - the reason for the one star rating - the nauseatingly loud music. You can't hold a normal conversation even across your tiny, wobbly and cramped table. What is the rational for music that leaves you with ringing ears and a headache? I'll not be returning, which is too bad because I would have enjoyed exploring the menu.
