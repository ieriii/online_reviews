While I like the premise for this bar it could be taken so much further. A) Belgian beer does not have to cost this much. B) You should not have to wait so long for Belgian beer. This is a great place to observe chestpuffing twenty somethings sit in oppressively short chairs at dimunitive little coffee tables boasting about their international travels and Whole Foods, and skirt the topic of funds over a 12 dollar 10 oz glass of hops. It is literally the Same beer you could have at Map Room plus 2 bucks a pop, food is great at maproom as well. Both bars you have to wait for attention of couse, but all else equal Maprooms got it. Hopleaf does not.
