Cannot say anything about the food, as we had no chance to eat! We sat at 1pm, we told the waitress we had only 45 mins and she said that it was plenty of time to eat. At 1:30pm we asked about the food and they said they will rush it in 5 to 10 mins??? Seriously? So we left. Oh and they almost charged us the lunch. I had to remind them we did not eat twice before they canceled the charge. That's my experience here... pretty pretty bad service. Horrible way to gain customers. I am sorry as it seemed a good place to eat.
