This place is great. Was in Andersonville at the Galleria on a Friday night, and we went across the street for a late dinner. The service was great, and the atmosphere reminded me of a rustic, intimate Italian restaurant. The roasted squash and ricotta ravioli entree was absolutely divine. Perfection in my book. It was more savory than sweet, and the sage made the dish. I will not make the mistake of sharing dishes next time - I'm getting the ravioli all to myself. :)
