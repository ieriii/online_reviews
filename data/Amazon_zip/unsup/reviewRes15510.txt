went here 2 days after openeing and understandably the wait was and hour and a half, the bar had about 7 beers on tap, 5 of wich were their own. we tried all of them of which the porter and ipa were best, but none of them were too memorable. the food was pretty solid, ordered the pork sandwich which was said to be great, a pizza which was alright save for the sauce, I ordered the seitan sandwich and thought it was good but sloppy and the fries seemed undercooked. I usually hate cheese soups but a friend ordered a bowl and I actually liked it which says a lot. service was pretty good for being so busy, but our waitress kept touching my arm. we will come back again, but i really hope in the future they don't play it so safe with the house brews, i know you need flagship beers but give me at least one extreme to look forward to.
