ever since this place opened i have been meaning to check it out, especially since it is located in my old 'hood, logan square. i am pleased to report that i finally managed to get in there for lunch today. first off the place was busy! filled with happy, chatting customers, always a great sign. i ordered a coup d'etat and my gf ordered the anti-hero IPA; both beers were excellent! the ant-hero IPA was sufficiently hoppy and the coup d'etat was a refreshing saison, perfect for a hot day. for eats we ordered the tofu curry dish and the tempeh reuben with the blue cheese potato salad... the food was surprisingly good for a brew pub. hearty servings and made with fresh ingredients. the decor is very urban chic brewery. service was attentive and helpful. in the back there is a nice view of the brewing room. they also did a great job on the fixtures, i especially like the bar with the big carved fists raised revolution style and the matching tap handles, very cool. we wlll be back.
