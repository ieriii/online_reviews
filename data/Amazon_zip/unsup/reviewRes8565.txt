I love brick over pizza - in fact I really enjoyed Spacca Napoli's pizza...BUT (and a huge but) I will never go back there because of the way I was treated.  First, while we were told we had a 45 minute wait we went down to Lil Street to kill some time, when we go back after about 30 minutes they were very condescending and said they already called our name and they guess they would put us back on the list. We were a possible group of five and I said "Four of us are here so go ahead and seat us for four." The woman said to me "Well is it four or five, what do you expect me to do just pull up a chair if the other person shows up." I was a bit shocked at how rude she was - I said seating us for 4 is absolutely fine. We were sat shortly after a man (the owner?) graciously was giving samples of pizza and wine to people waiting. As soon as we got our pizza they made us move tables! We couldn't believe it. Right in the middle of the restaurant they made us take our food and wine to another table! They had apparently sat us at a 5 top. As soon as we finished our dessert they asked us to get up and leave because "people have been waiting over an hour for this table." WOW! I enjoy a nice, slow dinner with wine and all the works...Spacca Napoli is not the place for this.
