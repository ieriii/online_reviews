First off, there beer selection is tops. Were this *just* a bar, I would be more than sufficiently impressed. But it's NOT just a bar, it's also a wonderful restaurant. One whose menu is so full of deliciousness, that I have to spend the day before I eat there pouring through the menu to make sure that I make the right choice. Their brisket is killer, and so is there mac 'n' cheese, and everything else that I've ever nibbled off of someone else's place has also been dynamite.
