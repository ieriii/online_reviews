Was disappointed when I saw the torta come out - girth was fine, but length less than I'm used to deepthroating. But turned out to be surprisingly filling. The Pepito is no ito. No, hay Pappi que rico! The braised short rib meat inside was delicious and high quality with just the right amount of caramelized onions to complement, plus that fantastic dark green chimichurri-ish dipping sauce. Satiation. A previous time I got the carnitas soup which was delicious (tortas more filling tho). Great for Atkins diets if u take out the handful of lil chicken dumplings. Will def try other tortas and soups here.
