The people were nice and the food was pretty great. I had a chocolate chip cookie dough shake, which was a little too sweet for my taste, but it was nice and creamy and they put a layer of chocolate around the glass which was a nice touch. I had the California reuben, which was really sloppy but tasted good and the bread was especially good too. The mac and "cheeze" is pretty good for what it is, but I don't think any non-vegans would choose it over the real thing. I'm eager to go back to try out the rest of the menu.
