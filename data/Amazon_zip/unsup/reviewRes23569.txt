So I've been here twice and each time I've barely been able to move when I left. You really do get a good feeling of being somewhere in the Mediterranean, (although it being 75 or 80 degrees out and not wearing a coat would help a lot as well). The food is damn excellent each and every time I have come here. I keep craving the Greek salad with chicken along with everything else! This place is really warm and inviting, very casual, very fun. Excellent service, (especially since we had a pretty large group) and they are always accommodating every time of been there. Free valet, good wine, great atmosphere and excellent food.
