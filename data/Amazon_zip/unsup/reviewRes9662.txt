My wife and I enjoyed a great dinner at Sprout for our anniversary. The three course prix fixe option was well paced, and the intermezzos were just as good as the courses. The service was impeccable. We will definitely go here again. Recommendations:  1st course: Veal 2nd course: Short rib 3rd course: Chocolate
