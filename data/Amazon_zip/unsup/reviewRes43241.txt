We went two times already. We were blown away by the quality of the food and staff. There were so many dishes (I think every dish actually) that was excellent! What even made it more impressive was that when we asked then how long they had been open they said "about 10 days...our Grand Opening is next Saturday..." To attain such perfection when most restaurants are working out there kinks is phenomenal. Since we were so pleased we returned again to see if it was just a fluke and again the place left us in awe. We actually tried several other dishes we had not tried previously. Without a doubt, our most favorite restaurant in the city for the whole experience! The only slight negative are the desserts. Although they were very good, they were not memorable as was the rest of the meal.
