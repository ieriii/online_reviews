Very solid Costa Rican food (who are we kidding, it is the only Costa Rican joint in town, but it is good). We have mainly stuck with the burritos which are great. My favorite however is the Pepito sandwich. The pepito is basically a gooey steak sandwich with onions, pintos, and their great Lizano sauce. It is so tasty and simple. If I am famished, I will grab a taco tico as well which is an interesting combo of cabbage, ketchup, and taco. If you have a sweet tooth, the oatmeal shake is beyond compare and goes just fine by itself. FYI, this is a cash only operation.
