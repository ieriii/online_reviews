Well, I find that I liked this place the second time around (and years later!) far better than the first. I don't know if the menu has just shifted that much, or if the food is actually better, but I definitely loved my meal. We started with Ropa Vieja and fish tacos. The fish tacos were pretty expertly done, and very tasty. But I have to say that the flavors of the Ropa Vieja were just about perfect. I don't like plaintain, so that was a problem for me. But I can absolutely say that all the flavors were just wonderfully balanced and combined. It was just right. I had the tenderloin as my main meal, and I sincerely could have licked the plate clean of its goat-cheesy side. The meat was delicious as well, and the accompaniments (spicy beet salsa? YES PLEASE!) were perfect too. Simply delicious. Everyone else loved their dishes; I would recommend dinner here, absolutely.
