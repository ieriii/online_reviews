Visible Disregard of the Customer - Caf 28: What a shame. I do not think it is worth the walk up the ramp to this restaurant. Odd location and odd, consistently disappointing experience. Twice over two weeks, my party sat down within one hour of dinner service only to be greeted with what was not available on the menu from starters to entrees to desserts. From the quality and cooking of the food, ownership could have at least run to Jewel to get some groceries. The welcoming owner was obviously more interested in the next party instead of the one he was greeting. The woman wait staffer we had both times was detached. The starters were dull. The entrees, without exception from what I tasted, were without taste. Pork chops overhyped; blackened duck was sad. The desserts were rote and lacking in focus on details. The drinks, however, were solid but even alcohol was unable to overcome the deep and palatable problems of food not available, food not well prepared and the lack of friendly and welcoming service.
