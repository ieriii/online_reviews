The dining equivalent of organizing your desk, network tv, or elevator conversation. Just a hodge podge of banality. We ordered: Red Wine Overpriced. Pollo Arrosto alla Romana Roasted half-chicken with garlic, shallots, Rosemary, lemon, and olive oil with roasted potatoes. Bland considering all the savory elements. No idea why. Salmone alla Senape Roasted salmon with portobello mushrooms in a mustard brandy cream sauce on a bed of spinach. He said it was bland and a let down. What is going on? From those descriptions they sound great, right? But I'm not even mad. I'll try it again because it wasn't that bad annnnnnnd the atmosphere is really cozy and romantic. And our server looked and acted just like Charlie from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He even had his delightful laugh and sense of humor. That's enough for me to put on my eatin mittens on and hope I'll be smitten, kittens.
