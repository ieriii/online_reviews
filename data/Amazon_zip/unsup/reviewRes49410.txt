KIWI MOJITOS & CHIMICHURRI First time for both. And I want more! Kiwi is an amazing fruit, and I'm pretty sure no one has ever even thought to put it in a mojito. I have had several different fruit flavored mojitos, but never a kiwi, until Las Tablas. It was SO good. For an appetizer I decided to get adventurous and ordered the char-grilled baby octopus. I have only had octopus like once before, and it was in a seafood mix....so I really didn't know how it was gonna be. The grilled flavor was amazing. I would definitely order this again. I also got the Churrasquito, small strip steak which came with sweet plantain, fried yuca, and a potato. All of the sides were interesting and fun to try. But the best part was having two chimichurri sauces, one spicy - one not? I don't know if the other one is like the standard chimi flavor, but they were both good. I really liked having a bite of something with the spicy, and then going for the regular...and then I just kept repeating. The portions are large, especially if you have appetizers with your meal. You might wanna split if you're into that kinda thing, or you'll have a snack for later for sure!
