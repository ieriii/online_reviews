Wow, now that is a cupcake I would pay a premium for.  I've only sampled the goods at a recent YELP party, but they are head and shoulders above Cupcakes and similar novelty bakeries. ****added 4/25/07**** I finally stopped by the actual bakery on division. I had a medium iced americano.  Aside from being exceedingly tasty and a few cents cheaper than starbucks, I also had the pleasure of enjoying it at an alfresco table. The help wasn't as snooty as some of the neighboring places either. Perfection!
