I've called to make reservations for the group of 15 people to eat there. I've asked her about simple questions and she seemed she didn't understand. I asked her again and she got angry and told me " you come and look!" and she hung up on me!! Way to go! They just lost $400+ in business! Rude and unprofessional!
