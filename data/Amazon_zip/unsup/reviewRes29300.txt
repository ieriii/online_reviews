I was extremely disappointed at Bayless' Frontera Grill.. For a lunch of $30 per person, I would have expected much more. I had the Mantarraya al Cilantro (fresh New England skatewing with cilantro sauce), and anejo mashed potatoes. Unfortunately, the food gave me a bad stomach ache. I would NOT come back here, and am hesitant to even try out Topolobambo.
