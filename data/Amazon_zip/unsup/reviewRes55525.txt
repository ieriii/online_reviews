My daughter brought me out here one morning. It was a little while before we got a seat. I had the three apple brioche French toast. It was incredibly sweet and delicious. The prices are a little high but the food portions and quality is pretty good. I would suggest preparing yourself for a 30-40 min wait when going but other than that well worth checking out.
