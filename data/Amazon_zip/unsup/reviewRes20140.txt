I have been going to Coast at least 2-3 times a month for at least 2 years. The atmosphere is always great. The BYOB aspect makes your experience more affordable. The long sushi bar is impressive with up to 12 chefs working non-stop. The most important and best feature is how consistent the quality of the sushi is. Don't expect Japonais or Mirai quiality, because you won't pay those prices either. But it's up there. The Coast Crab Roll can be addictive. It is beyond good. I always get two. The sashimi quality and presentation is always top notch. This is a place where if you feel like being adventurous and trying new things, you are safe; it's always good. Also recommend the hokkigai sashimi and the volcano roll. Service is attentive but the wait can be long on Fridays and Saturdays during peak times because they have limited reservations. Nice thing about that is you can drink while you wait. Only drawback is that there are only two single-person restrooms, so you may have to wait to pee!!
