Very enjoyable bar with an extensive Belgian beer selection. The CB&J sandwich and the fries were extremely tasty and I loved that all the beer was served in proper glasses. This would have been a five-star review save for the rude waitress that threw a hissy-fit when we tried to pull up a chair to the table for a late-coming friend. The prices are a little high but that stops mattering after your second Trappist Rochefort 8, right?
