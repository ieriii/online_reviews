This noticeable restaurant in the heart of Andersonville will not disappoint you, but I am not sure if I would pick this place over Tuscany, Mia Francesca, or Rose Angelis.Calo's comes pretty darn close though. They have some good deals like ribs (full-slab) for 9.99 on weekdays. So compared to those three restaurants, Calo's is better value. I've had seafood risotto and linguine at two different occasions. Their white sauce(cream-based, but light) is great. However, I found my pasta and rice slightly over-cooked. Very family-friendly as well.
