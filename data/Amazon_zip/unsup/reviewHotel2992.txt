The location and the atmosphere of the hotel is nice, The rooms were comfy and great view. However, the service is absolutely awful and unacceptable.It was hectic and chaotic and not what we would expect from a 4-star hotel, let alone the W. I am a frequent patron of the Starwood Family and this was absolutely dis-concerning. The concierges didn't even know the area, nor were they friendly or helpful. And when I finally dragged out of them a recommendation, it was probably the worst meal we ever had. He basically googled the restaurant that was closest to where we were going. Unacceptable.   The Acura car was never available and the spa was not enjoyable. The bar-tending staff was rude and slow. The elevator took forever and in a elevator conversation with another guest, they initiated the conversation on how disappointing this hotel was and chaotic and relaxing. So glad I was not the only one! I wouldn't return with all of the great hotels in Chicago.
