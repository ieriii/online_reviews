I went here with "Chicago" friends. They led me to believe this was going to be some Zen like breakfast experience. I went hoping I could get some good Hispanic breakfast foods, because I was really craving it and nowadays any breakfast joint worth its salt will at least have one Mexican breakfast specialty. I ordered a Mexican Bacon wrap. It was a tortilla with bacon, egg, cheese, and salsa. I expected to get eggs chihuahua cheese REAL bacon and at least a fresh salsa. Instead I got eggs, American cheese, microwave bacon, and out of the jar salsa. My breakfast was dissapointing to say the least I might go back but Ill stay away from their "Mexican breakfast" dishes. That's better left to suburban mom and pop breakfast joints.
