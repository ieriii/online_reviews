While I was a fan of the lunchtime offering, the dinner is pretty darned good, too. I suggest not having lunch, or being young with a hearty appetite. The "salad" bar is top notch, with many different choices. I particularly like the mushroom risotto, seared ahi, oysters and the variety of salads. But of the course the meats are the main course if you don't mistakenly eat too much of everything else, including the garlic mashed potatoes, fried bananas, cheesy bread, etc. Unlike many such places, they have quite a few good cuts of meat, as well as shrimp and pineapple that are delicious.
