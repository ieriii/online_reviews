The food was...different... gud different if ur the type to step out of the box , like I am my hubby is more of the strawberry banana kind of guy soooo I dnt think he enjoyed it much BUT he did say he would gve it anohter shot, so thats a gud sign.It is a bit pricey, but im not one to care about the price IF the food AND service is right.with that being said SERVICE SUCKS!!! waitreses are very rude and dont seem to care much about customers (or the customers tips HA!!!) yea no, they pass u right by a million times never ask if u need anything EVEN when its obvious ur trying to get their attention, the soft drinks seemed literally WATERED DOWN which was kinda gross,but a male waiter did (4 sum reason,cuz no one else seem to have it on their table) set a small jug of water on our table so that was bearable...they gave us NOOO forks or knifes and I had a side salad! I would say try it if different thick burgers interest u,(like the pb, bacon and fried bananas one)skip soft drinks (they do seem to have quite a selection of beer and the like though) buuuut dnt expect great service and order EVERYTHING u want right away cuz u probably wont ever see ur waitress EVER again, that is until she offers the check :)
