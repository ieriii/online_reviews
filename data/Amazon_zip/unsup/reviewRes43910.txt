The food was fantastic! The summer sizzle menu is just right for a nice outside dinner before the sun goes down. The server SUCKED!! The server neglected to tell us about their Summer Sizzle menu which was prefixed for $20. One of us already knew of it and had to ask for it. We felt as if we were troubling him for the menu. I'm sure he's just another cookie cutter waiter trying to rip off their customers to get a bigger check thinking they're going to get a bigger tip. IF that works, go for it, but it's the kind of service that makes this industry look bad. The server also pretty much disappeared the entire night. We were waited on by busboys and the manager after a table next to us complained. Assholes like that need to move on.
