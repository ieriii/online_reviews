I love the food here. Their dinner combos are great. The employees are helpful and friendly and will answer all of your questions about the food. Good food here: the falafel, chicken shawerma, hummus, kefta kabob (OMG, awesome!). I haven't tried other things yet, but I definitely will. Prices are reasonable, but you have to pay cash, which is a bit of downside in my opinion. If you have to get cash out of the ATM they have in the store, your meal just went up $3 in price when you take into account the ATM fee - so, come prepared!
