I like Piece because of the pizzas, the decent beer selection, etc. I ate there recently on a Saturday after a dentist appt. at Damen North Dental (plug for Dr. Cha-yay!) and I loved how they had the individual pizzas so we could both get what we wanted on ours. I had the white pizza with fresh basil as my topping and it was delicious. Greasy and yummy and everything a pizza should be. However, what I didn't like was that the caprese salad we ordered had not quite ripe yucky tomatoes on it. I mean this is a salad whose basic ingredients are cheese and tomatoes, if you can't get one of the two right, maybe dont' send it out? Also we are in the prime season for tomatoes now, and what with the plethora of Farmer's Markets in the city, you mean to tell me that Piece can't find any that are deece? I was pretty upset by that. Also, no one really came to fill up my water which kind of sucked because I wasn't drinking beer, and was a little bit under the weather, but i just drank my husband's instead because he was feeling pretty beer-y and was neglecting his. I know I'll be back but for the love of God get some good tomatoes on that PIECE~!
