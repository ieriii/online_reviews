Its just ok. I start my reviews with saying, ive been to a ton of sushi place and reviewed mostly sushi places so I feel thatt I kinda know what im saying. When I get to a sushi place, we always order miso soup and almost all sushi places have good miso soup, this place didnt even hit the mark. SKIP THE $3 miso soup, its a waste of money, it tasted like vegetable broth. Other sushi places charge 1.50 for miso soup and this place charged twice the price and it didnt even taste half as good. Enough of the miso disaster The place was very clubby and dark, so its really hard to see your food. the place can seat 20-30 people, similar size to Toro restaurant. When I eat my food, i like to be able to see my food clearly especially if its sushi. I also like to know that I have some Japanese guy whipping out my sushi but you wont be able to see that in this place coz there is no sushi bar. I wnoder who makes the sushi and how its made. Is it made fresh or pre-made? They dont serve sashimi, i wonder why. Its really hard to say if the fish here is fresh or not.  We ordered the five o roll with the canadian bacon ($14) it was good and interesting and unique. Alaska Roll ($8), i thought that the price of this is higher than your other sushi places I could have skipped this. The scallop roll is pretty good and the star of the show is the godzilla, it was absolutely delish. Other places have godzilla and this place is better and bigger. In restrospect, 2 people could just order a godzilla and another big roll and thats enough to fill you up. We had to wrap some to go. The 2 guys beside us ordered just two big rolls that we ordered and they cant finish it.  There is not much selection in the menu. I would not come back to this place but I will order to go for the godzilla. Again, Skip the miso soup.
