Gino's East is an awesome place in its self. With being able to write all over the place and read what other people had to say - it's just a cool place to go. And if you're trying to find out what true Chicago pizza tastes like then definitely check out Gino's East. With that being said, I've been there a few times because my family is big fans of it... Me personally, everything is good but the crust is... not horrible but it's not good either. It tastes like cornmeal and I'm just really not a fan but some people like it. Overall, I give it 4 stars and think, for everyone, it's worth a try.(:
