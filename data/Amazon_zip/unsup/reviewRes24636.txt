Really cute place! Came here with a Greek coworker, and he did most of the ordering. We had the loukoumades, creme caramel, berry yogurt mousse, and the kataifi. While the kataifi was too sweet for me, everything else was SO good. The loukoumades are like funnel cake balls soaked in honey.. mmmm. This was accompanied by Greek coffee (my first time), which wasn't really my thing. Good desserts, cute cafe, nice atmosphere. Recommend.
