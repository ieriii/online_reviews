The thought of returning to q makes me fall out of my chair and begin having an orgasmic seizure on the floor. Step aside Smoque, there's a new sheriff in town. I went with a large group which allowed us to sample probably 80% of the menu. We got most of the apps, the pulled chicken, wings, both the regular and St. Louis style competition ribs, the Kobe beef ribs and a full pork shoulder. All I can say is wow. This place would bury establishments in Kansas City. I have three recommendations: 1. Do whatever you can to get some Kobe beef ribs. 2. Take as many people as possible to facilitate ordering the full pork shoulder. I mean, the chef comes to your table to serve it and pulls the bone out like it's a magic trick. Unbelievable. 3. Wear elastic pants.
