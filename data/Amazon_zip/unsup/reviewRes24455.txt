Had a really great late lunch at Iraza yesterday with my sis and a friend. A great place for vegetarian dishes and the like. The chili rellenos was fabulous! The best I've had since the grandma retired from my favorite spot in Pilsen. The Costa Rican black beans and rice was delicious. The host was great. Show them some love this summer! BYOB to boot!
