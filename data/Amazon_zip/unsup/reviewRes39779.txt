This place had been on my list to check out. Since Logan tends to be cooler than me lately. ;) My bf and I went to go see a 4 dollar movie at the Logan Theatre..when it got done we were hungry for dinner. It's 11:00 on a Saturday night. Where to go? Here! Guess what..every table was full. We didn't have to wait long. When seated my smile was big when I took a look at the gigantic beer menu. The place smells awesome and I love what they did with the place. Very rustic and a lot of exposed finishes. (I'm sure to be more green-or to appear that way) It's very dim with candles on every table. The menu is not that large..and it's a little pricey. My boyfriend got the half chicken and I got the wild boar sloppy joe that was pretty darn good. I also got a side of fries that were salty and nummy.  I would come for apps and drinks..maybe not dinner because of the price. But it is good. I really like this place and I can see why everyone else does too. Ohh..and the service was really good.
