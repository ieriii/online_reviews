BEFORE READING:This is for the La Pasadita furthest south, on the west side of Ashland Anyone who disses the burritos at this place, should get kicked down a flight of stairs. Best in the city by far. Yes, the overall atmosphere, decor, and operation looks like the work of a drunken/mildly retarded Mexican, but it's clean, and they get the one thing right. that really counts ....The Food Dammit.  Arrachera = Carne Asada= Killer Burrito. Nothing too complicated about that equation. You'd think it's some highly guarded secret, but 96.3% of Mexican Restaurants in the Chicagoland area manage to screw it up. How and why only God seems to know. All in all as far as burritos goes in Chicago, this is the standard. Midwestern transplants, who don't know any better, seem to be the only people who disagree............Just sayin'
