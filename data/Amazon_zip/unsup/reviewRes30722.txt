Nice place. However, totally full of themselves. It is a "self-important" steakhouse. I spoke with our server and she informed me that there were very long hours...and they could get a meal for 50% off. Which would potentially cost them several hours of pay for the privileged.  As someone who has worked in the food and beverage industry...when I got to new restaurants I pass ratings based on how they treat their staff as well. If the staff is treated poorly...it is added into my review. The food was okay but not worth the price. Service was excellent but I didn't like what I was told from my server. It's not her fault...I asked the questions. Food presentation was okay...drinks are way to pricey. All of my negativity is based on the attitude of the place and front-of-the-house staff more than anything else. I will go back and hope I simply went on the wrong night. For my money...Gibsons or Sullivans or Harry Carry's are much better by FAR.
