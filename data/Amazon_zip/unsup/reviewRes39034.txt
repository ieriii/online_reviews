Love this place. Been getting pizza delivery for the past 2 years and just began frequenting the restaurant regularly. Pizza is fantastic, but so are their plates. Their herb chicken is out of this world, and so is their Monday special Beef Stroganoff. Huge portions and awesome place for some home cooked comfort food. The restaurant is quiet and very comfortable. No pretentious diners and great to take your grandparents for an affordable meal.
