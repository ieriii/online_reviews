This place defines uptown, being here since at least the 20's, back when the area was known as Little Hollywood. The place got its name as a counterpart to Moulin Rouge (which means red mill and was popular in Paris around the same time the Green Mill was opened, which also had a slightly different setup then the current one). Prices are reasonable considering this is quite the classy place. Bands from around the country perform here for a modest cover (8-10 bucks) and the best deal is the Weiss beer. My favorite times to go are late on Saturday nights (Hammond B3 quartet!) or Friday nights (both after 1 am, it's either free or only 2 buckaroos to get in). Ted Sirota, one of my favorite drummers, plays on Saturday nights. Lots of booths and tables to sit at, although this place gets packed to the walls so don't expect to sit for a while until someone leaves. Or you can just get there early and stay all night if you can afford it, which could be a great adventure. Since you'll meet just as many out of towners as people from around the area, usually interesting too. I've seen anyone from Deadheads to people in suit and tie in here at the same time. Pretty funny. Did I say jazz kicks ass? That's the main reason to go here, and the place just oozes personality and character. The only drawback is that the bathrooms are right by the drummer and are kinda small. But that is nothing compared to the fun you'll have here.
