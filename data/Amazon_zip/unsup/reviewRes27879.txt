After a disappointing attempt to dine at Sable, we decided to try our luck at snatching a bar seat at Frontera. A bit hungry, anxious about time, and borderline grumpy from the previous venue, we were invited to order some food from a server that saw us perched at this end table (with lamp) and have our repast. Guacamole, casuelas with pork, and enchiladas mole came in good time and took up every single inch of table space. And we had a blast eating this delish food, standing up, meeting other customers along the way. Sure, I am spoiled being a native SoCal resident as far as Mexican food goes. But this was lovely, and most of all, memorable. And how convenient to have Xoco right around the corner for a churro and one of the best chocolate cappuccinos I have ever imbibed. I hope that end table is still there next time I go back.
