I'm amazed that so many people raved about this place. My sis and I went for breakfast one day. We were seated right away, waited 10 minutes for coffee. We both had 1 egg and sausage. The eggs,scrambled, were slightly burned and almost cold. The sausage was the size of a half dollar and no thicker. It was totally tasteless. I ordered toast (ala carte) it was cold no butter was on the table, when I asked for some it was ice cold. I then asked for some jam for the toast, they only serve what is in season so all they had was apple butter, YUCK!The price for this totally forgettable meal was $21.00. Ramova grill here I come.
