No, no, no! I have not left a restaurant feeling so unsatisfied. First of all, I was not impressed with the ambiance. A chilly atmosphere with no music, an expressionless waiter going through the specials with her eyes glued on the chalkboard. I mean come on! Make the specials special! My boyfriend and I ordered 2 pizzas. I rarely eat meat and we received 2 pizzas with meat. Our waiter failed to mention this topping during the most unawesome descriptions of the "best pizza" in Ravenswood. I didn't make a big hoo-ha about it because its easy to pull off 2 ultra thin cuts of prosciutto. No piggie! I mean, biggie. At this point, my excitement was declining but I gave it a good fun smack on the ass. I wanted to taste the most delicious pizza in Ravenswood!!! So I took a bite, chewed and swallowed. After 5 more bites the pizza was gone. They were small pizzas. It was over. I was not happy. It then dawned on me that I could have popped a piece of naan bread dipped in olive oil with a tablespoon of fresh grated parm in an oven too, but I would have enjoyed it more because it would cost me 1 or 2 bucks, not 18. What a waste of money and time. I'm going to Panera. They play jazz standards and smile at you. I can't get over that Broccoli Cheddar soup and Greek Salad "You Pick Two". I leave full. I leave happy. And yes, Spacca I'm comparing your yuppie Neapolitan narse to Panera. I choose Panera.
