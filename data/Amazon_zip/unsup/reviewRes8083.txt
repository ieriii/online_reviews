How can you not love this place?? Every time I come here, I leave with "the meat sweats." Not sure if that's a good thing, but it definitely means two things for certain: 1. Im gonna smell like beef for the next 2 days 2. I had an excellent experience at Fogo's! Fogo has the best Brazilian-style meat selection in the city, hands down! I have been here on numerous occasions, including my last two birthdays. You just can't beat the flavor and quality of meat they serve here. The waiters/waitresses have always been friendly and accommodating. The "carriers of skewers" are fast and efficient. If there is no meat of your platter, they are quick to come around and check on your status. The bar is actually cool as well. It is located by the front doors in a small area, but the bartenders are cool as hell and they have a heavy pour when it comes to making drinks. Definitely try the Parmesan-crusted pork and the smoked sirloin...unreal!!
