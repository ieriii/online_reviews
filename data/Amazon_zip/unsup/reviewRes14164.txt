90 miles is incredible. I'll start out the day with a cafe cubano. Then come back at lunch when I can,and grab a cubano sandwich or a steak sandwich. The food is very fresh. It's well made and presented nicely. The staff their made me feel right at home. They obviously know what they are doing. I really like sittiing outside and enjoying my coffee or meal.
