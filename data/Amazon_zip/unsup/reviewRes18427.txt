I really, really, really wanted to love the Bad Apple. It's in my area, it has an extensive beer list and claims to have incredible burgers. It's like a more accessible, beer-filled Kuma's right?! Nope.  The only thing that came through for me was the beer list. It was huge and well priced (dandelion beer?! awesome.) But getting said beer (on both visits!) while sitting at the bar was near impossible. We couldn't catch a bar tenders eye sitting directly behind the taps! And...I have to say that asking "Do you have any specials" and being told snarkily "Everything is special here." did nothing to warm my heart. Throw in mediocre burgers (not cooked to our specifications) and stark, clubby red-lit decor (out of place for a beer and burger place) and color me disappointed.
