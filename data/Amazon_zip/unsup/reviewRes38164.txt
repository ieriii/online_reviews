My buddy and I headed over to Giordano's and I was eagerly anticipating my first time eating Chicago deep dish pizza. Then I saw all the people waiting in the bar area and in front and almost reconsidered. ALMOST that is. Yeah I was told the wait was an hour (actually it ended up being 45 minutes) but at least they had the Memphis-Tennessee b-ball game on so that kept my attention on something. I was told to pre-order our order in 20 minutes so at least it would be ready by the time we were sat. When we got our table we ordered the calamari in addition to the pizza. Gotta love those crispy, greasy rings of goodness. Dipped in some marinara sauce and I was good to go. Then the pizza came out and the first slice was served by the waiter. It was great pizza from the flaky crust, the tangy sauce, and stringiest cheese. I could only down a couple of the Special but it was a delicious morning breakfast to have the next day. I'm seriously hooked on deep dish pizza now and can't wait until I come back to eat it again. Though I just checked that Giordano's does mail order. This could be trouble.
