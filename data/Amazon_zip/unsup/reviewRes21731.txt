Flavors just outstanding! Try the Hamon Quiche dish or Yogurt for an outstanding light breakfast or the chicken milanese or sopa caldo for lunch or simple dinner and don't forget the churros. Delicious. The ordering process is a bit convuluded but it seems to be getting smoother with each passing day and like I said the flavors are worth the wait and mild chaos.
