First of all I have to say the food here is excellent, however returning for the 2nd time with my family was a nightmare! I just recently moved to the area and went for breakfast my first visit which was excellent however had to wait about 15 minutes for the check after asking for it. Overall a great experience though. I was looking forward to trying out the dinner menu and brought my family (parents, sister, and nephews) thinking we'd all have a great dinner together. I was sadly mistaken. After watching numerous tables get their food before we did when they arrived after us and being reassured our food would be up shortly, after over an hour still no dinner. Meanwhile my nephews are getting crabby and other tables have left that were seated well after we had ordered. The manager only found out after we asked for our food to go and the check, which had not one thing removed from the bill and still hadn't received our food, until we explained the situation to him. Now I've worked in the restaurant business for years and know things happen however this was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Bottomline....great food, terrible customer service! It's too bad that I live so close and would love to enjoy the wonderful food but this situation was too much to forget!
