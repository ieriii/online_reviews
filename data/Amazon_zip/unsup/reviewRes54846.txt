Took a cab up to hopleaf on a suggestion from a coworker, being late sunday night we thought it would be a quite place to grab a beer and a late dinner. We were pleasantly surprised to see the place full of people when we found it. After finding a table in the bar we waited for service only to find we had to order both food and drinks from the bartender. The menu was was mix of quirky comfort food and pub-eats, I couldnt make my mind up, besides on the fact that I will come back to try everything I couldnt on the first trip.
