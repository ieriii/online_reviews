My stay was on 8/20 -21/2011. A friend and I had adjoining rooms on the 9th floor. I am in my 50's meaning I have stayed in many, many hotels over the years. The bed in my room was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, in my life! The hotel staff was wonderful and the room was very spacious. I was told I was in the old part of the hotel and that the older rooms are bigger than the newer part. I love old, so for me to see the original hardware, etc., meant a lot to me. When I return, and I will, I will request the same room or at least the floor. Love it, love it! Don't miss out on this great historic opportunity! In reading some of the other posts regarding the speed of the elevators...who cares? Really, are our lives that insanely rushed that one has to complain about the speed of an elevator? Life is the journey not the destination. I have to add this from a "fan". " If the elevator was taking them to see their maker, they would think the elevator was going too fast." How profound. Let's reflect on that comment people.
