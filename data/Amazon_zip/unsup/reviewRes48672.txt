The food is just eh. The raw dishes and vegetables - arugula salad, oysters, fish crudo, grilled cauliflower, etc were all good, but frankly with fresh produce, those are dishes hard to miss. The entrees we got were well below par - the whole fish and the country ribs lacked any considerable flavor, while the duck breast was poorly conceived with the smoke flavor taking over the delicate duck flavor. Far from impressive, but worth considering a re-do if the service warranted it. The service though, absolutely awful. Our server was inattentive and seemed to go missing for 30 minutes at a time. He failed to mention another bottle of wine would be substituted (ours was out of stock) until after it was delivered, not giving us much of a choice in a re-order. We also ordered the whole fish entree, and not only did he come by 10 minutes AFTER the dish to fillet it (as we were sitting there hungrily staring at it), he completely botched it to the point of almost being inedible with bones everywhere. I know how to fillet both raw and cooked fish, he had no clue! With a dish like that, flavor and execution are equally critical to ensuring the diners have a well served menu item. For beers and some apps after work, maybe on the company dime. But for a delicious Saturday dinner out, there are much better places for better food within the same concept (Girl and the Goat, The Bristol, etc).
