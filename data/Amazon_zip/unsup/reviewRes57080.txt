This may be a nice place, but we never really had a chance to experience it. They have a policy that if everyone in your party is not eating food, you can't be seated. Since half of us (party of eight) had already eaten, we were not welcome there. They wanted the eaters to sit at a table and the others to sit at the bar! We had some munchies in the waiting area and then left. I had the Workingman ESB which was pedestrian, as it should be. Very noisy place, accentuated by the pressed tin ceiling, making it nearly impossible to have a conversation.My opinion - the beer people need to take control their establishment from the restaurant management (maybe a revolution?). Won't be back.
