The best bar in Uptown and the best late night bar in Chicago. Great drinks. Great atmosphere. The bartenders and staff are consummate professionals. Go in early on a Friday to hear organ player Chris Foreman and get edified in the ways of the world by Mike the bartender. Cash or AmEx. Liquid meals only. Cause they're cool like that.
