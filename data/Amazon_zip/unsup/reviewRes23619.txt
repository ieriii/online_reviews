This place is good for savory AND sweet crepes!!!  I frequently crave the crepe perla (dulce de leche, banana, coconut and vanilla ice cream), it truly hits my sweet spot nice and hard! I swear that after I eat it I can literally feel the condensed milk sticking to my ribs. It is soooooo good and has the perfect comination of flavors. Have a cup of their house tea also, I think it's some sort of mint or at least I imply so since they have a leaf of fresh mint in the tiny baby tea cup. It really goes well with the sweet crepes. I also get the crepe de roma (capers, baby mozarella cheese, roma tomatoes, portabello mushrooms, fresh basil and baby spinach) when I'm in a savory mood. It is delicious, I can taste it my mouth right now. For a light dinner I always half a savory crepe (roma, and it also comes with a soup) and a sweet crepe (perla) with my dinner guest. And i add a cup of their house tea. I can eat in this manner every day!!!! You walk away feeling you had a delicious well rounded meal that won't leave you with food coma! :)
