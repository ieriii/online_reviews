Best damn pizza I've had in Chicago or anywhere. Period. Believe the hype, you won't be disappointed. The best thing about this place is that despite all the glowing reviews you see here, whenever I step into Art of Pizza, I NEVER wait longer than 5 minutes for my little slice of heaven. You definitely can not say that about some of the other pizza joints/chains in Chicago. When my parents came to visit me a month ago, I took them straight to AoP...no need to wait 45-60 minutes for a pizza in an overly crowded restaurant. Right?
