Marcat was an amazing food experience!! Everyone suggested the serrano ham and fig salad-- I was hesitant to give it a shot, but it was SO worth it. Yum! The Patatas Bravas were what we expected, but the Paella Negra, Shortrib Flatbread and Dates exceeded our expectations. I will definitely go back!!
