This was my 2nd dining experience at Sunda. The food this time around was incredibly disappointing. The sashimi was not as fresh so it did not melt in your mouth. The fried items were VERY greasy i.e. toast and jam/loompya. The rolls were decent but 1 was over sauced, forget trying to use chopsticks. The cookie sampler dessert was inedible, should not be on the menu...My expectations given the price and reputation of this restaurant were not met. Skip it, too many great trendy restaurants choices in Chicago at this price point.
