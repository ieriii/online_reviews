I'm an outsider who recently came to Chicago to visit a friend. One of our top priorities was to try out some of the most famous deep dish pizzerias in Chicago - Pizzeria Uno, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's. I would rank Gino's East as third best of the four. For me, it was significantly better than Uno, but not quite on the Lou Malnati's/Giordano's level. We ordered a bacon cheeseburger pizza as well as a sausage and spinach pizza. Both were very flavorful. The pizza did seem to be greasier than the others that I had, but that's no problem for me. I think the defining characteristic of pizza from Gino's is that the volume of toppings you get is very high. This is nice because a lot of times with deep dish pizzas, you are left with a huge chunk of dry crust when you near the end of the slice. It's a lot easier to eat the crust when you have lots of excess toppings that you can scoop up. And the butter crust here was pretty decent - nothing to write home about, but good enough to eat at least. We came here at around 9:30 PM on a Saturday night. There was no real line to get inside, but once we got in and ordered, it took the pizza around 45 minutes to get to our table. Pretty standard fare for deep dish, but still pretty long when you are hungry! The service was fine and the interior was okay too, although all of the walls and seats are covered in graffiti, which was kind of weird. I don't think you can really go wrong with Gino's - you'll get a really solid deep dish pizza and leave satisfied. But in my opinion, there are still two superior options nearby in Lou Malnati's and Giordano's.
