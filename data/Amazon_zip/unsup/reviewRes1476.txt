Could've done without the horribly long line after traveling nearly an hour to get there, but the dogs were good. Gotta love Vienna beef! Had a Chicago dog and split a Polish with my boyfriend. Fries were good. Don't know if it was worth the wait, but it was certainly one of the best dogs in town (and believe me...we ate a ton in the week we were there) Would definitely visit again, but would try to get there just before they open to avoid the lunch rush. Tips: Bring cash, don't go during peak lunch hours/weekends
