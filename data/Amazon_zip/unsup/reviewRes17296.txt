Five-stars! This is as good as it gets! This was my first visit to this North Indian restaurant located in River North. I invited a guest and we went Friday, March 11, 2011 at 7:20 p.m. I was so impressed by this restaurant that I had to "Yelp" it right away! The Decor: Well it's: Indian. Enough said. Starters: Complimentary basket of naan pieces with tikka sauce--delicious! Two pieces of Samosas (deep fried cone pastry filled with potatoes and green peas) were orgasmic! My guest and I really enjoyed the nice and cold Indian Lager beers: King Fisher and a Taj Mahal. Nice big bottles and beer glasses were ice cold! We had one of each kind they offered. The Entres: I am not an expert on Indian food, my guest was more experienced so I let him do the ordering: most excellent wonderful hot soups--mine was tomato. I give-up red meat during Lenten Fridays so I couldn't go for the wonderful lambs and chicken offerings. But the shrimp dish in the tangy sauce was unbelievable! Then he ordered this unbelievable platter of nirvana called Vegetable Thali. It had: spinach with cheese, lentil beans which were awesome, a rice dessert-y pudding, lots of different vegetables, white rice which I devoured immediately so I had to order another one which was brought out in a flash. The service here is like you're at home with your family. The hosts at the entrance were very welcoming, attentive and hospitable. We had about 6 different people come to our table. They were all amazing! I apologize for not writing down the names of everything we had--but the staff WILL bend-over backwards to answers all your questions and explain the menu to you! Dessert and Coffee: Gulab Jamun (golden fried balls of milk pastry soaked in sweet saffron syrup & served hot!) Very good and very nicely paired with their Indian coffee! I was very happy with this restaurant and would recommend it whole- heartedly to anyone especially if you're not use to Indian food!!
