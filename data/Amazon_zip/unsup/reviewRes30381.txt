Sunda is one of my favorite Japanese/Asian places for lunch, dinner and cocktails. Decor is spacious and sexy/chic. Clientele is young and hip or older and sophisticated. Personal food favs: 1-Sticky Rice with Kobe beef (comes hot, like a cooked Kobe Sushi piece). You only get 4 pieces per order but OMG it is glazed and tender...soooooo good! 2-Sushi is amazing (specialties are the best) 3- Cocktails: Yum! Bartenders here know how to make a drink. If you're going to pay for an expensive cocktail I say go as crazy and complicated as you like. 4 - Some sort of duck bun thing was ammaaazing. Think it was an app. Never made it to dessert....was always way too full. Good place for a date, friends and maybe your parents if they're cool enough.
