Well, I have to say I was not that impressed. First of all, in this day and age of lawsuits, I can't believe they actually bring your food out on 500 degree plates. I'm not sure if it's supposed to improve on taste or indicate quality or something, but I found it annoying as it made my sweet potato casserole dissolve into soup when I made the mistake of spooning some onto my plate. My steak itself was tasty but not exceptional. I had the ice cream pie for dessert and it was as tasty as eating plain vanilla ice cream out of the carton at home. On the plus side, the service was excellent.
