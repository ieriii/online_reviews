I'm a big fan of Sultan's Market, and have been going there for a few years now. I've never been let down by their falafel sandwiches which are capable of alone being enough to make me full. I've had the lentil soup which is also a favorite. Their chicken soup is good too, but if you don't care for finding bones in your soup then it would be best to avoid it. Also a tip for the rice dishes, I find it's often a good idea to get some hummus as well as Jersualem Salad and/or Tabboule for a topping on it. Gives you a mix of everything ya'know?

Ever since the city redid the sidewalk the bike rack disappeared which is rather annoying for people like me that get orders to go often.
