This is the best Korean bbq place in Chicago! I've been eating there since they opened over 15 years ago. Over the years they've improved a LOT in terms of service. Originally they didn't seem to want non-Koreans as customers and did not try to accommodate them, but after getting reviews in magazines and newspapers they've learned a more reasonable level of service. My family eats there often enough that they know what we'll order every time. However, don't expect first class service at ANY Korean restaurant. That's just not how they are. Food is #1, and the less than perfect service is worth it.
