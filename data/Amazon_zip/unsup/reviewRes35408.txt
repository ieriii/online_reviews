Would not recommend. Had chicken & pork over rice. The chicken had more bone than meat. The pork was really tough. Had the seafood over noodles, the noodles were soggy and clumpy. The squid was tough. Then the bill came. $13.70. We were told it is $14 to put on a credit/debit card. The people were upset that I had a card. They did it anyway. Service sucked. The neighborhood is horrible. They were mopping right next to us for maintenance. Save time & hassle, go to Chi Cafe in China Town.
