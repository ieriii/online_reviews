I have to admit I have a slight obsession with GE so I'm biased. My first visit to GE was my first foray into fine dining but this second time around, I'd like to think myself a little more experienced and not as easy to impress.  We came in on a Tuesday night around 7:30. We sat at the bar and drank and ate like royalty! I started off with the Smoke Monster-the only lackluster part of the night. I really miss the deep, multi-layered flavors of Lynn House's cocktails, this one was just missing deeper dimensions. That's not saying the bartender wasn't great, my dirty martini was spot on! . My BF and his friend picked beers throughout the night and every pick was delicious (they definitely have a great beer menu). In terms of food, we split everything so I got to try almost the entire menu which makes me happier than a bunny on crack! For our apps we started with the sweetbread hush puppies, kobe carpaccio, the duck satay and 3 pea soups. I swear I could eat those hush puppies for dessert! SO smooth and creamy!. I've always thought sweetbread was kind of chewy but I guess when cooked right, it's supposed to melt in your mouth! The pea soups were basically spring in liquid form. YUMYUM For entrees, we split the halibut with morel mushrooms, whitefish with red lentils and jidori chicken. Each entree represents a world flavor, the halibut (west coast dining), whitefish (India) and chicken (Japan). Who knew that jidori chicken is apparently the kobe of chicken, not me, but I sure was happy to learn that! The red lentils in the whitefish is made into a DELICIOUS paste, I could eat that all day! Each dish has a delicious puree...OMG, I think purees are my new favorite food accessory! dEEEEEEElicious meal! Yes it's pricey but it's SOO worth it! My only regret...not getting to give Chef a huge hug cuz he wasn't in that night. But don't worry, I'm not giving up on my quest!
