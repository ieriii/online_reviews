Tyler is moving to Alaska for six months to play a homosexual banjo-playing bear in a "History of Mt. McKinley" dinner theater show. To mourn/celebrate/encourage his departure, his friends all gathered at Ricochet's on Lincoln until the wee hours of the night. In fact, my own arrival was well after 11pm, thanks to a late improv show at a north-side high school and a very fussy baby. At around 1 am, when people had been there long enough to be polite and to work up a healthy appetite, someone suggested we head to Garcia's. And we did! Garcia's is wonderful for several reasons. First, it's open very late. And they don't treat you like late night visitors. They treat you like it's dinner time, and you're not a fool/loser/bad parent for eating your supper at 1 am. They seat you at a table, just like a civilized person. And even though you're probably intoxicated, and the people you're with are babbling about the quality of meat in Argentina and which days Hot Doug serves duck fat fries, you're given a nice napkin to drop in your lap. Second, Garcia's food is ultra cheap. I ordered three tacos, couldn't even clean my plate, and dropped about $5 on the meal. And third, the food is great. I've had a few different things there at all sorts of hours, and never once have I been disappointed. Granted, at 1 am you really drop your standards... but quite honestly when I eat at Garcia's I never feel like I've sold myself short. It's never, "ah crap, Garcia's is the only thing open?" It's always, "Oh, whoooopy! Garcia's is open!" These four stars are not only for the restaurant, but for the company. So if you're hungry at 1am, give Jim, Garrett, and Chris a call. Chances are they're already there, debating the subtle flavor differences between German and Italian sausage.
