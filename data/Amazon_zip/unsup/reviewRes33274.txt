Being from Chicago and of different ethnic backgrounds, I am used to influences from all over the globe in my mom's cooking and my own. But man, this place brought it all together in Romanian food. I had the short-rib beef goulash and my friend had the sausage stuffed chicken thighs with polenta. Both dishes were excellent. The host and all the staff were wonderful, but especially the host. He went out of his way to make you feel welcome and brought me out a shot of "Romanian Holy Water" promising it will help, and it did. Everything on the menu sounds great, including the deserts. We had the panna cota with strawberries and a delicious honey lemon sauce. To die for! We also had the saganaki as an appetizer and that was flaming cheese to perfection. I want to try everything on the menu at least once so I will be back! They also have outdoor seating which I look forward to when the weather warms up. Next time, I want to bring a group of people. They have music and even a belly dancer on some nights. I bet a birthday party would be so much fun. The next time you are on Elston, stop by Little Bucharest for a great dinner and great hospitality.
