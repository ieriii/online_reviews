I've been to Chicago twice..both times I made sure to eat at Ginos. How can one not? The pizza is hands down the best i've ever experienced. The deep dish is everything its said to be and more...and trying to explain why its so amazing is kind of difficult. So I wont. Tip: Make sure to arm yourself with patience if you are going during rush hours. The lines are ridiculous.
