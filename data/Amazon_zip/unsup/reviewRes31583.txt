I came here for a happy hour date with a few of my favorite ladies. Loved the decor and the service was great. All the servers were quite attractive, if that matters. Doesn't hurt, anyway. The apps and some rolls are half off, plus there are daily drink specials. This runs from 5-7 and it's totally worth it. The food is delicious. It was rather heavy for me since most of the apps are fried, but it still tasted good. I just can't take too much fried stuff. The only thing I didn't like was that salad thing that was also fried. Yeah, you read that right. Fried salad. Besides that, everything else was good. We ordered almost everything on the happy hour menu. The drinks are very reasonable and not watered down in the least. I would return again.
