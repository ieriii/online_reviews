Alinea - my dining experience was like watching a dramatic theater show and left me feeling a wide range of emotions. Excited, Anxious, Happy, Sad, Confused, Giddy, Disappointed (but not what you think though), Surprised, and in the end had me Raving about Alinea and wanting an encore - I actually went to bed smiling. I'm not going to detail every course because I'd be repeating other reviews, but will comment on one dish : Canard a la cussy, which is a puff pastry w/ duck breast, cockscomb. This dish was one of my favorites and least expected... because it looked "normal" and unlike the other progressive dishes, this one transported us back to 1906 Paris with Escoffier. Even the antique silverware provided for this dish is reminiscent of that time period. The service was executed with perfection as they make every guest feel important and special. It is no wonder that Alinea earned 3 Michelin stars and rave reviews - the attention to detail and level of service here is outstanding.
