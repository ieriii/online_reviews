This did live up to my expectations. Food was deliciously well-seasoned. I have never had mexican street-food. I wished a little that my sandwich came with a fork so I could scoop up all the pork at the end that had fallen out of my sandwich.  Saw Rick Bayless briefly. The line went pretty fast for us on a Friday night at about 8:30 pm. I think we were in line for about 25 minutes. I think we were probably lucky. Worth going at least once before you die.
