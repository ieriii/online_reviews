Believe the hype! B/c that does not even do this place justice. The menu is inventive but not overly exotic. They get all the traditional brunch items just right. If you're one such traditionalist, I recommend the breakfast burrito and a side of breakfast potatoes. So simple but done so well. But please do not visit TBR and not order one of their seasonal pancake concoctions or the chocolate french toast. They're hall-of-famers! They'll make your list. The pancakes and french toast are perfect for one person and even better to share if you and your dining companion also want to dive into an amazing eggs benedict inspiration or one of the aforementioned burritos. But if the devil is in the details, TBR really earns its 5 stars. Sure, you may have a bit of a wait if you go during prime brunch time; however, once you sit down, the staff is great, the restaurant is comfortable (one can never under appreciate tall ceilings with effective ceiling fans), the interior design is simple yet well thought out, and--this I delight in--the house coffee is Intelligentsia and the house tea is any number of varieties from The Mighty Leaf! I love when places have that sort of thoughtfulness and consideration. If you live in Chicago and do not go at least once a month, the joke's on you. If you're visiting Chicago, bump TBR to the top of your list.
