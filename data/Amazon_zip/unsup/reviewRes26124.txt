We went on a triple date to Mercat and decided to do the tasting menu. With drinks and the tasting menu, it came out to be a bit expensive per couple. But, I think it was well worth it. A few highlights: Drink - we had Sangria and then several specialty cocktails. After a big dinner like this, you think you wouldn't be tipsy but we sure were. We ordered a few pitchers of Sangria which we flew through. They weren't stingy with their liquor pours that's for sure. Food - so many courses during the tasting menu. At one point they cleared the table and I thought they were done. Good think we didn't ask for the check because the next thing we knew they were bringing the next course. It was A TON of food. Lots for us to try. A few of my favorites was a cheese plate, bacon wrapped dates with an almond, and lamb chops. I would go back and just order these they were so good. Service - the service was decent. It wasn't overly great. Maybe for a more upscale restaurant like this we should have had a little better service. One of the girls we were with had nut allergies and we told them that if there was nuts in the plate or in the sauce to just tell us and she would just not eat it. They brought out the bacon wrapped dates with the almonds with no warning and she was about to eat it. Thankfully someone at the table cut into it first and warned her. Close call! Ambiance - great ambiance. The music, mood, and lighting is true to any upper scale Michigan Ave restaurant in Chicago. Would we come back - yes. Would we do the tasting menu this time - probably not. There was so much on the menu the 1st time that it was overwhelming. But I'm glad we did it because now I know what to order. If its your first time maybe you should try the tasting menu. Although it was pricey, we got a great feel for all the different dishes and I think it was worth it.
