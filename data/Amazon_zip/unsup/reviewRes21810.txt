This is an institution that consistently delivers on its promise - simple, hearty fare in a fun environment.  Repeat...Repeat...Repeat. For over 60 years the family drive-in (yeah, I know, right!) on the far NW side of Chicago continues to serve great basics (dogs, sausages, burgers, fries, malts, ice creams, sodas) in the cleverest of marketing packages.   Only cash, long lines through the simple screen door to keep you from the inclement weather and lots of drive-in spots with retro (really, they are vintage) automats and the happy play of neon everywhere.  The rooftop signs are kitsch and effective.  My folks had their first date here in 1956 and I have frequented this place at least 4 times a year for the past 30 years or so.  Never changes, always polite people, friendly patrons (who know that life here is grand) and good hearty basic food. The prices are a little high for the fare, but not outrageously so that you feel that the family is capitalizing on you for their maintenance of a shrine. Superdawg should write a book on how to run a business well -- take care of your people, offer great food at a fair price, establish something unique about you and passionately take care of those things and you will be an institution, no matter what your cuisine is.  Bravo, little dawgie!
