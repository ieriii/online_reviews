Although they didn't have 5 beers that we wanted, they did have some great alternatives. Wait, really great alternatives!! We had some great burgers. I, personally, had the Elvis Last Supper, which is peanut butter and bacon. Btw, awesome combo!!! Ok, back to food and drink, the waiter had some awesome suggestions, so the drink was way great. I think I've found my alternative to Kuma's Korner, but not really that place. Ill be here for sure many, many more times!!!
