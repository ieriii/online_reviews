My favorite japanese/ Asian restaurant! The sushi is the best (and I am very particular) and the service is impeccable.The drinks are just as great as the food.I had a margarita special- it was a cucumber base w a kick. It was the best drink ever. I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed.
