This place was awesome. Great atmosphere - fun but cozy. The tables are a little close, so maybe better for a group of friends than a first date. But the food was fantastic. Creative dishes and everything had a lot of flavor. Plus who doesn't like sharing lots of small plates? We enjoyed everything we ordered, but the truffle egg toast is something I'll be coming back for. Friendly service and a reasonable tab - definitely will be eating here again.
