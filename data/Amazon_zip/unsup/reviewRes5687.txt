Purple Pig huh? Well that's a Bit off the Beaten Path not unlike the Atmosphere and the Tastie Tapas fare. Dear Lucas, LukaZ, Lukaz Sir(our waiter); My girl said just Today..."Dang Good Memory!!!" First Off...Know what your getting into. If your looking for that introverted quiet table for two in the corner...Go somewhere Else! On the other hand the warmth and friendliness of the staff and the neighborhood locals makes on wish you were a regular, even if you were just passing thru on the way to San Diego. The menu plays well into the hands of the few that think about the Adventure of skydiving, but have nevered pulled the chute. I'll leave that open to interpretation but I think you'll get my point. Tastly vittles with very few misses. Stick around for the Dessert! Not over the top...but so right to end the nite. Perfect Sync. The tendy indoor Euro style Barn turned Diners Hang Out is Busy, Tight, But yet not-Crowded. Contradictory. Maybe? It's just Hard to Describe. This is an Excellant CASUAL Dining Experience. I already consider myself a PP local. I guess once a year will have to do! See yah Next year Purple Pig!
