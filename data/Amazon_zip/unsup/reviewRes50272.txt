I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here and have never been disappointed. Furthermore, I've hit this place up in the course of a night out on the town and have always had a good time. For breakfast, I recommend the breakfast lasagna. It consists of potatoes in the place of noddles coupled with egg, cheese, and bacon. The honey soaked thick cut slices of bacon on the side are great for a group of 4 as well. I recommend the burgers and sandwiches as well from this joint. I haven't had the mac-n-cheese yet but plan on it. A good, good day for all occasions.
