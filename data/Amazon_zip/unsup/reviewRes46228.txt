This place is gorgeous! The layout is like the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove in LA on steroids. My friend and I wanted to grab dessert before seeing a nearby comedy show, but we were short on time, so we could only share one dish. They still treated us like regular customers: they brought us to a gorgeous table by the window overlooking Michigan Ave, and our server was incredibly patient and kind. We wanted the molten chocolate lava cake, but he helpfully informed us that it would take 30 min to prepare, so we went with the apple crisp. It arrived in record time. The dish itself was just okay: it was a tad too sweet, and the portions were too big, even for two people. Regardless, I left a note thanking our waiter for the good service and told him we'd be back for dinner sometime to try out the rest of the (impressive, well-priced) menu.
