I created a Yelp account just to write a review for this place. Little Bucharest Bistro is outstanding. I went there Friday (the 14th of September) to celebrate my 21st birthday. We got there around 11 or so. There were a few tables occupied and the live band was playing. The setting and atmosphere is perfect. Intimate and cozy. I'm not Romanian or even European and I felt right at home. The servers were very attentive. The food is INCREDIBLE. I got the Romanian steak. It was the best steak I've ever had. Cooked perfectly. My companion got the "Rata" Duck Thigh. I've never had duck so I tried it. It was so good. The rum sauce was amazing. Portions were great. I got a cocktail as well. Amaretto Kiss is what it was called, I believe. So delicious. For dessert, we got "Tort de Ciocolata" Chocolate Ganache Torte. It was so yummy. Everyone was tremendously friendly. The owner came by our table often (even set up our table) and made sure we were happy. He was so nice and funny. Branko, thank you so much! I will recommend this place to anyone and everyone I know. I think I used every positive adjective that is available and believe me, this place deserves it. 5 stars are not enough for this place! I could not have picked a better place to celebrate or have dinner in general. It was an amazing experience and I will be back to have more!
