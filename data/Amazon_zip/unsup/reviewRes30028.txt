I love this place! It is affordable, great to dine in and for delivery. Their delivery is on the fast side, usually under an hour. Almost every entree I have tried has been fabulous. I especially like their duck curry and I think their pad thai is the best in town. I order for delivery frequently and it is a great place to go with friends for good food at a good price -- it won't break the bank!
