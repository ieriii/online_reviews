The place for seafood in the Windy City. I come here a lot, mostly with clients, and you do need deep pockets. But it's worth it! Crab fingers, fish, salads, seafood, steaks- it's one of the best in town. Highly recommend it. Have even seen celebs here on a few occasions so it must be popular?? If you are with Europeans, be sure you pick up the bill so you can leave the tip. 20% or more is expected and again, it's worth it. Go at night, love it when it's loud and busy, a lot of fun. Big fan!
