I'm in love. And it's not the mint julep talking. Chicago Q is gorgeous. It's been said and I'll say it again - upscale BBQ and yet, completely unpretentious. The space is comforting and inviting. We had a party of 10, and they sat us at a large table in the private room upstairs, which was phenomenal. Our table was set up with plenty of homemade chips and delish homemade bread and butter pickles right when we sat down. I would come back here with a large group in a heartbeat; we were expertly served throughout the evening. You quite honestly haven't lived until you've indulged in the bacon cheddar hush puppies here. They simply cannot be skipped if you've made it through the front door of this place. I was lucky enough to be with a group of friends that were up for sharing, so I got to sample many different meats. The brisket is my front runner, followed very closely by the pulled pork. The pulled pork with a healthy dose of the Carolina vinegar sauce is sheer perfection; the dry rub on the brisket is so good that it's perfect on it's own. The St. Louis ribs fell off the bone with a mere nudge. And the mac and cheese.... oh the mac and cheese. The cavatappi noodles hold the cheese sauce so well..... the sauce is mild yet flavorful, with just a slight dusting of buttered breadcrumbs dusted over the top of the dish. As for the aforementioned mint juleps.... they give new meaning to "Hello, I'm Drunk". If you enjoy bourbon, order one, you won't be disappointed. If you're like me, order a "weak" one and you'll drink every last delicious drop. (I know, I totally just lost all my street cred by admitting I can't handle my whiskey anymore. *Sigh*) Chicago Q is the perfect upscale casual hybrid, the food is FAR above average, and the space is beautiful. Check it out, my friends.
