This place is terrible. I order take-out for clients quite often, and the order has been incorrect every single time. Their menu changes with the moon, so you can't even place an order because the menu you just looked at is wrong. WTF? If you like consistent service and well-prepared food, this is the last place to order from. Trust me.
