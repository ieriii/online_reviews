Amazing Italian! I'll give Mia Francesca that. It definitely has some unbleievably yummy Italian, and probably one of the best Italian spots in the city, but oh Mia...how stupidly crowded you are. If you're looking for a fabulous first date spot, look elsewhere (try Socca down the street! Perfect date spot!). It's super crowded and you will LITERALLY be sitting next to another couple. If you're planning a trip to Mia's, I suggest grabbing an early bite or a late bite (after 8:30/9, it's still crowded around 8!), so that way you can actually talk to the person sitting across from you! So yes, the tables are very smushed together, the noise level can be excessive, but the food is absolutely deelish. The wait staff has been nothing but wonderful every time we came in (and walked in on a weekend! Very accomidating!), but again, if you're looking for somewhere you can cuddle up and whisper sweet nothings, head the other way!
