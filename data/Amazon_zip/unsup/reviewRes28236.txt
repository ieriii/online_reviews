After all the hype, I was somewhat diappointed with Nuevo Leon. I didn't really like the area, and the restaurant seemed to have an old smell. We sat by the front door, and everytime it was opened, there was an annoying, screaching sound. It's in desparate need of WD-40! Our service was slow, but very friendly. The food was just okay. I wonder if I had ordered the wrong thing based on all the great food reviews. I had the Combo plate. The food was very cheap, especially considering byob. They even gave us lime for our coronas!
