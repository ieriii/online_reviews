The appetizers are amazing - I think next time I will make a meal of the antipasto or the mussels or the proscuitto y arugula (which comes with a delicious ball of fresh buffalo mozzarella). My pizza was delicious, but I almost don't need it after a starter like that. My advice would be to go very early if you want to be seated - this place has become a neighborhood favorite and is quickly packed. I'm looking forward to eating antipasto with green olives and working my way further into the wine list again.
