Went here for the first time over the summer. Sat outside along the sidewalk and I ordered seafood risotto. The risotto reminded me of eating in Italy - the seafood was fresh and the sauce was perfect.  We received the food relatively quickly and the order was steaming hot. We also tried a porcini risotto and the flavor of the mushrooms and the sauce mixed well together.  However, the caprese salad was less than mediocre. The tomatoes and mozzarella were not fresh. It was well worth ordering and pairing this up with a glass of red wine made the meal feel like I was in Florence overlooking a replica of Michelangelo's David. And the tiramisu was to die for. It was creamy, rich, and espresso flavored like tiramisu should be. Definitely worth the money and worth going back.
