I've been to Chicago twice is as many months and have eaten plenty of good pizza, but nothing that absolutely blew me away... I work for a food-related company and yet never was fed a classic deep dish. I was told by a Chicago native to go to Gino's as it's supposed to be a solid example. I know there are higher rated joints, but this one seemed to have some sort of history and whatnot. It just seemed like the thing to do anyway. My impressions were as follows: -Staff was nice -Service was slow -Place wasn't packed, but wait was long. -Food was decent, but not legendary. I love Chicago Deep Dish pizza, and this was right up there with anything else I've had and enjoyed... it lacked the wow-factor I was looking for though. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm going to go to the absolutely highest rated place in the city. I want to give it a fair shot before I decide Chicago isn't a pizza authority.
