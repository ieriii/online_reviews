My husband took me here for my birthday this past weekend. They really went above and beyond. I asked where the bathrooms were and the manager took me there herself. With my perfect timing, just then the food came out of the kitchen. The staff informed me he would bring it back to the kitchen to stay warm. I told him that wouldn't be necessary, i would just be a second. He insisted. At the end, they sweetly brought out a small cake and ice cream with a single candle in it. There was no obnoxious song or procession of staff. Perfectly sincere and sweet. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing. It was perfect for a nice birthday dinner, but it would also be really fun for a girl's night or any other fun group. There were some kids in the restaurant and that was fine. I don't know how they appreciated the menu, but then again, some kids will eat anything. Their menu is amazing. I highly recommend any and all desserts. They have churros there that I have been craving since being abroad in Spain, so I will be heading back for those (while it was my birthday, I limited myself to the cake and ice cream...) Thank you so much to the staff and everyone at Carnivale! I will definitely be back...
