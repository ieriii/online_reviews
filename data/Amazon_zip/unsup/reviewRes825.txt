Big big fan. I wasn't sure it would live up to its reputation, but it sure does. Bring cash. Be patient if there's a line. I arrived on a summer Friday around 11am, and the wait was about 30 minutes. Like everyone claims, the owner Doug Sohn takes your order and couldn't be more friendly. He's very patient and gives s recommendations to those who are overwhelmed with all the delicious-sounding sausages available that day. After placing your order, find a seat and prepare yourself for what's about to come. The food comes out shortly. Then you feast, and your stomach becomes very happy. Mr. Sohn announces two sausages of the week on the Faceook page and Twitter. You can also check their website for the other sausages currently on rotation. (Hot Doug's closes for vacation on certain holidays and random days so it's smart to check Facebook, Twitter, or their website beforehand to make sure you're not making the trip to this sausage mecca only to be disappointed). Many of the sausages and their accompanying sauce/toppings change often so you can visit Hot Doug's many times and never have the same item twice. I haven't come across a bad one yet. The buns are soft and fresh, but they aren't toasted, buttered, etc like Franks N Dawgs. It doesn't matter though because these sausages and toppings are outstanding (far superior to Franks N Dawgs in my opinion). While many people love the duck fat fries available on Fridays and Saturdays only, they are thinner than their regular fries. I prefer a thicker cut fry so I actually like the regular fries more. The regular and duck fat fries are great, but focus on the sausages. Glorious. Prices are more than reasonable as well. One of my favorite spots in Chicago. Highly recommend!
