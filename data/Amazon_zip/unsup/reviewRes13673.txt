Oh so good! Found this place from the Food Network's Diners Dives and Drive Thrus and am so glad that we gave it a try. It's seriously seafood based, but offered a good option for me as a fettucini chicken dish with cherries, raisins, and blue cheese. The beer options were pretty good, and it's a bit dark, but a pretty cool ambiance. Very easy to get to via the metro train and open until 10pm. My friend raved about the seafood, she actually dined there twice in the week before I arrived!
