I went here with my friends for Brunch on Monday. The wait was about 15-20 minutes and the place was small so we just waited outside. I had the Crepa de Roma (consists of mozzarella cheese, spinach, tomato, basil, mushrooms) which comes with potatoes (yum!) on the side and my friends had the Chicago Crepe and the Ham & Cheese Crepe..we all enjoyed our crepes..very delicious! The service wasn't bad besides the fact that the waiter initially forgot that we were waiting outside and seated a couple of guests that arrived after us before us (I guess we should have just waited inside); however, when we were seated, the waitress was nice and provided good service.. reasonable price for the crepes (~$9-$15)..the proportions were good enough to satisfy our hunger...I would definitely go there again with my friends..
