I ordered a stuffed spinach pizza. WOW this had a 1/4 Inch LAYER of GREEN, Tasty Spinach! Other places I Have ordered from give you little flakes of spinach....I thought LaVillas was an explosion like when Popeye would squeeze out the spinach cans on the cartoon.....And, they didn't call spinach a 'premium ingredient' as some other pizza joints do (charging double for a small amount). Way to go on the thick layer of fresh, tasty spinach in this stuffed pizza!!!
