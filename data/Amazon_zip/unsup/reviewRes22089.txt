We rolled in around 8:30 starving and pretty tired. There was a wait for a table and as much as I wanted to stick around, we opted to order our food to go.  I got the steak sandwich and an oatmeal shake and my husband ordered the steak and onions with Costa Rican rice. We paid the nice man and then went out to the sidewalk to wait for our food. A few minutes later my shake was ready and they tracked me down. I could not have been happier. I took a few slurps of that heavenly concoction and was instantly addicted. I want an oatmeal shake every day for the rest of my life.  I am convinced that the steak sandwich is also created by the gods. I added the avocado and cheese and it was amazing! I was pretty mad that I could only eat half of it. However, I got over that when I realized I would have leftovers. Hooray! Irazu was a pretty chill spot. The hostess and every worker there were extremely friendly and appeared happy to be there. We will be going back to enjoy the patio seating, BYOB, and other menu items.
