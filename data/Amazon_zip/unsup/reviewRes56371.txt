Very average vietnamese food. Fresh spring rolls are dry, too big and contain too many things in it. How are you suppose to put this big roll in your mouth?Pho Ga (chicken soup) is very different from the real one that has simmered for hours in a pot. Service is very average and the restaurant start to look like a mess at the entrance.
