Great location, friendly staff, great valet.- a fuse blew in our room, took about an hour for them to fix- air conditioner wasn't working at checkin, but they fixed it eventually.- elevator was brokien at the time.- all the drink vendig machines were sold out of everything and the ice dispenser was  broken.
