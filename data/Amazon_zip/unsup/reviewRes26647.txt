I kept hearing such good things about Peaquod's so I was really excited to try some of this allegedly wonderful pizza. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. Dough: Seemed a bit dry. Maybe they were having an off day? Sauce: Was just fine, but nothing breathtaking. Defintely had a different taste than most pizza sauces. Cheese: Ok. Crust: Addicting. Part of me wanted to cut off all the crusts just for myself. In conclusion, I like Peaquods just fine, but I don't see myself going here when I am in need of some pizza. The caramelized cheese on the crust however is a very nice touch to an otherwise average pizza.
