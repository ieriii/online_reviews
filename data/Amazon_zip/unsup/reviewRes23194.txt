Bleh. Decent, but dry, food. The family style dinner seemed like an ideal choice and, well, while it's definitely a lot of food and while the lamb was good, the chicken was dry and the vegetarian moussaka had a strange texture that was off-putting. The baklava and the phyllo in the galaktoboureko were also dry and not appetizing. The service, however, was amazing - I could barely take a sip of water without it being refilled - even as the tables around us filled. But still not worth $70 for two.
