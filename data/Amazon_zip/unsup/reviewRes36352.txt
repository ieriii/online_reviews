Nice spot for breakfast. The eggs benedicts and potatoes were pretty good, but I'd have to say the best thing about this place is the freshly squeezed orange juice! If I'm not mistake, most of the waitress's have European accents, which is pretty cool but can be difficult to understand what they're saying sometimes. My only 2 issues about this place is that there's a wait (45 minutes when we went) to get seated and it's more than what I'd like to pay for breakfast food. But hey, at least they give you a pager so you can walk around. I'll definitely come back to try some of their other stuff.
