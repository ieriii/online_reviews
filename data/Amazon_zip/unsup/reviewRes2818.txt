What can you say about Tru besides WOW? The only reason I could see anyone giving this place less than 5 stars is because it is very, very pricey. But everything else is simply impeccible.  My date and I got a collection which included: - Raw Maine Diver Scallop, Kumamoto Oyster, Italian Black Pearl Osetra Caviar, Preserved Lemon - Roasted Langoustine, Hearts of Palm, Sunchokes & Brown Butter - Veloute of Summer Corn & Leek, Corn-Herb Fritters - Canadian Foie Gras Torchon, Salad of Rainier Cherries, Hazelnuts & Radish, Country Toast, Cherry Jus - Grilled Loup de Mer, Braised Baby Fennel, Tomato-Orange Nage - Roasted Elysian Fields Lamb, Salt-Poached Potatoes, Petite Summer Vegetables, Lamb Jus - Gale's Dessert Collection - Complimentary birthday chocolate snack - Mignardises & Lollipops - Espresso The service is unbelievable. You are attended to like royalty. Even if you're not used to super-fine dining like this, the waitstaff will go out of their way to help you understand the food, the ettiquette, and anything else. They really are there for you from start to finish. The wine was outstanding as well, and there are some more reasonably priced selections if you're not a millionaire. But it certainly puts a pretty good hole in your pocketbook so be sure to save up for this treat. Seriously, the reviewers who gave 4 stars, I would hate to see what DOES impress you to a five star level.
