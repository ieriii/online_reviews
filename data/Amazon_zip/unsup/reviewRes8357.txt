I have been screaming SPACCA NAPOLI, every time we drive past this restaurant a) because its fun to say and b) because I've been wanted to try it. Try we did about a month ago. We got the special, and it was pretty delish. We weren't so much about the cold eggplant appetizer, but whatever, we tried. This time I was very excited to go again. Ordered the Funghi pizza... was totally ready to get my mushroom on...CANNED MUSHROOMS! Bleh. I felt a little jipped. The fresh flavors I came to expect after one visit, totally not there. The dough tasted like soggy bisquick. And... twas all on the cold side, despite the 5 minutes it took to get the pizza.
