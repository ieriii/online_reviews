Frontera Grill is an outstanding restaurant because both food and drink strike the balance of flavor and creativity. Big, bold, authentic Mexican flavors are given special treatment and enjoy superb execution. Let's start off at the bar. These are the best margaritas I've ever had. They're done martini style, premium tequila and liquor shaken perfectly with freshest sweet and sour.  The food is excellent. You can taste the supreme quality of ingredients used in all the dishes: fresh fish, delicious free range beef, juicy duck breast. Good enough on their own, at Frontera the food is accompanied by decadent sauces. Rich cream, fresh avacodo, cilantro, tomatillo, roasted tomatoe and chillis all delight the palette with the flavors of Mexico. If I had to fault Fronera Grill for anything, I'd say the service is not as good as the food. Expect long waits any night of the week, and on occaision the hosts seem a bit aloof. Servers are attentive, but not always that friendly. Frontera is a little bit expensive, you pay a premium for the celebrity status of Chef Bayless, but not worse than most downtown restaurants and the culinary delights in my opinion are certainly worth it.
