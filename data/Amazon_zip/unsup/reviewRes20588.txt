It's across the street from Millennium Park. Let me repeat that, it's across the street from Millennium Park. Let me know of another place with the quality of finishes and service at this price with a similar view and I will have a visit. Until then, of the places along this stretch of Michigan Ave, this place gets my money. Beer selection is nothing short of great, though minimal when compared to other Gastropubs (which incurs a $25 cab ride to Andersonville). But that's really digging to find something. Love the downstairs as well...
