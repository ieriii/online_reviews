The food here was excellent, and the service was above average. I had a rigatoni dish with Italian sausage and goat cheese in a tomato cream sauce. Delish! And while it's perhaps a standard-bordering-on-cliche at any self-respecting Italian joint, the warm bread served before dinner with olive oil and freshly-grated parmesan was nonetheless fantastic, as well. I couldn't believe how packed it was on a weeknight, and the flow of paying customers didn't ebb until late in the evening. In quasi-celebrity spotting news, Cubs announcer (and 2001 World Series champion manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks, for you baseball fans) Bob Brenly was dining there when I arrived, after the ballgame that afternoon. And yes, he brought his full-on porn 'stache and slicked-back mini-mullet with him! My only gripe about the place is how loud it was, and how closely packed together the tables were. But I suppose those are problems you run into at any Chicago neighborhood restaurant that's tucked into a long-and-narrow brick flat. All in all, a pleasant dining experience. I'd go back, but I'd definitely make a reservation first to avoid having to wait, even on a weeknight.
