Finally went to Big Jones two weeks ago, had the burger - it was phenomenal. Left me jonesing big time for another one. But when I went in today the waitress suggested I try the gumbo and guess what - equally impressive! Big jones is a little pricey for casual lunch time dinning, so maybe that's why it took me so long to finally get in there. However I am so SO glad I finally did. The flavors and the quality of the food at Big Jones are an exceptional treat. The atmosphere is really charming - it all works. Big Jones elevates the already lovely neighborhood of Andersonville.
