I have been a Superdawg fan ever since trying my first dawg at a Temple Beth Israel luncheon back in my childhood. I was lucky enough to be friends with one of the Berman grandkids (the place is still owned by the Bermans today) and these great people sure know how to keep their customers happy and well fed. I have tried almost everything on the menu -- my favorites being the Superdawg (of course) and the Grilled Cheese Sandwich, which I always get on dark pumpernickel bread with a thick filling of heavenly cheddar cheese. I am drooling just thinking about it. The place is pretty vegetarian friendly -- my dad used to tell a story about an Indian guy that he worked with who always ordered "Superdawg with everything -- no dawg". :-) The ambiance is great, especially when it's nice out and you can enjoy the weather with the windows rolled down. A definite stop whenever we are on our way to or from O'Hare. Also, a great place to stop if you're looking for some winter fun -- there's a forest preserve across the street with tobaggon runs and hills good for sledding. We'd pop over to Superdawg for hot chocolate afterwards. Such great memories at this place! :-)
