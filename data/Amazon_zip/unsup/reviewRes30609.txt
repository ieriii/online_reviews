Nana is located on Chicago's South Side near US Cellular Field, sort of in a weird place, but it makes parking easy and it is really a gem. The interior is clean and modern, with nice hearty wood tables and metallic accents, yet still cozy. I went here with my mom for her birthday, and I cannot stop thinking about the lunch we had there. We started off with cocktails (at noon, yes). My mom had a citrusy one that was made with yuzu, and mine was all kinds of berries and gin. They were delightful and we both had two. For the main course I had what they called a quesadilla stuffed with truffles....anything with truffles has be sold. These weren't traditional quesadillas--the "tortilla" part was rather dense and obviously homemade, and also stuffed with cheese and garnished with veggies. What I really want to talk about here is the dessert, however. We got their play on a funnel cake, that came complete with a glass of champagne. That we definitely didn't need so early in the day, but it was birthday, so why not? The combo was amazing and really finished the lunch off with a bang.
