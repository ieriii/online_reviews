Great beer selection. How do they get all those glasses straight!?! I just ate appetizers but they were all very yummy. The goat cheese pie was very tasty. Mussels delicious and plentiful. The aioli sauce with the onion rings and french fries were addictive. Very good. I would have given it five stars if they actually had service in the front of the bar, but we had to get our own beers and order from the bar. Really crowded, is the upstairs open?
