So I feel really bad about only giving Violet Hour three stars, since it's one of my fave bars, but the experience we recently had actually borders on 2.5 stars. I came here Friday night with a group of four. Luckily, we didn't have to wait more than a few minutes. We got a table next to the fireplace and my girlfriend swears there was a faint smell of vomit. I can't vouch for this since I'm sick and stuffy, but I'll go with her sniffing expertise. I love the drinks at Violet Hour....it's an experience. I love the vibe. It's romantic and intimate and I feel like it's Alice in Wonderland. However, the service is just awful and it kind of killed our experience. It took our waitress forever to come take our order and it took her FOREVER to bring the first rounds of drinks. I really enjoyed their version of Dark & Stormy. It was strong and delicious. After eons we finally got our second round. It was almost last call and my friend ordered a beer. We waited a good 10+ minutes and still no beer. How hard is it to grab a beer and serve it to your customer is beyond me. So finally, we were ready to leave since it was closing and asked for our check. It was brought out by a guy and not our waitress. The never served beer was on our check. When we were trying to get the guy's attention to make sure he removed it, the beer finally came out. However, it was too late and we were ready to bounce. And he made such a stink about it when we asked that the beer be removed. Out of courstesy he probably should have left the beer behind, on the house, but no such thing. The opened beer was quickly whisked away as our bill was corrected. So unfortunately, just a mediocre experience based soley on the bad service. If not for that, it would have been a lovely time.
