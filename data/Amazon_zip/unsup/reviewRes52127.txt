Went at lunch time, didn't have to wait too long to get a seat, although if I waited much longer a large line developed so this was good. I liked the ambience and the decor. 70 minutes for our pizza is so not worth it. Again nice enough but nothing special and definately not worth the wait. Our appetizer took over 30 minuted to arrive despite reminding the waiter. He said hey it's not my job I just deliver it, not I'll check just shut up and wait. I don't need that attitude from a freakin waiter. Luckily I was with friends who i hadn't seen for a while so it wasn't a huge problem. Service: A bit rude and slow Wait:    Absurd, life is too short to wait 70 mins for a pizza price:   Overpriced for what it is Decor:  Great, open and airy Novely: Write on anything with crayons or pens keeps the kids happy However, you need to keep the kids happy cause it is so damn slow.
