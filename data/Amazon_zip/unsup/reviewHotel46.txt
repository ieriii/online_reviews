This hotel is OLD. Peeling paint, slow creaky elevators, dirty/scuffed baseboards, and ancient light lamps, wallpaper, and decorations. In my room, the walls actually had pretty sizable holes in them under the headboard and desk. The sheets were rough and I even felt the hard springs inside the mattress poking me a little as I tried to sleep. That said, the location is good (it's close to Michigan Ave and the Chicago Red Line stop), the price is cheap (even last minute), and housekeeping is phenomenal at keeping things immaculate, even if you don't leave your room until the afternoon. There was also free wifi, which improves pretty much any situation.
