I went here for Sunday brunch with two lady friends, one of whom was from out of town. I like Avec and Blackbird, so I couldn't wait to put another notch on my Chap Stik case. My first choice (I don't even remember what it was, but it sounded awesome) was out. So I ordered a waffle. OK, that waffle was the best damned breakfast food I've had in years. It was perfectly crispy-- in fact, I could hear the faint, subtle sound of crust cracking when I poked my fork into it. But it was the center that literally made me...um, kumquat. It was gooey and chewy and melt-in-your-mouth perfect. I never knew a waffle could taste this good. Seriously. I had a great bloody mary. I tasted both of my friend's orders. I wish I remembered what they ordered, cuz both dishes were goooooood.  I can't wait to come back here.
