I would say there's a tradeoff between food and service here. What we ordered was wonderfully flavorful and delicious, but service was surprisingly slow considering there were people at the front of house still waiting for a table. The waiter was not very attentive, only showing up to take our order and drop off the bill. I would recommend India House to fulfill a craving but a restaurant needs reliable service to become a regular feeding spot in my eyes...
