Monday night, my man-friend wanting to impress;) He picked Piccolo Sogno. We didn't have to use our reservation because it was open table, but we should have asked to sit on the patio because it looked gorgeous!  The service was perfect, we had a rotation of 4 or 5 people keeping us happy so I had no complaints there (And am astute enough to order club soda rather than a huge bottle of sparkling water "made by the mountains of god"). I was happy to be able to explain why I didn't want the Branzino special but rather the Black Truffle Ricotta-filled Pasta, because I *knew* it would be amazing, and it was. The flavors were subtle and authentic, the portion was perfect. I did not let any grated parmesan touch my pasta but did let it touch the wonderful bread which deserves a mention. My man-friend's ravioli was to his liking but would have been too much for me, we finished off with the Mille Foglie, which I liked but reminded me of cookie dough in a pastry, next time I will try the Chocolate Hazelnut cake:)
