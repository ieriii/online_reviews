I was a bit skeptical at first walking up to the place but that changes quickly. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and found a table. The inside is small but cozy with the food being cooked near the dining area and not n a seperate kitchen. The night we went, they had a seared scallop linguini dish that I had which was awesome! The scallop was cooked perfectly and the sauce left me scooping it out with bread. Service was good, fast and easy, waiter was a bit corny but did his job right. One complaint is that if you get bread and olive oil, they bring you semi-stale hard room temperature bread. If they had warm, doughy bread to dip into their olive oil/balsamic mixture that would make this place a 5 star gem for value, service, and food quality.
