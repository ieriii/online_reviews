This has become our place for pizza, and now for chicken. Been trying to do the lighter eating thing this month, so we have been on the salad and better foods deal. We have been ordering the Chicken Dinner here with sides of corn and garlic rice..Lasts us 2 meals, is charbroiled, not fried, and tastes great(like 11 bucks I think).  Cant drop my pizza urge, but orderd the Napolitana pizza that is light with Regiano(???) Parmesan cheese and basil...I tried it as a slice there, and loved it, so we ordered it for delivery this week..  Great food, friendly service, good delivery(like normally 45 to an hour) in this neighborhood..Keep it going Fogo!!!
