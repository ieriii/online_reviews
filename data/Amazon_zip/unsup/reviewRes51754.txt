I really like their recent renovations. The space is very attractive, open and airy. But I don't know what's happened to their food.  If I had written this review a year ago, I would have given them four stars, but the last two visits to Garcia's have been unpleasant.  The most recent time was for a friend's birthday. I tried to choke down my pollo en mole, but it was very dry. My friend had lomo de arbol, which can't possibly be dry, but it was. The previous time was worse. Although the food wasn't bad that time, the staff was eating something communally. You could see them picking pieces of something and eating it without cutlery. They were licking their fingers and digging in again. This went on for at least half an hour. Occasionally one of them would come out to attend to a table, or serve food, not bothering to wash his/her hands. Update: I'm downgrading them to 1 star because I went again over the weekend and it's so gross that I'm contacting the Health Dept. today. The staff was constantly picking at food in the kitchen, licking their fingers, and then serving customers' food without washing their hands. If you go, watch for it. I guarantee that I'm not exaggerating-- it's much more gross than I'm describing it. They'll even be chewing when they wait on tables, and their fingers are constantly wet. It's fricking DISGUSTING. So only dine at Garcia's if you like your rice and beans with a large dose of saliva.
