From what I've had so far, this is my favorite steak house in Chicago. The decor is very Rat Pack-like with circular booths and dark wood everywhere. The bartenders are very good with a great selection of wine and bourbons. I've only had the filet mignon trio (three smaller filets each with a different crust) and I have no plans on changing. Every time I've gone they melt in my mouth like butter.
