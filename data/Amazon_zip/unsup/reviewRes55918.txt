OK, Viceory is the best in the suburbs, but this place is the best in the city.  I have gained 3 pounds in last 2 weeks eating all that indian food. When i come to India house, i feel very happy. they do have some weird dishes that taste good, but overall my satisfaction with this place is good.  bad? there has to be something bad about this place right? Well its kind of expensive at $15 for the buffet, and then i had to pay for parking.  but its all good. love their pachranga dal.  (dal made with 4 -5 lentils )This location is MUCH better than their location in Oak Brook. So I have found my fav resaturants in the suburbs and in the city.
