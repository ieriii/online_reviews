I thought Amada in Philly had ruined me for all other tapas - but flying to the city of brotherly love every time I wanted Spanish food was really starting to become unrealistic - luckily Mercat right here in my own home town opened! The menu is wonderful, and on both of my visits, we had amazing service and even better food. The chef here trained at Amada (James Beard awarding winning restaurant) - and he is doing to same great things with small plates here that Jose Garces is doing there. The sangria is wonderful (really really wonderful), but they also have a fantastic grilled pineapple mojito that rocked my world. If the menu looks overwhelming, do yourself a favor and just order the tasting menu, you will end up with tons of food and the best stuff the kitchen is doing that day. I am in love with the goat cheese and balsamic strawberries off the cheese menu, as well as anything "a la planxa" style.  Beware though, portions are not huge and prices are relatively high (which is part of the reason I think the tasting is such a great value), but the food is really well done and I don't think you could fine better tasting tapas in the city!
