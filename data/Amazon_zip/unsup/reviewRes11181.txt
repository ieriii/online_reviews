Piece has pretty decent thinner-than-Chicago style pizza. The crust is nice and chewy and the sauce is just the right amount of sweet and salty.  Decent selection of ingredients and fast delivery makes this a semi regular place to order from. However, one time it was so salty that it was inedible. The manager was nice enough and offered us a discount towards our next order. I just wish...I just...wish that I could find a really fantastic East Coast style pizza place here. Piece just isn't it for me. Big sighs. The quest continues!!
