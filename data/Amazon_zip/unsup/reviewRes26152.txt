I LOVE this place. I have been here about 5 times-always bringing someone different-my husband, sister, friends, and so on. I love introducing new people to this place! Make reservations because this place has a wait. Very cozy and romantic. Come hungry-you will leave stuffed! Best fondue place hands down! LOVE the flaming chocolate fondue!!
