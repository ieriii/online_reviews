When it comes to Vietnamese food, I usually stick to the Argyle area. But this place has everything that I look for in Vietnamese restaurants: creative dishes, warm ambiance, and affordable prices.  The salmon noodle dish is served medium rare topped with crispy strips of ginger all on bed of noodles and fresh cut vegetables. Yum! We were also treated to a dessert plate of fruit and aspic. Double yum! If you're looking for some fresh Vietnamese food outside the beaten path of Argyle/Uptown, this is it.
