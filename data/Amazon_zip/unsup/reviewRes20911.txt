My favorite sushi place in the city. Hands down. The sushi is absolutely delicious, as are the salads and miso soup. The BYOB feature is killer, and there is no corkage if you spend just $15 per person on your meal. I also absolutely love the decor.  The dark woods and splashes of orange make it intimate and inviting, with of course an Asian flair. Definitely get a reservation on the weekends, and during the week during peak hours. I think I have had every single server wait on me, and every one was great.
