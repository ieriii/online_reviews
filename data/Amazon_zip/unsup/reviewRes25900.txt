Oh Geja's how I have missed you. Your dark wood interior with private booths are oh so cozy and intimate. Your cheese fondue is an orgasm in my mouth. The meats melt in my mouth and your mutitude of sauces are oh so fun to try. Then your deserts are amazing. The chocolate fondu with the toasted marshmallows are oh so decadent. Yes...you are expensive, but yes you are worth every penny!!!! When I went on my anniversary you even gave me free champagne. What a romantic you are Geja's.
