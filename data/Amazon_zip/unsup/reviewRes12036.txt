Enjoyable Evening Had dinner here with friends recently on a slow evening as the restaurant was less than half full. It was a hot and humid evening so we opted for inside seating. There were a variety of food requirements in the group (gluten free, vegetarian, vegan) and the menu selection satisfied all. I had the bisteca cubana and the portion was very generous. I'm a fan of black beans, rice and plantains and was pleased with these sides. I had the tres leche dessert and was a bit disappointed as it was soggy. Our group enjoyed sangria, wine, and margaritas with our meals. Our waiter was attentive without hovering and gave us plenty of time to chat between courses. The cost of our meal per person, including tax and tip was about $50 each.
