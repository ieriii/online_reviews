They have a ton of veggie options. Almost too many. I always get the spicy garlic string bean appetizer. The service is excellent. They bring you're food out as soon as it is ready. You also get a free pot of tea. The prices are cheap and the food is good. Many vegetarian options. Beware of fish/oyster sauce!
