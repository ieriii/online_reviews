Some important things you should know 1) the door is no longer graffiti-ed. It is just a white wall, but it's pretty obvious since the address is right above the door. 2) do not wait behind those stupid exclusivity curtains!!!! A whole bunch of us were freezing in the hallway waiting behind these stupid curtains designed to make you feel like this is a more exclusive bar. As more and more people cut us in line to the front, people started asking what the deal was... which leads me to my next point... 3) cut the line and go to the front and put your name down so they can call you. most of the people in line have already done this and have been called back for their table. (Wait for your call across the street at Big Star and get some tacos!) 4) drinks are 12 dollars. so stay awhile and enjoy it. 5) order the peanutbutter fried banana if you want to top-chef your dessert with some bacon sprinkling.. pretty yummy, but heavy. UGH. I had such high hopes for Violet Hour.. and was thoroughly let down. There was like NO interesting decor inside... the place was just full of wannabe hipster yuppies. My reaction was "this is it???" when I got in, so yeah it's overrated. Honestly my drink (Hush and Wonder) which was recommended by the waitress tasted like college frat boy jungle juice in a nice glass. *shudder.. yes yes complain complain.. I guess I just don't understand what the big deal is. I think people just love exclusivity and the IDEA of a hidden secret of a "speakeasy". Although the juliet and romeo (ranked by GQ as 3rd best drink in America) was rather tasty. I wanted to love you violet hour....
