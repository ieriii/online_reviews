After reading all the reviews, we went here for brunch on a Monday, no waiting. Me and the wifey ordered classic eggs benedict and some kind of spicy chorizo/jalepeno skillet. They brought out my english muffin with a side of strawberry and orange marmalade which was a nice change from the Smuckers jelly pack assortment Im used to getting. Coffee here is good and smooth, and I even gulped down an extra cup. (Damn you GERD, I'll suffer for it later but it was worth it) The portions are definitely big and we had to take about half the food home. Service was friendly and attentive, a big plus in my book. Its my new favorite breakfast place for sure. I wish I had found it sooner. Thanks Yelp!
