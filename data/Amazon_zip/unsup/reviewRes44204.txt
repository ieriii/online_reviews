Stopped for macarons. Maybe I ate em too quickly but the texture was a little stale. Wasabi-white chocolate sounded fantastic but didn't deliver. Odd flavor combo. 1 star Pistachio-brandied cherry was much better. I dug the whole cherry in the middle. 4 stars Chocolate-salted caramel was the tits. 5 stars. $1.50 for each cookie. Not the best I've had but A-Ok
