First. I am not a huge fan of polenta but here it is amazing. I love how they serve it on the board with the meat over it. Burrata is awesome. The octopus is one of the best I have ever had and the pasta with the egg in the middle was delicious. I wasnt a huge fan of the pizza but it was all good stuff.
