A friend tipped me off about Carnivale, telling me that it is her favorite restaurant. There are many other excellent reviews of Carnivale on Yelp, so I'll just say:  1. I agree! They've created an amazing, exciting atmosphere  2. Eating the appetizers was like witnessing a festival of flavors  3. I want to come back to see what the bar area is like at night. Enjoy the pictures. Hopefully I'll be back someday.
