There were some things that I liked about Yolk, and some that I didn't. I enjoyed the fact that there were high ceilings in the restaurant and the tables were spread out well. When I left breakfast, my hair and clothes didn't smell like a diner - and I can't tell you how much I appreciated that. The food, on the other hand, I didn't really like that much. I ordered an omelet with cheese in it and I almost couldn't find the eggs! TOO MUCH CHEESE! The pancakes were awesome, tho, and the price was reasonable.
