Hungry at 3am? Feeling like grilling your own food? This is your place. Went here with a group of three and really wasn't told anything about it before I sat down. Service wasn't good but not terrible compared to some of the things I read on here, Ordered up some meats and then something amazing happened. They roll out this cart with something like 20 plates and bowls of all kinds of kimchi. There was almost no room on the table after they gave us everything. They set up a grill for you in the middle of the table and you get to cook your own meats they provide. Get ready to come home smelling like a campfire though. Everything was good and I like grilling so it was a pretty cool experience.    TL;DR -Grill your own meats! -Awesome appetizer presentation -meh service
