Super yummy lunch stop before the Art Museum (which is just a block away). I had the Grilled Wagyu Sirloin salad with tart Apple, radishes, aged cheddar, mixed greens, and smoked shallot vinaigrette...it also had some kind of savory meyer lemon jelly on the steak which I really want to recreate.  The rest of the crew ordered the half sandwich/soup combo which everyone raved about. Also, great pickles! What I love about places like this is that you can get a really nice, beautiful meal without feeling like you're going to interrupt someone's fancy meal by having a baby with you. There was a very diverse clientele here which was great for us! They were super nice, especially to the baby. And yes, they do have high chairs!
