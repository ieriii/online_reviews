Not really my kind of place at all. I was out of place there in fact. I felt like I went down the rabbit hole and some how got lost in wonderland. The really high backed chairs were rather uncomfortable and the service wasn't anything spectacular. More a novelty than anything. It preys on those trying to be desperately hip. I'll pass and save my money for beer at a real bar than pay twice as much here.
