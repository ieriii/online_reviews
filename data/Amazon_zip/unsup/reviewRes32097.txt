I just took my father-in-law to the Chicago Diner since we both don't eat meat, and I thought it was fair. He had a polenta dish and loved it, and I had the mushroom caesar wrap and didn't care for it. I was hoping for LOTS of mushrooms, but instead got lots of seitan. Boring. I did, however, LOVE our waiter. In fact, all of the wait staff seemed like they really enjoyed their jobs! I guess I should give it another shot and try something that you all suggested in your reviews.
