We, 5 of us -- all girls, ate here last nite. There's no doubt that the food was fantastic; however, the portion was extremely small. We all left the restaurant with a half-full stomach -- in which at one point we were thinking to head to Chinatown for a bowl of wonton noodle soup. We all wish we did head to Chinatown for the noodle soup cuz it was no fun driving home hungry. I chowed down half a bag of potato chips before heading to bed. Not healthy at all!!! We had the $30 prix fixe dinner -- the price is good. For starter, 3 of us had the soup du jour - four mushroom soup and 2 of us had the poached pear salad. For entree, we all had the braised beef short rib. For desserts, 2 of us had the bread pudding and 3 of us had the apple quince. Again, we were all very pleased with the taste but we all wish they would feed us a bit more -- esp. we were usually not a big-eater to begin with. Minor detail -- I would suggest them to invest on installing a screen door. It was freezing cold every time when someone open the door. We didn't take advantage of the BYOB. We could've easily bought wines at the corner store but we decided not to since we were way too lazy to walk out in the cold plus we all need to work the next day. $5 corkage fee per bottle is a bit stiff but still not too bad of a deal. I personally will definitely go back again but it has to be on a absolutely-not-hungry day.
