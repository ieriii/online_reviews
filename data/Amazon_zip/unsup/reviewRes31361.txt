This place was such a find. I was recommended to Nana's by a friend that knows I'm always on the lookout for delicious and fun new places... and this one lived up to the hype. My friends each had the Nanadict, an omelet and the French toast... I had the chicken sandwich. ALL , just soo good. The service was great too. The gentleman who served us was very cool and very attentive.  We'll be back!
