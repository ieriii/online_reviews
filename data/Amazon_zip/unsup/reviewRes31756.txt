Yesterday a friend and I went to Nana for breakfast--her first time and my fourth. I was really disappointed in my English muffin sandwich--and this was the 3rd time I've ordered it, so obviously I'd loved it in the past. The chorizo was extremely salty, the side of arugula was at least half wilted, yellow, yucky and the potatoes, usually fabulous, were over done. Has the Michelin recommendation gone to Nana's head?
