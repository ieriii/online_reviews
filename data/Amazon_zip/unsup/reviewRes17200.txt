I went to an event held in the upstairs private room and cannot wait to go back for dinner. Seriously, from the drinks to the passed appetizers to the buffet of tasty treats, they know how to throw a shin-dig. Every table in the area had chips and guac (so good and greasy) and the appetizers were not your standard fare. Lamb chops (mini), fried plantains topped with ground beef, shrimp in a mango sauce, chicken in another heavenly sauce, a tuna tartar on something else (but this time I was a little tipsy and not able to remember all the toppings!) The beverages they offered were also great - a nice Merlot and a red sangria that had triple sec and had to be about 95% alcohol with no fruit juice. Servers were very friendly and attentive as well. I'm making a reservation now.....
