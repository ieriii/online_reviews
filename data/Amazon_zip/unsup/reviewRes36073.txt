Loved Meli Cafe and Juice bar. Went there for breakfast with friends and we got there very very early and so had no wait time. Highlights of the breakfast were the veggie frittata and the orange carrot juice. Veggie frittata was delightfully yummy and not too heavy as regular frittatas. It has chunks of avocado (yum!) which makes it totally over the top. The carrot orange juice was delightfully refreshing. They serve bread with homemade jam goodness. We also had the eggs benedict which was delicious. The only dish that was disappointing was the tofu scramble - did not enjoy it. But we liked the other dishes enough to come for a second visit.
