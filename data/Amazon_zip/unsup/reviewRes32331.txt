Some of the best Asian Fusion I've had. We tried several dishes and the mix of flavors and textures were amazing. The brussel sprouts salad was absolutely fantastic and a must get if you visit Sunda. The atmosphere is upscale and cool, but has touches casual with large wooden benches and tables. It also had a great lounge area by the windows. Our server was one of the best I've had in some time - she was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. All her recommendations were spot on. Great place for a ladies night out or date night.
