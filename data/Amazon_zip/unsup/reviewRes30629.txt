I take pride in never going to the same restaurant over and over, but instead i want to try new places. The best review i can give Sunda is probably that i actually keep coming back to this place and love it every time. So the bottom line is that everything here (food, service, wine and drink menu etc) is good but not out of this world spectacular. However they all blend perfectly together and always deliver a great experience... So my recommendations is to go there! Im sure you will leave a happy person!
