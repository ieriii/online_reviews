This is a great location when it comes to accessing Grant and Millennium parks or the Museum Campus. This is why you stay at the Essex Inn. It's several blocks to the L unless you want to take the bus or taxi. They offer a complimentary limited service shuttle to Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile and the Museum Campus throughout the day. The exterior is a steel and glass modern structure with a huge neon sign and stands out a bit (easy to find) from the other stone and brick buildings along Michigan Ave. The lobby has a modern feel, but the carpet is a tropical dated thing of the past. It just doesn't match the lobby furnishings, the new hotel restaurant (Tribute) and the renovated guest rooms. They have nice amenities like the 4th floor rooftop deck, indoor pool and gym. The deck's garden is gorgeous with nice flowering beds and small trees for shade. It overlooks Michigan Ave and has nice views of skyscrapers in both directions. It's great if you just want to listen to the bands from Grant Park during Lollapalooza. The standard king room is decent size with modern decor. The hotel and rooms are clean overall. The housekeeping staff are very accommodating and pleasant. The front desk staff are nice and customer focused - they took care of us in recommending restaurants and addressing room needs. (especially Ryan and Reggie at the front desk). It's not a luxury or budget hotel, but it is comfortable, offers the basics, great room prices and great access to the parks. During Lollapalooza, they bring in additional security and take additional measures to make sure that guests are comfortable, safe and enjoy a pleasant stay. It is a perfect location for Lolla and isn't a party hotel.
