Ordered their stuffed pizza special. I ordered the small one, the one for one or two... damn more like a family it's so thick, but that's not a complaint. My complaint is that if you are gonna stuff veggies in two and a half inches of cheese, don't drive them home raw, they should have been sauted at the very least to give them some browning and taste. The raw veggies ruined the pizza for me. Using pie crust as pizza dough is interesting and adds a whole different spectrum to the taste. I also ordered cheesecake as desert - not knowing how huge this pizza pie would be - and it was yet another one of those run of the mill cheesecakes that can be found at your local Costco. All in all an average experience.
