Walking in to this restaurant you know you're in for a very upscale experience. The decor and ambiance is clean and modern but not cold.We were told to make sure we ate upstairs only because of the noise factor in the bar area. Noise is great for a high energy evening but we planned a family dinner with alot of talking.The service was extremely prompt and attentive. The tables were sizable and it was nice not to feel crowded in for a change.We had the HUGEST shrimp appetizers which reminded us of the shrimp cocktails from the Beetlejuice movie. Remember?Chopped salad was remarkably fresh with a balsamic dressing that was perfect and not overbearing.Steak was the entree for most. The bone in ribeye was good, not great. But the petite filet was outstanding. The sides were nice and plentiful. I had the onion rings which were like eating brown life preservers. They weren't traditionally fried but had a crunchy coating, not greasy enough for me.Overall I enjoyed Mastros but the men at the table still preferred Gibsons steaks. I wish they had lobster macaroni and cheese. That would have made the fifth star.
