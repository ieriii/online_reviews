It is so hard for me to give this place four stars. I think that it no longer deserves the five stars I would have given it three or four years ago, when there was still only one room, no food, no additude (save for two bartenders...and THEY know who they are...one of them, I think still works there). Up until about three years ago, my friends and I would sometimes come here a few times a week even though we all lived out in the suburbs at the time. Things have changed though. The prices are higher and the place has a deserved air of superiority. This really is the best selection of beers in or around Chicago, always has been, always will be. I've changed my mind. Hopleaf still gets five stars, not four. Edit: The bartenders here know less and less and less every visit. The food is good, and I would like to say that it's overpriced, but I don't believe that it is. A bucket of mussels for $20 is not bad in my book. Some of the drafts languish due to lack of use. For example, Dupont's winter seasonal is still on draft. It is June now. You can't go wrong with bottles, especially when you know the glass is going to match. I want to encourage people not to go because I want it to be less crowded when I go there, but I'm not quite that mean-spirited.
