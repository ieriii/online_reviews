Huge fan of this place! They have a brand new upstairs bar area in addition to their downstairs bar and seating area, with a cute fireplace and couches, normal tables, and seats at the bar. Unfortunately they would not seat me until my party was all there (and we were all coming at different times) so we just sat at the bar- no problem. They offer 4 oz samplers of all their beers for $2 or $4 depending on the beer. I loved all their beer. I tried: (score of 1 is best beer ever, 5 is worst beer ever) Bottom up wit: Banana flavor wit. Light and very good. Wheaty. 1.5 Grave digger billy: Scotch ale that is amazing. Very scotchy. Very strong. Good 1.5 Coup d'etat: Lemony strong flavored. Nicely. Carbonated. But little too citrusy. Little banana. 1.75 Hugene: Very flavorful. Imperial porter.Mild chocolately. Malty/mild coffee ish, good carb. Very caramely.  2 Institutionalized: A good barley wine. Grapey but not too much. Not too sweet. I actually like this. 2.25 For food, I had the Forest Burger- gorgonzola, mushrooms, arugula, - on a poppy seed bun. Bun was a little dry and a little too big. Burger was also a little dry, but toppings were superb. Fries were delicious. Bartenders were very friendly, great service. Decent prices. Weird location off the blue line, but worth the travel time! Would come back any day!
