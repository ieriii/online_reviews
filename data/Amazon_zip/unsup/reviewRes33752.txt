Yeah the wait is long but the food is DELISH.  I always get the pecan waffle: A big pecan waffle with fresh sliced banana and caramel. Mmmmmmmmm. You don' t even need syrup b/c of the caramel. I've also had the orange bread french toast. Very sweet.... too sweet for me but good nonetheless.  The coffee is decent also and they have different flavor creams on the table and my favorite: raw sugar. I'd give it 4 stars if not for the wait.
