Okay, just okay! The service was good. A big smile from the owner! The crepes I got gave me a huge stomach ache. When I went to pick up my order, I double checked to make sure the crepes were g.f. The server chick gave me a "wtf idk" look. I saw the owner behind the wall and shouted to him. He peeked around the corner and smiled. Then he reassured me they were and that they'd be delicious! I ate them and threw up! Yikes! The painted walls and intricate decor looked fantabulous and Mediterranean though...:-/ Brownie points for decor effort!
