I went there for Thanksgiving . BIG MISTAKE ! I have been here before and it's has been mediocre at best. It wasn't busy not that would have been an excuse for cold food or bad service . We asked the server if we could get desert to go because we were in a hurry. She said no problem. We asked her 2 times if she could check on it . She just smiled and again they weren't busy . The manager did stop by and ask if everything was alright . Our mistake to say fine thanks . We had to leave so we stopped at the hostess station to say forget it and got a nasty ,mean spirited person . Before I could finish my sentence she throws her hands up cocks her head and says I'm only the hostess. Not in a pleasant voice either I then said maybe you should offer to get a manager she just pointed. The followed me to the manager.Turns out the manager thinks poor service and a rude employee are acceptable . I guess it's true service starts at the top . All it would have taken was I'm sorry . Hopefully they will learn this simple customer tip.
