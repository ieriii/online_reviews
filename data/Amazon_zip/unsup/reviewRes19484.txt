Xoco is one fabulous thin-wallet-friendly establishment, featuring Tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and hearty soups and stew-like concoctions. Oh yes, and Mexican hot chocolate. Everything is locally sourced and there is some fabulously funky artwork on the walls. The ordering system might be a bit strange, but it's beyond effective. You put your number of guests in to the host, are given a menu and then stand on line. Once at the counter, you place your own order, but can't do so until you're given a table number. When that happens and the order is placed, you are taken to a space in the cafe-like seating area - a space that one would think is open seating. However, the sheer volume of people coming in and out necessitated some sort of structure, which I have to say was expertly executed by the brisk, pleasant manager who resembled a brunette Stephen Merchant. Food was utterly fabulous. The salsas were smoky and had incredibly deep flavor, homemade tortilla chips had a subtle peppery flavor. I went for the Seafood Caldo - a spicy light broth with gigantic shrimp and generous chunks of fish. The Tortas were incredible, and I managed to steal a bite of the Pibli torta - a glorious mixture of beans, pork, thick crusty bread and some eye-watering habenero salsa. Churros - necessary - were crisp, fragrant and complemented perfectly by the rich chocolate sauce. An amazing experience overall.
