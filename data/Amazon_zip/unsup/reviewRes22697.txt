Just had dinner here tonight with 4 other friends. We all left very satisfied. For you spice lovers, this is the place to go. The restaurant has an extensive menu and you will be left wondering what to get. We ordered the ma-po tofu, dried chili chicken, boiled beef with sauce, beef stew noodles, garlic green beans, and chengdu dumplings. Everything was delicious but my favorite dish is probably the dried chili chicken. I won't go into much detail here since there are plenty of other Yelpers who have commented enough about it, but if you like popcorn chicken, this is an item you must get. The spice isn't too overbearing (for me at least), but I'm used to eating spicy food. The texture of the food was great and the tofu was probably one of the more flavorful tofus I've had in a while. The only drawback is that everything comes out very oily, but that's what you get with Sichuan food.  Place was crowded when we came in, which was a good sign. We waited about 20 minutes to get a table and were served timely. Very friendly servers and host. I won't make a habit of coming to eat here because it's probably not too healthy. For example, when they brought the tofu out, you can see the layer of oil glistening and glazing on the top. Also a plus if you're a student and you pay with cash...you get 10% off. Afterwards, do yourself a favor and stop by Joy Yee for a freeze to cool you down.
