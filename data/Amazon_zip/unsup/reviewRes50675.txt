I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of Big Jones. Only two things gave it a minus, a hair found in my food, and the fact the red velvet cake didn't really seem like actual red velvet cake (really it was delicious, still). I came here on a Sunday afternoon and was seated quickly. We were given beignets to eat before our food came and we all ordered cocktails (mine being a corpse reviver) which were all great (and there is an amazing selection of liquors here). I had the creole croque madame with grits, which was huge and unique from the traditional style with thicker ham and a bit of added spice. As well, the bread was really tasty and buttery. The red velvet cake for dessert really was delicious, but it just wasn't real red velvet cake. It tasted like homemade cake dyed red with food coloring -- so, good, but not red velvet. Anyway, overall this is a great brunch/lunch place and is priced about the same as most trendy brunch places.
