i often like to stay at "chain" hotels, but on occasion, i like to try the chic and hip ones as well as old historical ones. this one is one of the historical chicago hotels that was worth the stay. its in the south loop area, a bit of a walk to get to all the shopping but if you're staying downtown, you're gonna be walking alot anyways. the lobby was absolutely gorgeous!!! very very friendly staff. i was taking photos of the lobby and was asked by a hotel staff if i would like a picture taken. very generous =) the room was very nice and clean. i love that the room came with two bathrooms! its perfect especially if you have multiple guests in one room.  the rooms came with one tv and coffee maker. the coffee maker was pretty cool. it makes cups, not pots. perfect so that you can control how many cups you want. the only thing i can complain about is that the picture was a bit wirey on the tv. nothing major, but it probably about time for them to upgrade their tv's. btw, i love that they stock crabtree & evelyn bath products! they smell wonderful!
