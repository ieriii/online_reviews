I like Wilde. It's a "real" restaurant in an area where real restaurants are sorely lacking. I really enjoy the gluten-free and low-carb aspects of their menu; they will make any sandwich or burger without the bun. Food is tasty. But I do think it's a bit overpriced by a couple of dollars, and the service isn't always the greatest. As in, when I sit down in there I am relieved if I get service relatively quickly. Good drink specials during the week, nice cozy dark atmosphere.
