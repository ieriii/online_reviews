This place is not good for the following people: Muslims looking for a post Ramadan feast. Vegetarians Orthodox Jews Poor people People who like a large, extensive, balanced menu People who usually drink Miller Lite In other words, they should rename the place Porklican and it would be more fitting. The food isn't bad. I had the red wine, poached egg thing and it was good. It wasn't a lot of food but when you add in a few beers it ends up being enough. They do have a very extensive beer list and the waiters know the beers well and can help pair them with the foods and can give recommendations to suit your tastes as well. A lot of Belgian and German beers but a lot of American micro-brews, British and even a Norwegian beer. Having all this beer, you would think it would be a bar but no, it isn't an all day long bar, it is a restaurant and it closes mid-day until dinner time. You go there to eat, not to drink. I would possibly go back to try dinner but I probably won't make the trip down to have brunch again even though it was decent enough food. It is expensive, especially the beer. Oh, and don't expect a thin piece of crispy bacon if you decide to order bacon. This is twice as thick as your typical slice of Christmas ham and is mostly fat, like most bacon but when its an inch thick it just makes more of an impact. I am not saying their bacon is bad, just different than what you are used to.
