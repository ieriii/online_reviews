I got to experience Big Jones Catering last night, so I wanted to write a little update to recommend that as well! My favorite dish that was delivered was the blackened chicken salad sandwhich. It kicked in all the right ways! All of the food was yummy, kept very well in the catering containers, and well matched with dips and dressings. Delivery was prompt and setup was quick and easy! Thank you AGAIN Big Jones!
