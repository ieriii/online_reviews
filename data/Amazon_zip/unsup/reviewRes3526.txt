The Crisp restaurant is located in a very trendy part of town. It is a small restaurant that has high price korean food, very suitable for the area, however not a good bargain if you're looking for a good meal with a deal. I found the customer service was friendly and helpful in answering my questions about the restaurant and the food that I was interested in ordering. I found the food to be very tasty, I tried their Korean BBQ and the Seol Sassy chicken wings I liked the taste, I wish it wasn't so expensive. I probably won't be returning to that restaurant too often for the chicken because I know I can get it some place else for a better deal. My husband tried their korean buritto and he liked it a lot, but also agreed it was pricey and we might not return to that restaurant because of high prices. But I recommend it to anyone who wants to try Korean BBQ wings, and a Korean Buritto.
