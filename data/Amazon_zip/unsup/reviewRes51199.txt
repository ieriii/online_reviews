Food was good-- not excellent, but perfectly fine. Only complaints-- we had a large party (eight people) and our food took more than an hour to arrive. My steak was cold. Our waiter was VERY nice and made an effort to make food safe for my allergies. I'd consider this a pretty allergy friendly environment- they did a good job overall. I'd go back.
