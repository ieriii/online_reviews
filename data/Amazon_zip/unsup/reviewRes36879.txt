This place is worth all 5 stars. It is THAT good. The menu is the hardest part because you have to decide if you want savory or sweet. There are like at least 6 different kinds of eggs benedict, plus frittatas, omellettes, skilets, crepes, pancakes, stuffed pancakes, french toast, etc! PLUS they do with every menu a daily special. The juice all of their own juices, their coffee is a Lavazza espresso blend that is off the charts amazing. The food is fresh and the line is long with good reason. It's packed - always but the location is small. The staff is good, friendly, and fast. Thank God they're opening a 2nd location on Grand and Wells because they have definitely the fan base for a second restaurant. I only hope that they will continue serving up the best breakfasts in Chicago. -And don't kid yourself, they are the best. Period. Just realized that I am actually UPDATING this review because I've reviewed them before and they are still AMAZING!!!
