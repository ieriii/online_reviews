I'm not going to re-tread over covered territory, but I just wanted to make sure that the historic underdog of desserts-- rice pudding-- doesn't get overlooked in all of the frenzy surrounding churros, hot chocolate and, um, food.  Today, the arroz con leche is made with lime, toasted coconut, and mango. A couple of weeks ago I think that it was made with black cherries, tequila, and pure love. And it is so crazy good it actually makes 3:30 in the office (my lease favorite time of day) tolerable. More than tolerable, actually-- enjoyable.
