Some interesting facts about Crisp: I have delicious dreams of this place on a regular basis...I have often awoken licking my fingers. Some of my taste buds reached a state of nirvana after eating here...haven't heard from them since. I have been here on two separate occasions in one day. Seoul Sassy and the BBQ sauces are crazy delicious. The bowls are great too...but honestly...GET THE CHICKEN. Also, the owner (who I have chatted with a few times trying to lobby longer hours) is very nice.
