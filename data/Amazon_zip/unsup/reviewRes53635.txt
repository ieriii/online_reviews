For a hot dog joint, it's amazing. I had the Tueten and it's soooo GOOD...then again I love corned beef and to make a hot dog out of it was a great idea. The place opens at 1030 and when I arrived at 1015, there was already a line about 40 people deep. I think we ended up waiting in line 35 minutes before we got to the front (counting the 15 minute wait for the place to open). I think the food's great and really hits the spot if you're looking for a hot dog, but I still don't understand the extremely long lines, even in cold temperatures. I think being aired on the Food Network has a lot to do with it. So get there early. I tried to go once before (around 2 pm) and there had to be 100 people in line. The most important tip: ORDER THE DUCK FAT FRIES...they are only available Fridays and Saturdays.
