YES!! I am the 850th Yelper to review Hot Doug's All 849 reviews are accurate.  You will wait an hour+ on saturday. Doug is very nice as he takes your order. The specialty sausages are incredible ($7-$9) The duck fat fries are also incredible Seriously, if you have not gone to Hot Doug's, you need to go. 850 people can't be wrong
