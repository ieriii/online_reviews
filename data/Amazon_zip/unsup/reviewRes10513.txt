Piece attempts to dazzle you with their wide array of toppings. But if you can't do pepperoni right, who cares that you make a clam pizza? I ordered a pepperoni and chicken pizza (while my cousin attempted a *mashed potato* pizza. Yes. Mashed potato). Mine was fine. Just fine. The crust was thin and nondescript. The sauce was sub-Boyardee. The cheese meant nothing. I ate it, but I was just going through the motions. I didn't enjoy it. I didn't savor it. I wasn't in love. I tried a slice of my cousin's mashed potato version. Now I hate mashed potatoes AND pizza. Thanks a ton, Piece. You people who say this is New York style must be eating frozen pizzas cooked over a flaming trash barrel in Queens. Maybe it scores points as a brewpub, but this pizza is not worth waiting so long for. Chicago has so many great pizza joints. This one isn't one of them. I'd rather get Domino's. And I hate Domino's.
