WARNING: This is a conflicted review. So totally meh. Yes, I said MEH. Which rhymes with bleh. I would use bleh as well. So totally bleh. I had high hopes for this place since I'm on the road to becoming a vegetarian. (Note: I'm not one just yet. I'm still counting the days since I last had meat. 57 days at this point. Talk to me when I've lost track.). Not to mention that various friends have been raving to me about how the food reminds them so much of meat, especially the fake bacon cheeseburger. We ordered the breaded mushroom appetizer, which was extremely bland - if I have to salt the food to give it flavor, it's not good. They did bring out Sriracha hot sauce, so I gotta give them props for that. And the fake "bacon" cheese "burger" (the bacon and burger were fake, but the cheese was all real in it's dairy glory) was not impressive at all. And my friend ordered eggs with a side of fries and they hardly gave him any fries. Stingy! I will say that customer service was king here though - the servers were pleasant and when my friend and I spent a long time chatting after we had finished our food and the table was cleared, they didn't try to rush us out the door. So, Sriracha hot sauce and friendly customer service are its pluses and the minuses was the food itself. I do want to come back and try the seitan gyros even though what I had was so meh/bleh. See, I'm conflicted.
