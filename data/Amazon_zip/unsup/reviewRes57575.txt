We had an amazing time here! The food was fantastic. Everything was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful aroma that permeated the entire table. Our waiter was a polite, attentive man that really knew his wines. He suggested an excellent red that went beautifully with our dinner. It was a little dry for my tastes, but I'm not really a wine drinker anyway. Wonderful atmosphere, great service, and great food.
