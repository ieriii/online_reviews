I'm a SPG Platinum member and can't believe that Starwood even keeps this property in their portfolio. I'm writing from the dingy room as we speak. Pro: It was $100 for a Thursday-Sunday room in early December, when prices usually spike around the Magnificent Mile. Cons: only 1 (slow) elevator, very old and dingy decor, poor front desk service, no movies, very few electrical plugs. I could have chosen between the Hampton Inn and Tremont. I stayed at the Hampton a month ago and should have stayed there again. Yes it's cheap and close to Michigan Ave, but if you are a business traveller and accustomed to SPG standards, this is not your place!
