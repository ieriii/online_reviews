Creativity is off the charts. Very little here has been done before. Grant Achatz is truly a genius, though I have to wonder about what's going on in his head as he's about to smash a giant egg on my table. Service can be pretty casual, but very attentive. It's not a bad thing at all, but these guys aren't stiff, nor are they very formal. They are, however, true pros who wouldn't surprise me if they imbibe in little green plants that grow from the earth and are best consumed aromatically. The wine guy/som, Richard Richardson is someone very special. An obvious savant and master of his trade. It's a true pleasure to witness his art. The cuisine is unbelievable. He goes so far over the edge, jumps off of a cliff, yet still has me wanting more of every bite. Most chefs can't stay inside the fence and pull that off. Amazing.
