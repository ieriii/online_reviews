I bought in Berwyn 3 yrs ago and my GOD do I miss this pizza. The best I've ever had for the 'real' neighborhood pizza that real chicagoans grow up on. Deep dish touristy places are ok, but this is the real thing. I have a feeling when Frank goes, it goes because the owner is the only one that makes the pizzas, rolling dough off his antique roller and vintage 1930's art deco Fauld ferris-wheel oven. The neon sign, it's all complete.
