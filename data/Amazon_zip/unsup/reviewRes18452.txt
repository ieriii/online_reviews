I've been dying to try Rick Bayless's restaurant before I move out of Chi-town and I finally made it! I think I expected more out of it - it turned out to be a pretty solid sandwich shop. For the non-initiated, tortas are just a fancy word for a pressed sandwich! They are delicious but no more than a good pressed sandwich. I had a cubano and it was solid. My friends raved about the churros so I had to try one. I topped it with chocolate and ice cream (where is my self-control?) - all cost extra but not too bad. I loved the ice cream but I definitely had better churros elsewhere. The ordering process is a bit confusing but if I figured it out you will too. Overall, a nice spot for lunch but kind of overhyped
