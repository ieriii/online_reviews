Just a small wait, and crowded, but only because the food is so good! Came here in February and it was still busy! Ordered the deep stuffed supreme pizza and it was the best pizza ever for a deep stuffed, although a little too much cheese for my taste, still good! it also took about half an hour for the pizza to cook, but worth it! next time i go, i want to try their regular pizza. also ate the garlic bread, so good because they used regular italian bread, so it tastes even more fresh! service was great and friendly, food was great. i will definitely come back here next time im in town!
