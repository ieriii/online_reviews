I think this place has the best french fries in the city. And I consider myself to be a potato connoisseur. Everything I've had on the menu is fantastic. I love the wild boar sloppy joe. The beer list is extensive. The service is charming. You can't beat the unique menu or the whiskey list. This place is worth a detour if you want an extraordinary dining experience. Or the best fries in the city.
