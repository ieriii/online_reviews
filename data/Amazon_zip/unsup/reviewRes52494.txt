My friend and I dined at at Brazzaz for the first time on 2/25/10 and had a wonderful experience. The hostess was very pleasant upon our arrival approximately five minutes prior to our reservation time (7pm). The valet price was a little weird ($11.75...why not just $12). As soon as we were planning to sit down to wait for our table, our host arrived and called out our name stating our table was ready. (FAST) The wait staff and gauchos waited on us hand and foot. Our chairs were pulled out for us and they offered wine suggestions. A manager even came over to the table and asked if we needed anything. We did notice however the dining area became more crowded after 8pm (but we expected this due to Restaurant Week in Chicago).  The food was great. I'm not a huge red meat eater but I enjoyed what little I had. I absolutely loved the mushroom risotto, shrimp, lamb and pineapple. And the wine pairing the host suggested (Chardonnay) went perfectly with everything. For desert, the Tiramisu was so good! Overall, I could not have asked for a better initial experience.
