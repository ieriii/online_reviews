First off, some of the food was good, some was mediocre. Our server was very pushy and sarcastic.  I generally appreciate advice when it comes to what to order, but this server pretty much had his mind made up for us. He told us what we had to get, and he even told us what was terrible on the menu (the fondue appetizer apparently). The dish that he thought was best was the Bison tartare. My fiance thought it was delicious, and I was not a huge fan. The presentation was nice, but it didn't come together very well flavor-wise. Don't waste your time on the pickles "snack." The burger was definitely the best thing we tasted. The rib eye was not anywhere near worth the money and was very lacking in flavor, ditto the fries. The brie potatoes were so-so. Overall, the food was decent, the service was annoying, and the atmosphere was very loud. I'll probably go back and have a burger at a time when I expect it to be slow there, but we won't be back for another dinner date.
