MMMmmm, tasty. When I read about Rick Bayless and his joint, I knew I had to come by here on my visit to Chicago and I was definitely not disappointed.  Hailing from California makes me somewhat of a Mexican food expert (fogs nails and shines them off on collar) so I was pretty skeptical of finding good Mex out in the Mid-West. My girlfriend and I were told they didn't take reservations (wat.) when I called so we prayed it wouldn't be too busy when we walked in. The place was totally packed on a Thursday night and the hostess seemed pretty efficient at getting people on the wait system, but luckily, we got a seat at the bar.  The bartender was a super cool, Harley kinda guy, and he recommended the Topolobampo margarita. My gf had a "skinny margarita" which was straight up tequila with limes (mistake numero dos). Wooooo. By the time our ceviche sampler appetizer came out, we were both feeling good. The shrimp ceviche was my favorite of all three, and really the only one I would reorder again. The squid ceviche didn't seem very well thought out and the tuna one was just normal, nothing special. We shared the puerca entree that was rec'd by the bartender and it was delicious. It's since discontinued because they rotate their menu monthly but if it's on again, you should def order. These soft, tender slices of pork came out with a chile tomatillo type of sauce. The meat was so soft, it felt like it was going to melt in my mouth. This was some serious puerca.  Anyway, if you're in Chicago, or going to go, or want to go, you must check this place out!
