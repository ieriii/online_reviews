I recently ordered take out here after a long hiatus (due to moving from the area and trying to save money) and forgot how good the sushi is. I have not been to a ton of places in Chicago, but so far this has been the best place I have found in the area. The dragon roll is by far my favorite.  I also enjoy the eating in the restaurant every once in a while as it has a pretty cool decorum inside (helped out by the numerous attractive girls that frequent this place). The only drawback for here is that I think it can be a bit expensive for not the largest quantity of food, but its well worth the price if you enjoy good sushi.
