One of Chicago's best places to eat! We love the atmosphere, the food, the sangria...everything! My husband and I take his clients, our friends and family to this restaurant all of the time because they are always spot on! Their service is great too. If you need a date night place, a place to take friends, family, strangers, clients, etc...bring them to Las Tablas! You will love it!
