Art has great pies but I love their cheap daily specials. The Italian sausage on Monday and meatball sandwich on Tuesday - both for the low, low price of $2.49 are incredible deals! Sure, there's a minimum order for delivery ($11, I think) and a delivery charge of $2.95 but what a deal! Your order comes with a liter of soda (Pepsi products), I believe. And you must try the full slab BBQ rib dinner on Sundays for $9.95 (spaghetti & meatballs for $4.95). The dinners come with fries, salad, bread, and soda. You can't beat it with a stick!
