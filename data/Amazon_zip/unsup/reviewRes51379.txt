Dinner at Garcia's on a recent Friday night left my feeling like I drank unfiltered water in Mexico. What did me in- shrimp fajitas. Just average. The nopales sauted with other veggies was quite good. I had never had a hot preparation of napoles. I had to send back the red sangria. It tasted like peach schnapps. Gauc was tasteless- very bland. I took one bite of the flan and that was it. Eevery tooth that i have is a sweet tooth. So for me not to eat a dessert really says something Service to our large party was friendly and attentive. Perhaps if I hadn't been violently illl for several hours after eating at Garcia's, I would have given it another chance if someone twisted my arm. Except for the fact that they have a liquor license, I don't know why anyone would choose to eat here over Los Napoles on Western & Wilson.
