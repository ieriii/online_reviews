In all fairness, I've been here too many times, I've become sick of it. Salad bar is ok....same items ALL the time. Meat is ok...my only real faves are the garlic steak and lamb chops. Aside from that, I believe the service/customer service sucks. Our group reserves here A LOT for special occasions and they hardly make any big accommodations for us even though we come a lot! you would think they would for that reason. But they don't. I'm tired of this place.
