300! I've seen this place the corner of Foster & Clark, but somehow always forget about it. Then I would forget about it. Finally one night the stars were aligned and we remembered it, so decided to stop in for dinner. It was a weeknight and the place was pretty empty. I thought the soup was excellent, and the crepes were great. I've not really had them that often, and certainly not a savory one, but it was really good. I didn't have any meat in mine, but I might want to try it with chicken next time. The staff was friendly and helpful as well, which is always a plus. I'd like to return sometime and have a sweet crepe. I almost wish the portions hadn't been as humungous as they were so that we could have tried one for dessert!
