This place is awesome. I've take many people here and they would also concur that it's a great place to eat Korean BBQ. The best thing about it is, it closes late. I think we came here at 2 in the morning one evening to quench our drunken hunger. I always get an order of Kalbi and Bulgogi. This can feed about 4 to 5 people. They definitely give you a crap load of pan-chan... I sometimes have to limit myself just because I get so full off the small side dishes. The meats are absolutely marinated excellently. You can taste the sauces even after you grill them up. It's pretty self explanatory... Korean BBQ.. who the hell doesn't love it. The only negative drawbacks are the smoky smell you you inherit once you leave and also the additional unbuttoning of the pants... =)
