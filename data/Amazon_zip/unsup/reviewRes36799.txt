Two, yes, that's right, two restaurants in one! The thai here is worthy of a Thai-only restaurant, and the Japanese entrees and maki are worthy of a Japanese restaurant. Plus, you can mix and match - get your table an order of maki to split as an appetizer. Unless you find yourself craving the crab rangoon, which everyone seems to rave about, and judging by the crowd tonight, everyone seems to order. I love their savory and rich basil chicken, but I'm also happy just trying their many creative maki rolls, like the Popeye (unagi, avocado, cucumber, cream cheese and spinach, topped with BBQ sauce) and the Metallica (scallop, spicy mayo, masago, cucumber and avocado.) I had to order that last one because whenever I see a menu item named after a heavy metal band I feel obligated to order it. (They hate me at Kuma's because I always order "one of each.") There are a lot of temptations on the menu; I figure it will take years to try them all. Oh, also, they get bonus points for dealing with my rowdy party of nine in a timely manner, without screwing up a single thing (and for taking the unorthodox but entertaining approach of asking for a show of hands to see how many miso soups to bring out.)
