No visit to Chicago is complete without stuffing your face full of deep dish pizza! Giordano's did not disappoint. We ordered a crapload of food: a small deep dish Chicago style pizza, a small thin crust pizza (in case we got tired of chewing on deep dish), a hot italian beef sandwich, an order of spaghetti with meatballs, and an order of mozzarella sticks. We also had garlic bread and minestrone soup. It was a monster feast! The tomato sauce used on the pizza and pasta was really good. Everything was pig-out heaven. Word of warning though - leftovers do not taste as good! This stuff must be eaten fresh!
