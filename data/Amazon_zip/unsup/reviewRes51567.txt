In an area swarming with tacquerias, this is our go-to place. The portions are large, and the food is good. It's an even better deal if you eat in-house, because they have waiter service (a rarity for a taco stop) and free chips and salsa. I think the burritos got smaller recently, but they're still big enough for two meals if you play it right. The chimichanga is a deep-fried version of the burrito, which means it's huge! The combos are best if eaten at the restaurant.
