This falafel is not good falafel. It's not BAD, but it sure ain't good. However, it's cheap and fast, which makes up for the weird taste (what is the undertone I keep getting? It's kind of fishy, literally, right? Like, it tastes a little like fish, or maybe just ancient, reused frying oil?). Please don't ever order anything of the chicken variety, because you'll just get bones. Now for the good stuff: great salad bar full of fun junk (anchovies! mozarella balls! dolma!) that's not overpriced, pleasant lentil soup (a little dull on its own, but a nice complement to other menu items), lentils and rice. Portion sizes are generous, staff is friendly and quick. I am disappointed that they did away with the umbrellas on the outdoor tables. I enjoy eating outside but don't like sizzling under the blaze of the afternoon sun. I am a delicate flower!
