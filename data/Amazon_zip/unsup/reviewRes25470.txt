This place has just good food. I followed other yelpers and ordered the mushroom artopitas and it was really amazing. The chicken and lemon soup smells amazing.  The pastries are wonderful, the menu doesn't really describe them effectively but just ask your waitress/waiter and they'll explain it to you. A good cheap tasty meal!
