I came here almost 8 years ago when it first opened for a birthday party with 10 of my closest gal pals. It was horrid. And I swore I'd never be back. Well, I went back. And, once again, I swear I'll never be back again. I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place. It's crammed, noisy, and you sit on top of each other with no real elbow room. It took almost 25 minutes for anyone to come take our order. Our pizza was nothing to write home about and BURNED ON THE BOTTOM. And for $28 for a medium with 4 toppings, I'll go to Lucky Vito's and get a grand slam sausage slice for $2.50. Oh, and their beer is less than good. For being a microbrewery, they need to learn that all the different brews they offer should not taste crazy hoppy. I'm surprised this place has lasted as long as it has. Out of 100 reviews, I guess I'm one of the few that requires good tasting pizza for $30 and better tasting microbrewed beer for $7.
