This is what I call an athlete's splurge on cheat day (apart from Edzo's in Evanston). Been going here for years. Have pretty much tried everything on the menu from the regular italian suasage-esque and hot dog bites to the gourmet tastes of such exotic meats as alligator sausage, duck sausage, ham sausage. Cheddar fries are addicting. As are the duck fat fries. The latter I have not had in a while because weekends when they serve them, the outside lines are way too long, especially when the temperature hits single digits. Every time I have guests and friends from out of town, this is the first place I take them as part of my Chicago VIP tour. I also think this place can be a natural anti-depressant..literally. Last year when my car was booted, I walked 5 long blocks from DMV after paying in blood to get my car back and had to wait 8 hours to get it unbooted in freezing weather and feeling very challenged lets say. Walked over to Hot Dougs, and after a great meal of duck sausage with some who knows how to pronounce sauce and toppings and cheddar fries, I was high as kite and Mr. Happy go lucky! Plus Doug is always on standby and behind the cashier to throw some humor your way..if you ask the right questions. This place should be a city landmark!
