Finally got around to trying this place and it was definitely worth it.  My wife and I had the vegetarian Sambussa (like a samosa but with more of a vegetable paste filling) and the Veg-Meat Messob (2 veggie dishes and 2 meat dishes.) We got the split red lentils in sauce, potatoes and carrots with spices, lamb with sauce and a drumstick topped with really spicy sauce. Everything was tasty except the lamb which was a little unexciting.  Service was decent and the prices were within reason. I'd definitely go back.
