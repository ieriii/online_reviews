What a fun place! I was a little leery after reading some of the other yelp reviews, however, I thought, what the heck. Food was totally awesome - started with their version of the egg roll- spot on! not greasy or deep fried tasting at all- just warm and polite. Next was the soup which I could have eaten by the quarts on a cold Winter's day. Very fresh, lots of nice healthy tasting veggies too. For dinner came the beef medallion filet. Perfectly prepared and delightful. Drink menu was interesting too. However, the one thing that caught me off guard was the dcor- I felt like I belonged in Savannah Georgia sipping a polite mint julep- not that it was a bad thing at all- just wasn't expecting it
