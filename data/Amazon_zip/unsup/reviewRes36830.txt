If u want to be kicked out ur table before finishing ur coffee in order to give the table to somebody else then Meli is the right place for u. i went there for brunch today and receiving bad food and even worse service, a busboy rushed me to leave the table while i wasnt even done with my coffee and OJ, when i wanted to complain to the owner the only thing he could say rudly was " Well then u just had a bad experience" quote. he was the one wanting as many custermers as he can and doesnt really care about the custermers experience. i would just say i have never been treated that pourly in any restaurant in my entire life... WOW
