BEST STUFFED PIZZA IN THE CITY!!!! Calo is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in town, and coming from a native Chicagoan, that says a lot. I lived in Uptown for several years and regularly ordered delivery from Calo. They were always prompt and the delivery guys were super nice! The stuffed pizza is AMAZING. The crust is perfect and the cheese is delicious and plentiful. I've had pizza from dozens of places in Chicago, and no where else even begins to compare. My favorite part of Calos is the cost. The prices are dirt cheap compared to the quality and quantity of food you get. Definitely a place you have to try out!
