I'l say it very simply: Not only was dining at Alinea the best culinary experience I will likely EVER have... it also set my standards so high that it's very likely I will never rate another restaurant 5 stars. Mind blowing food and service that would be worth flying to Chicago from Canada for one day, and then go back home right after the meal. If you can attend an Alinea service, do it. You'll thank yourself forever.
