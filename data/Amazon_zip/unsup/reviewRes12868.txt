I'd been meaning to try Cafe 28 for quite some time and finally went last night with very high expectations. And guess what -- even on a busy Saturday night and the day after it reappeared on a "Check, Please!" rerun my expectations were only exceeded!  This place is so so GOOD. Everything we had -- the "taste of Cuba" app, almond-crusted halibut, pork chops and profiteroles -- was delicious. And the drinks were amazing. I would highly recommend Cafe 28 to anyone. It's definitely a must-try!
