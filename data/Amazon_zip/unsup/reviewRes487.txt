Going to Alinea is a special occasion in itself, however, when I went, it was also for my mother's and aunt's birthday celebration. We were a party of six and it was amazing. I have never had a meal like it - it's true what they say, it's not just amazing food... it is an experience. Here's some of the highlights (I'm to lazy to organize my thoughts into a clever plot line with witty one liners that make sense): - The meal was 5 hrs long with over fifteen courses, it not an experience or meal to be rushed. Sit, enjoy and slow down. - The dessert was so amazing, who knew eating off the table could be so fulfilling - The wine pairings were perfect to the tee.. though i didn't really want to drink that much on Wednesday night (I'm getting old) - Your taste buds will orgasm, your eyes won't believe what you're tasting - My favorite dish was a coffee halibut (what it was really called I don't remember, I simply called it "white" at the table) - the flavors so complex and the visual so simple - I ate a nutella sandwich that did not look anything like a nutella sandwich - Although a dish might be a single bite, I was full by the end - I found the staff to be polite and witty - they timed every dish beautifully. I can imagine it wasn't easy for a table of six - If it weren't for the tiny Alinea valet sign, I would have not seen this place - The atmosphere was a little pretentious for my liking, but i guess when your shelling out a couple hundred for a mean it's expected... - It was worth the hype. It made me happy. - I can't get over how fun the dinner was, and complexity/simplicity of every dish. You could really appreciate the work, labor and love put into every master piece of a dish So there it is. My words couldn't do justice to Alinea and to Grant. I am just grateful for the experience, it is one that few truly appreciate and will get to experience.
