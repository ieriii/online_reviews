It was everything I had heard about. Amazing salad appetizer bar with artichokes, hearts of palm, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto etc.... Then the main courses of meat that send you into a meat coma, or what I refer to as being "meat drunk"! It was my anniversary this evening and the even customized the desert to have written in raspberry sauce around the desert plate "happy anniversary".  This is definitely a spot I will be stopping at again. Thank you Fogo de Chao!!!
