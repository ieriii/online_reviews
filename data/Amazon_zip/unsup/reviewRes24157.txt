best. chille. rellenos. evar. i also have to respect a place that has chicharron on the menu as an entree. its a ballsy move. they also have a pretty decent selection of vegetarian options. so yeah, fried pork chunks AND veggie choices. food fun for everyone. prices are SUPER reasonable too. around $12 for the average entrees, which are enormous, and under $5 for a sandwich. plus, its byob and there's a liquor store right across the street!
