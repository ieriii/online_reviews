If it would allow me to give 0 stars I would!! Absolutely awful experience. Went here for brunch with a party of 6. The hostess told us it would be at least an hour. We were waiting for half of our party so we sat in the bar area and talked and waited. After the hour she came to us and told us it would be another HOUR!!!  Just horrible customer service. No apology. No option of any other advice to give us. Just completely rude.  I will never return. Ended up at Charlie's in Andersonville and had wonderful service and a fabulous meal.
