I had never been to Chicago and I was recommended by a friend that lived near downtown that the only place for fine dinning and great steak was at Kinzie. And that recommendation lived up to its word and then some. The food was out of this world, the wait staff went out of their way to accommodate any need we had, and the visit by the manager after the meal was dying down made it an evening and dinner that cant be matched anywhere else. Just a great place to enjoy great food and a great atmosphere.
