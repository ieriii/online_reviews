I've been coming here since the early 80's with my parents. It's still as fun and delicious. They have great drinks, awesome burgers, wraps, soups & salads. Oh and that salad bar...well, they were the first that I can remember. Anyway, another great example of a small place that executes well towards their customers. I bring all my friends who visit from out of state or the country. Can't beat the food and drinks at this place. Continued success to you guys!!!
