I like the spirit of this place. Very fine dining in a down to earth atmosphere. There's something refreshing about being served a $35 entree by a waiter wearing Chuck Taylors. Somehow, I don't think Keds would induce the same warm fuzzy. So the ambiance is great. But- full disclosure- I do carry an extreme affinity for lime tinted accents. Thus, I fell in love with the decor. Others with a more mature design palette may argue. Fitting with the casual theme, the courses were simple: Cold. Hot. Sea. Land. Sweet. Monosyllabic, something a caveman would utter. We had one of each: beef tartare, diver scallops, mahi mahi, lamb, gooey chocolate brownie. And each was delightfully intricate. Somehow the beef tartare and mahi did not fully live up to the presentation and ingredients. Despite all the components, they lacked some flavor. The lamb was interesting. Accompanied by lentils and had an overall Indian way about it. I found it challenging and am still trying to figure out what I think. This ongoing internal debate is rare, so it qualifies the dish as a raging success in my book. The gooey chocolate brownie had peanut butter and was sinfully rich. And ridiculously good.
