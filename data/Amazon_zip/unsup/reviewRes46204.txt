Please.... this place is soooooo....... wait for it.........wait for it........OVERRATED!  the handful of times ive been here it has been at the request of out of town family members. The food is decent enough although nothing stellar, there is always something slightly synthethic or fake looking/tasteing about food from the "let us entertain you" monopoly of restaurants! Plus don't ask me how I know this but I think most of the desserts are bought from a dessert company (chocolate pyramid anyone) but that's just guess. I would have no problem going back, that was until my most recent visit with a good friend and three of our "older" lady friends. The waiter was so incredibly rude it shocked me! Personally im pretty easy to please so he truly shocked me when we walked up to the table, the five of us were talking and he said "Hello"  (we are finishing up the sentence and about to acknowledge him) about 2 seconds later he says "excuse me!! let me try this again..... HELLO" as if to imply that this table of older ladies couldn't hear him! I was so appalled that I actually clutched my invisible strand of pearls every gay man has but only grabs coupled with a gasp! that that point my friend ad I look at each other and then look back at him.... he actually says...."what??" and looks back at us! We order a mediocre bottle of wine and then its time to order our meals he leans into the woman sitting next to me and says very loudly "mamme? have you read the menu, what would you like?" again implying her lack of hearing. The woman, a very witty with it french woman in her late 70's turns to him and says. " I do wish you'd stop shouting in my ear, I can hear you alright"  the night continued with this attitude.... it was unbearable! I have never not left a tip of any amount in all my life, until The grand Luxe Cafe!
