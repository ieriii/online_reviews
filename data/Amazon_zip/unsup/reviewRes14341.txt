A lovely little shack of a place that serves delicious Cuban-style food. Nice outdoor seating area, not much at all in terms of indoors. Descriptions of the food could have been better; I got the tofu dinner. All I knew was that it came with tofu, white rice, black beans and plantains. Thankfully they did something with the tofu, cooking it in some kind of tasty sauce that contained large chunks of peppers and onion. Properly prepared Cuban-style black beans and rice are a combo everyone must try at least once, and this is a good place to do it. This place won't impress your date until she tastes the food. I am a fan, and I like to pleasantly surprise people.
