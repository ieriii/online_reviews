I give Garcia's 4 stars...an unenthusiastic 5 stars for the dishes I have had, and a disappointing 2.5 stars for the food that everyone else I goes with seems to order. Do the math, (5 +2.5)/2 = 4. On all of our visits to Garcia's, I have ordered something that I thought was very good (tongue tacos, chilaquiles, huevos rancheros), and my fiancee has ordered something that was disappointingly bland (i.e. all of the vegetarian entrees). So basically, the food is hit or miss, but to better your chances of getting something tasty, veer towards the items that wouldn't appear on a standard "combination plate". The breakfast type items have been batting 1.000 I think the reason we keep coming back is for the margaritas...holy cow, they will do a number on you, and you won't even know it, and they are reasonably priced. The space is kind of weird because of how open it is, and the lighting is way too bright, but it is clean, and it doesn't smell (that's always good right?).
