One of my favorite restaurants of all time, its been a dependable family favorite since I was a kid. It's worth the drive from the suburbs! The walnut shrimp is crunchy and fresh, the mayo isn't overbearing. The dry chili chicken is always good. The szechuan cold noodle salad is something I've recently discovered on the menu. Spicy and flavorful, it's good straight out of the fridge the next day. Don't be afraid to try the very Chinese section on the menu, it's as authentic as it gets around here. Also try the hot pot fish, it's literally translated to "water boiled fish". It is EXTREMELY spicy, so dripping sweat is normal, make sure you have a lot of ice water ready. It's a fish stew with some celery and chili peppers and mouth numbing peppercorns. My boyfriend and I call it poison soup, but we can't stay away! Leftovers are great for boiling noodles the next day. It gets busy during the weekends, but weeknights are pretty free. Prices are very reasonable, and parking is usually accessible. Don't forget to try it's sister restaurants Lao Beijing and Lao shanghai, which are also in Chinatown square!
