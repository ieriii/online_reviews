Completely over-rated. Pizza came out warn and the crust has too much cornmeal making the deep-dish too flaky. Pasta is better but it was nothing special either. Don't be fooled when you see the line outside. They do it on purpose to show people that the restaurant is full. I was in line for about 10 minutes (around 3:30PM) but when I sat down at my table, the first floor was about 1/2 full and was mostly empty on the 2nd floor. I will not be back at Gino's East next time I'm in Chicago.
