This place is great! I came here with a friend this past winter, and was really happy to finally try Icosium out! I love the decor because it's interesting but not overdone. Our server was very friendly too! I ordered a vegetarian crepe (although I am not a vegetarian). It was wonderful!! So much flavor and goodness wrapped up into one crepe. I split a dessert crepe with my friend and that too was delicious! if you like savory OR dessert crepes, this is definitely a place to try out!
