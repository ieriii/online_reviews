Having moved away from the homeland, and while yelping about some good food in SD, I started day dreaming about Doug... don't let the glasses fool you, that man has a vision, a vision of encased meat, topped in hedonistic fantasy; he never serves up a miss. Never have I seen so many rmoulades on so many species, with so many cheeses. Doug, what are your drams like? Even if you don't love kitsch hot dog paraphernalia, if you are willing to eat meat, eat Hot Dougs, there is no better sausage. If you go on a weekend, bring a book.
