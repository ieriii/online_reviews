So I know that I ate here. In fact I ate here in June. Unfortunately, I really don't remember what I ate or if I liked it or not. That's a bad sign. I do remember the place was very cute on the inside. A little cramped but we got a great window seat. It's a shame that I remember the decor more then I remember the food. Maybe I didn't eat the right stuff. Maybe the native New Orleanian in me won't let me remember. Either way I know it wasn't terrible (I would have remembered that) but apparently it didn't wow me either.
