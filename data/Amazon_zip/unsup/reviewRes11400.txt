i was wary of getting pizza in chicago bc im not the biggest fan of deep dish so coming to piece for their thin crust pizza... which i LOVE... seemed to be the perfect fit. not to mention i love karaoke and they have live band karaoke on saturday nights. as an appetizer i got the goat cheese in marinara. SO GOOD!!! it comes out piping hot though so be careful! i think every single one of my friends burned their mouths on it. as for the pizza i wish that they had specialty pizzas on their menu instead of it just being a make your own kind of deal. i ended up getting the red pizza with meatballs and ricotta. it was DELICIOUS!!!!! they are a pretty good size too. my friend and i shared the small pizza and still had like 3 slices leftover. so loved the food..... did NOT love the karoake. only bc i didnt know most of the songs people chose. maybe i just wasnt rocker enough for chicago....
