What a cool place. I could see how someone might be tempted to call it pretentious, but that person is loosing out. Fun concept (speakeasy), beautifully decorated, great service (when they realized that our server hadn't come over in a while, they delivered a complimentary round of cava -- none of us had complained, they just did it to be cool), and a relaxing atmosphere.  Putting all that aside, though, and what do you have left? AMAZING COCKTAILS and a very cool drink menu. And as far as I'm concerned, that is more important than whether the table next to mine is filled with yuppies, posers, or crack heads (yes, AMG S., I'm talking to you. It sounds like you're the one focused on whether you're part of a scene). I was able to enjoy a fun, relaxed evening with old friends, some relative privacy and space at a bar (!!), and my drink(s) -- the Part and Parcel -- is one of the best cocktails I have ever had. And isn't that the point?!
