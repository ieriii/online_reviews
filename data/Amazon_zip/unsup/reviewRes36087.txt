This place is awesome. I knew that I fell in love when I saw fried chicken skin in containers on the counter for 99 cents a piece! Everytime I go I plan to try something other than duck, but duck always finds it way to my plate. The menu has something for everyone and if not check out the specials written on the glass wall. Be prepared to be served a ton of food, which means delicious leftovers for tomorrow's lunch/dinner. Perfect! The only drawback to this place is they don't deliver. Why Sun-Wah? Why?
