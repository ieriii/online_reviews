Five star margaritas here. They're strong and delicious, and if it's Tuesday or Thursday, then they're half off. The food is top notch Mexican at very reasonable prices.  I always get the burrito. It's quite small inside, but the patio is great for sitting despite the lack of any view at all. They'll let you smoke outside or inside if you sit by the bar, but be ready to fend off some evil looks.
