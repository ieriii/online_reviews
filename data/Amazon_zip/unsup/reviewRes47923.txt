Glad it stopped raining as these Chitown storms appear out of nowhere. After eating at another restaurant, still wanted to do the outside/rooftop as this is a summertime favorite. The rain stopped and we hit up Zed451's for rooftop drinks. The crowd was cool and laid back on a week night (Thr) around 8pm. It indeed did get crowded as more people realized it was a fantastic evening to be out, clean air - nice breeze and not humid/hot at all. Drinks were great. Bartenders were on their A-Game. Most definitely will return. Also a place when you close out the tab you are like - hmph, could have invested in a small start-up for those drinks I just had.
