Giordano's had been recommended to me after I had posted a so-so review of Gino's East. I went to this Giordano's because it was the closest one to my apartment. Now that I'm reading other Yelper's reviews, I see that it generally gets crowded. Not the case on a weekday afternoon, but most people don't have the luxury of a 1.5 hour lunch break (the pizzas take about 45 minutes to cook, but you knew that already), so my party of 3 was seated quickly by a very friendly waiter.  DISCLAIMER: Though I have lived in the Chicago area for almost 6 years now, I am a true east-coaster and my stomach cannot adapt to deep dish pizza after 24 years of thin, fold-over, greasy New York-style pizza.  My friends and I ordered a medium deep-dish, half spinach. Since it was close to Valentine's Day, they shaped our pizza like a heart (bonus points!).  The pizza was very good but I felt a little sick after 1 piece and could not finish second slice, while my friends contemplated a 3rd. I was told that deep dish pizza has a lot more butter in the crust than regular pizza and that's why I never feel well after I eat it. I'm still going to go ahead and give it 4 stars for overall experience at the restaurant, taste of the pizza, my friends' opinions of it (they are true Chicagoans) and my low level of queasiness compared to Uno's and Due's.
