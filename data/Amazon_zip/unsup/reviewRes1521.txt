I was visiting Chicago and needed something to eat that Minnesota didn't offer so a friend of mine who lived there recommended Hot Doug's. He told me it was shown on the food channel once, but I didn't realize that would also mean waiting in line for an hour and a half. If you're not in a rush to be somewhere I recommend giving this place a try, at least once in your life. It truly is different and a gem. I have tried the Chicago Style Dog, The Salma Hayek, The Sally Vega, The Charlie Sheen and James Sohn, a polished sausage with some swiss cheese on it (forgot the name), and duck fat fries. Out of all of those my favorite was the polished sausage w/some swiss cheese and my least favorite would be The Charlie Sheen and James Sohn. It was my least favorite because it was mini bagel dogs and I found the bagel part make everything dry. I also didn't find anything extra special about the duck fat fries as everyone is claiming...they honestly taste just like regular fries to me! Pros: -inexpensive -lots and lots of varieties to choose from -Friendly and helpful customer service Cons: -long line -restaurant set up is kind've crowded + all of the people there too -street parking which gets hard to find b/c of all of the people there trying out hot doug's too. -they cut you off from waiting in line at 4pm daily -closed all day sundays I definitely would come back to try the other dogs that I haven't tried out yet!
