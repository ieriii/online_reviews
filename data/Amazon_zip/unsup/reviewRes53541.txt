Crisp is hands down awesome. Their BBQ chicken wings are perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of fried. I also highly recommend the Magic Mushrooms, which are battered and fried and come with Crisp's amazing dipping sauce. The staff is friendly and laid back and the food comes out pretty quickly. Love this place!
