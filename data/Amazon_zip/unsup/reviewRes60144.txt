Big fan of pho, and this place has the best in the area. We have tried EVERY one of them. Place is always packed and their menu is so large it is almost overhwleming. I get the pho everytime, my wife has mixed it up and has liked what she got everytime. Service is very very average but Im not sure thats exactly what they are looking for. Def more of a turn and burn kind of place. Not a lace to take a date unless its for lunch but fantastic Vietnamese for sure.
