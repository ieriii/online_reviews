I came here for dinner with my hubby and mother in law (who was visiting from out of state) a couple weeks ago. Zed451 is beautiful, with delicious food, and even better service. Most important- MAKE SURE YOU'RE HUNGRY! We came around 5pm on a Wednesday, so we had no problem with seating. We ordered a bottle of wine, and filled up at the Harvest Table (which is essentially a salad bar, only without the do-it-yourself salad of a normal salad bar, more like unique salads are presented). Unfortunately I filled up a little too much, and was kind of full by the time the entrees started. I tried a little bit of almost all the meats, and absolutely loved buttermilk sirloin, the rib, and the crab beginets. We also bought a Smores Pie. Yum! I'm glad there were 3 of us, because I was stuffed by the time dessert came. Our server Dwayne was hysterical and great- he made sure we had a great time. The chefs and managers were friendly. The food was amazing. If you're vegetarian, don't do the full service as it's very meat heavy, although the harvest table has lots of veggie friendly stuff, and if you're vegan, I think you're probably out of luck. I've read the mixed drinks are good, but I stuck with wine. If you like meat, and lots of food, this is your place! Can't wait to go back! :)
