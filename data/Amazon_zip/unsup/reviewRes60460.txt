The food was very good and our waiter was helpful. However, while we were enjoying our after-dinner drinks, we were asked to leave by the manager so they could have the table. Maybe we were lingering a bit, but there were all of 5 people waiting at the bar and no one was coming into the restaurant. A very nice evening was ruined by this pushy jackass. When this was pointed out to him on our way out, he blew us off. There are plenty of excellent italian restaurants in Chicago, so putting up with that kind of treatment is unnecessary. Needless to say, we won't be back.
