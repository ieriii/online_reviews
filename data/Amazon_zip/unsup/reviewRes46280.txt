After a very long flight from London to Chicago, we settled into our hotel and went out for a small bite to eat. Don't expect anything small at this place. Everything is massive - from the chairs, the tables, the chandeliers, the menu, the drinks and my word- the plates. I don't think I have been quite so shocked with US food portion sizes until this place. I ordered the chicken pot pie which was absolutely delicious (but about twice the size of my head). The food was so lovely here, we decided to go back again when I ordered another chicken dish which I think was called chicken royale (and nothing like the burger king one!) The service here was brilliant, although we did have to wait a while for a table. Although I would be happy to wait 5 more years just to get my hands off that chicken again. If only they delivered across the Atlantic...
