This place has such a great atmosphere that I had such high hopes for the place, but in the end the place did not live up to them. We had a 7pm reservation on Sunday night, but were running a bit ahead of schedule and showed up at about 6:30. The place seemed awesome from the second I walked in. The outside looked awesome and the atmosphere inside was so cool. I was so excited for the meal. I asked when we walked inside if it was possible to be seated early. He said if we were ok with a 2 seat booth than we could be seated immediately, but for a normal size table it would no be until 7. We decided to go with the small table, but before we even got our water they came over an offered to move us to a full size booth, which we did do. The waiter was extremely nice and the bread which he brought over with him was delicious. I ordered the New York Strip with fries and my girlfriend ordered the Filet with the wild rice. For a New York Strip steak the piece was not very fatty. There was only a couple of bites by the end that were, so this was a huge plus. The steak however, ordered medium, was extremely dry. Thankfully the plate was covered in juice so I soaked each piece before eating. The girlfriend's piece was also a bit overcooked, but she was not as lucky as to have the extra juices on the plate. The reason both were overcooked and kind of dry was because they clearly were sitting under the heat lamp for A LONG TIME. The plates were so scalding hot that you could not even touch them. The top of the girlfriends rice was very dried out, another sign of being under the heat lamp for a while. Although we did not try a dessert it did look really good. Over all the place was a bit disappointing, but I would definitely be willing to try the place again. The food was great quality, I just hope next time it come out quickly instead of continuing to cook under the heat lamp.
