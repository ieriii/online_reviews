We loved Chicago q! Everything was perfect---drinks, service, meal...everything. I made a reservation for 6:00 on a Saturday. It was early enough that the restaurant was still rather calm and quiet. Our server was very knowledgable on the menu. We started with the hush puppies and I had the brisket and hubby had the ribs.  I think this was my first time eating a rib EVER, and I loved it. The brisket was delicious and tender and I loved experimenting with all the sauces.  The way to my heart is through free little starters...and q's pickles and chips were perfect. We will definitely be back.
