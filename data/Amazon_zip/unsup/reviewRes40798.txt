I feel like food is like love. It doesn't have to be fancy, it is just important that it is quality. Of course it doesn't hurt when you take your love out and spruce it up once in a while... and this place was just right. I came here with my sweetie and we arrived at 6:30. We were the second couple in the place, and I thought "ruh-roh!" however within about 20 minutes or so the place started to fill up and by the time were were done with our 8 course journey of awesomeness the place was full. The eight courses came at just the right spacing... and they were phenomenal. We requested pescatarian menu and they were more than accommodating, calling me a few days ahead of time to confirm and make sure that we were on the same page. I loved the lobster and squash/corn soup, as well as the summer eight ways.  It was highly amazing. I would recommend this to anyone celebrating something a little special... cuz it is. OH!!! AND BYOB. How awesome is THAT?!
