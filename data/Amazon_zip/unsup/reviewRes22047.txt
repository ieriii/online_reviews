Superdawg to the rescue! In need of a Chicago dawg, served right to your car, just like how they used to way back when? Have no fear, SuperDawg is here! Served in a cute red rectangular box with the caveman-attired and tutu-adorned hot dog mascots on it, the superdawg comes with all the Chicago style hot dog condiments (neon green relish, pickle, onions, mustard, hot pepper, and a slice of tomato), with some crispy fries on the side, on a poppy seed bun. The hot dog was juicy and flavorful. Fries were crisp and hot. The bun was a little squashed and slightly soggy from the pickle on top, but all in all, a good hot dog.
