Ordered spaghetti a la patte with bolognese meat sauce (paid an extra 2$ cuz the sauce sounded yummy) for pick up, had high hopes because when I walked in it smelled so good! But was bummed when I got home and took a taste of my food. The meatballs were pretty much ground beef (no pork or veal) so it wasn't tender, just kind of dry, lacked real flavor (how bout a little garlic?!) but worst of all was the overall flavor of the dish. It had this weird taste. Also, it said it came with garlic bread but it was just a roll and they put a bunch of cheese on the top which had hardened and was completely stuck together by the time I got home- had to pull it off and toss it. For a woman who loves meatballs you know it's just not that good if I am willingly feeding my dog my food. bummed.
