I have been to this diner before but for dinner. We had crabcakes and salad which was average but reasonably priced. My second visit was for brunch was an altogether different experience and like others have said, we asked to wait a "few" minutes which we did (few=25 minutes). We were seated outside and it took the hosts about 20 minutes to even come back and ask about coffee.juice etc. This upon me going in to the bar and asking them to pay us some attention. One of the servers then stopped by and delivered normal coffee when decaf was ordered...left in a huff when we stated our order and said "I am not your original serve and we are quite busy so sorry for the delay???". Anyway, again, now we waited for our main course and finally our sever (tall, blonde guy with a goatee) stopped by with my omellet without cheese when the original order included cheese. By this time, I was quite a "hangry" customer so I just ate what I got and left a less than normal tip with specific notes as to why I tipped less. its been about 2-3 years since I had such a let down to pay lower than normal tip but I based this on the fact that our server didnt even stop by to refill our coffee during our meal. Well, as you might have guessed, I burned my bridges here and will not be going back, for good reason! if you do go back, Id recommend not choosing the server we had but I dont know if thats a choice or if he was just having a bad day!
