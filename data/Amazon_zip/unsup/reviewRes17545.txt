It was alright. The ambiance and service were top notch, but the food wasn't anything to write to India about. The chicken tikka was a bit runny and all of the items on the buffet tasted alike. I still can't get over the grease factor, but I've had some tasty greasy Indian food over the years and this was hardly worth the calories. The tandoori chicken and the naan were average and I've had MUCH better at places that charge a third less. While my water glass was never more than half empty, i felt like it was a trick to fill me up on the free liquids so I couldn't down as much food! Nice tactic under the guise of attentive service! Tricky Tricky! I must be spoiled by the plethora of Curry in a hurry joints in San Francisco....cheap, tasty, and filling.... who needs someone hovering over you constantly filling your water glass if you can make away with chicken tikka, rice, and naan for under $10 bucks??
