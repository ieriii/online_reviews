Amazing food and service. Our server was Elizabeth and she was excellent. She was attentive, friendly and fast. I had the SWEET POTATO QUESADILLA which I recommend - very tasty. My friend had the Duck Ala Orange and it was amazing. I also had the Pinot Noir - not the best wine I've ever had, but pretty good. For dessert I got the raspberry espresso chocolate cheesecake. I have to say I didn't like it that much. I wanted to try the chocolate chip cheesecake, but they were sold out. Apparently that is one of the favorites. I was surprised when the check came as I was expecting it to be more than it was since we both got desserts and drinks. I also recommend sitting outside if it is nice weather and they have space available. I highly recommend this place and will go back again soon!
