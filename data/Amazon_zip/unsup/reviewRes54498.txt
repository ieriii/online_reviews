The Chicago Diner is the quintessential vegetarian/vegan restaurant! Hands down. My favorite thing to order is the Ruben, and I order it almost everytime I go there. They seem to have a good range of dishes there, including soups, and mashed potatoes with gravy. In the summer they have a nice outdoor eating area which I love. The staff is always pleasant and upbeat, despite them being busy. I would reccomend this to anyone, even if they are not a vegetarian. Just good stuff!!
