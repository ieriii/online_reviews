The most delicious meal I had in Chicago!!! We shared the Xoco salad with chicken and Ahogada, which was basically like the Mexican answer to a meatball sub. I can't even. So delicious. I will be back fro the juices, which looked really good, and for a caldo when it gets cold again. The line process was efficient and quick, so don't be deterred. If you're starving by the time you order, get some chips and guac, they serve them up first.
