I am torn between a 3 and 4 star rating for this place...so I'll give it a 3.5.Had dinner at The Gage last night. Food was good, but a bit over priced for what we ordered. The mussels can't compare to Hop Leaf's, but the Gage burger was pretty good. The curry sauce was thin, which was disappointing. The decor was cool. I really liked their selection of tiles on the walls. Unfortunately, it was REALLY loud and hard to talk with companions, esp. at a table for six. It was a nice gesture when the owner, Billy Lawless, stopped at our table when I said 'hello' and he 'seemed' to remember us from his days at the Grafton. Worth a visit to experience all the hype for yourself.
