You know, I've been here a handful of times now, and I'm really just not sure why we take the crazy trek all the way to Pilsen to eat here. The food isn't bad, in fact, its just fine. But that is where it ends. The food really is "just fine." Not great or wonderful. There are plenty of Mexican eateries in Chicago that have better quality food. That being said, it isn't bad either, and if you are in the area looking for a place to eat, it might be worth giving a try.
