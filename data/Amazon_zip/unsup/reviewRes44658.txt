First of all, I think it needs to be stated that up until I arrived at Giordano's and saw pictures in the menu, I had been GROSSLY misinformed as to the exact appearance of deep-dish Chicago pizza. Having assumed it was pretty much the same as New York style, coming face to face with what seemed like a cheese-and-cheese-alone quiche of sorts was a delicious if not intimidating surprise. We showed up as a group of six in the middle of the suppertime rush yet were only given a five minute wait time - just long enough to pre-order the pizzas since they take a good long time to cook. With a cheese pizza, a spinach and cheese pizza ordered, and a great deal of confidence in our own appetites, we were off to our table to enjoy pitchers of beer and a slammin' Caesar salad. The place definitely has the hustle and bustle of an Italian eatery but doesn't go so far with it that you can't have real conversations with your friends. Tables come ready with big plates, small plates, and little stands that help you manage sharing dishes without your table turning into the restaurant equivalent of a little kid's bedroom. Service was snappy but not overbearing. Added bonus: a server who could help us decide how much food/drink we'd actually need for our shared feast. The answer? Way less than we ordered but of course, it was too late. I tapped out after a piece and a half of our two medium pizzas, each one packed with about half the height of an iPhone worth of cheese. Even with six of us, I'm pretty sure we took half a pizza home when all was said and done. Embarrassing considering I think of myself as a bit of a pro pizza eater... All in all, a fantastic first deep-dish experience that is already keeping me awake at night dreaming of the next time I'll encounter and triumph over my Moby Dick of pizza pies!
