So I love Indie Cafe...seriously it's legit. Great sushi variety, seriously fresh fresh fresh ingredients, amazing spring rolls, I could go on!! Cool combo of full bar and/or the option to BYOB for a small corkage fee, great and attentive service. The only reason it scores 4 instead of 5 stars for me is the 1.) ambiance ...often cramped quarters which can cause you to involuntarily over hear details from another's conversation. This for me is a pet peeve, I don't want to be so cramped in that my chopsticks are poking my neighbor in the face and 2.) While the sushi is delish...the thai part of the menu doesn't do it for me. I have had much better Thai right around the corner at Ben's Noodle on Bryn Mawr (which I believe has the best Thai in the city.) Overall though, visit Indie Cafe. It is worth it. The hubs and I keep going back...at least for the sushi.
