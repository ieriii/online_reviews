I read somewhere that this was the new 'It' bar for Chicago and I can definitely see why. The vibe in the bar is cool and trendy. It's a great spot to go on a date (romantic lighting) and strong drinks. I went with work friends, but no matter it was still a great time. There is a bar in the basement with couches (warning the downstairs is cash only) that has the feel of a hidden speakeasy. The drinks are expensive, but they are worth it. We had eaten a little earlier, so we just grabbed some sides at appetizers and they were great. We ordered the brussel sprouts with bacon and the cauliflower, which were both delicious and you didn't feel bad eating them. The hamachi was also delicious. I would definitely come back here again!
