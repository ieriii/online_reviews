There isn't a lunch this side of my grandmother's cooking that is as good as a good Cuban sandwich and cafe cubano. With that said 90 miles does a great job at what they do. To me the enjoyable experience goes in this order (from least to most): Cafe Mariano La Unica Cafecito El Cubanito 90 miles Cuban The food is better than La Unica and Cafecito. Cafe Mariano makes me want to drop kick people. Food wise, I like El Cubanito a little better, but 90 miles was more pleasant in that there are seats. The waits are short. The owner up front is very friendly. Not to mention the Guava Cream Cheese empanada is great. I had the Ropa Vieja (2 points over El Cubanito who always claims to be out) and it was very, very good on the cold day. A little rumor is that another outpost is opening on Armitage where Calvin's was. That is a walk, summer or winter, and that is good news for me.
