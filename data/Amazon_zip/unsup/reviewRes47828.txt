My husband and I stopped by for a drink on the rooftop last weekend, when it was super warm out, and we thoroughly enjoyed. Very pretty crowd, nice ambiance, good drinks, and great service. We had a little trouble finding seating, but given how nice the weather was, it was understandable. My only complaint would be that the seating at the bar was super uncomfortable. The stools had these cut outs on the seat, and I could feel my thighs seeping thru...gross, I know. So if you're trying to look cute, I suggest you stand if you can't find a seat at one of their nice tables with wrap around benches.
