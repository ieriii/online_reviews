Ended up rolling in here when I first arrived in Chi town. It was packed but it wasn't to ridiculous of a wait. Deep dish pizza was always something I never craved for but I wanted to try the real deal in Chicago. The first thing ordered was the spinach/mozarella sticks that were very good. It was fried but it was still overall delicious and fresh. The pizza I ordered was the hot peppers sausage pizza which came out about 45 min after I ordered. It was a behemoth at medium size this could feed 4 people prob. Definitely not something to get with just 2 people. It is basically a deep dish pizza with a rather huge patty of meat on top of cheese than covered with tomato sauce and peppers. Flavor wise it was really good filling me up after 2 slices. The corn crust was pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of carbs so it's on the large size but it came out pipping hot and fresh. Flavors were great too. Service was great too. I noticed a lot of service in Chicago was great. This is definately a spot to come check out if you've never had deep dished pizza. I still favor NY style. They also do offer this btw but of course I came to try the Chi town style pizza.
