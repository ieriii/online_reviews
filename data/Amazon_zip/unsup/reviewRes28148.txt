You can't find a better spot in my opinion for some good ol mexican food...the prices are low...the food is always good and the service is a little slow but only because they are always so busy...I LOVE the Tampiquena steak...yummy...large strip of steak with beans and rice...it's almost too much food..yeah the bathroom could use an upgrade and the place is not exactly fancy...but neither is good mexican food..tip: if you want to during lunch time, get there before 11:30 or you will be in a healthy line of people waiting to be seated..it is worth the wait though...P.S. CASH ONLY..there is an atm but its out of order sometimes...oh yeah...its BYOB
