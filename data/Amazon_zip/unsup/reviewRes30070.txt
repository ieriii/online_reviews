This is by far my favorite restaurant in the city, and here is why: (1) They play awesome music all the time (Kings of Leon, Interpol, Cut Copy), (2) Their food is awesome (Corination Chicken Salad, Homemade Soups, Great Coffee, Cappuccini, etc.), (3) The Staff is super cool, (4) The vibe is very relaxing (It's just a really chill Coffee House). It's such a stress relief to just go there, and I have probably eaten there 50+ times and brought dozens of people through (all loved it). Do not hesitate to give third coast a try, you won't regret it.
