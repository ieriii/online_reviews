Rick Bayless is one of my favorite chefs! My first visit I had frontera grill and loved the food! On my second trip I wanted to try this little sandwich shop next door... the line wasnt too bad and it moved pretty fast. Seating might be tough though cause its first come first serve type of spot. If I remember correctly I ordered the pork sandwich and I compared it to Paseo's pork sandwich. The XOCO sandwich came nothing close to how delicious Paseo's pork sandwich. It was good but not great! Maybe I'll give this place another try when I visit Chicago again.
