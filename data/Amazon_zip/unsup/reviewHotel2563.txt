After my one and only visit I give this place 3 1/2 stars, but I have a feeling it will go up after the next time I drop by. The interior is definitely something to see, it's cool in a very odd sort of way. The set-up kind of made me feel like I was in someone's living room (someone with an affinity for pictures of naked women since that's what is all over the walls), but it was very eye-catching and original. The ten dollar cover was a bit annoying since it wasn't particularly crowded and we were inside by 11:00, but I did notice that all of the employees were very friendly and not at all pretentious, which was definitely a nice change. I would recommend starting with drinks at Fulton Lounge, which is just around the corner, and then heading over to Victor Hotel.
