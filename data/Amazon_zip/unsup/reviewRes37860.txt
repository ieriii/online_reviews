I hear a lot of people bitching and moaning about how crowded this place gets. Yes, it is mega packed downstairs, but once you go upstairs it's a lot more comfortable. I've been lucky a time or two to score a table downstairs, but end up going up stairs because it's much better. I also dig the music they play. I usually hear old rockabilly music when I go upstairs. After hearing people rant and rave about their mussels, I have tried them. They are ok. I'm not a fan of mussels, but I tried them.  They do have rather large beer selection. It might take you a while to get it. Grab the bartenders attention and they'll get to you a bit quicker. Just don't be some crab ass towards them as they try get to everyone as soon as they can. Hoplead, I give you four "cheers to you" on the "cheers to you scale."
