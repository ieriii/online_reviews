One word......Amazing! I could not give this visit any less than 5 stars and quite frankly I'd like to give 6. The highlights for our table was the lobster risotto and the crouton filled with mascarpone that was the centerpiece of out Caesar Salads. We could have eaten an entire plate of those over sized croutons. Excellent service, nice wine list and sublime favors. A pricey meal for sure but definitely a must try for respectable foodies. Enjoy!
