Unbelievable evening that our "Ladies Dinner Group" will NEVER forget! We have been dining together once a month for over 25 years, and this is by far, one of the best, and definitely most memorable, of any restaurant we have ever been! We were treated like royalty throughout the night. Scott, Paige, and Joe made sure we had the best selections they served, from start to finish. Hard to pick a favorite because everything was first rate. We started with Focaccia Di Recco (baked focaccia with soft cow cheese), Roasted Heart of Palm, Roasted Beets,Roasted Cherry Tomato and Burrata Cheese, and a Roasted Corn, walnuts, mushroom and goat cheese salad. We then moved onto spaghetti and black pepper, ravioli wit spinach, and a polenta dish. We ended with every dessert on the menu! Truly every menu item we tried (and we certainly tried most of them...) was flavorful and very delicious. My personal standouts were the raviioli with spinach, baked focaccia, and the parfait, cheesecake dessert. This is such a fun and enjoyable way to spend an evening -- tasting small plates of a broad range of amazing tastes and flavors. Thank you, thank you, thank you from the 9 very satisfied female diners who visited you tonight.
