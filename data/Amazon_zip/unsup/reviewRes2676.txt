Ok, it's about time someone puts the kool aid down and writes a critical review of this place. Number one. I've been to this place since it was on Addison and Western so shut up. Number two. This place mysteriously closes for days and sometimes seemingly weeks at a time, making my drive in the middle of day during the week (yes, that's the only realistic time to go since it closes at 4 and complete lunatics start forming human shields around the outside of the place on weekends like they're protecting it from Al Queda who just declared Jihad on hot dogs) completely pointless and a waste of time. Doug, stop taking vacations, or at the very least, find someone competent or adopt a man-child to run the place when you're gone for chrissakes. It's called running a business. Number three. Yeeeeeeeeeeeeah, it's hot dogs, people. Ok, maybe "encased meats" tickles your fancy more, but you get my drift. Number four. The stuff is good. So good I could drive there again tomorrow when it's closed.
