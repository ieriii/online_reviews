Typically I'm a Chicago deep dish pizza gal, however Piece is on my short list of places I'll make the exception for and go thin crust. Especially when it's Mash Potato and Meatball pizza with Golden Arm beer to wash it down. I would have tried one of their dessert, but I decided to eat an extra slice instead. Next time! I was impressed how busy they were for a Sunday night. That said, I didn't feel the quality of service was compromised in any way, shape or form.  Overall, a great visit and I can't wait to go back.
