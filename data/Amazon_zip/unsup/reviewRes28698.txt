I was napping (at home) when my neighbor stopped by to say hello. So, after an house of chatting, we realized that neither of us had plans for dinner. It was a toss up between Indian and Thai. The Thai's had it.. My neighbors recommended Opart. This place is in a great location at Lincoln/Western. For me, very easy to get to.  After arriving, I see that my neighbors were correct in that this place is always busy. In total, there were five of us and we were seated quickly on a Friday evening (8p). We ordered a few appetizers and our own main course. Everyone loved their dishes. I ordered my dish hot and I still needed the chili sauce to spice it up. Service was fast and good (even though it was very busy). Would definitely go back.!!
