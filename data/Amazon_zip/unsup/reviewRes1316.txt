Seriously, there's a reason why this place is so hot. We made the drive out there (plenty of street parking btw), waited in line for 20 minutes and it was worth every second!  The food is awesome for the tiny bucks you'll spend. The energy is awesome and the crowd is electic- hipsters, families, yuppies, you name it. I'm a small girl but put away two hot dogs, cheese fries and two drink refills. The staff is incredibly friendly and happy to see you there. I have to admit that the hours and location make it oddly special and sought after...the experience makes it worth the planned trip.
