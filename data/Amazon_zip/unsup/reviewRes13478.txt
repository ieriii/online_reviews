Okay, so if I've dined here twice last week and will be returning on Sunday, then that means this place has got to be good! Thanks to Keshia C. for taking me to a wonderful spot! The place is smaller than I would have imagined; it was packed, but we were seated within a couple minutes.  First of all, never ever pass up the clam chowder soup....that stuff is amazing. It's so creamy and so chunky with big pieces of clam! I was disappointed when I saw it in a small cup, but once I licked the chunky goodness off of the spoon, I had a feeling that I was going to like this place....and so was the case. We ordered crab cakes and the all-you-can-eat special for thursday, which was a basket of garlic shrimp and spicy shrimp. It came with a corn on the cob, marinara sauce, and coleslaw. Crabcakes were delicious and filling, and the shrimp was quite tasty. The spicy ones were definitely spicy, which I enjoyed. Visit number 2, I took the fiance here and we went the breakfast route. Once again, I ordered the wonderful clam chowder and he absolutely loved it. I also ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and he ordered a mushroom and ham omelette that had these cool potato pancakes on the side. We definitely agreed that this isn't anything close to your ihop or golden nugget, it's all quality food here! Can't wait to come back!
