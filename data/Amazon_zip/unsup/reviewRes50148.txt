The space itself is the biggest asset of Big Jones. I enjoyed the wall-hangings, the tables, the chairs, the layout. All of that was well done. The service was fine. Our waiter was friendly and accommodating Though I found the service a bit slow, it was not egregiously so. Perhaps this is part of the southern motif. The food is fine. The cornbread is very good. I got the gumbo appetizer and would agree with others who have complained that it was a bit burned. Again, not enough for me to write it off completely, but I will not likely order it on a return visit. My date had the cucumber soup which was apparently top notch and unexpectedly a little spicy. I got the chicken and dumplings entree. Another reviewer complained of the amount of cracked pepper put onto the dish as well as the lackluster lima beans come butter beans. Both complaints were valid, but overall the dish was fine. I don't think that it was worth $14, but it was enjoyable. If you go in expecting the service to be a little slow and the food to be fine, but not quite worth the price, Big Jones will hit the spot. Should I find myself pining for southern food within walking distance, I'll be coming back.
