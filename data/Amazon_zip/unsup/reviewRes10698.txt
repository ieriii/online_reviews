Does anyone else wish that the hair salon nest to Piece would close up shop so Piece can expand more? That ^ relates to the only drawback to Piece. The large crowd. I do my best to only come to Piece for lunchtime now. Also, they need to brew up some more Top Heavy... Still, I give it 5 stars because I can not find better beer anywhere else and the pizza is excellent. Is it true that years ago they used to have macaroni & cheese for a topping?
