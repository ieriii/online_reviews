Apparently we were not the first to discover Longman & Eagle! My husband and I and another couple had decided to double date on Saturday night and try this place out. Knowing that they don't take reservations we had a contingency plan in mind and were willing to spend a little quality time in the bar until we were seated (twist our arm). As we walked in, we quickly noticed the place was packed and when we asked for a table for 4, they politely told us that they were no longer seating tables for 4 and that it was likely longer than a 3 hour wait for dinner! Dejected, we left and decided we'd try again another time...after all, it really smelled delicious!!!  We'll be back for another attempt Longman & Eagle....we haven't given up yet!
