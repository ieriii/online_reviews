The boyfriend and I visited Chi-town during Valentine's Day weekend and on Chinese New Year, we decided to get Chinese food for dinner. We yelped this place and because of its high reviews, we gave it a shot. We ordered the ma-po tofu, garlic shrimp, and some spicy chicken dish and honestly, I've definitely had better Chinese food. This place is just a hype. It wasn't anything special. Definitely worth skipping out on.
