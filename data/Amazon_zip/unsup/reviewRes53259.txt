The food is great, one of the owners Mir is an excellent human being........ the problem is his sister. We drove almost 50 miles to have a dinner at an unfortunate time when there was a Persian concert in town. We saw 4 couples in front of us get seated and other Persian friends/family who bypassed us because they knew the owner. On top of that the owners sister cannot communicate in English properly and kept asking me for a resolution and when I said what she did was unfair and wrong, she indicated that I should sit on top of her head. The food at this place is amazing but the owners sister needs an attitude check along with the realization that helping your own Persian friends thru connections is not a good image to have with your customers.
