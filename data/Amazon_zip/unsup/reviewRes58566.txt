Definitely like this place. One of my favorite places in Bucktown. This place has a great atmosphere and the pizza is good too. Not a bad place to be single either. I'll never forget the time I sang Band on the Run during a live Karaoke gig one night. Parking is a major challenge so grab a cab or take the Blue line if you can.
