I thought the food at this place was excellent. My biggest issue with the restaurant is being asked to leave as soon as I rest my fork on my plate or take my last sip of wine, beer, etc.  Here is a tip to restaurant owners: If you want to keep people coming back, don't ask them to fucking leave the millisecond that they have completed their meal. I think we were there maybe an hour. I understand that they want to get as many people in the door, but this was ridiculous and from what I understand, was not the first time this has happened. I will go back because I liked the food, but if they think of pulling this shit again, it will be the last time.
