Great place for seafood enthusiasts. I love whenever I can make it before 5:30 for their daily catch specials. Such a steal! You basically get a choice of three fish and whatever sides they come with plus salad or soup. Their clam chowder is delish and is a chockful of clams. Service has always been great and attentive (if not overly attentive at times). I definitely want to come back for their all you can eat king crab special.
