I like the deep dish here, perhaps even more than the original Uno's (is this a travesty?). The crust is crisp outside, soft inside, and it's not oily. The cheese is super elastic. The sausage is spicy, flavourful, and sliced generously. The bread is warm and fresh. Soda refills are free. One star off for service - the last time I came here, it wasn't busy but the server forgot our drinks and neglected our table. Call ahead with your order so you don't have to wait 45 minutes for pizza. Don't stray from deep dish either! I tried their baked pasta, and it basically was regular ziti with a slice of mozzarella melted (microwaved?) over it.
