We have heard so much about this restaurant and many people were raving about it, so we thought we'd give it a try for a friends birthday. Somehow the gods were with us, because we were able to get a reservation for 9 people on a Friday night. We arrived and we had to wait a little, so we had drinks at the bar. We got seated not in the big room, but a little side room next to the patio. My only criticism is that the room was so dark, we all pulled out our smart phones and installed the flashlight app, so that we could read the menu. But once we ordered, the darkness only lit by candlelight actually created a very cozy atmosphere. Although everybody liked their food, I can only speak to what I ordered. I had the beet salad, which was mixed with citrus segments. It was so yummy that I tried to copy it at home the next week. As Main course I had the milk braised pork shank and wow that was delicious (yes, I know - I used delicious - Bobby Flay would call me out on that). The meat was so succulent and tender I was able to pull it off the bone with my fork. I think the greens on the side were Kale, which can be hit or miss, but in this case it was a big hit and went perfectly with the meat. It was a large portion and luckily I applied the Martina Navratilova style (where you cut the portion in half immediately after serving) - otherwise I would have devoured the entire meal because it was so good. Even the next day the other half of my portion was so delicious and the flavors kept very well. There are many great Italian restaurants in the city, but not many of them leave such a great memory. I'm writing this review about 6 weeks after we've been there (yes, I'm a procrastinator), but I'm remembering every little detail.
