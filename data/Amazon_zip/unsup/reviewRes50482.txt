I have been here for dinner several times, but still have yet to try their much recommended breakfast.  The cocktails are always meticulously made. A perfect balance of flavors and the much needed alcohol.  The menu always has something new - I love the pork belly (several different ways) and crab cakes. I usually get the special. The last time I got a great fish dish that melted in my mouth. I've had friends get the burger, which they couldn't stop raving about.  Big Jones is perfect comfort food. Always more than enough, I almost feel like I'm back in the south.  Service has been spotty. I've had excellent service, normal service and lacking service. Just cross your fingers, the food will always make up for any deficiencies here.
