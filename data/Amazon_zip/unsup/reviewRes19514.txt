The latest food trend in Chicago is not from any one culture or cuisine, it's called Standing In Line. Maybe this is our price to pay for eating high end food at a low end price point - but whatever the reason is, if someone like favorite son Rick Bayless tells you to do it, you just shrug and go to the back of the queue, knowing that what awaits you is bound to be good. The specialty here is the torta, which is a meat-filled sandwich. For such a simple dish, the quality and preparation is key in separating the street-food from the haute-street-food. XOCO succeeds - and once you have your food (and your table, and awkwardly timed and orchestrated event), you can see why Bayless's cooking is so revered. The flavors are all good, not overwhelming, but done just so. We shared the Ahogada or carnitas torta, which was supposed to be the best and made even more special by its dine-in only status. It was good, but I didn't care for the fact that it was served in a bowl with sauce on the bottom, adding unnecessary sogginess. The Pepito, or braised short rib torta, was amazing. That is the one I would recommend to anyone - the meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the accompaniments were just perfect. I had a bite of the Churros (delicioso) and the Mexican Vanilla Ice Cream with Maple, Bacon and Pecan Streusel (muy muy delicioso), and I can tell you with conviction - save room for dessert. Is it worth it to stand in line? I think so. Would I go again? Definitely. There are 4 more wood-burning oven tortas that I have yet to try, as well as 3 from the griddle, and I will do my best to dwindle down that list next time I am in Chicago. Note: watch the time that you go, because not everything is available when you think it might be. Breakfast till 10, Tortas only after 11am, and Caldos (soup) after 3pm. Closed Sunday and Monday.
