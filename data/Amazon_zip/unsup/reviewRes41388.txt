Ruth's Chris Chicago used to be (not sure how) independent of the other Ruth's Chris restaurants. There food always was good UNTIL they switched to being part of the chain in the past year. Now the food is good, not great.  Went there for my birthday counting on the fantastic food that I have experienced numerous times before and was completely disappointed. They wouldn't do anything that wasn't on the menu due to being part of the chain now. So where before they went above and beyond to please, now ya don't. They do have the best dinner salad that I have ever, ever tasted though. Not sure why it is so good, but it is. Fresh. Crisp. Awesome.
