Ok, I've lived in wicker park for 3 years and we finally visited this bar lastnight. It's a large room with a lot of tall green velvet curtins. WTF are you all raving about. Yes, the lights are low, yes the door is disguised like a wall with a giant door handle. The drinks are very flavorful, however they also contain a single ice cube large enough to render a baby seal unconscious. Less ice, more drink please. Why did I wait in line, why was the service so slow. The music selections were very a pleasant mix of classic rock and current hipster audio, they have a limited but nicely rounded scotch selection. The the provided candle on the table to read the menu. If your trying to impress a date come here. If your in a group of friends and your not to snooty to just drink in a normal bar, avoid this joint. Whats the point of getting scene here...if it's to dark to see anything!
