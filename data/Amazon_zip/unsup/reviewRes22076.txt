I came here before a Hawks game a few weeks ago and my my my what a delight! I feel like I'm always giving reviews 5 stars, but I really don't know if I'm just going to all the right places, too positive about places or what! But really, this place was a hoot. My older brother took me here with his little daughters (my adorable nieces) before a Sunday night Hawks game. I, never having Greek food, was completely open but nervous about it! My bro knew all the right stuff. He told me what Mousaka was, Dolmades, Keftedes and Kontosouvli was. Whether or not I can remember right now and tell YOU what it was in another story. Basically what I think I had was meatball, pork, some sort of wrapped grape thing... I... I just don't really know. All I know it was damn good! Obviously the best part of the place is their FLAMING CHEEEEESE! People go crazy for this stuff and I can see why! We literally just ate the cheese, no bread no nothin! So good!  Also, if you go there before a Hawks game they treat you like royalty because they know you need to get in and out right away! I don't know how the treatment is for just the average diner, but boy do they know how to serve ya once they see whatsss up! Well there ya have it. Not sure if I helped anyone out but it was a happy surprise to me. If you've never had Greek food, go here, but I would recommend going with someone who knows a thing or two about Greek food or has been there before! Thank god my bro was there, otherwise I would have had no idea what to choose... but yet, that kinda makes it fun, no?
