I recently dined at Carnivale, for a second date. I wanted to go somewhere nice, with atmosphere...but also something that wouldn't kill the bank. Carnival was a great choice, and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Pro's: $5 valet parking Great attentive service Delicious Food Great decor and overall feeling Negatives: We got sat in a small room off the main dining area. It was nice and intimate (which was nice) but away from the "action". They have a lot of seating areas, so make sure to specify what type of atmosphere you're looking for. The Costilla de Res was absolutely delicious. Well done Carivale!
