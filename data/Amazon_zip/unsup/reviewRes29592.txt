The food (pasta) is great. And I love pasta. In fact most of the dishes are at least good. The staff is attentive and you get your meal pretty soon. This is a simple place with good food and good service at a decent price. It pulls off what it sets out to do. My only complaint is the salad. The croutons are always soggy and the house salad has way too many beans in it. When I order a house salad, I don't expect to get beans.
