very authentic and very spicy!!!! the food here never fails to amaze me. if you decide to go, please don't be the average american dumbass by ordering egg rolls, fried rice & mongolianbeef . try the diced beef with tofu or the sour pickle fish soup. be adventurous, you won't be sorry... if china town is too much of a headache for you, the have a location in palatine on nw highway with plenty of parking & the same exact menu & quality.how tired i am of hearing who has the best damn eggroll. who cares!!!! good luck trying to find eggroll if you ever visit china as its NOT a traditional chinese food!
