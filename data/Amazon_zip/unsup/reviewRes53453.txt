As a member of the James Beard Society; a self proclaimed gourmand; having eaten at 3 star Michelin and 4 star US restaurants, this was truly the most innovative dining I have ever experienced. Of the 13 courses there were maybe 2 that did not knock me off my seat. And one was the plainest: a piece of somewhat chewy lamb with potatoes. The other was a duck confit in a mole sauce. Fair. But the presentation will remain with you for life: they served this course on a pillow of air that released its essence when the plate was carefully placed on the pillow. Smoke essence engulfed the nose and palette. The duck was good but not great.Overall I'd give this restaurant a 99 and truly rate it as the finest dining experience of my 65 years. Liquid balls of butter or grape juice that would burst with flavor when either pricked with the tine of your fork or the roof of your mouth.. explosion of flavor..A simple WOW.BTW: it was the most expensive dinner ever. the 12 course meal is $145 pp plus wines, water, tax (at 11.25%!) tip; etc. we had 3 glasses of champagne -- $18 each. Then a bottle of Vouvray at $45 (one of the least expensive wines on list and delicious). Wine pairings are available at 75% of the dinner price. Add a 20% tip with the 11.25% Chicago tax and you add almost 1/3 to the total bill.  It is worth it for a very special occasion.Enjoy...the Burgermaven
