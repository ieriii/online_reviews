I can't believe I lived at my current place, which is withing 5 minutes of walking to Hot Doug's, for 2 years now and only today I had the chance to stop by! I pass in front of this place daily and never fail to see the line down the block. So today was the same of course...but the line actually moves quicker than one might think. I just ordered a regular Chicago style hot dog with everything in it, and of course the cheese fries! I think I should have ordered 2 of them though, because one definitely wasn't enough for me. It was so delicious I could eat even 3! It's a very friendly place that delivers fast and great service.
