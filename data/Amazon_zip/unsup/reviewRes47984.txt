I went there for a Sunday brunch with no idea what I was getting myself into. Great food (try the red wine poached eggs!) and FANTASTIC service! Barry was our waiter, and he took care of us as if we were his best friends. He made recommendations, offered to serve us a plate at a time so we could easily share, was quick to return and check on us . . . I am all about great food and I am willing to pay a little extra when amazing service is also on the menu. I'd recommend this place to anyone (but I would suggest a reservation if it's a weekend brunch).
