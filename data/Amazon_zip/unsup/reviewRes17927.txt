heres the deal: despite my less-than-positive overall opinion of the place, i think it has enough virtues to warrant at least one visit. im going to start with the cons: -sigh. the people. (granted, i dont like crowds, and i dont like loud/obnoxious/rude/snotty people, so if youre not bothered by that (and i do have friends who just dont seem to notice/care these things (yes, im envious -- id love to be more chill. sigh.)), dont give it a second thought.) -the line. im actually a good queue-er, and a patient person, so lines dont bother me in general. but the people (and if youre offended by this -- i dont mean you. im sure youre a very considerate, normal person.) who ive encountered in line here have been rude and self-important. ew.  -the hostesses/wait staff (note: not the bartenders, who have been universally cool): WOW. its almost like theyve been forced to watch hours of footage of rude hostesses and then they were told that their jobs depended upon emulating that behavior. yeah, im gonna go with that theory because it saves me from thinking theyre just not nice people.  pros: -the interior is interesting and fun -- the aesthetic is very lewis carroll-esque, and very, very different.  -the drinks are excellent! yes, theyre pricey, but you just have to come here expecting that. -it *is* possible to avoid the crowd. i would also recommend sitting at the bar (once youve enjoyed the alice in wonderland chairs :) (theyre fun, but they make conversation surprisingly difficult, incidentally.)). the bar is nice because you can watch the bartenders work, and the stools are plush and comfy. -easy to get to on public transit. overall: great drinks (for a price), interesting ambience, avoid like the plague on weekends. *random side note: every one of the five times ive been here (spanning different days of the week/time frames), someone has fallen down (like, drunk). dunno why i felt the need to share that, but there it is.
