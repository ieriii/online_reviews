We have had great experiences here. The staff is friendly & knowledgeable & the owner goes out of his way to greet people & offer apps, like truffle pizza slices. We've sat outside & inside & both are great. Their pizza is eerily familiar to the pizza we had in Rome & Florence. It is just a simple & good place.
