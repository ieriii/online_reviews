En route to pick up our tuxedos for my best friend's wedding, we stopped at Crisp for an early lunch 3 days ago. The three of us ordered a meal that consisted of a full chicken, 2 sides, and 2 sodas. We decided to get half the chicken prepared with Seoul Sassy and the other half was Plain Jane. Our sides were fries and onion rings. To my delight, the chicken was succulent and perfectly complemented the crispy, seasoned exterior. Although the Asian-inspired Seoul Sassy was my clear front-runner, the subtle flavor of Plain Jane did not disappoint. Both varieties were presented fresh from the fryer and begging to be devoured. The fries were reminiscent of McDonalds and the onion rings were satisfactory. Clearly, where this place shines is in the chicken. I'd love to return and sample the other, more diverse sides. Based on the chicken alone, I would give Crisp 4 stars. But, the extra effort of our server, John, to make sure we enjoyed our experience warrants an extra star. I was very pleased with my experience overall and I'm interested in returning to try one of the many other types of meals available at this establishment.
