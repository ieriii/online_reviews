This is my official Recession Mexican Destination, and on my New Year's resolution list going forward: Eat Here More Often. Not much more to report than the other 200+ reviews. Our service was fine, prices were cheap-o, and the food was fine. Thanks to anyone who gave a shout out to the beef entrees; the strip steak was great. Oh, and BYOB is sweet. The mega-secret-parking is on Laflin, just south of 18th. As reported, its small n' cozy. Watch out for the nearsighted drivers who short the spaces on the angled parking, trapping your car in limbo.
