I came here to eat dinner last year during July 4 holiday. The place was very busy and the food was really good. So I decided to bring my family there yesterday! It was not so great. The side dishes are as variety as before. JabChe is a good as usual. However, the BBQ meat was not good and was poorly cut, which made the meat impossible to chew!
