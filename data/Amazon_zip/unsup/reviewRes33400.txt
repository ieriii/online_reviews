Ambiance for breakfast places is especially important to us and this place is cute, cozy, and definitely cheery! We love the sunny colors highlighting the spacious interior of the restaurant and the decor is simple and non-cheeeeezy...we've been to too many breakfast places with farm decor or filled with chicken figurines.  We are satisfied every time we visit this place and are especially fans of the corned beef hash and the skillets! Large, generous portions at a great price...under $10! Portions are so large that one order usually lasts me 2 or three more breakfasts :) We love this place and always brings a smile to our faces and perks up our mornings!
