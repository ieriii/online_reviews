Decent deep dish pizza. Got a primarily meat combo pizza, and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. Thankfully, the weather was nice, and had a pleasant time sitting outside while waiting. Pizza is better than Gino's East. Wait staff was average at best. Could be better? Yes. Deal breaker? No. Definitely worth another visit.
