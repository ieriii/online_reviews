Kinzie Chophouse is a good place to go for upscale steakhouse dining in Chicago that offers a little more variety than some other restaurants of the same type. I had excellent, friendly and attentive service, and the atmosphere is classy without being stuffy. The food is good to very good, but I would not say that it is great. I would say it is par for the course.
