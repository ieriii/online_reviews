The food is half-way decent, I've honestly had better. I've been to this location on many occasions and its always the same.Rude, rude R U D E!!! Worst service/discrimination I've gotten A N Y W H E R E in my life. If you come with a man, or korean friend, you'll be fine. It you're used to the service and have been a long time customer, cool. But for people who want to enjoy their food a nice welcoming atmosphere DO NOT go here.
