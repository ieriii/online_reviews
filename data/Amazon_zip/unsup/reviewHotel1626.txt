hm. room was ok, bathroom looked like someone's crummy apartment though. not worth the money. but the real problem was the experience. After calling to confirm our room with a river view for a special occasion the day prior, we somehow still did not get our room with a view as confirmed. The desk manager managed only to repeat that he didn't know what to say, that we wouldn't be charged for the better room. we chose this hotel based on it's location and view. i also noticed we weren't the only ones with problems unfortunately. so the service, again, was not worth the money. won't be coming back or recommending it. overall, i feel that a city as great as chicago should expect more of a hotel in it's tourism center.
