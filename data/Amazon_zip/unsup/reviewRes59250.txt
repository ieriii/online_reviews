We had their signature dish, Peking duck, which was a total rip off. They carve the duck at the table side and left so much meat on the bone that even my 17 year old daughter noticed and made comment. The waiter said that they use the rest of the duck to make the soup and duck fried rice which is included in the hefty $38 price. However, it appeared that much of the remaining meat left on the carcass did not appear in the fried rice or the soup. The Peking duck was good but is not actually made with the real Peking duck cooking method, the duck broth tasted like it was made with a boullion cube and the fried rice was nothing special and tasted like any other type of fried rice. We would have been better off separately ordering their roast duck which at least one could be sure was the entire duck for $16.75 with all its meat still attached to it and actually served on your table instead of next to it and then wheeled away, a plate of fried rice and soup. We also ordered beef chow fun and they put spicy green chilis in the dish. Really? The normal, authentic recipe for chow fun is NOT spicy. While the waiter apologized nicely, he made no effort to make up for that error. It's still in my refrigerator and no one will touch it. Ever since this restaurant moved from its former, humble storefront around the corner on Argyle, they have gotten farther and farther away from authentic, economic Chinese dishes. The recipes seem to have been modified to suit non-Chinese tastebuds. While I had gone to their previous restaurant for many years, I will not be going to this one anymore.
