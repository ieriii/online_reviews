For a great neighborhood Mexican Restaurant, I would highly recommend Mayan Place. They have a great back outdoor portion to the restaurant. The place has excellent salsa, fresh chips, the steaks and enchiladas are amazing! If you love margaritas, this is the place. They are not over sweet, or watered down.
