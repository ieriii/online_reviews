Mmmmm... I'm already salivating at the thought of going back here again. We came in for a quiet brunch on a weekday [yay summer!] and were promptly treated to delicious huevos rancheros and a nanadict [an improvement on your classic eggs benny served over pupusas with a delectable and slightly spicy sauce]. Coffee was a bit overpriced at $3, but when you want caffeine you want caffeine. Our food came out quickly [but not so quickly that you wonder whether it was just sitting there ;)] and our server was friendly without being intrusive. The place is beautifully decorated and the windows open to the street, keeping it nice and airy. Can't wait to go back and try the burrito!
