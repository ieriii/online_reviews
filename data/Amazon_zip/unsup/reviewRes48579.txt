Great food, great prices, and the first beer mimosa I've seen. The restaurant is a large, open room with communal tables and booths. The booths are each fitted with half-doors, creating a stagecoach look. I like that you can see what other people are having easily and, since it's a communal table, it's a lot more comfortable to ask someone what they are having than at most other places. The sausage dish I had was great and the portions are appropriately sized; I rarely clean my plate most places. My wife's and my only complaint was that her short ribs were burnt/charred partway through, which wasted part of the dish. Last week, The Publican made a list of the top ten new restaurants in America on http://Forbes.com - the only restaurant in Chicago to make the list, I believe.
