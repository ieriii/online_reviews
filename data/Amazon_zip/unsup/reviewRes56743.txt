This is such a great place. They have delicious homemade pasta. I have been here twice and both times I got the veal meatballs. They were large and super tender. My family went crazy over their pumpkin ravioli, it is the best pumpkin ravioli I have ever tried. Their desserts were delicious as well, with a hazelnut (I think) panna cotta, as well as the tiramisu. But to top it off, and the reason they absolutely get 5 stars in my book, is that I just received a card in the mail from them. I had filled out my information on a card at the restaraunt last time I visited, and I just received a handwritten thank you note from the chef, along with a gift certificate to come back and use! I have never had a restaraunt do that unless it was my birthday, so I think this really shows how much they value their customers. I will absolutely be coming back!
