Meh. Good atmosphere.  Service is too fast / jumpy for my taste...yet friendly and nice. Waitress rattled off information like she's said it in her sleep....and recommended the three priciest dishes when asked....always a giveaway that you're not going to have a special-foodie-local time or relationship with waitstaff. No wine suggestions either....just pointed to the list written above the kitchen. Too many different people coming by constantly interrupting asking to take dishes off the table....no one watched us, and for the price, i'd like to be watched. Food is good....got much better after i waited a good 10 minutes to let it cool. Got the whitefish horseraddish encrusted and buttered....they should clarify the butter so the sweetness doesn't clash with the spice. Boyfriend got the Surf n turf....Club Special i think it was called. Excellent turf. Surf's scallops were ok....both of us agreed. The butterflied shrimp were ok. Mine was $20, his $37. The Oysters Rockefeller were odd....totally smothered in stringy cheese and large bits of shallot....not too refined. I've never had cheese in a Rockefeller, but maybe a little parm. It was like kid-food. No spice, no subletly....VERY dinerish...al la Chicago (too much heavy cheese!).  And the oysters were extremely small....MAJOR bummer also b/c i was introducing oysters to my guy - he was not impressed. $15 i think. After my whitefish cooled off, though, that along with my California Sauvignon Blanc were a PERFECT pairing! Really nice foodie moment there that lasted. Large fish portion and lots of fresh spinach. Very nice. I'd get it again. I'll go back, but won't spend the bucks on many dishes ...i mean one dish had a potato and rice pairing....weird. I'd recommend, but with caution depending on preferred service for price range and quality of food preparation. I'll definitely try a FRESH oyster night sometime. Two martinis, two glasses of wine, two entrees and an app....$150plus.
