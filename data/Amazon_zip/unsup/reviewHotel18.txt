Great location, terribly outdated. Feels like my grandmother decorated it, complete with overwhelming smell of cranberry potpourri in the lobby. Nothing extra, no frills, no service, no greeting when you walk ing. You can pay $5 for muffins and coffee in the morning, no eggs, no room service. If you're on a budget, at least it's clean, maybe not comfortable.
