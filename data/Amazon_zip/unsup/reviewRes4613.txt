This is where I come when I feel like eating and drinking too much, and have a taste for wine. I usually ask my server to recommend a bottle of something amazing off the wine menu. On my last visit it was a Spanish red. As I enjoyed my wine I gorged on fried pig ears, lardo iberico, morcilla, guinea hen, and for dessert lemon panna cotta. I was heart broken to learn the balsamic braised pigs tails were sold out for the evening. I recommend going with a few hungry, thirsty friends. Go through two or three bottles, and order everything that sounds interesting. You can't go wrong.
