Pleasantly surprised! I went with my wife to meet some of her friends for dinner. We got there about 45 minutes early so we went straight for the bar. However, unlike a normal bar where you would see rows and rows of bottles lining the back wall, this bar had rows and rows of CEREAL!!! Captain Crunch, Apple Jacks, Wheaties, etc. I was thinking what the heck is this?!?!?!?!Second, I'm a Miller/Bud Light guy and they didn't have either - strike two I thought.When my wife's friends arrived, we sat down at our table. The first thing you will notice (after the cereal boxes) is the long list of seafood specials they have - good stuff. As you would expect, one of the specials was an Apple Jacks crusted Talapia. This is not something you will see at your local Houlihans, so I had to try it . Bottom line - EXCELLENT!The waitor was VERY attentive and social which made the experience even better. An interesting beginning ended with a great evening. Ill definitely be back.
