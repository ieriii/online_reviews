The glittering sign outside winked, "Hello friend." Inside the bouncer whispered, "Please keep quiet . . . for the musicians . . ." And here's where my jaw drops to the floor. An absolutely beautiful gem of a bar on a Wednesday night filled with a lovely variety of jazz-loving patrons and you could hear a pin drop. Sure it's not the place to go to have a loud conversation and probably the best for a big group . . . but as a closeted musician I have so so much respect for a bar that enforces a "listen to the music" policy. And by enforce I mean that even the bouncer asks you politely to be quiet . . . and in case he wasn't convincing enough they have little slips of paper with a reminder note . . . My kind of bar. And for the first time ever since relocating to Chicago I thought, "My kind of town." Oh yeah. Cheesy button. I just made one.
