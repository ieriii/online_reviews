Amazing! Have literally eaten here THREE times since it's opening and can't get enough! 1.) Must get the Cow's Milk Foccacia 2.) Monday night Burger & Beer for 9$ is a MUST! (Burger to die 4! And Sophie, need I say more) 3.) great wine selection, at totally affordable prices. This will be an instant favorite! JB
