I do like LaVilla quite a bit; their ribs are yummy, sandwiches (so far, I've had the chicken parmesan, italian and bbq beef) are big, delicious and come with a huge portion of steak fries and big bowl of cole slaw, if you order 'deluxe'. I'm not all that crazy about their pizza--it's not that they're bad, it's just that others are a little better. First, their crust is kinda dry on the outside (they don't put the sauce far enough out), they put on way too much cheese (don't order extra!) and generally the middle isn't done enough (order well done, especially if you get veggies on it).....BUT, if you order well-done, it's perfect. Their delivery, in my experiences, is prompt. Big portions, great food, great value.
