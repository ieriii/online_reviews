Is it worth the 1+ wait..... Um no. And I don't get why the wait was so long. We were seated quickly. That's why they get one star. The drinks were cool, add another star. Well that's about it. We had the Gino's house salad just to pass time. (Nothing special about it) When the pizza did come (Gino's East Supreme with sausage and pepperoni) let's just say I was less than thrilled. All that anticipation just fizzled away. Over rated! Especially for the line to be around the block every time I walked by. No thank you.....
