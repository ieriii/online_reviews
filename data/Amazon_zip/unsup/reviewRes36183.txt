first of all, the 5 star rating it's for the peking duck and hk style roast pork. we ordered the famous peking duck, it's most delicious in chicago! the duck is served with steam bun which is different from other places (phoenix restaurant in chinatown). love the duck and will definitely come back again more often. couple years ago, i've also had their hong kong style roast pork. again, it's way better than any other places in chicago.
