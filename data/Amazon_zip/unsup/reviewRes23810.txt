Fantastic Algerian crepe place. I got the Ikosium crepe which had goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, spinach salad mix and added chicken. Sooo good! My friend opted for the build-your-own crepe and I may have to go that way next time. Prices aren't cheap but portions are huge and you will not leave hungry. Dessert crepes are plentiful and though I got a typical nutella raspberry crepe, I will definitely be back to try some of the more exotic fare. The Turkish coffee was infused with cardamon and like nothing I ever had. Delicious!
