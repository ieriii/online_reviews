Another great place in my 'hood. Not much to add to what everyone has already said. It's GREAT food. It's incredibly cheap (in a good way). Their Lentils soup is so good, I could just dive into it! (Don't worry, I won't!) Lamb shawarma: awesome. Hummus/Baba Ghanoush/Falafals are all amazing. 5 well deserved Stars!!
