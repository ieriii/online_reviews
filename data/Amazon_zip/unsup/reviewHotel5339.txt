This is the greatest hotel I have ever been to - the customer service is unmatched, the lobby and public areas are luxurious, the rooms are bright, beautiful, and comfortable. The food is delicious! Great location, great staff, great experience!To elaborate on the customer service I should tell my story. My purse containing my license, money, and interview folder was stolen on the train. I didn't have the credit card that I used to book the room or any ID to prove who I was. The hotel found a way to work around that, AND they called me and asked whether there was anything that the hotel could replace to make my stay more comfortable. I only asked for a notebook, as I needed one for my case interviews, but they brought me a leather-bound professional folder and notebook with pens that was even nicer than the one that was stolen. I started the day sobbing and ended it astounded with the generosity and kindness of this wonderful place.
