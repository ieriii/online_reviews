The interior is very warm. Kinda reminds me of a mansion. I would imagine that it would be more elegant come the holidays.As a college student, I wouldn't say it's a good place to go. But for going on dates, a plus. The bread is fresh and the portion size is very big, yet delicious. VERY DELICIOUS!! It was well worth paying the 16 dollars the entree cost. Me and my girlfriend had leftovers, and even then it was still good.
