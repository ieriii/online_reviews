I'm going to preface this by saying I prefer thin sliced pizza...having said that, this pizza was excellent. I really was impressed, and the ambiance of this place is great too! Chicago Tribune headlines with famous world events cover the walls, and the place looks very rustic. Arrive early for lunch because the wait can be long, especially on the weekends. Overall, a great experience!
