It took 7 minutes from when I placed my order online today to when the front desk at my office called me that Jimmy John's had arrived. 7 minutes!!!!!!! During peak lunch hour delivery time! It usually takes longer than that to get an elevator in this building! They REALLY mean "Subs so fast you'll freak"! My order was 100% accurate and I had several modifiers on my sandwich. Their website is very user friendly and the delivery guy was also very engaging and polite. I would DEFINITELY recommend this Jimmy John's to anyone! Standard Jimmy John's as far as taste and quality---I've yet to have a bad experience or bad tasting sandwich at any of this chain's locations.
