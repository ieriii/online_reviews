4 stars for the potted meat surprise that I was seriously licking my lips as I enjoyed it - I have no idea what's in it or how they make it but I could not get enough.  I like the decor and great location, staff was friendly (though a bit slow otu of the gate). Only thing I'm not a fan of is that the menu and service is so adamant about family style dining - sometimes I just want to eat what I want to eat (and with the delicious food I don't want to share).
