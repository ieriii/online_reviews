Frontera is amazing, and there's nothing else to it. It's worth every penny. The service and atmosphere are perfect. The waiters there are incredibly adept at being constantly present and meeting your every need without being too visible or intrusive. The wait wasn't incredibly long since we knew what to expect going into it, and it was worth it in every way. I didn't taste a single thing that had an off flavor profile, bad texture, anything. We got a few of the samplers as well as guacamole and the salsa trio (and an extra habanero salsa at the recommendation of the waiter) and everything was amazing. We ate significantly less food than what was typical of us at a restaurant and for a nice change of pace we were perfectly sated afterwards- we had eaten just enough and were left only wanting more for the sheer desire to taste everything. The chocolate torte dessert was phenomenal. It was paired with a fresh mint ice cream. I will tell you straight up that I hate mint ice cream but this was fabulous and I wanted more. It was a wonderful way to end the night. I really look forward to going again.
