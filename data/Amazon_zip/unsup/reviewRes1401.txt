H is for Hot Doug's, that's good enough for me H is for Hot Doug's, that's good enough for me H is for Hot Doug's, that's good enough for me Hot Doug's, Hot Doug's, Hot Doug's starts with H. If the Cookie Monster had been to Hot Doug's, he'd ditch the cookies and sing about the awesomeness served at 3324 N California Ave. I returned to Hot Doug's, again with David R, on another cold wet day. And again, left in a coma induced by some of the most delicious food Chicago has to offer. Keeping some form of tradition, I ordered the Chicago dog and split an order of duck fat fries. Both as yummy as my first visit, leaving me wonder "why did it take me 10 months for a return visit?" I also ordered the Apple Pork Sausage with mustard curry and creamy melted gouda. In a word - yummmm. The service, as usual, was outstanding and worth every minute/hour of waiting. Doug, don't worry. I won't let 10 months pass again.
