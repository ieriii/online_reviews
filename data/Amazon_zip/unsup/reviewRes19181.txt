I came here a couple of weeks ago with some friends, and the food was very good. The tortas are very delicious, and I would definitely go back. Also, I would recommend an order or two of churros with chocolate to go with your meal. The food all tastes very fresh, and the flavors can't be beat.  I'm looking forward to going again sometime and trying some of the other menu items. The soups also looked very good. The only thing about this place that was kind of confusing that I didn't really think was necessary was the way in which they take orders and do seating. They want to assign you specific seats, but yet they also want you to place your order at the front counter. With the way the system works, they basically won't allow you to place your order and make you stand in line until they have seats to assign you. This means that you could be standing in line to place your order for kind of a long time. There were three of us when I went, and they kept telling us we'd have to keep waiting, because they didn't have space for three, only two. They had us stand in front of the counter at the front of the line to wait to order until there were seats for us. So, we didn't lose our place in line, but at the same time, there probably was a party of two in line behind us that could have ordered and been seated ahead of us. Basically, I think their ordering and seating system could use some adjustments, but the food is amazing. They have an option where you can order the food to go, in which then there is a separate place where you can place your order and you don't have to wait. Whatever you decide to order here, do yourself a favor and get an order of churros and chocolate sauce to go with it.
