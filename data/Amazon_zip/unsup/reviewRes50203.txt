Update: After my initial posting the owner actually emailed me, apologizing for the way things went down. He offered to comp some stuff if we came back in, and since the offer he threw my way was QUITE generous, we took it and went back in. It was a MUCH better experience.  However, everyone was so nice to me, that I'm pretty sure the owner was like 'this pissed off bitch is going to come in, she gave us an awful review, please be EXTREMELY nice to her." However, regardless of WHY everyone was so nice, the experience was great, my friends and I had a lot of fun, our waitress (Elise) was super sweet, and I'm pretty sure we'll wind up going back again.
