(1) entering: you could just as easily walk into the hair loft as the restaurant. good for one stop errands, bad for first restaurant impressions (hair + food = no). (2) potential hazards: the hostess station has a hot plate with a pot of some type of aromatic substance. no, it's not mulled wine, it's just weird. and potentially dangerous. (3) patrons: when i walked in, about 7 on a tuesday, there was a large and endless stream of "professionals." i am not sure what type of professionals, but they were very professional. this made sitting at the u-shaped bar while waiting for my friend slightly uncomfortable and annoying. plus it took longer to get my drink because the bartender (who also seemed confused by their presence) kept serving them "micro-brews" and listing all the vodkas (the bottles of which were clearly visible at the bar) that they serve instead of stoli.  (4) popcorn: what's all the rage? it was of the "roasted garlic" variety. i've made better popcorn with that garlic pepper grinder you buy at the grocery store. i would rather have had bread. (5) music: REALLY LOUD ROCK AND ROLL. wtf? i'm not at nick's or listening to The Drive. it was gauche. (6) artichokes: were on display in the mirrored cabinets around the restaurant. but not a lot of artichokes, just two on each shelf. it just seemed too austere and i wanted to put more stuff in there. (7) food: if i was grading this restaurant just on the food, it would get four stars because the wagyu beef tartare, my friend's escargot and my halibut were great. nothing wrong. the spring pea soup was a little sweet for my taste but, i did order it knowing that it came with a lavendar marshmellow. overall, a good meal but i think something like BOKA is a better alternative (in the expiremental vein but they get the atmosphere right). i won't be back . . .unless it's for a business meeting.
