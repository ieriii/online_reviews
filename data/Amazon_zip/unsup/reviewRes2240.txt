The elk dog was unique and very tasty!!! Owner was taking orders and he was consistently very nice to everyone. Its clean but its so small. It was close to full on a Monday at lunchtime. On weekends I have seen the line around the building corner outside. I think they could expand with the amount of hype they have. I do see why people love this place! Only way it could be better is if you knew you could go without a long line.
