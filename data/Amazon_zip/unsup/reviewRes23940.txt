If you want spicy Chinese food , you can't get it anywhere better in Chicago land than here. My favorite dish - chili peppers with shrimp. Thick butterflied shrimp sauteed with a boatload of red chili peppers. Honestly, i can't eat spicy, but this place makes it so good, you will not mind the little burn while you enjoy every savory bite that comes with dining here.
