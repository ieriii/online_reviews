Always wanted to check this place out. Did a quick search and saw that they had gluten free pasta. Yay! Another place I can eat like normal person! So, the boyfriend and I stop in after searching high and low for a place close to my work for dinner. He feels a little under dressed in a regular tee and dickies. Me? I'm still wearing my dress pants and button up so I fit in, albeit a little uncomfortably (if you know me you cannot really picture me in such attire, but alas, it is my 'uniform' for work). We hungrily stare at the menu, and pick out the cheese (platter? dish? variety of cheese and grapes on a plate?) whatever it was called. Loved it. But then again, it was just good cheese with some ripe grapes on a plate, presented nicely. How would I not? I order my gluten free pasta, he orders some gluten-filled (haha) pasta, and we enjoy the rest of our meal. The waiter is quick to suggest a wine when we ask. It's good. The rest of the meal was spent admiring the cute little nooks they have for intimate dining, drinking wine, and stuffing our faces with some good pasta while in a semi-nice restaurant. Good times. It was busy in a happy bustling way, and we never really felt neglected. I'll be back.
