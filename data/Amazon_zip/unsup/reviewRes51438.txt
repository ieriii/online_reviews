The good: The best chips and salsa i ever had. I could eat a whole bag to myself. Enchiladas with the red sauce are cheesy and good. The OK: Their tacos are alright. A liltle bit too greasy for me. The bad: The rice is really bland and refried beans were too oily. The steak was really greasy. If you want good mexican food there are a lot of better places out there. I suggest you stop by for some chips and salsa.
