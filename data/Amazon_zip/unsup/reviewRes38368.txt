I know there a gazillion reviews of the Hop Leaf in my hood, but I have to add my $.02. The Leaf is two doors down from my office and I can't tell you how satisfying it is after a long day of clients to meet a friend for Belgian style mussels and an adult beverage. There are ups and downs, smoke and salty waiters, yet there is only oneHop Leaf.
