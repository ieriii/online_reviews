We went there again last weekend and we didn't have a good experience. The chocolate tower french toast was burnt and it was very hard to eat because it wasn't fluffy. And the presentation was very poor. It wasn't cover with sauce, the chocolate flower was melted... We complaint about it but the staff didn't do anything, waitress just confirmed that it was burnt. A few months ago we had another bad experience, we tried to correct our order and the waitress ran away from us! I don't know if this place will keep being my favorite.
