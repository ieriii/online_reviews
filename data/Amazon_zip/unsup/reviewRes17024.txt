I am not what you would call a huge Indian food fan, but I have my entrees that I enjoy. My wife and I ordered delivery from here recently, and even though the website says they offer delivery, the delivery is actually handled by CEO (so I guess they didn't technically lie on their website, but instead of being able to call the restaurant directly, I had to go to the CEO website and place the order online). Minor annoyance aside, now that I know the trick to ordering, I will be doing so again in the future, as often as I can. The food arrived quick, hot, and damn tasty. I had the tandoori chicken, and it was awesomely moist and tasty. I'm used to places that cook the hell out of this dish, so that the chicken is dried out and tasteless. This was quite the opposite, as I said, juicy and flavorful. We also got some naan (think that's how you spell it), some sort of curry chicken, some cheese ball things, and some milk-pastry-ball thingies sitting in a tub of thin sweet syrup. The only bad thing about it all, was that there wasn't more of the syrup. After finishing off those little pastry balls, I soaked every last bit of naan I could in that syrup... I probably would have dipped the dog in the syrup and licked it off him if I could (or maybe I could have just gotten a straw and slurped it out). Needless to say, everything was great, and this is probably the best Indian food I've ever had.
