If you haven't been to Greektown yet you are missing one of Chicago's finest displays of ethnic community dining (others include Chinatown, Pilsen, Little Italy and more I don't know about). There are plenty of great choices in Greektown but my favorite has always been Greek Islands (in no small part because that's where my parents took me). An argument can be made that they are all good and the same so any difference is just preference. For me though they have set the standard for delicious gyros, saganaki, fried-zucchini (no where else comes close) and my absolute favorite for keeping vampires (or anyone that smells your breath) away - a healthy dose of skordalia. My latest trip was after that fateful Bulls game that injured Derek Rose and set the stage for our disappointing first round exit. It was a saturday afternoon game so we just went down Madison st post game and grabbed a table to eat and drink away the sadness (and this was after a victory). We ordered everything off my wish list to start, and Erica tried the vegetable kabob. I love the flaming cheese that they do at the table, and I introduced the rest of the table to the joys of skordalia topped fried zucchini.  I honestly couldn't tell you if the rest of the menu is any good because I haven't ventured far from my favorites. But judging from the rest of my table, and every other packed table in the restaurant it's probably a good bet everything is very good. There's an added bonus when you get the check because I can't remember any meal surprising to the upside. Value is very good. If you haven't been to Greektown yet I'd try and change that, and Greek Islands is a great place to start.
