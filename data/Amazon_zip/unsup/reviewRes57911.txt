The food here was delicious! Very flavorful. We've been twice now and the service was fine. Not overbearing but not intrusive either. Very friendly wait staff who are happy to make suggestions if you don't know what to order. We tried the combination plate and ordered two veggie and two meat dishes. All were full of flavor and the spicy dishes had some heat but nothing approaching burning or painful. The prices are really reasonable for the quality of food. The portions were good- not so tiny you feel cheated but not so huge you can't finish. Just right in my opinion. With two glasses of wine plus the combo plate, for a dinner of two the bill came to just $25!The crowd was a good mix, which suits Uptown perfectly in my opinion. There was a family with a child, several small groups, and also several couples. It's a nice but casual place, so you will not be out of place dressed up or dressed down. If you're in the mood for good Ethiopian food with lots of flavor, for a good price, this is the place.
