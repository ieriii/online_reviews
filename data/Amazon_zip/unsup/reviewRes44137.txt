I haven't had many experiences here (its a bit too pricey for my bank account!) but the experiences that I have had have been nothing but pleasant. I love sushi and japanese food and I came here with my parents most recently to enjoy an abundance of sushi and fantastic japanese appetizers. I wish i could recommend a specific roll but I fell confident saying that almost anything you order off the menu will be really tasty.  In the summer the outdoor seating part of what makes lakeview so nice (or maybe its staring at all the yummy sushi?) and inside the actual restaurant is a really relaxed atmosphere, regardless of how busy it is!
