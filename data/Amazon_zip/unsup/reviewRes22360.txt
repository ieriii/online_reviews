This place rocks socks! I really had no idea what to expect when it came to Costa Rican food but was pleasantly surprised and happy with the service. We were in town for a good friend's wedding and wanted to take advantage of the local Scoutmob deal. The oatmeal shake tasted like a liquid oatmeal cookie! YUM! I had the raspberry smoothie and it was perfect! My steak burrito with guacamole and sour cream was non-greasy and super filling. The boyfriend had the chicken casado. I had a taste and enjoyed the sauteed onions with the pan seared chicken. Overall, the chicken casado tasted a tad bland but they do serve large portions so be prepared to be stuffed/ fully satisfied. :)
