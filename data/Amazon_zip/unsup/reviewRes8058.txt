After reading Yelp reviews and hearing this place had amazing pizza, my friend and i decided to wait out the hour long wait on Saturday night. While we were waiting they served us foccacia bread and mozzarella /argula pizzas. Those were excellent so I was excited for our pizzas. I ordered the italian sausage, basil, mozzarella, and tomato pizza while my friend ordered the buffalo mozz and basil. They screwed us. My pizza was burnt, I couldnt even eat one section the burnt taste was too overwhelming. If our waiter had come back to ask how things were i would have told him. But he was very unattentive, maybe because we didnt order liquor we werent a priority. Both of our pizzas had basil as an ingredient but i counted three pieces on mine and about the same on hers. The middle of the pizza was soup. And the italian sausage had two huge hunks and then just a couple sprinkles. We started looking at pizzas around us and noticed that ours looked very different. Other pizzas had loads of ingredients and were not as soupy. Basically, whoever cooked our pizzas messed up and because our uninterested waiter didnt stop to ask us how everything was, i would not go back.
