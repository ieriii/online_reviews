Opart is wonderful Thai food with a beautiful splash of Thai culture. The decor is lovely, warm: exposed brick, traditional Thai art, cozy seats. The Neau Sa-Ded appetizer is so good: grilled beef cooked up tender in hot sauce. The fish dishes are quite good as well.Portions are more than enough for the low prices. I went with two friends for 2 appetizers and three main dishes and we were charged only 40 bucks!!!It's byob, too, which is wonderful bc the liquor store next door sells a couple of Thia beer selections.
