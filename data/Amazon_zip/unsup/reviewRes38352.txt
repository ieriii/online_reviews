I would give this place more stars if it was not for the incredibly rude manager. I did not get his name but he was an older gentleman dressed in plain clothes. He looked like a general manager or something. He was extremely rude to us. I came here with my Aunt, it was my first time and I was visiting my family in Chicago. He yelled, he stared, he made me very uncomfortable. He was extremely rude and should not work around people. Food was good.
