As a long time customer of Bongo Room, I was very disappointed in the service I received the last time I visited. It was late morning on a Thursday, we told the hostess we would be happy with first available (counter or table). With only a few 2 tops waiting at the time, our wait was only expected to be about 10 minutes. As we stood there, the only ones still waiting 20 minutes later, we asked if we could be seated at the booth that had been open for at least 5 minutes.  The response... Bongo Room: "We reserve this for tables of at least a 3 top during the lunch rush." Me: "But we are the only ones waiting for a table, and there is a 2 top sitting at one of the booths now."  Bongo Room: "But they have a baby with them." Me: "Yes, a baby in a car seat that is too young to even eat solid food, therefore I believe this constitutes a 2 top". Dear Bongo Room, seat your customers that are waiting. Not the ones you are expecting. Unfortunately, we walked right out and went straight to Delish. Maybe not as trendy, but the food was great and the service was friendly. I will always think twice before ever going to Bongo Room again.
