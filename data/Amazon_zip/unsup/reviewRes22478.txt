Get your authentic Greek-style luv'n here! Hey I'm talking food here not drilling for oil in the wrong hole. So with that said, clean up your act and lets talk about cheap eats with a huge quantity of food. We didn't have plans on going to any particular Greek restaurant in Greek Town, so strolled up and down Halsted street and chose the place that had the most people waiting and being serviced. This place was rockin' and they must have a waiter staff of 50 people or more. You'll find both family-style and individual catered plates. Tons of appetizers and main course selections. For $5.50 you get a huge slab of flaming Saganaki. What a deal to get your flame on. Their Avgolemeno soup was thick 'n creamy - texture-wise, just the way I like it, however it was quite bland and not full of the explosive lemon flavor I'm use to. The Gyros was a plate-full. I've gotten use to the more Middle Eastern (Swarma-style spices) flavors - so the meat was kinda-bland, but that's what is to expected for Gyros. Still, it was freshly cut off the rotisserie skewer and tender and juicy. The Loukanico (Sausage flavored with orange rind) was quite tasty, and the slices of Roast leg of Lamb were pretty moist.  So if you want to get caught up in all the hussle and bussle of frantic Greeks running around screaming Opah! Opah! Opah!, this is your spot.
