I have never ever eaten so much rice in one sitting in my life!!! Now, that is saying something for this Puerto Rican Chica, you see I grew up eating rice & beans--no wonder I was a little fatty as a child :-) Trust me though I am not complaining because it was super yummy! Although, I left feeling uncomfortably stuffed--oh the tummy wanted to explode. Not only was my first Indie Cafe experience filled with lovely Yelp ladies (thanks to Brett for organizing a GNO), it was also my first EVER sushi experience--yes tis true people, my sushi virginity was lost last night. I have no regrets about that. Just like any new experience, you can either love it, hate it, or just be so-so about it. While I cannot say that I am huge fan of sushi, I will give it another go soon. I opted for the garlic chicken dish (Thai) and I must say they do it right. The garlic is not over powering and the chicken portion is very generous, the rice portion on the other hand is humongous--holy flip! I really do love that this place is a combo of Sushi & Thai. It is nice to have options and if you ever wanted to go out with someone who justs wants sushi & you are not a sushi lover--you can have the Thai. In my book that makes this place pretty fantastic. I definitely recommend this place for groups. While it is not large, it can accommodate a group of up to 25 pretty easily. Plus, it is also great because you can sample other people's dishes--thanks to Jackie for sitting next to me & getting me to try her sushi dish. Loved, Loved, loved, the ambiance of this place. We were in the Red Room and it was very warm & inviting. It would also be a great option for a romantic date. Grey room was a little blah, but I only strolled through it. The menu is quite extensive & kind of cool looking. All in all a wonderful experience & I cannot wait to go back.
