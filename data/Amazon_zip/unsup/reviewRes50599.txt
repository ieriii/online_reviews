I have never spent any time in Andersonville. This place came recommended for dinner but after looking at the brunch menu everything looked so good and tempting I had to make a reservation. That's super important to note... you can make a reservation on Open Table! That's so rare for brunch so I was happy. When my friend and I showed up there seemed to be a short wait (2 parties waiting), but since I had a reservation we were seated immediately. You should have seen their faces!!! Heated. LOL. Our waitress may or may not have been new. She was an odd one but nice so I don't have any complaints. Everything on the menu looked as good and tempting as online so we asked for recommendations because we couldn't make up our minds. We each got a "signature" dish: my friend got the House Cured & Smoked Bacon and Early Onion omelet and I got the Shrimp and Grits. While we waiting for our order, they served us fresh, warm beignets. They were pretty good but very sweet with all the powdered sugar on top. Our mimosas were yummy (how could you mess that up?), but since they use freshly squeezed orange juice, there's a lot of pulp. Just a warning. I'm not a fan of pulp but it was easy enough to scoop some out with a spoon. Overall, our food was good and not overly filling (you know how you tend to overdo it at brunch!). The shrimp and grits were tasty and there was a decent amount of shrimp so I didn't feel cheated. I wasn't drooling over the dish, nor was my friend, but we left happy and I cleaned my plate. It probably won't be my go-to brunch spot, but I would come back again and try other dishes as well as the dinner menu. I also liked the vibe in Andersonville in general so I'll be back!
