CHEESE, SWINE & WINE!!!!!!!!! i take words like these all in the same breath seriously and OH THEY DID NOT FAIL TO DISAPPOINT! from Marrow to pig's ears (its good. my husband was apprehensive but he ate a lot of it. it does not look like pigs ears as it is sliced thin and fried to crispy perfection. not gummy, not gelatinous, just way good to chomp with your wine) everything we had in here is excellent and the prices for the food and the service cant be beat! yes, drink wine! although we did not eat cheese (had to save space for swine! haha) it was an experience that i will hold dearly and very close to my forever craving heart. ah, i wanna go to chicago again! http://www.flickr.com/ph
