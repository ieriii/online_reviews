90 Miles has amazing Cuban food, and that is coming from a girl from Miami with a Cuban husband. Some of the things we have eaten and loved are the avocado salad, Croqueta Preparada sandwich, pastelitos and my favorite: Ropa Vieja. They also have great breakfast items including delicious guava pastelitos and "coladas" which my husband loves. Their new online ordering system is really user friendly, and I will be ordering delivery soon as I noticed there are some new vegetarian options which I'm sure will be really great.
