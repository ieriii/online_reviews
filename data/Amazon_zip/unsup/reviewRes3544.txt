Man I love wings, and whenever there's a inkling of a good wings place I am all for it! This place is great, self serve, can eat rice with your wings, and it is pretty big with great flavor. I love korean food and when I found the buddha bowl was a korean rice mix dish (bim bim bop), I wanted to get it but disappointed that there's nothing special about it... if you haven't had it before then try it but don't waste your time or stomach, get their wings! I had their Seoul Sassy chicken and bbq. The bbq was okay but the seoul sassy was great! Reminds me of good korean chicken wings. They are big, juicy, tender, and simply delicious as you take each bite and savor it! I just wish there were more sauce on these puppies! Hands down get the Seoul Sassy and avoid the rest.  But I would say these rank in fourth for great korean wings, go to Great Seas or Take Me Out for the best of the best! But these aren't far behind. btw best part is that since its self served, no need to pay tip! But sadly the seating here is very small... don't come here with a party greater than 4 unless you feeling lucky.
