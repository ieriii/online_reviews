If I could give this place more stars I would. It's beyond delicious. Everytime I have gone the food has been perfect. I lived in Mexico for awhile so I'm quite a Mexican food snob but this place hits the spot. The churros are better than in Mexico, the tortas have this way surprising you everytime you eat one, and the fresh agua is better than I ever had throughout Mexico. Go and you won't be disappointed. It's worth the long wait!
