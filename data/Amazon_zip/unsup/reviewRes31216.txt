My husband was in the Windy City (hope you guys don't hate that like we hate "Beantown") for one measly day. (Another reviewer from Boston, please open one here!!!) I begged him to get to the Diner and bring me some vegan yum. I spoke to Laura twice on the phone. Could she have been any nicer?? NO. The second time we spoke, I confirmed he'd have the time to pick up food, and she helped me pick out things that would make the trip to Boston. TWO reubens, a Jerk Chick'n wrap, pulled "pork" sandwich and hard-to-transport country friend steak dinner. Laura jumped right on it, separately packing sauces and "cheezes" and stuff to faciliate transport. Everything made it here fine. And the important part is that what we've eaten so far even after 8 hours of travel was absolutely the best vegan sandwich I've EVER had. The Reuben totally killed, how do they DO it? And it's huge, who can complain about the size or price of this thing, $10? Laura threw in a piece of birthday cheezecake for me, and a fabulously delicious if crumbly chocolate nut cookie bar. (I heated it for 10 seconds, awesome!) The one thing my husband really misses eating is pork BBQ, and that sandwich really impressed him. Today is my B'day, so we are going out to dinner, but I almost would rather stay home and eat the rest of our carry-out.  Thanks Laura, thanks Chicago Diner. Can't wait to visit Chicago and visit in person.
