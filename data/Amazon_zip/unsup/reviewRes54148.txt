Gag, gag, gag! I was so excited before going to this restaurant because I read such good reviews. It turns out there is little to be excited about. The food is tasteless, little portions, and nothing to rave about. Its flavorless and overpriced! Please, please, please save your money and go elsewhere because this place will leave you sorely disappointed.
