I love this family owned Italian restaurant! The food is delicious and the pizza is awesome!! Everything I have ever ordered is so good, right down to the focaccia bread they bring to the table when you sit down! I come from an Italian family, and the food makes me relive my childhood! The owners treat you like family when you walk in. They also have a banquet hall, and having a wedding reception or any other big family get-together here is a treat! They take care of everything and their prices are reasonable for the service provided! There is a full size bar and the place is always packed! Highly recommended!!!!
