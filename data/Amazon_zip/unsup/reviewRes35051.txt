I really enjoyed Shaw's. Like really really...  Classy, sophisticated dining room (we sat on the east side of the restaurant - looked like there was another area on the west side, and there's also a middle bar area) and I was loving the high ceilings of big old wood beams (see my pics), long red leather booths lining the walls, giant stuffed fish, fish paintings, and fine red table runners adorned with crab decals.  I took a handsome gent here for a special lunch during Restaurant Week, so although we were ogling the full menu and wanting damn near everything we saw, we stuck to the 3-course RW menu ($22/ea): - cup of clam chowder - crab cake burger w'fries - mini key lime pie Starter: Awesome chowder. It was very thick - almost too thick, but I really liked it. Creamy, rich and delicious.  Main: The crab cake burger. Mmmm.... the crab cake burger. I was thinking about this thing all night long, wanting another one. It's basically a huge crab cake sandwich on a house-made, hot buttered bun, served with lettuce + tomato, and a side of fries. The crab cake was a good size with big chunks of crab meat, thick with crispy edges. That bun was heavenly. Also crispy, and buttery, and the perfect combo for the sandwich. Fries were good, but honestly, I really wasn't paying attention to them with all the other goodness on the plate..... Dessert: I wish the key lime pie was twice as big. This was a small / mini pie, with maybe a 3" diameter. Pie-eating contest anyone..? Sign me up! Very cute, tart, nice texture (I do like a more crisp pie shell though...), and a nice little treat after our lunch.  Service was great, and I definitely want to come back here to order from their full dinner menu.
