Ever since this place was reviewed on Check, Please years ago, I have wanted to go. I FINALLY went there! It was SO good! So much better than Reza's, and cheaper! I had the combo ribeye and ground sirloin skewers. The ribeye was SO good! It was so tender! I liked how you can get a combo dill rice and regular rice. The service was great and the place was really cozy. I felt like I was in someone's house. I definitely will go back!
