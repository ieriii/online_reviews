Everything was great, from the pork rinds to each beer I ordered. The space is a bit loud, but that's downtown restaurants for you. One low note was the potato-leek gratin, which was clearly undercooked. Raw, bitter leeks, not my favorite. But the roasted cabbage was a revelation and I could live in the pork rilletes. Yum!
