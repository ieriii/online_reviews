Pros: Very affordable Italian BYOB that has lots of fans.Cons: Despite other reviews, I found the food marginal, and given the wealth of dining opportunities in Chicago, I cannot fathom the appeal. But taste is a matter of opinion, so here are some facts: the salads are not made to order, but instead are obviously pre-made (the ice cold dish and soggy/brownish lettuce remind one of a Holiday Inn wedding.) The pre-sliced bread tastes and feels day-old. The service is also hit/miss, as people in my party had their meal served cold. Further, since they only take reservations for large parties, and the restaurant lacks a bar, waiting parties are forced to congregate outside, or in the 4x4 vestibule. No fun during our long cold season.My advice: Affordable Italian is commonplace. Take a pass on Cara Mio and support businesses who serve fresh food and provide competent service.
