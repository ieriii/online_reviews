Posh and pricey, Fox and Obel is Chicago's answer to NYC's Dean and Deluca. It caters to an eclectic clientele of Streeterville yuppie locals, Navy Pier tourists and AMC River East moviegoers. I live two blocks away and always appreciate the extensive hours (6 am - 12 am daily). Regarding the store: a 6 serving container of Moonstruck hot chocolate goes for $20+, a small bottle of Firefly tonic, $5...I certainly don't do my main grocery shopping here, but I enjoy the occasional indulgence in this gourmet spot - red velvet cupcakes, Vosges chocolates, scones and clotted cream oh my, I do think F&O is the reason my cholesterol intake has gone up since I returned from Europe. My favorite part of this establishment isn't the friendly staff (a close second) or the ubiquitous, fresh samples, but rather the accommodating caf. In a part of Chicago that is mostly devoid of neighborhood coffee shops and hole in the wall bookstores, F&O Caf is my favorite place to study. With rich, sophisticated soups and hearty sandwiches that come crammed with their homemade potato chips, this place is often underestimated in its capacity to be a casual dinner spot. They serve fresh squeezed orange or grapefruit juice at brunch, and their cappuccinos are fantastic. Flip side: Their salads are a little hit or miss in flavor, and their eggs benedict is, for lack of a better word, crap. Their excuse for a hollandaise is atrocious. If I wanted fake butter taste, I'd go across the street to the AMC to douse my poached eggs in it. But now you know what to avoid and what to pick up... so go!
