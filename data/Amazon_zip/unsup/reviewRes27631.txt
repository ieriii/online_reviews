My fianc and I relocated from San Francisco to Chicago yesterday. Somehow it worked out (in our favor) that we rented a place around the corner from Frontera Grill. We had been here on vacations in the past and fallen in love with the bar...but coming here as a new "local" was amazing. My Holiday Margarita tasted like a gift from the heavens and the appetizers we shared after an entire day of travel left us ridiculously satisfied and tickled our taste buds. Cannot wait to make this our local bar and our go-to place. Rick, you're a gem, and the staff here is delightful.
