I have been here twice now for lunch, once in the opening week. The line was not THAT long, though longer than what I would normally wait. Each time it was no longer than 30 minutes. The smaller the party, the faster you get seated. Rick Bayless was there each time, so that was a bonus! I recommend the Ahodaga, it is a delicious pork torta served in a excellent tomato broth/salsa, your choice of mild of spicy. The bread was out of this world, the rest of the sandwich was equally as good. Large enough to split, assuming you get some chips and guac or salsa. I also had a Gunthrop Chicken, it was great, but not as good as the pork. The chips gauc or salsa are always a safe bet. I also tried the soup of the day, can not remember the name. It was a thick tomato chicken soup. It was good, a little think for my taste, it seemed more like a salsa than a soup.  I thought the price was outrageous, don't think would order that again. The pastries are great too, the shortbread cookie they have is the BEST I have ever had. Delicious. I can't want to return for breakfast and to try the Mexican hot chocolate. The only negative is the seating, it is not very comfortable. It is an awkward and tight space.
