Love the decor, the Andersonville location and even the food. However, after finishing my $18 pasta dish, I was still hungry. The whole time I was eating my food, I was saying to myself that this better be the half portion size. It wasn't, and that's a shame. On top of that, I feel that the service was only adequate. I'll go back optimistic that things will be better, but only after several months of them fine-tuning the kinks.
