My favorite Italian restaurant in the city! The pasta is always so fresh and even their simplest dishes taste unlike anything that you can make yourself. Even after eating at a bunch of great restaurants in Italy, I can't complain--it upholds the basic elements that I experienced there--fresh, simple, delicious. The menu is always different, and it's a great place to go on a date or with friends. If you want a little peace and quiet, try to get a spot in the coach house out back, which only has a few tables and is attended to by one great server/bartender, who has given us free shots with dessert every time I've dined back there. He's the best! Make a reservation if you can, because even when you have, you'll have to wait a bit.
