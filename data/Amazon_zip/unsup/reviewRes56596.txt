If there are two things in Chicago that there are no shortages of they are steakhouses and steakhouses. Mastro has a very cool bar area with nice decor and very expensive drinks to go along with it. I would be willing to pay more if they would please not put dry ice in everything.  The food is in-line with the rest of the other high end steak places in town, better than Gibsons for sure.  The service was good though I am not even sure how many different people served our table.The lobster mashed potatoes were the only memorable part of the meal.
