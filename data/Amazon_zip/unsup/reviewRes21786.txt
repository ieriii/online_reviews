We arrived at XOCO on a Tuesday night in February around 8:30 and It was pretty packed. The way this place works is that you get in the ordering line, pay for your food and then the hostess will then help you find a seat. The restaurant is pretty small, so not sure if you go there around lunch/dinner time Im sure it would be harder to grab a spot. We had a party of 10, so it was nice that the host was able to find us all seats together. I ordered the Chili Hot Chocolate since that is what real Mexican hot chocolate is and I honestly didn't care for it. It was way to RICH for my tastes. I'm more of a Swiss Miss kinda girl. I also ordered the Churros with the dipping sauce and these were really good. I only ordered dessert, but other people in my party had sandwiches and soup and they all seemed to love their food options. I would definitely go back here to have the Churro's again and try other things on the menu. I know when I eat at any Rick Bayless Resturant his food is always bursting with flavor. So I can't wait to return.
