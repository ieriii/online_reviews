So I recently went in to Wilde for lunch, giving it another chance after a disastrous opening night experience. The waitress came over and pointing and waving her finger from side to side at me and my brother, stated "drinks?".. Uh, do you mean what would I like to drink? To spare you from boredom, the rest of the experience went something like this. Bland Jack Daniels Wings, no flavor whatsoever Cold French Fries Wilted lettuce on my sandwich Crappy Service. Total Bill for 2 Cokes 1 Appetizer 2 Chicken Sandwiches $45 WTF?????? Oscar Wilde would be ashamed.
