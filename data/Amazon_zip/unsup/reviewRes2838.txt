Tru was a wonderful experience. Beautiful space, elegant wait staff. Love the napkin choice - I hate using a white napkin when wearing black slacks. Also thought it was very interesting that they offer a tiny little table for your purse! Nice touches. We opted for the Spring tasting menu. 8 or 9 courses and added a course of sunchoke at the beginning. The sommelier was very knowledgable, but informed us that he was having a difficult time with the chef's selections and the prevelance of spring vegetables (asparagus, artichoke, sunchoke) that are notoriously difficult to pair. Awesome, thanks for letting us know that the wine might not work?? We're paying an arm and a leg for dinner, the least you can do is lie to me and tell me it's all going to be fabulous. Dinner progression was nice, albeit almost entirely protein-free. A dish that had mentioned lamb was actually a lamb broth. A dish that mentioned a cheese was actually a cheese foam. I was having one of those "where's the bread guy" moments - not just b/c I wasn't filling up, but b/c it's hard to drink 8 glasses of wine on an empty stomach and still maintain the kind of decorum required for an evening at Tru. Dessert and cheese were my favorite parts. Although it was probably not the case, I did pretend that Gayle Gand was making the dessert personally for me. All in all - a beautiful evening, but I would definitely recommend Nomades or Alinea over Tru if you're looking to spend that type of money.
