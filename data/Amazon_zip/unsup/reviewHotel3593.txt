I stayed in The Drake while I was taking the bar exam. I didn't want to have to deal with cabs or waking up even earlier for the test, so I just booked a room. My key did not work. I went to get another key. It worked once. Each time I had to enter the room, I had to go back down to the lobby to get a new key. It was so irritating. Additionally - no internet in the rooms. What. The. F.? I get the idea that the only people using the Drake anymore are business men who want to rack up Hilton points and businesses who schedule conferences here. Thus, you NEED internet in the rooms. Additionally, it costs $7.50 / hr to log into WiFi in the lobby. That's absurd. There are three things in this place that say luxury: the huge floral arrangement in the lobby, an excess of crystal light fixtures, and the bedding. Otherwise, this is a totally average hotel with tiny rooms and tiny bathrooms. Our bathroom had a magnification mirror that was affixed to the wall a good foot over my head. Useless.
