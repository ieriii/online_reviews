I am in love with this hotel from the art work and restaurant on the first floor to the rooftop bar and music it is the best. we recently opened a business in Chicago and used the hotel to interview potential employees also a 5 star experience. One of the managers in the first floor restaurant is especially helpful and customer service is excellent. We are from Cleveland and tell all of our friends to stay there or at least go rooftop for drinks (hurry spring) French fries and mini cupcakes are especially tasty.n.b.
