Stopped by on St. Patrick's Day because we were hungry and didn't know where else to go! Actually, it was very hot that day..plus drinking and hunger doesn't mix too well. The place wasn't packed. It's a small restaurant with maybe 10 table tops. It isn't a fancy restaurant, very casual atmosphere. Our server was attentive and noticed every time we needed more water. The food came out in a timely manner as well. We wanted to eat something light so we ordered nachos and a 2 carne asana taco dish that came with rice and beans. We were so full by the time we finished the nachos! The food portions are generous and worth the money you pay.
