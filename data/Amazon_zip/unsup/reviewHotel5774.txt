When this establishment was first built, it was the Inn at University Village. Many medical professionals would have meetings, events and we would dine there. They had a nice buffet and it was nice and cozy. It was fantastic to meet and greet after work. In later years, it became the Hyatt and it lost some of its appeal that we had come to love. Now, its the Marriott and I find myself distancing from it. I think this hotel / restaurant does not have to be competitive because its needed in the Illinois Medical District. A few months ago, I went there with co-workers for cocktails and dinner. Well, the menu was scant and the food or should I say sandwhiches were not "all that". I just am not impress and I miss the Inn at University Village.
