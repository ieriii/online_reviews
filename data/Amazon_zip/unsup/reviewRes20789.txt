Went there with a large group for a birthday brunch. The staff was so accommodating - let us bring in our own cake and didn't charge a cutting fee. The food is good, not great, but it is overall a lovely place to eat on Michigan's touristy strip by Millennium Park. I really enjoy the atmosphere, Irish touches to the menu, and waitstaff.
