Went there for the first time tonight. It came highly recommended by a co-worker. I'm a vegetarian so I asked the waiter about vegetarian options and he gave me some off the menu items. Including tofu seabass. I ordered this and it was amazing! My boyfriend said his sushi was the best he ever had. We were both in love with our dinners. The service was great and the ambiance was cool. I liked how they had several different dining table options. Like my co-worker, I would totally recommend this place! Good food and good ambiance aren't so easy to find!
