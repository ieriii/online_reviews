For the past few years, Friday night in our house has typically consisted of whatever's on the DVR and Opart. And I'm more than OK with that. I heart Opart. A sampling of our faves- tod mun (awesome fish cakes), mee krob, and spicy fried tofu for apps; larb and tom yum (for our soup and salad combo); pad see iew (you gotta ask them to make the noodles crispy!), peanut sauce lover, pad kra praow, and the spicy catfish. Their fried rice is the best I've had - not greasy at all (and soaks up the delicious sauce from the spicy fried tofu perfectly!). They're always busy, but the quality doesn't suffer because of it. We've tried other spots in the neighborhood, but they just don't match up to Opart in our book. Opart, please be expecting our call yet again on Friday...
