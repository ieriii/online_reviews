When friends come to visit I recommend Kimpton, so for our anniversary we planned a little "staycation" I am sad to say I was disappointed. I love the vibe of Kimpton, and the lobby had it, but we must remember this is a HOTEL and the rooms are sad! The rooms had a few problems: 1. small room 2. tiny bathroom 3. thin walls 4. housekeeping was knocking on our door early in the am. All night I heard people getting off the elevator, I wanted more than Allegro could give.
