Publican has enough love letters and Odes dedicated to them that maybe I should just give you an overview. Ok, 7 things. Or, 6 short things and one long thing. 1. I was surprised at the bacon. It was amazing: fatty, thick and perfect. But I didn't expect it to be so thick. I thought it would be a typical strip. Definitely not a bad thing.  2. We had a pecan roll given to us as a birthday treat, and it was to die for. 3. My girlfriend had a boring egg white only omelet (healthy, sure but not at Publican!). 4. My bloody mary was great, and I love that they're reasonably priced and come with a beer back.  5. The duck hash was good, but not amazing. 6. My side of grits must be the saddest grits ever made. Or simply under cooked. I'm not sure which. I travel to the Deep South often for work, so I've had pretty much anything you can name fried and more than my fair share of grits, as I love them. I was wary about getting grits north of the Mason Dixie line, and I should have followed my gut, but hey, I thought, "this is The Publican! They wouldn't put something on the menu that wasn't good." I also asked the server how they were. She said they were creamy. Well, I *guess* they could be considered creamy. But mostly they were lumpy, with me having to chew a little grit or five in each bite. I've never had to chew grits like that. On the other hand, the flavor was great. It was just the consistency/texture that was off. 7. The service was a little lackluster, as they were not good with coffee or water refills, but the staff made up for it in kindness. You won't find those brooding, "you should be grateful I'm serving you" people here. I will be back, but I won't be getting their grits again.
