Apple Jacks encrusted Tilapia. Enough said. Glenn's is a small, primarily seafood joint in Ravenswood. I had heard from my friends who brought me here for dinner that it gets crazy busy, however my pal had no trouble getting a reservation for three on a Saturday night. We were promptly seated and I was promptly overwhelmed when I took a look at their chalkboard of seafood offerings. I was impressed that they had Jambalaya on the menu, which I almost ordered until I saw that they had fish encrusted in my favorite food - cereal. You mean I can get my daily serving of vitamins and minerals AND protein all in one sitting? Nice. As slightly unappetizing as it may seem, I was surprised by how delicious the fish was. The crust was not too sweet or overwhelming at all and complemented the very tender and flavorful Tilapia. Who knew?? The fish is paired with some delicious savory potatoes and I washed it down with a gigantic bloody mary. Yes, I know that's not really an appropriate dinner beverage. A large bloody mary is almost like a meal in itself and slightly resembles a shrimp cocktail complete with a giant slice of melon, celery and a skewer full of fresh shrimp. My friend's girlfriend also highly recommended the lobster roll though the sandwich was so big she couldn't finish it all. Glenn's was a pleasant dining experience. The restaurant is quite small, so I highly recommend making a reservation since there really isn't much space to wait. I'll definitely try to make it back when I next visit Chicago.
