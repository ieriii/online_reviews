I loves me some gastropub and Gilt Bar does it right. Let's start with the drinks. Great selection and they offer a glass of Pabst but call it something fancy so you don't feel like a schmuck ordering it. The food is what makes this place shine though. I had the bone marrow app which was outstanding, although probably horrible for my health. I then had the mussels for my entree which was excellent. My wife had a pasta dish which was outstanding. I can't recall what type but it had a spicy sausage which was excellent. I also had a few bites of the pork meatballs and the prime rib, both of which were excellent. The one big problem I have with Gilt Bar is their weird policy of seating on the weekends. Apparently walk-ins can only sit in these small areas. It didn't make sense to me. If a group of 8 people show up wanting to spend money and you say that walk-ins can only go to this one area, why would we stay? The worst part is that the entire time we were there plenty of tables remained empty.
