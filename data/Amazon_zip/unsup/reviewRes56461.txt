Do NOT go, unless you are prepared to stand around for two hours and then be told that it will be another twenty minutes. Not acceptable. I became particularly irritated by waiting around while open tables just sat and sat.  The bar was packed, so it wasn't like you could enjoy a drink at the bar while you waited. VERY DISAPPOINTED...
