My favorite pizza place in Chicago. Very lucky they don't deliver too far north or I'd be in serious trouble. This pizza is unlike any other and if you're a fan of thick crust and extra thick cheese without sauce...this is not for you. The dough is lighter crunchier, chewier with a good layer of cheese some might call light and just the right amount of sauce; big on taste and that caramelized cheese...wow.
