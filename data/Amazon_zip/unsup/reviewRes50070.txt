I need to get my head out of my backside & get down here more often. No excuses. Been here a few times now, perfect place to watch a Cubs Sox game. Outdoor seating, great bar menu with quality food. Cute, perky waitresses that attend to your needs and treat you as if you're the only patrons in the establishment. Can't beat that now can you! Best time to come is the summer time. Go straight after work, prior to any sporting event, or for a late evening snack. Attractive patrons and a big city feel in an underrated neighborhood. If I could rename it, I'd call it 100/100. There's no doubt this place is a winner. TV sight lines are perfect, the screens are HD, and they realize that size matters. I'm so glad something got me out of Lakeview to check this place out. I'm already looking forward to Summer of 2011 to check out the elite talent. It's a lot easier to watch than a sub .500 Cubs game. Come to Fifty/50 and you won't leave disappointed. It's right next to innjoy too, so you can hang out here before you go get your retro on with the local cougars. Hot bar, hot neighborhood. Don't sleep on it!
