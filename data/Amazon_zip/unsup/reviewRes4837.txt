By far, one of the most interesting food experiences I've ever had! I went with a couple of friends to Chicago, for fun, and with no expectations. The Purple Pig was a recommended place to eat at, so we decided to give it a shot, and eat there for dinner. The hostess that was helping us was very friendly, so that was already a good sign. The wait was about 30 minutes, but it was expected since the place was popular, and the space was very small. I really liked how everything in the restaurant was wooden, I kinda felt like I was in a farm. There were barrels, the tables and seats were all wooden.. it was cool! Since there were 6 of us, we decided to each order something different. Everything was tapas style, so it was easy to share amongst each other. It was my first time trying bone marrow, pig tail, and pig ears! LOL. Doesnt sound appealing, but the presentation and the seasoning made everything look so darn appetizing. The pig tail was nicely cooked, and sweetened, with a few green toppings. The pig ear was what I found most interesting... it was chopped up with a fried egg on top. Delicious!! Bone marrow.. I had no idea how to eat it. I learned that it tastes good as a spread on bread, and to top it with capers. Amazingg! On top of those dishes, we had the turkey leg (very tender), octopus (kinda rubbery, but good, if you like that), wagyu sirloin (HIGHLY RECOMMEND), green onions (surprisingly good), and garlic broccoli (Amaaazing). As you can tell, we went a bit crazy with the food, but it was all worth it. The bill was high, but it was expected. Be sure to have a full wallet, and an empty stomach when you visit The Purple Pig. I would definitely eat here again!
