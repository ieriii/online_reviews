Really wanted to like this place...but the really poor service overtook the really good food. I'd do take out, but I'd really resist eating in there again. Annoyingly slow pace from the get go. Never saw the server after they dropped the food off, and had to get up and find him when we wanted to cash out. So womp womp...disappointing.
