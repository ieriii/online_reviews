Let me preface by saying I really expected to be wowed and blown away by the pizza based on friends assertations that it's 'the best pizza in the city'. And while it was good, I can't say that I agree with my friends. In fact, I thought the thin crust was pretty similar in taste to a few other places I've ordered from (Pete's, Golden Crust). I will order it again, but at this point I can't say that it stands out as 'the best' or even in my top 5. Although, I haven't tried the stuffed, so maybe that's where I'm missing the boat.
