This was a super cool place! And I have to say that lots of the advice from other Yelpers just wasn't the case when I went! There was no "biker dude" waiting for us when we arrived - instead it was a friendly hipster-type guy who politely told us no talking during the music. The server was VERY efficient and friendly, and the drinks weren't that over-priced. When the music was about to begin, the manager guy introduced the band and nicely asked everyone to stay quiet during the show. There was one "SHHH" during the show, otherwise there was no violent interjections from management regarding talking. We went on a Tuesday night for a monthly jazz organ jam. We arrived early due to the warning from yelpers about the crowds. It was basically dead until an hour after the show started. We got a good seat, right up front. It did fill up, however, later. The only problem with the night was with the Hammond B3 organ - the amp for it went out about three times during the show. It was frustrating, but I don't believe the organ was the property of the band or the venue. They got it together and the music was great. The venue itself is a treat to visit. I highly recommend it to visitors as it's a beautiful piece of Chicago history. GORGEOUS wooden bar and wall decor.
