Not bad. Overpriced (almost $5 for a hot dog and fries?) but the hot dog has a really unique taste of spices to it. It gets points for its quirkiness and kitsch but I hate eating in my car. I hate it. I think I'd bump it up to 4 stars if they had indoor seating because it's a super cute place with decent (yet totally overpriced) food. We had 2 hot dogs, 2 fries, and 2 small drinks and it was over $15. And it's not even a whole side of fries- they just throw fries on TOP of your hot dog. Which also pisses me off since you have to eat through the fries to get to your hot dog. Points for not serving ketchup on your hot dog though.
