Yum YUM YUM. Was visiting Chicago, and my dad and I had nothing to do for a couple hours around dinner, and this was referred to us by a friend. I gotta say, our waiter was super kind, but it could have been because we got there around 5, which was before dinner rush on a Friday. She was super knowledgeable, able to offer great suggestions, and we chatted for a bit. She suggested a few things which were super legit: -fried kale pieces, pig ear, and fried egg -cous cous with grilled fresh octopus -pork liver pate (super silky consistency) -bone marrow (deliciously broiled, nicely supplied w salt and onion & parsley for spreading on bread) -shaved brussel sprouts (wasn't expecting much, but was so surprised) I'm moving to chicago soon and I'll probably be a regular. **EDIT** I AM a regular! love this place. especially milk braised pork shoulder... it's to die for.
