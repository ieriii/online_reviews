Came here for my first sit-down visit to a Rick Bayless restaurant. I was very pleased with everything that we ordered. Started off with the delicious Blood Orange Margarita, followed by the Trio ceviche sampler. The waiter was kind enough to drop off some extra chips for us without being prompted. I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano, which I thought was pretty well-balanced. Adding Rick's Red Pepper Hot Sauce gave it the perfect amount of kick. My friend ordered the steak tacos, which came with some awesome gourmet toppings. Finished it off with the Mexican vanilla ice cream (with rum) and hot fudge topping. As we were eating, we got to sneak a peek of the legend himself talking to a few employees in the back by the kitchen! Left very satisfied. My only concern was that I couldn't stop eating the food before I was too full. So good!
