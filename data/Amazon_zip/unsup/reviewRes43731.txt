A friend introduced me to Milk & Honey this past weekend - what a cute and quaint place! Service was friendly & personable. My dish (orange brioche french toast with almonds, mmmmmmmm) was well, mmmmmm. :) And the decor was clean, fresh, and stylish, but in understated fashion (doesn't scream, look at me! look at me!, more like, hello!). I would highly recommend venturing out to this part of the neighborhood to check out the cafe & other upcoming boutiques/food joints.
