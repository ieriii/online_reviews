What makes this place standout? Honestly, it is great for the location in Lincoln Square. The fact it is open 24 hours is also great for those times when you're just hungry for some good, greasy mexican food after a night of drinking or whatever other time. The food is good though I really can't say I am any expert in mexican food. I like their portions and think their horchatas are really good over there. Also, their oatmeal shake is quite tasty. The price just can't be beat either. It isn't just another mexican restaurant. I think the things I've mentioned put this one to 4 stars.
