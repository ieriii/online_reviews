This is a pretty big step up for me. I'm pretty much satisfied with a draft pint of Fat Tire and watching a televised sporting event involving two teams I don't care about from a shaky bar stool. I'm not a sucker for ambiance at all, but when a place makes a modest effort to give itself a swanky 1960s look, I'll bite. It's the closet thing I can get to proper time travel since Home Depot doesn't carry the flux capacitor I need for the time machine I built out of spare telephone parts and my old Castle Grayskull. You're not just going to see a couple of Andy Warhol posters and listen to The Beatles here. Aside from the subtle hints of looking like a set on Mad Men, it's a very relaxing atmosphere. It's very dimly lit so nobody can notice your blemishes or any remnants of that facial tattoo you got after that "anything but clothes" party your freshman year. The chairs are probably the most comfortable things to sit on without having to pay a membership fee or overstay your welcome at The Sharper Image. Between the lighting, the seats and the potent cocktails, you might have to make a pretty good effort to not fall asleep. Drinks are $12 each unless otherwise noted. It sounds overpriced, but a lot of time and effort is put into them, and they follow their recipes to the last milliliter. Once you taste their Old Fashioned, you'll know where those extra few dollars went. The term "half assed" is not tossed around freely at Violet Hour. This is a great place to bring a date or a friend, but also not a bad place to drop in by yourself and sit at the bar. The bar men are very friendly and more than willing to talk to you while they mix your drink. One thing they won't take kindly to is phone talking. They have a pretty strict policy against them. Just turn your phone off and relax for an hour or two.
