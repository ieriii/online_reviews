I don't care if everyone thinks this place is "overrated"... what matters is my opinion and I think it is good! I had an awesome dog there... I forget what it was called, but it had beans and chipotle mayo on it. Really dude... my mouth is watering thinking about that delicious wiener going into my mouth. GO ON FRIDAY AND GET DUCK FAT FRIES... IF YOU HAVE NO CONCERN OVER YOUR HEALTH OR YOUR INEVITABLE HEART ATTACK THESE FRIES ARE FOR YOU! So fattening and SO yummy... Me gusta mucho mucho. Really... go here. It will be busy and you may have to wait but it will be worth it. Take Manders' word for it!
