Sorry, chef. I think you are a genius. You taught me to make my own salas-many salsas, but Xoco has fallen flat. The tortas, while made with quality ingredients, were - well, just sandwiches. The bean soup needed more masa dumplings and less salt. The waiter who rolled his eyes at us when we informed our dessert was supposed to be to go was silently RUDE! Not only was he rude when he brought it the first time, but also when he brought it the second time in a bag. It was a beautiful day and we wanted to show my niece the lakefront. Is that any reason to scowl at a table? I think not. If you must go to a Rick Bayless restaurant, this one is worth one visit and no more... Sorry, Rick.
