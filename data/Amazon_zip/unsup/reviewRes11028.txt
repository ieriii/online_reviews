Let's get down to business....we had the white chocolate caramel pretzel pancakes and an avocado chorizo cheese omelet. The pancakes were sooooo good. You would think with all the sauce they put on top they would be super sweet, but not so. The were in no case overly sweet. Just the right amount of sweet & saltly taste. Mmmmhhh mmmhhhhh and the omlet for being nothing special was also very good. The best way to eat at these type of breakfast joints is to order something sweet (like the pancakes, french toast, etc) and then something breakfasty (eggs, potatoes) and SHARE!!! (If you can manage that!) Bon appetit!
