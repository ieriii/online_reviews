This yelp page is basically pointless because it's a bunch of people jerking off about how good these sausages are. Grab the lotion, because it's that fucking good. It is really fucking hard to get here by public transportation, but I would commit otherwise people will make fun of you for not having gone to this place when you had the chance. Expect to wait another hour or so in line because of all the other asshole yelpers that show up from the moment it opens to the moment it closes. We got the Uber Garlic Pork sausage and the Sauternes Duck Sausage. Both were stellar. I'm not a huge sausage fan, but these changed my mind. They're decadent in a way fried meat is not supposed to be.  Doug is the fucking man.
