Um... does it dye your teeth black? No, it doesn't, so eat up! The Spaghetti Neri Frutti di Mare (noodles made from squid ink) was so delicious that the only things left on my plate were the shells that once housed my mussels. :) The sauce has a nice kick to it, which paired perfectly with the seafood. Other dishes I sampled, aka "mooched", "stole", "free loaded" were the short ribs and boar. Both were pretty good, but if you're feeling carnivorous, go with the short ribs- ohhh... tender perfection. Am I going to have leftovers? Probably not, as the dishes are pretty tasty AND well-portioned. You definitely will not, if you have a scavenger like me at your table. :) Drink much? Come with friends who know their wine, as the list is extensive. I typically have a hard time finishing 1 glass of wine, but had 2 without a problem... I believe it was #365. Very smooth. Can I wear flannel-lined crocs here? Yes, but you might feel a little out of place.
