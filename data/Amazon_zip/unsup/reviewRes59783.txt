Great Pizza!!! This place has the best selection of slices at all times!!! Every single time that I have ever been there they had 12 choices of hot fresh slices ready for you to enjoy. Usually it consist of 4 Thin Crust, 4 Stuffed (Chicago Style), and 4 Pan. Not many places can you go and always count on hot fresh slices of any style combination and ingredient that you'd want. I usually go with one thin and one stuffed. Their pan style, still tasty, is my third option. I find it to have way too much bread and not enough sauce. Good thing the guys at Art of Pizza keep the big selection hot and fresh at all times!! I subtracted one star because the place is always seems dirty, when you walk into the restaurant you typically see garbage on the tables that looks like it has been there for quite a while....its actually kind of strange, but who the cares the pizza is great.
