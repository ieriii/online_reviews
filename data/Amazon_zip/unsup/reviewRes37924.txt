I honestly have not found a Giordano's that I haven't liked. Consistency and ooey-gooey deep dish pizza FTW! This location was hot as an oven inside... maybe because we were standing by the pizza oven. The nice thing is that you can preorder while you wait so the pizza arrives shortly after you're seated. Love! I'm usually a tried-and-true spinach, mushroom, and sausage fan, but on this occasion, we opted with the stuffed "special" (green pepper, onion, mushroom, and sausage). So satisfying! Beer, wine, and cocktails are available too.
