We decided to try out the spa and were very disappointed in the staff, the services we received, and the set up. First off we were asked to change our appointment for a scheduling conflict. There was no conflict, there was no one there, we had to wait for staff to arrive. Be warned, if you want to "steam" first, the steam room is on another floor, and you may burn yourself if the steam has been turned too high. We both ordered the same service but received different treatments that were not consistent in time or content. The staff all around could use some training in customer service, staff were obviously in positions above their ability, and were not professional about their business.
