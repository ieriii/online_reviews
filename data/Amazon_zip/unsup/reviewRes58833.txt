My date really wanted to have dinner at Sunda because she loves the food. I have never been there before and heard great things so thought I'd give it a go. We arrived around 7:30 PM on a Friday so I knew it would be busy and didn't expect to be seated for a long time. The Hostess was very nice and said we may dine at their communal tables or at the bar. We said "thanks" but prefer a table reservation and asked about the wait. She said it would be 40 minutes (which was awesome) and entered my name and telephone # in their system. We went to the bar and waited for our table. Here's where Sunda dropped the ball. An hour later, I went over to find our hostess to inquire about our reservation. She said our table will be ready shortly. After another 20 minutes I went back to our hostess to inquire about our table only to have her say we have NO RESERVATION and the only time she can accommodate us is at 10:30 pm. This was a Twilight Zone experience and a total insult so I asked to speak with the Manager. The Manager didn't even look in the system and said "yep" we can get you in at 10:30pm. I asked about my name and telephone # in the sysem.... and she said we dont have a reservation for you! I asked my date if I misheard something and she said "no, the hostess said we would be seated in 40 minutes" Knowing this was going nowhere (and basically being called a liar) we decided to take our business elsewhere and will tell everyone about our less than spectacular experience. So crazy. Usually people write bad review AFTER they sit down and eat. LOL. If we knew we would be seated at 10:30pm....WHEN WE ARRIVED AT 7:30pm... we would have never went to the bar to have overpriced drinks. Good stuff Sunda!
