It took me awhile to like Tank Noodle because I had a serious aversion to Vietnamese food, until my Vietnamese friend showed me what to order. Now, I lament how one of my relatives ate my leftovers without asking me! I'm not the biggest fan of pho because I can eat noodle soup at home quite easily. Then again, I am still learning which kind of pho to order. My dishes of preference from Tank Noodle are the Vietnamese spring rolls and the crepe. Note that Tank Noodle has a book of a menu with over 100 items. Let's talk about the crepe, since spring rolls can be found at other restaurants. The crepe is the dish that my relative fiendishly consumed. It is listed as an $8.95 appetizer, and takes up half of a 12-inch diameter plate. The other half is occupied by lettuce, basil and other herbs. The crepe is made with pork strips comparable to bacon rashers cooked into its egg-based shell, and the shell encapsulates cooked shrimp and fresh bean sprouts. You eat it by slicing pieces off and nestling them into a leaf of lettuce, adding basil and other herbs for taste, then dipping the lettuce/crepe wrap into a sweet & sour, papaya, white vinegar mixture. ... ... Gawd, I want my leftovers back! I also tried their smoothies and wasn't terribly impressed. The mango smoothie is small comparable to the ones you can get in Chinatown, and for the same price. Also, don't get the jackfruit smoothie, it just tastes odd because they use super sweet, bottled jackfruit. Tank Noodle is also the only Vietnamese restaurant I've been to that has crepe. Therefore, I WILL be coming back. Besides, why not? It's located on the same block as the Argyle red line stop.
