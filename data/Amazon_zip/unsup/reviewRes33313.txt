I went here on Saturday night with a friend, and thought it was spectacular. I liked both the food and the atmosphere. You walk in, and the first thing that greets you (after the host, who may shake your hand several times), is a life-size stained glass of Vlad the Impailer. (WTF, awesome!?) Then you sit down in a cosy little dining room right next to a bar. There are lots of servers, and wild tables of drinkers, but also children running around and playing, and families with seniors. There's also a roving accordian player who's pretty good. The food is not served super-fast, but I thought it was worth a little wait. The short-rib goulash was really, really good. The chilled Romanian wine was great. ($7 for a very generous glass, and our last round of the night was on the house!) The Caprese-style salad was good but not spectacular. The complimentary liquor offered through a hose was weird but good. (And hey, it's free,) Toward the end of the evening, women were carried around and encouraged to break plates against the wall. Wine bottles were also broken. I see a previous Yelper said that walking out through a bunch of glass shards was a negative thing. To that, all I have to say is there are 6,000 restaurants in Chicago where you DON'T get to walk out through broken glass. Thank goodness there is 1 where you do. If you are adventurous and like good food, then Little Bucharest is totally awesome.
