Just getting on the band wagon here, since it has all been said before by 700 yelpers before me. I had ridiculous expectations. I've been to Schwa, L20, Tru, Next, Bonsoiree and Moto (you can say I love to eat out) and I'm a New York transplant (I proudly ate through New York the 5 years I lived there). And I have to say, I've never had such a beautifully crafted, wonderfully executed, ridiculously ingenious, tasty and elegant meal in my life. From the start of the meal (lifting the pumpkin centerpiece to reveal that little morsel inside) to the end (smashing that chocolate egg over a modern art sauce landscape), it was fabulous. Yes, it costs an arm and a leg to dine here. And yes, you will be uncomfortably full by the time you get out (and it may be almost 1am since the only reservation you could score was a 9pm on a Sunday), but for a special occasion, it is just the place to go.
