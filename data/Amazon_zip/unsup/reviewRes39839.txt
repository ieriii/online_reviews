This really hits the spot. I'm Asian, not Korean, but I have had home-made Korean food and eaten at Korean restaurants in Chicago and Champaign, IL. Sansoo gives out a TON of "panchan" (side dishes), and each meal I've tried is one of the bests I've tasted anywhere, especially the chopchae (clear noodles dish), soondubu (tofu w/seafood soup), and Korean beer. May not be the best place to eat kalbi (bbq) - there are a few kalbi buffets in the city just for that. Prices are fairly reasonable, ~$8/dish? The parking lot is really tight and small, and you come out stinking like a kalbi/bbq pit (there are tables and tables of grills w/meat sizzling). It's kind of a trek for me, but I've never been disappointed with the food or service here, even though some of the ladies don't speak the best English.
