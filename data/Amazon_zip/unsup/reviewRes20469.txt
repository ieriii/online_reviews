Coast is definitely my favorite sushi place in Chicago. Somehow I always stumble in with there being a long wait, but grabbing a corkscrew and some glasses from the hostesses and opening the wine we bring makes the wait rather pleasant. The gomaae is great here, and I adore the Coast crab roll - I could eat it almost every day and not get sick of it. There's a huge sushi selection, but on the one occasion I got a steak teriyaki appetizer just to see how it was, I was very impressed. Any restaurant that has a line out the door every night of the week is my kind of place!
