Big impersonal chain hotel, marginal to poor customer service. Rooms a bit beat up but mattresses and linens have been updated recently.  Everything is ala carte....internet is $13/day, parking is $39 - 50/day, gouge on food and drink.  Location is okay but not great. kinda halfway btw Michigan Ave and lakeshore Dr.
