I was here for a wedding this past weekend, and it was one of the most beautiful weddings I've ever been to! Part of this was because of the wedding planner of course (and the adorable couple), but this hotel really added to the experience. The lobby is beautiful and the rooms were spacious. The shower had upscale stone tile and a rain shower head. The beds were very comfortable as well. The valet people were so helpful with getting cabs and loading cars. Another person in group called down for more space to put food, and a refrigerator was apparently brought up in minutes! However, the drawer under the tv was sooo cheap and difficult to close! This wasn't a big deal, but it didn't match the rest of the room.  The reception room was great, with a large dance floor big enough for a wedding of over 300! The brunch the next morning was in a quaint and very pretty room.  We hung out in the Presidential Suite the day after the wedding (where the wedding couple was staying), and it was incredible (beautiful views, too). The air conditioning was broken when we first went up there, but there were maintenance people in there fixing it right away.  This hotel is in a great location. It was truly upscale and beautiful, and I highly suggest it.
