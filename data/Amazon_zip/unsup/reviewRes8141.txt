Perfeio! (Translation: Perfection!) I have had the fortune to dine here many times and have had a great culinary experience every time. The service is impeccable and it is obvious that they take great pride in it, as they should. They anticipate your every need. The meat is top-notch, the wine list is impressive, their cocktails are delicious, especially the traditional caipirinhas and caipirosas (my favorite). The appetizers are very tasty with my favorites being the crispy polenta and the cheese bread. For dessert, have the strawberry cream. I know they boast about their signature papaya cream but trust me, I've had both more than once and the strawberry cream is better. The salad bar is well-stocked and has some interesting selections like heart of palms and sun dried tomatoes but honestly I would skip it and get down to business: meat, meat, and more meat!! A word of caution: eating here leads to food comas. It is very easy to overeat because the meat never stops coming! Do exercise your power to flip that card to red and stop the barrage!
