They say you get what you pay for but in this case we didn't even get that. A group of students and two professors organized a trip to Chicago and we all booked rooms at the Travelodge together. Little did we know that upon arriving they would not have rooms ready for us. After waiting at the desk for about 30 minutes or so we left our bags with the staff so we could all get something to eat in hopes that this would give staff time to get our rooms. We came back after about 2 hours and still nothing so we waited maybe another 1 hour and a half and still nothing. At this point we've been waiting around 4 hours for rooms we reserved. Eventually we just had to find other accommodations for the night. And try and speak to the manager in the morning. Next morning the professor in charge calls the hotel and http://hotels.com to try and organize a refund for last nights debacle. Not only did the hotel hang up on him they told http://hotels.com that we never showed up!In short the staff was unprepared, not courteous, and dishonest. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.(the bell hop who helped us check our bags before going to dinner was very nice though)
