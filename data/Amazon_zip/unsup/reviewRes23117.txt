We went with someone who knows this restaurant well, and who also ordered nearly every appetizer and vegetable on the menu for the table to share. So, so much goodness... Our table couldn't contain it all. Definitely try the Greek beer... I'm not a huge beer fan, but this passed with flying colors. Not too hoppy, and not too heavy. Everything we ate was delicious. Loved the flaming cheese, the butter beans, green beans, and (surprisingly for me) the octopus. Free valet parking is also always good, and loved the interior. The staff was also very friendly, helpful, and attentive... I don't think my water glass was near empty all night. I went with my boyfriend (who is Greek) and his cousin (who is also Greek), and they gave it the official stamp of approval by comparing the food to Yiayia's. Can't get much better than that.
