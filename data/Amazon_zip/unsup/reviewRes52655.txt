I've been to many Brazilian steakhouses before and this is by far the best. If you like your meet anything beside medium rare than this is the place for you. Whereas most Brazilian steakhouses cook their meats to medium rare for everyone. The servers here can cut a piece of meat for you at the exact temperature that you request. Best of all the service was outstanding!
