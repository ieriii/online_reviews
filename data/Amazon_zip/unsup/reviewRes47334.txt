Luved their burgers! Its awesome! and I enjoy their music as well... I'm jus upset on their service. Hostess wasn't talkative and showed no care and few weeks ago I went for my buddies bday and couldn't offer 1 thing for him on his day. My buddy likes to come here but was disapointed on his bday here as his first choice to come..... Other than that, da food was delicious so I give all most of the props to da cooks and their service was "EH"
