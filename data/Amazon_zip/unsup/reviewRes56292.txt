I LOVE SIMPLY IT.great food, great prices, and great staff. the owner is always there and very very friendly. the food is always very fresh and the portions are always very generous. i wish i lived and/or worked closer because i would go once a week to get my vietnamese craving satisfied.simply it is simply awesome
