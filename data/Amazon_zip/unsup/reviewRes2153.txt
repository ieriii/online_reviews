We waited from noon to 2pm on Saturday to get in the door. Doug took our order and was very friendly and nice (I would be too if I were making cash hand over fist like he is). We had the bacon duck with goat cheese (really good), wild boar with chili and cheese (favorite of the bunch), cherry and apple pork sausage with mustard and chocolate (okay but a lot of chocolate), Chicago dog (very good), and veggie dog with the works (not a lot of flavor compared to the others). The duck fat fries were very crispy and good (available Friday and Saturday). We were told the foie gras dog was good. Worth the wait? Yes, but we wouldn't wait that long a second time. Next time we'll get there early and hope the line is shorter. Bring cash! The specialty dogs are around $8, regular dog is around $2.
