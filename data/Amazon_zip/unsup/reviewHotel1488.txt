I loved this hotel. Very spacious, comfortable, and clean. We were lucky to be given a top floor room with great views of downtown and michigan avenue. I especially appreciated the seperation of the living area from the bedroom with french doors. Each area also has a door to the bathroom and the living area has a flat screen tv and a wet bar. I was told all rooms at the Omni have suites this. Unfortunately, we were there for a short weekend, two nights. We ordered room service late night and it was good food. The lobby is on the third floor and you have to take two seperate elevators to get to top floors from the ground floor.
