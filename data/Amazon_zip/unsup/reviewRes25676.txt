What a name! It makes me smile & appreciate being Asian for classic names like these. Simply It truly is 'simply it'. I kid, I kid. What it does have is the very best spring rolls in the city (confirmed by my Vietnamese hair stylist); altho I love a little heat, so I prefer to dip it first in hot sauce, then in the sweet peanut/plum sauce. Steamy yummy pho, a generous serving of fruit with your order, and for those looking for meaty dishes; they are generous and huge. The restaurant is cozy and warm, and lacks tvs (major plus). It's byo, but you should also order a taro smoothie w/tapioca beads. It's like a cross between rice pudding & a shake. It's amazing. Also, they offer a crazy lunch deal.
