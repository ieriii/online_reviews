Piece: the hipster haven that also somehow attracts frat tanks to the table. Togetherness. I have hater tendencies but I will put up with a lot for their pizza. Their red pizza with sausage and mushrooms is really the best sausage pizza I've found. I have also gotten mashed potato white pizza with broccoli, sausage, and garlic. Why not? They're all good. It's hard to screw up a Piece pizza unless your taste is really foul. Only problem is, when the masses roll in, you realize how not-huge this place is compared to how huge it looks. And with wait times of 2 hours on Saturday nights... good luck. It's usually worth it if you can snipe a bar seat to wait in. When it stops being worth it I'll stop coming here on weekends. Weekdays are generally a lot less stressful and the pizza is usually a little bit better because they have fewer of them to make. In the summer a late afternoon pizza on the upper deck where they open the shutters is really nice. Then you get to see and feel what a beautiful, sunny, glorious grunge festival Wicker Park really is. Beer on draft is almost always great. I like Golden Arm for a classic light crisp pizza beer. I also like to watch people make waitresses uncomfortable when they raise a pervy eyebrow and order a Camel Toe. This doesn't really ever get old.
