Came here on a super hot summer morning, the line was out the door by noon. I'm not sure what time they open but I'm almost positive they close really early, 4:30-5:00pm. I saw the line and immediately told my friends that there was no way I was waiting a good block down from where the door was. They assured me that the duck fat fries would be worth the wait. After about 50 minutes of waiting in line it was our turn to order. I decided to just get a regular hotdog and try something really different, I don't know what it was but there was foie gras on it. I must say that it was delicious. Too bad they didn't have the duck fat fries, only on the weekend I believe? There's limited seating for the amount of customers they have in any given time. Totally worth the wait.
