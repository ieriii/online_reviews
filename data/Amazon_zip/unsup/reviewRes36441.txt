Awesome place. I had the bear omelette (with "bear meat") one of their blended juice. It was a great experience! My sister had the orange brule french toast and said it was too sweet but I thought it was ok. I also didn't have to wait in line. It's a clean place. The menu looks good and the price is ok.
