Wow, this place is amazing. Had an incredible dinner there this weekend. I highly recommend he oysters from Prince Edward Island and the Nantucket scallops -- some of the best scallops I've ever had and scallops are my favorite dish. The atmosphere is great -- imagine a fishery infused with an old-world steakhouse. The staff are incredibly attentive and the customer service is unparalleled. Almost everything they serve is made in house and it's the best. A definite must for seafood lovers.
