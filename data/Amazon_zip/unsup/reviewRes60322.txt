HAIR IN SUSHI ROLL! ANT IN DRINK!My husband and I have been loyal patrons of Wakamono since 2007 when we moved to the Lakeview neighborhood. Last night we took my sister and her fianc there for dinner. Our table ordered 2 Godzilla rolls, 1 hotel California roll, 1 maki Mexicano roll and 1 of the daily special rolls. When the rolls were served they were plated all together. The second piece of sushi I ate was a from the Godzilla roll. After placing on my place, I noticed a black human hair sticking directly out of the center of the sushi. After seeing this, me and the rest of my party lost their appetites. I pointed this hair out to our server (SONIA) and asked to talk to the manager. I explained to the manager (a female, who refused to provide her name) that we were dissatisfied with the meal and that we would not eat any of the remaining rolls on the platter as they were all placed on the contaminated plate. At this point only three pieces had been eaten out of the many rolls ordered, prior to finding the human hair. I requested that we were happy to pay for the drinks and appetizers we ate before finding the hair, but that the sushi rolls should be removed from our bill. Who wants to continue to eat after noticing something disgusting as a thick black hair inside a roll? The manager decided that it was appropriate for her to not charge us for the hair roll. Instead she said everything else is fine and refused to accommodate us in any other way and augured with us for 3-5 minutes. Additionally, I ordered a pear martini and a dead ant was floating at the top of the beverage. I have reported Wakamono to the city of Chicago health department, better business bureau, and BBB food inspector. The lack of respect, courtesy and appropriateness towards their customers is disappointing. I would not recommend eating here any further.
