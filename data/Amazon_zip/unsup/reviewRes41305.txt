i really enjoy Bonsoiree. The folks that work here are friendly and unpretentious. They seem to have a lot of fun with food. Have had some amazing dishes here: smoked pork belly, s'mores made w/ scallop (and I hate scallops), perfectly cooked fish..., sansho peppers(!) Be prepared for a loooooong dinner. Nice small space can get a little cold in the winter.
