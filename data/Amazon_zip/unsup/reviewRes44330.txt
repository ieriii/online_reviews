"The Dilemma of the Trendy Sushi Bar" by Philip K. Once upon a time, there was a 20-something guy living in Lakeview. Having just graduated from college and having not yet found a worthwhile job, he was forced to live and play on a meager salary.  Oh so often, he would walk by the recently opened and highly trendy sushi bar called Wakamono on Broadway. "Gee, David," he would say to his partner, "we should check that place out sometime."  And so they saved their spare change for weeks and weeks, knowing that they would be paying not only for good sushi, but for the extra-loud pop music, fabulous presentation, minimalist and somewhat uncomfortable seating and everything-in-wood decor. Indeed, the menu prices were high and made them wonder how much sushi actually costs to prepare. As the night went on, the lights became dimmer and the music got louder, and all was trendier than could be imagined possible.  But they enjoyed the atmosphere and the delicious raw fish with smiles on their faces. (Facial expressions became particularly important as the rising decibals of music made conversation more and more dificult.) In the end, they left the trendy sushi bar feeling much trendier and much happier (by societal standards) than before. The End.
