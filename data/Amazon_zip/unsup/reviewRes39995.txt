San Soo Gab San, what a HUGE disappointment. I promised myself that I'd go check this place out when I deemed myself worthy (and by worthy I mean being able to say the name of the place by putting the four 3-letter words in the correct order). On the day of rapture, I decided to celebrate the end times by taking the wife for an early dinner to beat the Saturday rush and was seated immediately around 5 PM. The menu looked a little intimidating so I asked the server if she could help us out. She mumbled something, pointed to the corner of the menu and left us to figure things out.  It took us awhile, but basically to get the full experience of plugging the hole in the table with fiery charcoal, you need to order two meats (approximately $20 each). I recommend going for the kalbi (marinated short ribs) and bulgogi (marinated beef), you can't go wrong as both were marinated well and as such really tasty. If you're only eating as a couple though, one meat is enough as they give you a good amount on a large plate to cook. They also give you more than enough side dishes (banchan), around 19 little bowls of mystery and 1 little bowl of potato salad. We were taking our time and enjoying ourselves until the owner walked by and said that we needed to cook our meat faster because the coals were dying out, which was absolutely not true. Instead, it was her way of trying to rush us (we hadn't been there for more than 30 mins). If we didn't get that hint, the next one a few minutes later was more obvious: our server, not even acknowledging us, took the rest of our meat and dumped it on the grill, a definite WTF?  And if that wasn't enough, the next party to sit at that table had already been led there before I had even finished paying the bill. To that, I'd say that I agree with other reviewers about the crappy service they have.
