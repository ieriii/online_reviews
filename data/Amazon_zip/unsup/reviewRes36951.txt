Something has gone horribly wrong with the expansion of the space. The food we had there on a recent weeknight was uniformly bad. And not like past experiences I have had. Mussels were small, gritty, and should have been rejected; the wine sauce was bitter. The Montreal smoked meat was a series of end pieces that were dry and old, just awful. Even the sides were failures. The mac and cheese was watery and never set up, and the slaw was worse. The fries were flobbery. They need to get their shit together unless they are happy serving great beers with awful food. The second star is based solely on the great space, the friendly staff, and the beer list.
