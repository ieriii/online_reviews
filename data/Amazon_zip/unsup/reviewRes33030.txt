Had a delicious dinner tonight!! Went there with family and everyone enjoyed their meal and atmosphere. The owner, who served as our waiter for the evening was inviting and friendly. He was also slightly goofy and overly energetic, but fun, fun, fun. Overall everyone had a great time and delicious meals. Tried a little of the award winning stuffed chicken thighs, as well as the skirt steak, but the best dish was far and above the stuffed cabbage. I was very happy that I ordered this dish, it was nicely seasoned and a very generous portion. While the owner was very attentive to my 11 year old daughter and even included her in the lighting of the saganaki, she did have a difficult time finding a suitable item on the menu. She settled on the Village Salad which contained fresh tomatoes, cucumber, green and red peppers, red onion, olives and feta cheese. She was definitely happy in the end though. I used a You Swoop coupon and had absolutely no problem with using it. Will definitely go back again!
