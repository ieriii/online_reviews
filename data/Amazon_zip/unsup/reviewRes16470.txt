I came here with a friend after buying a $40 groupon for $20, and were so excited to come to this buffet--our mini reunion after the college school year ended. The restaurant was certainly beautiful, and the dishes were diverse and elegant, with everything from seafood to appetizers to chicken and vegetables, not to mention fruit and dessert.  But as with so many buffets, the presentation was the only beauty. The food was bland and not property seasoned, perhaps specifically to my extra-loving sodium tongue. The chicken tikka masala, for example, had no creamy tomato kick to the sauce. The mango chicken tasted like chicken swimming in sugar. The ice-cream was not ice-cream, but instead a pile of ice with a few designs to make it look all pretty. When we arrived, the server presented us with a plate of Tandorri Chicken and naan bread. The chicken was actually the most descent part of the meal (besides the cauliflower dish that actually tasted good), but I actually thought it was a waste of money, as there were no way we were going to finish the whole dish. The naan was also delicious. I don't know why so many people said really good things about it, but I was sorely disappointed. Can't wait to go back to Caf of India in Cambridge. There, it's cheaper, and better.
