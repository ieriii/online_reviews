A reasonably priced reliable restaurant with many delicious breakfast options. I love the salmon cakes and the andouille hash. The menu is supposedly southern reconstruction, whatever that is. I don't know if the food is authentic, but it is tasty and the service prompt. This part of Lakeview is affluent territory, so there are a lot of neighborhood families at the weekend. This is a huge space, so even if you do go at the weekend the line moves quickly. The restaurant is clean and bright with huge colorful lantern things (best way I can describe them) over the booths. They look like chinese lanterns on acid! Dinner offers many options, and I have never had a bad meal here. It is worth going here for the lemon cloud pie alone. Unfortunately this is a revolving menu item, so they don't always have it. If they have it, try it because it puts key lime pie to shame.
