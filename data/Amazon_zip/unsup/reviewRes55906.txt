I'd never eaten good Indian food before so I went with a friend who lived there for a while. She was kind enough to order for me as she knew what I liked. Boy was it good. I'd eat Indian food anyday if it always tasted this good. They didn't have Kingfisher beer but the waiter suggested another that was very good. I'd recommend this place to anyone.
