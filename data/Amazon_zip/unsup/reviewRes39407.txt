Food is good, but service is HORRIBLE. Come here if you want your standard grill yourself Korean BBQ. I think this place is 24 hours, and it is busy at the oddest times. I think I went once on a weekday at around 10 pm and there was a huge line. The meats are quite good here. Side dishes are good too, but they are quite salty.  Their soup entrees are actually really good, the spicy shredded beef noodles is damn good on a cold day. The tofu soup Sondobu is actually pretty lackluster though, don't get it.  Some bad thing's are the parking, their lil parking lot is full of Asian people who can't park. So they go into stalls that are too small in weird angles. Save yourself the trouble and just park on the street.  As stated the service is JUST PLAIN BAD, I mean come on I expect more even with a Korean restaurant. They have a fiscally sound, but retarded policy of not giving you side dishes except with your main course. So that one time where I waited for my soup entree for 45 minutes, they would not bring out the side dishes, so that they would not need to bring out seconds. Service is so bad that on one occasion I left no tip. Usually giving less than 5%. But if you're willing to put up with it...it's some good eating.
