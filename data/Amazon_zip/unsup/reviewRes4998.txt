I don't like community seating, but PP made up for it by by seating us next to cool people;) The food was awesome. I have been searching for lardo and finally found it, it was delicious! The bone marrow was also fantabulous. My lady and I mouwed our way through 6-7 courses, plus a bottle of wine and only racked up an $80 bill.... not to shabby! The service was great even though they were very busy. Kudos Purple Pig!
