Think of The Bad Apple as a gateway bar. You can avoid the standard black-frame-glasses, ambien-fueled, popped collar crowd and get elbow deep in tasty beef burgers topped with everything from fried eggs to brisket and pulled pork on a pretzel bun. Wash all that down with six or seven of the 28(ish) draft beers that Bad Apple Beer Sommeliers rotate as often as weekly or try your hand at their extensive bottle list, including a sampling of 750mL bombers that'd make a nun need to do laundry. So unless I missed something and that zombie bird pandemic swinepocalypse happened, grab your hat, get a seat at the bar and start enjoying the low hanging fruits that the Bad Apple has and continues to offer.
