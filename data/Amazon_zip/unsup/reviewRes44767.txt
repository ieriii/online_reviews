This was my very first Chicago-style deep dish pizza experience and I gotta say folks, I was not impressed. The reason you see two stars here are for the following: 1. The waitress was nice. 2. The salad that my friend shared with me (thanks) was good. As for the main entree, blah! After about 45-55 minutes of anxiously waiting for the arrival of a true Chicago pie, I couldn't wait for the rest of my friends to get their slice, so I went ahead and bit into my share like a starving mole rat. Sound the buzzard because this pizza is crap. Ok, it wasn't greasy and it didn't leave vats of oil on my plate, which is a huge plus, but it tasted like dairy for crying out loud. That really was my response, "This tastes like dairy". I started to sense my friends were also having similar responses. We ran into some native Chicagoans the next day at Lollapalooza and informed them about our wonderful endeavor and to our surprise, they had the same review as me, the guy from out of town. Apparently, every Chicagoan has their own favorite deep dish joint, so you basically gotta try them all out to find your fav.
