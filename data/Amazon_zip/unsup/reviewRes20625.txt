I have no complaints, only praise. I went with two friends. We had reservations and were apparently seated promptly (I was a bit late). Service was excellent throughout. The server didn't rush us even though there was a sizable crowd at the door, and he kept both the bottle of white and sparkling we brought on ice. He even brought new glasses when we switched to a bottle of red. We started with edamame and seaweed salad - both standard appetizers, prepared as expected. We tried several kinds of maki, and all were delicious. We also each had pieces of fatty tuna, and they were excellent. Everything we ate was fresh, delicious and delivered promptly to our table. While this isn't quite Mirai, it's an excellent alternative when you want to byob.
