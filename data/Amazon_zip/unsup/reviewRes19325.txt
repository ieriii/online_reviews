I think anything taste good when you are STARVING! But the food here did more than satisfy deep hunger! Kinda trendy, kinda old fashion this joint is cute either way :) I got the hanger steak salad which was delicous; steak was cooked the way I like it and the salad was perfectly dressed. Not too much not too little. I tried my friend's scallop dish and it was like BUTTER..... actually better than butter. Scallops perfectly tender and juicy which were cut by pickeled onions! mmmhhhh !!! Unfortately I was so focused on the meal, I complete forgot about pictures! :(  .... STILL, come to gage, eat with friends and get some drinks; garaunteed you'll have a good time :)
