We went here for my birthday dinner. The ambiance was romantic... dark and candlelit. The mixed drinks were quite good. I liked that they had a "low calorie" section. We got soft salad rolls as an appetizer and i loved it. The dip was finger licking good! For our main course we ordered lemongrass chicken in chili basil sauce and diced chicken with eggplant, yams, mango and cashew. We also got a side of the fried rice. The food was exquisite! The flavors were balanced and the spice levels were just perfect. The service was prompt and the waiter was very friendly. The only complaint i had was that the tables were set a little too close to each other and it felt slightly cramped. Overall I would highly recommend Le Colonial to anyone looking for a romantic place to dine.
