I've been to XOCO one other time for lunch and I went again this Saturday and enjoyed it just as much. Be sure to go when you have time to wait in line for 30 minutes and don't mind dining with others close by because the eating area is small. The food is amazing. I love the melansa, cubana, ahogada tortas!! They are all delicious. We shared the chips, salsa, and guacamole. It is fresh and flavorful! We also ordered a chocolate coffee which was extremely rich. The iced tea was solid but the surprise hibiscus lemongrass tea was awesome! A sweet iced tea lemonade blend. I will definitely get it the next time I go!! We ended our meal with churros and chocolate. Fresh, hot, and authentic. As far as the service, this place needs some work, we were told that the iced tea was bottomless and then were refused a refill. We were waiting awhile for our churros after our meal and when we asked the hostess about it she took another person's order to fill ours. I love the food and because of that I will return but I hope that they can work out some of the other parts of our dining experience.
