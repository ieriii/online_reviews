Grand Lux Cafe is owned by the same group as the Cheesecake Factory, BUT Grand Lux Cafe is MUCH BETTER! I only wish they had more locations around the country. Why? The good has better taste, the menu is not overbearing and they give some other tastes in areas that the CF misses on. I ALWAYS have to get the Potato Spring Rolls to start. They are amazing.
