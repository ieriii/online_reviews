Great deal. We got the "internet only" deal and then used a coupon for a $10 upgrade to a suite. All this is on their own web site. The suite coupon was "subject to availability" but we got one without trouble. One king bed and one couch bed. The suite was very comfortable and clean. Fridge, two TVs, lots of chairs to relax in. Looked brand new, no marks on wall, etc. Staff are very helpful with tourist tips. Right across the street from Hard Rock Cafe and Rain Forest Cafe but room is quiet. EASY walk to the Magnificent Mile and the amazing stores (check Bloomingdales for the stain glass windows). No breakfast or any restaurants in the hotel, they do have a bar. Free broadband Internet. Essentially a basic , clean place . A suite in a downtown area with FREE parking for $100 a night (plus 23% tax) !!!
