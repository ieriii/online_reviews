10:30 on a Tuesday morning, we walked right in and got a table with no problem at all. The decor was neat and it was a nice space. It wasn't incredibly busy, but enough to where you knew that you had found the right place. The menu was extraordinary. They were serving both breakfast and lunch. I had breakfast and my friend had lunch. The bacon was plentiful and done perfectly. The croissant was light and buttery. My friend had a sandwich that was so perfectly layered and interesting to eat. I'm not sure what it was but I think it had brie on it. The waitress actually suggested. The wait staff was incredible. Casually dressed and stylish. I guess this is what you are supposed to expect in Wicker Park. My friend was so impressed with the waitress that she asked her where to shop in the neighborhood, and she gave some great suggestions. The only problem with such a short trip to Chicago is that you want to try everything and yet when you find some place like the Bongo Room you just want to keep coming back there. We will have to deal with that when we return next time.
