This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Chicago. We lived in East Village and I would go out of my way to go eat here instead of the other Thai restaurants near by Wicker Park or Buck town. I always ordered either the Pad Prik King (Ginger chicken) or the Pad Kra Prow (Basil chicken). I usually orders the entrees with a choice of chicken because I don't think Thai dishes, especially the stir-fried w/ vegetables, are good with red meat, unless you're ordering the Lard Na noodle.  This is one of the few restaurants that prepares the Basil chicken or Pad Kra Prow using ground chicken instead of sliced chicken - so that deserved an extra star from me. The restaurant gets very crowded during the weekend and the services tend to get slow at times. Price is cheap and food is good. I come here often and always.
