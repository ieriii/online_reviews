My husband and I really enjoyed our experience at Fogo 2 Go. The owner's husband was there and was really sweet and engaging. I'm a normally shy person, but he made me feel very comfortable.  It's definitely not the best place to eat-in, but for a to-go, mid-week pizza it's amazing. My only complaints would be that the toppings were a little sparse on our by the slice pieces and it was also a bit greasy. This place deserves a 5 because of its above average pizza and reasonable prices.
