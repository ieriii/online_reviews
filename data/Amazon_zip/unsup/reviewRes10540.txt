I don't know how anyone can give this restaurant anything less than 4 stars. Like, Steve G. below, who gave this place only two stars, I also had the Halibut. It was excellent. I didn't feel there was an over abundance of farro. Infact, I thought it was very well balanced. I had grilled calamari for an appetizer -which was fantastic. The restaurant is very well priced. I thought our bill was going to be a lot higher than it was. The only reason we went there was because we were invited by friend's of ours as I'm not a fan of Itialian food. I am definitely coming back there!
