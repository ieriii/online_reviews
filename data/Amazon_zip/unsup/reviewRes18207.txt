My brother came from California for a visit, and wanted Italian food and some good wine. Now in his little Bay Area town, Olive Garden is the most appealing and authentic option, so I figured I could pretty much pick something at random and it would be a hit. I was really surprised when my husband and I loved it as well - I'm jaded when it comes to Italian, having had too much that was just blah and bad. Our meal began with fresh Italian bread, along with a garnish of garlic, cheese, and hot pepper, to be mixed with olive oil and spread on the bread. Me being me, I was spooning hunks of garlic directly onto my bread (bet you all wish you got to kiss me every night, huh?) but my dining companions preferred the daintier dipping option. When our server told us the specials, we couldn't resist the bruschetta as a starter - pretty fail-safe generally, and good here - and the cheese-stuffed gnocchi for me, lobster ravioli for my brother, and the gorgonzola risotto for my husband. Now, like I said, I am a cynic when it comes to Italian. Too often I hear raves for places that are serving dried reconstituted pastas and watery canned-tomato sauces, held together with a stick of butter per plate. Not here. The pasta was fresh-made, the sauces were rich and full over flavor, and there was probably a stick of butter per plate but I gave up on caring about that after the first bite. The gnocchi was perfectly al dente - ever had overcooked gnocchi? I think they call that "mashed potato" - as was the ravioli. The risotto had the ideal creamy texture that I can never achieve at home no matter how much I stir (not enough butter?). None of us could finish our meals, so we lingered to finish off our wine and digest a bit. We didn't try the desserts, but they seemed pretty standard Italian fare, tartuffo and all of that. All in all, a great experience, and we will be back!
