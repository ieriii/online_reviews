I hate you, but I love you. It's true. I'm stuck on you... Yes, that's my relationship with Fox and Obel. Fortunately, they are a hop skip and jump away from my job, unfortunately, it would cost darn near a Sallie Mae student loan to feed yourself breakfast and lunch there on a biweekly basis. Why are you SO EXPENSIVE?!! Yes, your displays are cute and reminiscint of European grocery shoppes (with two p's and an e), yes, you're always clean, and yes, you have items that Whole Foods/Trader Joe's might carry as well. BUT, your customer service is about as reliable as Chicago's weather, you treat your employees like crap in front of customers (I saw you, and you were NOT being nice), and you simply aren't special enough to charge $24 for a little cheese, a tomato, some cilantro, and bread. With all that being said, Phyllis, Tsiga (sorry for the incorrect spelling), and moody lady with the short straight blonde hair, I love you all. If you're going to handover your life savings to Fox, at least buy the blueberry muffins from the bakery and the tomato basil soup from the cafe otherwise, stock up at the beginning of the week at Dominicks and save your bank account the trouble.
