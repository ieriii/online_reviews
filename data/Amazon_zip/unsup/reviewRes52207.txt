Restaurant Review How can you miss a chance to have deep dish when visiting the windy city. I have grown up in Illinois and never pass up a chance for deep dish pizza. Nestled in Streeterville is a two story restaurant that always has a line of customers around the building waiting to get in during peak dining hours. The deep dish pizzas are rich in ingredients and thick mozzarella cheese. It takes some time after you place your order before the pizza is done. In the mean time you can write/graffiti the walls. Where else can you go and write on the walls and chairs. (Remember to bring a permanent marker, white out pen, or other writing utensil). The prices here are more expensive than the suburban restaurant, however still cheap if going out with large groups. Service can be slow at times, but you will be full by the time you leave. If you are no hungry for pizza, they also have salads and other typical italian flare. Pros- excellent deep dish, variety of pizza ingredients, you can write on the walls and table Cons- slow service, lots of customer and long wait times during peak hours Hidden deals- If you go at lunch time by yourself or a small group, you can skip the line and walk to the quick lunch area. You enter the restaurant and go through the doors to the right. The LUNCH SPECIAL is amazing price for $6.25 you get a small deep dish pizza (cheese, sausage, or special) with cup of soup (chicken Florentine), and unlimited refill on soda. For 1 dollar more there are other sandwich and salad selections available. Minimal wait time, no tip as you clean up after yourself, and bargain lunch price.
