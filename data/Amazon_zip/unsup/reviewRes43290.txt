Ok there is a a lot of hype for this place and I guess for good reason. It is super tasty! I went early on one of the coldest days of the winter around 10am and there was still a wait of about 20 minute for a table. I did find the ordering before you sit down a little strange but it worked out. For breakfast I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which had scrambled eggs, black beans, and cheese topped with tortillas and salsa all put together in a casserole dish. I am a huge fan of savory breakfast items and this hit the spot! Next time I might just get some things for take away and avoid the wait for the table. All the pastry items are great and very tasty coffee. With great food, good coffee and a friendly staff, I can see why Milk & Honey is always packed on the weekend.
