Texas De Brazil has a lot of great things a lot of things going for it. There are a lot of items to choose from, probably more than any other churrascaria in Chicago. There is a window for sushi, slice seared tuna, shrimp, pasta, salads, fruits, pretty much everything you can thing of. The problem might be that since they focus on so many different things, nothing really blows your socks off. The service is horrible compared to Fogo and Brazzaz, and the meat isn't as good in execution nor flavor. Still TDB has it's value if your a person who places a smaller emphasis on the beef. The salad bar options are plenty, the wines are numerous, and there is a woman flying around in the wine cellar. Can't beat that.
