Giordano's was hoppin' on a Friday night in August when I went. Rosebud across the street relatively less so. We waited almost an hour and a half (!) for a table because they don't take reservations. The guy who called out names appeared to be working off two lists which didn't make any sense, and then he disappeared for a bit, making some angry customers! Despite the crazy wait, my party of three had terrific service once we sat down, and since they let you preorder your pizza, we got the pizza soon after. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. It was clear, though, that the pizza had been under the heat lamp for awhile since the tomato sauce was getting a little crusty/overbaked. We had green peppers, onions, and mushrooms on our pizza. The pizza had a little too much cheese and not enough veggies, but it was still great deep dish. I would recommend Giordano's on a less crowded night.
