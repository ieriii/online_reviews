One of my absolute favorites. For me, it's really hard to beat sitting by the fireplace/stove on a snowy night with a great Belgian beer and their mussels and frites. The bar downstairs gets really annoying and crowded, so try to snag a seat in the upstairs bar to wait for a table (the wait is usually really long). Also, we're usually too full from all the bread and frites to order dessert, but their apple fritters are awesome!!
