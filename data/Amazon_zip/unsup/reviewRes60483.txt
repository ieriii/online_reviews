Some really tasty dishes. I particularly like the chargrilled octopus as a starter, and the other night I tried the roast suckling pig which was delicious. Some of the servings are a little small - but with an appetizer to share and 1/2 dishes of pasta we went home full. The waiters are always ready to lend a hand deciphering some of the oddly named dishes or to help you pick a wine for a certain dish.They can be pretty busy, so reservations are a good idea.
