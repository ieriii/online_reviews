What happened Frontera? This is the last and first place I ate before and after living in south america. We love your food, but our service was HORRIBLE! We were a party of 10 this last Friday before walking to the court house to get married. When asked what the least spicy dish on the menu was (because my sister cannot digest spicy foods) our waiter said :pick three and I'll tell you what is least spicy (what a way to respond when asking for help!) Not only that, but he chose something that we realized after the fact that was spicy. In addition, even though we asked for no onions (she can not digest those either) they arrived with them right on top!) We resorted to ordering rice and beans, just so she could eat something! We had to flag down the waiter, because he never checked in with us, and at the end of the meal, I was raising my hand as if in grade school, because two people were served coffee cups, but never any coffee!!!!!!! To top it off, (which "is what it is" - but it just made us want to run outta there even faster) the waiter delivered the check to my now husband with a pen opened and facing him. When he opened the bill the pen came sliding out onto his wedding day shirt leaving a nice line down the front of it. it was simply a disappointing and embarrassing dining experience for us and our family.
