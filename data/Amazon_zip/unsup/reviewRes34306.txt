We live in the neighborhood and have been to Mia Francesca many times. While we find that eating inside the restaurant can be distracting and extremely loud, the backyard outdoor patio is great in warm weather. We have also discovered that ordering take-out is fast and easy, and another way to enjoy the food in a quieter setting. I am a big fan of the bolognese pasta sauce - I think it's the best in the city. Overall, our experience at Mia Francesca is consistently good, especially if we stick to eating outdoors and/or at home.
