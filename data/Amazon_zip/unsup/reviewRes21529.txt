I don't think this place could get any better for what it is. Fun, cheeky, authentic retro.. maybe if the car hops had skates on, nah, their brass personalities make it worth it. I'm vegetarian and I love Super Dawg. It just makes me happy. I go there to stare at the Super hotdogs and killer 60s? black and blue diamond exterior. I happily sit in the car and eat my grilled cheese and fries and wish that I knew all the waitresses personally cuz you just know they have great stories. They do a really great job and deserve good tips for running back and forth to your car even when its cold. AND YOU HAVE TO TRY THE ICECREAM. not sure if anyone gave its uniqueness away but I won't say anything else. What a treat. Take your family and your dates here for the old time fun of it.
