Place is super super super packed. I visited here for lunch and the wait was almost 1.5 hours. The pizza is a bit expensive but you get a lot. I mean you get a lot! I'm a big eater, I can eat a lot!!! I ate a slice and a half and I was done. I love deep dish pizza and this place makes one of the best! The service was pretty crappy, I'd have to say a lot of it was the fact that they were understaffed at the time of visit. I'd come back any day I visit chicago again.
