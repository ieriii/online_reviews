LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! I came here and already fell in love with the ambiance. it was definitely a place I'd like to kick back, relax with a friend over some beer and good food. they have a HUGE beer selection and it was delicious! i forgot what we had but i noticed that they also have a building connected to the restaurant where you can see people going upstairs (glass windows) into the cute hotels when you're too drunk to go home...... how cool is that. Appetizer: I had the bone marrow with french toast... soooooo good and sooo greasy. You dip a cute little spoon into the marrow and use that as a spread for the toast... Entree: Had the Slagel Family Farm porchetta, sweet corn, bacon risotto, peach heirloom tomato relish, pea vines,and paprika oil. It looked like a weird combo but all of that completely went so well together. I love sweet corn and bacon so i went with in instincts.....it turned out phenomenal. I forgot what beers i had because i was so carried away at how amazing the food was and how much i enjoyed my company...
