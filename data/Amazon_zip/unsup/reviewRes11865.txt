Went for brunch on a Sunday and the wait was about 40 minutes. The food was amazing but because of the wait, not accepting reservations, and the hostess was rude when telling us we were in the way as we were waiting caused a 3-star rating. The food deserves 5 stars. The Eggs Benedict was one of the best I have had in the city and I tried the red velvet pancakes which were decadent, very rich but so yummy. One was plenty unless you have are a huge sweets person.
