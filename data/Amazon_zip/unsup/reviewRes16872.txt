Let me start by saying, I LOVE the food here. The Ropa Vieja is delicious, the fish tacos are amazing, and I've never had anything I don't like. However, there are a few downsides that I feel are necessary to disclose, despite my love for this place. On a recent Tuesday night, I went with a friend after making an 8:30pm reservation. We showed up at 8:25, and were told it would be a few minutes. We stepped over to the bar to grab a drink while we waited. First, we were given a beeper (Seriously, is this TGI Fridays? Have your hostesses find your guests at the bar and invite them to sit. This is just plain tacky). I ordered what has become one of my favorite beers, which Carnivale introduced me too, and they were out of it. Really? On a Tuesday? Ugh. Finally, at 8:55pm we were seated for our 8:30 reservation, even though there were many empty 2-tops in the place. Normally, service like this would make me rate a place 3 stars or less, but I love the food here so much that I will still keep going back.
