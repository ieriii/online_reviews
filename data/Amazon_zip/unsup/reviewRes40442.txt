Alrighy now, let's be a little objective here. I know that we are all excited to have a new spot in Logan Square but there are some issues to address here. I will be upfront and say that I did not eat when I was here but that was mostly due to the fact that there were few if any items that I could eat. I looked and looked at the menu and I believe that there were 3 maybe 4 items on the entire menu that didn't include beef or pork. The scallops had beef, one salad was made with a bacon dressing, the list continues. If you eat anything and everything and could care less about the number of calories, grams of fat and your cholesterol level then you should be happy here. The food did look and smell delicious but I am really tired of places that serve pork with their pork. Impress me with something that I've never heard of before or tasted together. Besides that the bar is cool and old fashioned. The crowd on a Wednesday night was very Logan Square hipster. And it was pretty packed at 7pm when I got there. It thinned out a bit by 8:30. I can't even imagine how packed this place must get on the weekends. It was a typical loud bar which also might not be ideal for a nice dinner out. The staff was very nice and helpful. The beer list was great and the whiskey list is phenomenal. They did have a cool old juke box which had some good tunes on it. I know there was music playing when I was there but I couldn't tell you what it was. My only other complaint was that the bathrooms were a bit dirtier than I would expect. I hope that is something that they fix quickly. I will go back sometime to try one of the few items on the menu that I can eat. Until then I can't give it a completely fair review. So far it is a nice place to grab a beer or whiskey but expect it to be crowded if you go at a peak time.
