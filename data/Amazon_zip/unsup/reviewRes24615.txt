Absolutely delicious Artopitas. They are flakey pastries filled with various ingredients such as mushrooms, cheese, feta or ham. I always order mine with pasta salad and a glass of the house wine, a nice dry white. Highly recommend trying this place. In the summer you can sit at a table near the floor to ceiling open windows.
