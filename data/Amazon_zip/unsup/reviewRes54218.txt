Food is overpriced and not good. Anytime, I have to spend $30 for rice and beans and vegetables, there is a problem. The food was just not good. The portions are nice sized. The batidos were good. Especially the mora y guanabana.**UPDATE**I am big on customer service...after all that is what I am paying for in addition to the food. Irazu gets an A++ for customer service. I appreciate it when management reaches out to its patrons and appreciates their business. After reading my review, the owner Henry, sent me a message apologizing for my experience and offered me a complimentary plate in exchange for trying Irazu again. I will definitely give them another try solely based on his response. I am a small business owner, and really appreciate other small businesses that go out of their way to make the customer happy!! Thank you Henry!
