LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE! The food here is so good. The chicken wings are awesome and the bi bim bop is my favorite. The staff is AMAZING. One time we waited a little longer than normal, so we asked about our food and the guy at the counter forgot to put the order in so he refunded our money AND got our food to us right away because he didn't want us to leave with a bad impression of the place. Needless to say, the money went in the tip jar because really, who does that?! Fantastic, glad to have it in the neighborhood, it will always be my go-to.
