I've never had Columbian food before this and I would have to say.. I'm in love.. with the chimichurri sauce. The waiter was kind enough to write down the recipe for us, and we made it at home. The Picada Colombiana for two was more than enough to make our bellys explode.. with leftovers. This place is definitely generous with its portions. Great romantic atmosphere and great service. High recommended, but make sure you're starving before you come.
