I was ecstatic to dine at this restaurant since I've heard Graham Elliot Bowles is such an incredible chef. I read briefly about his career and accomplishments... I was amazed! So, I admit that I came in with very high expectations for the evening. Overall I thought Graham Elliot was just OK to a total blah. Kinda disappointed. It began with our flakey waiter who seemed too busy or clueless to realize he was a server. Numerous times he forgot something we'd asked for. Also, pet peeve: each time we were served a dish they placed it in front of the wrong person. Quite an accomplishment for a table of 3. The presentation was beautiful and the food was in tiny portions, which is nice since I don't like big heavy meals. The signature popcorn you're served was odd to me. It was soggy, lacked any crispness and epitomized mediocre. Literally, it was soggy popcorn with some cheese shaved on top. Not a fan. I thought the scallop appetizer was OK; the deconstructed caesar salad was excellent. I ordered the ahi tuna entre, again just OK. I tried some of the chicken... what a mistake, I wish I got that! It was so delicious. There was a bit of brown foam with it that had the most magnificent flavor. I would've ordered the foam and drank it out of a jug-if possible. In short, the chicken would be the only thing I would go back for. Half way through dinner all of the lights went out and the wait staff freaked out. We sat in total darkness for about 10 minutes. Did they forget to pay their electric bill? What's with that? Last thing I have to say about Graham Elliot was it was SO overpriced. It was not that special. Wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it.
