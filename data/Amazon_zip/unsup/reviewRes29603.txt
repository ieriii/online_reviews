I was really hungry the other day and I decided to try this place on a whim as I walked up Clark Street to see a flick at the cineplex. Very impressed with service- friendly and efficient. I ordered a Talapia special with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and my total came out at under 18.00. The price is below average, but the quality of the food was above average. In short, try this place out, you will not be disappointed. I will be patronizing this place in the future.
