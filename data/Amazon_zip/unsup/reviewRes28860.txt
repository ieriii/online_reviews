What could I possibly add to this review list that hasn't already been said... They serve Peroni. OK, so I do prefer Moretti but at least they have Peroni, the beer that was the official sponsor of my bocce ball team. Any place that purports to serve Italian food had better have an Italian beer on the menu, right? Right.
