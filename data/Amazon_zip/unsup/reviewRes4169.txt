This review is super late, but better late then never right? I was lucky enough to be given the opportunity to partake in a soft opening shortly before Schwa reopened. We were served a 9 course culinary avant-garde adventure. I must say, Michael Carlson, you are rockin' some shit! We were provided with wine pairings and Rhyme Sayers soundtrack, which coming from Minneapolis was a cherry on top! The food, wow...beer cheese soup, jelly fish pad thai, liver and onions, candied sweet breads with parsnip custard. Unbelievable. Shout out to Mike Noll! This place is the new wave!
