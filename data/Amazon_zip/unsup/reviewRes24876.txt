Yea I ate here an yea I dropped a lot of money, but yea I ate over half the menu. Me and my boy dropped in here for a casual dinner on a freezing January Saturday night. It was late I might add and the place was loud, lively and packed with the standard look-at-me jackasses. The space is huge and the music was, to my tastes, excelente! Kind of Euro vibe; loungy, funky,etc...  Well, we started with some excellent charcuterria. From there we moved to the prawns - probably the best thing we had that night, we ordered it three times over all told, briny and charred perfectly. It was nice to have them served head-on because sucking the brains and head out was tasty! The chibarones were charred nicely al planxa - their specialty - but lacked that last hit of salt... The pork belly was swimming in some kind of glaze that overpowered everything on the plate and did not do the protein proper justice. The rabbit was good, but again, drowned in butter and the whole foam thing is so played out! The lamb chops, once again from the grill, were recommended and for good reason. Cooked to perfection and a palette pleaser no doubt.  Patatas bravas - Smokey Cebollas Rellenas - Cheesy Absinthe - Dreamy Red Wine - Perfect White Wine - Refreshing Beers - Standard Goodness I'll be back... with $30 in my wallet!
