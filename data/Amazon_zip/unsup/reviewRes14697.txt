Finally tried my Cuban Sandwhich! It was good, but given this was the first one I ever had I was a little dissapointed and not sure how to accurately compare..so I will move on. My friend got the Bistec dinner and it was amazing. The meat was cooked to perfection and flavored well; covered in onions and a garlic sauce. It came with white rice flavored only how Latinos do, black beans that were very good in flavor and texture, and maduros (sweet fried plantains). It was a huge portion for one person too. Over all damn good Cuban food and Im excited to go back and try the ropa vieja!
