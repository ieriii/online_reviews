What I want in a hotel might differ from most people. I would much rather have an interesting hotel, grand lobby, a sense of history, etc.. and a small but adequate room rather than a boring hotel with spacious rooms (Yes I'm looking right at you Embassy Suites). The Hilton Chicago is everything you would want in a classic hotel. - Scenic location - Amazing architecture  - Humongous lobby  - History oozing out of the walls like blood out of the elevators in The Shining Scenes from The Fugitive, My Best Friends Wedding, Primal Fear, Home Alone 2 and Road to Perdition were all filmed at the Hilton Chicago. They also boast that every president since FDR has walked through their doors. If it's good enough for Dr. Richard Kimble and Gerald Ford shouldn't it be good enough for you? I don't want to forget about our room completely though, after all it's the only hotel room I've had with two bathrooms and that comes in very handy when getting ready in the morning. It's just when I'm traveling the last thing I want to do is stay in the hotel room. I'd much rather be out experiencing the city or at the very least having a drink in the lobby. The Hilton Chicago has two bars that stay open late. Kitty O'Sheas and the Lakeside Green Lounge. If you want to watch a game or news hit the lounge otherwise you're better off at Kitty O'Sheas a faux Irish pub. Also if you want a nice free view find your way to the roof of the hotel for views of Lake Michigan, Grant Park, Navy Pier and the entire city behind you.
