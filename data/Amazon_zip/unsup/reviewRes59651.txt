WOW! great food at an unbelievable price. A dinner for 2 came out to under $15 with tip. Tacos were great and the guacamole was also very good. My only small complaint was the chips tasted a bit stale but as a free extra and considering that everything else was so good and so cheap not even a big concern. Fantastic food overall although thinking back on it, a little scary that all the food could be so cheap and still be approved for eating. Hiding that thought deep in the brain, the food was fantastic and will be going back many a time.
