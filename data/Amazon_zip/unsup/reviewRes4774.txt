Well I finally made it here twice in the past few months. And let me tell you... I am amazed. The service sucked. And when I say "sucked" I mean, both times I was there and it was beyond flagging-down-my-waiter-because-I'm-tired-of-being-ignored bad. The second time we sat at the bar while about 6 people behind the bar refused to make eye contact while cleaning glasses. Hello! Can I order a drink? I'm a big tipper.  Besides that, the food was good. Between my two visits, I had one of the panini's and two of the smears and the mussels. Everything was yummy. The wine selection is very god. I might be more excited to talk about the food and drink if I didn't have to beg to get a glass of wine.
