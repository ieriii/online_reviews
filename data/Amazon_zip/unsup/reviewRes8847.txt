OMG - we love this place. The main thing that we like was the combination of the ingredients and best of all the crust. The crust reminds me of the Indian 'roti' (bread) with an Italian twist. The fresh basil, tomato paste and different cheeses are just so delicious. The appetizers and desserts are also wonderful.
