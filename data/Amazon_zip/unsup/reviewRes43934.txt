Milk and Honey is a great brunch spot in Wicker Park. I would have to say the ambiance and diverse menu offerings are the biggest draw - you can get anything from pancakes, to beer to vegan black bean soup to a steak panini. The baked goods are great and the coffee is suberb. You order at the counter and the prices are very reasonable, but there are a few drawbacks. This place can get super crowded during peak weekend brunch hours and since this is a fairly small space it can be hard to get a table. Also, the staff could be friendlier but the great prices and food, wide array of offerings and inviting atmosphere make it worthwhile. Another added bonus is the long and well priced drink menu. Mimosas, blood Marys and other traditional afternoon cocktails are served along with beer and wine. All in all, I am a fan of Milk and Honey and think it is a great addition to the Wicker Park neighborhood!
