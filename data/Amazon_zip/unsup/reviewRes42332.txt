I might be a tough critic for Italian food. Growing up in a Chicago Italian kitchen, I tend to take criticism of pan and deep dish pizza rather seriously. Let's start by taking it from the foundation, the crust and working our way up. This is more of a corn-meal crust than dough crust, which is common in many kitchens. The crust is evenly fired, which is important because who likes having different textures in different parts of the pie? Personally, I like a good dough crust as opposed to the over cornmeal'ed crust that we found at Art of Pizza. I don't know where they get their dough, but it tastes like the same dough that I've found at other pie-joints in the city. I've tried the dinner special a few times and it's a great value for the money that came with a number of sides.
