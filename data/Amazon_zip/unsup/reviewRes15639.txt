This place serves their full menu until close! 2am on the Weekends! The PERFECT place to go get GOOD pizza or dessert after seeing Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind. We always hit this place afterwards. Late nights offer cheesy lounge singers and middle age and older people drinking and dancing, but the service was always good and the food/drinks far better than anything else open at that time of night.
