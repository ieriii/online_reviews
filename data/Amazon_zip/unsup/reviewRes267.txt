I wanted so badly to give it four stars, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Alinea is everything you read in all of these reviews. The show is amazing. The service is incredible. The food cannot be described in words that do it justice. Here is my thing...the wine pairing. Unless your palette is ready for the extra couple hundo, it is maybe not a good idea. If someone were to ask me my favorite wine, I would say Manage A Trois California Table Wine. So what amazing wines they were offering were pointless to me. Since I cannot truly give them a four star because of my inexperience of wines, they deserve the five stars because of everything mentioned above and I would go again, but only if someone else paid.
