I met up w/ a friend at Revolution Brewing Co last week---the place was packed. It was a Sunday night around 7pm. I wasn't planning on eating-just planning on grabbing a drink w/ a friend to catch up but the menu was too tempting! We ended up ordering the Cheese Ale soup (ridiculously delicious and not heavy at all), the sweet potato cakes with ginger, garlic & curry spices with red pepper cream dipping sauce and shared a Margherita pizza....I also ordered a caesar salad which was delicious too. Also-I want to mention that they maybe 1/2 of the items on the menu are veg friendly, which is nice to see for a change. I am not really a beer aficionado, so the server helped me choose one--she seemed to be very knowledgeable on all of the beers---finally a server who know what they're talking about!  This place gets my 4 star rating! I'll definitely be back!
