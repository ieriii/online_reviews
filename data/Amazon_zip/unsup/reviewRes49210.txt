SCENARIO 1 Private event/ wine tasting on the mezzanine level Hot, crowded, impossible to have a conversation, and long lines for the bars. It is probably the hosting organization's fault for over-booking, but this space is definitely not conducive for the amount of people in attendance.  However, would be perfect for a smaller group. SCCENARIO 2 Drinks on the first floor, seated on sofas Relaxing and PERFECT for four girls with a common goal... Prosecco, venting (boyfriends, work, family, etc), and getting to know one another more. *Great spot for a bite and a drink before a show at HOB. * Connected to the Hotel SAX. Drank too much? Book a room! * Ambiance here is quite nice. Open, airy, light neutral colors. Background uptempo, loungy grooves. Puts a girl in the mood! ... for sipping that is.
