Why review 206 for hopleaf? Because it is mine, of course!! Been here a bunch of times, but yesterday was truly enjoyable.  Met with some friends on a Sunday afternoon. The sun was streaming through the windows, the doors were open, a full breeze was raffling through the bar. The bartender was great, attentive, but not nosy... getting drinks exactly when needed... this was true for both of the shifts that we went through.  When we first got there, 2 of us were the only people, gradually, it started to fill. By 5, the place was packed with standing room only. Why 5? Well, that is when the kitchen opens. I am typically not a bar food person... no thanks. I would rather drink my calories. However, having forgotten to eat, with the help of a few Erdingers, sustenance was needed. I had the Montreal brisket. YUM!!! I ordered it with cheese- Havarti I think, It was fantastic. Not quite as tender as I like, but hey, it was quick, hot, and totally tasty. One of our group had the Ham sandwich. He had been raving about it the week before... My thoughts were a ham sandwich? Ya, enough, I can make one at home. I got to have a bite. It was luscious! I now understand.  Love the fact that no TV s were blaring news, or sports games. Conversation was the name of the game, and that is what we wanted. Great place to meet up with friends, both old and new.  The fries are awesome, but I am still thinking about that ham sandwich...
