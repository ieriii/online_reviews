Beer Selection: Overwhelmed and very impressed Food: (Vegetarian) Not so great. Had Mac and cheese, which was ok and what they call "frites". They looked like just regular shoestring fries served with aioli. No choices of sauces, or salad dressings for that matter. I'll be back for the beer, with a granola bar in my purse!!
