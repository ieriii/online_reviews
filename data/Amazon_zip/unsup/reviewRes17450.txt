My boyfriends' parents took us here for his graduation dinner. The service was very good. The drinks were surprisingly strong and good. On the other hand the food was just blend. I had something costilla and it was just okay. The place is very loud, but I get it is a carnaval! I won't be back to this place anytime soon. I think there are better cheaper latin restaurants.
