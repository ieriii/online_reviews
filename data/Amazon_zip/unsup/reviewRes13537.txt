I came here for a date last Thursday night at around 8:30. It was completely packed! So I knew it was going to be good. My date and I didn't mind waiting for a table so we both ordered a beer. Mine was the Anti-Hero IPA. It had a great taste and it wasn't overly hoppy for an IPA. I thought it was delicious. Later on, I ordered the Bell's Brewery Two Hearted Ale. Also awesome. Will be enjoying one later tonight. For food, once we got seated, we ordered the Bacon, Sage, and Parmesan Popcorn. Oh wow. I would lick my fingers every time I took a bite! And cry a silent tear whenever a piece would fall to the floor. Must be more careful with those popcorn pieces! We also got the sweet potato cakes with ginger, garlic, and curry spices. Those were very yummy. We got the big soft pretzel with cheesy ale dipping sauce. Das ist gut! And finally we had the polenta fries. Those weren't my favorite but they certainly weren't bad. There was just so much to choose from! I definitely want to go back and try some of the other amazing beers they have. And next time, I'll leave my car at home so I can drink as much as I like! Big fan of the gastropub movement in Chicago, in general :)
