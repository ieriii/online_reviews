So much fun and a great space! I love it love it love it! If you eat upstairs though, the music is so loud and the crowd is louder! (Upstairs is great for drinks!) Sit downstairs if you are eating, inside, near the window, not outside on Rush! Rapheal is a love! Food is great! Also love the melon martinis!
