There are so many good things to say about Alliance: free wi-fi, plenty of space, cool clientele, lots of light, an outdoor seating area in the summer, and it tends to be really quiet (partially because cellphones don't seem to work in the building). My experience with their food has been a little hit or miss. The cranberry bar is out of this world, as are the cupcakes, but I wouldn't recommend the lemon bar. The cookies are generally rock hard, they always seem to have 10 different kinds of sugar cookies, and a friend once had a very unfortunate experience with an eggplant sandwich. Overall though, Alliance is great and one of my favorite places in the city.
