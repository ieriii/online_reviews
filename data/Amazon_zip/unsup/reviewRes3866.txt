Simply awesome. Huge chicken wings cooked and sauced to perfection. A ton of options to choose from and genuinely good service. I'm a huge Bdubs fan, but these might be the best wings I've had. If you like spicy, these wings will do justice. Ask the manager for reco's, he's very helpful and knows his wings. Go hungry , leave stuffed and smiling.
