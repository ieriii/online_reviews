This place is nondescript from the outside and tiny on the inside! Only about 30 people fit, although they have carry out. We went for a late lunch and were seated by the back door, where there was a very cold wintry draft slipping under the seals. The food wasn't bad--Jen ordered chicken and rice, and I had a Tico Costa Rican taco, steak tostda and horchata (rice water). The meal took a while to serve, which was good as it was piping hot and tasted fresh. The differences between this Costa Rican meal and other Latin-American fare is very subtle. But to this gringo the minor differences don't justify the greater cost. Typical meals here range from $11-13 per person. I can go to Pilsen for less, and get more food. However Jen kept reminding me it wasn't Mexican. Anyway, it was good, but I doubt I'd go back unless I lived in the neighborhood. I would instead choose a much different and tasty Cuban meal, or fast food Mexican, which is everywhere and tastes similar, expect for the sauces. If you decide to go bring cash as they don't accept plastic.
