We waited a little over an 45 minutes on the busy night for the the seats and pizza to be ready. We ordered a two large deep dish meat pizza and couple of salads. They were both excellent. Gooey, meaty and cheezy! Also,wine was on the cheap side. Real CHICAGO style pizza! If you are visiting Chicago (especially as a tourist) - this is a place to go. I'm hungry now :(
