Well isn't this place super adorable (and yummy!). Using the Yelp app on my phone while driving around Bridgeport one day, my boyfriend and I decided to grab lunch here. When we arrived we were quite pleased to see how cute this place looked, and there really wasn't much of a wait at all. My boyfriend ordered the 'Nanadict' and I got the grilled chicken sandwich. We both enjoyed our meals very much and the service was wonderful as well. We will definitely be coming back here!
