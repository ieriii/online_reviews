This was a great hotel for the money. The location was perfect and very close to many Chicago attractions. It's right next to the L and pretty close to a couple Subway stations. They have a free wine reception every night from 5-6pm, which was a nice touch. The wine they served was Flip Flop wine which was pretty terrible, but it was free so what can you expect?! We stuck to the beer. They always have beverages out and switch them up during the day. If you forget anything from home, they have lots of stuff they'll bring to your room upon request - needed a makeup mirror and a couple toiletries which they brought right up. The service was great, the room was clean and nicely decorated, the ambiance was relaxing yet trendy, and the price was right. I would definitely stay here again!!
