I ate one of the best meals ever here on Saturday. I started off my lunch with the Topolo margarita. I get my margarita and it is fantastic!  We order some appetizers and ceviche of some variety was brought to the table. There were other things that were pretty good, but the ceviche stood out. For my entree I ordered the catfish tacos. Wow. Just wow. I would definitely recommend them. I wish I could remember some of the other stuff we ordered, but simply put I enjoyed all of it! Rick Bayless...youre my boy !
