Went for lunch at 1pm with girlfriends. Service at the front door was great. The place was clearing out, but they still sat us at a table in between other parties....not cool. Service at the table by Nicki was sloooow. This is lunch, not a dinner affair. Food is mediocre; I agree with other yelpers about there being more authentic sushi places. Nicki screwed up the bill at the end (when we finally got it); had to re-do it which took more time.....ugh. It's also a tad pricey....if I go back, a) I won't sit in Nicki's section; b) I'll make sure someone else pays!!
