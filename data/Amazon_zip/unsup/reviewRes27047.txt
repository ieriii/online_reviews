Get anything on the masa menu. I've dined at the bar three times in the last month and the small plates are ideal for folks flying solo...or who want to share. The smoked chicken taquitos with salsa and guac are incredible. If you like empanadas and quesadillas, you have to check out the quesadillas capitalinas -- they're like a hybrid of the two. The tamals and tamales are quite good, too. Last week I tried the tamales de elote and it was like a savory tres leches (crazy I know!). I've also tried the mole enchiladas off the regular menu and they were delicious as well. Rich and robust, with a subtle hint of heat. One tip: this place fills up early. Hit the bar no later than seven to get a seat.
