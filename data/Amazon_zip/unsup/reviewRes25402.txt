I went here for dinner a few hours ago. It was pretty damned good. It's not as pretentious (...as the friend I went with put it) looking as the other Greek restaurants in Greek town. The lighting isn't all dimmed, the music is more fun, and there's a lot going on in the middle of the restaurant, perhaps the bakery area, a bar or cafe w/in the restaurant. Anyways, I sat at a table/booth and the evening was very nice and chill. My friend and I started with the baked goat cheese, which will never let you down anywhere much less here. Then, I got the Mediterraneo sandwich which was great. It's lamb, lettuce, tomato, etc. The waitress let me substitute my pasta salad or potato salad options with rosemary potatoes, which I really liked. The point when I started getting disappointed was after my friend and I finished our meals. The waitress pretty much didn't come back to our table for what must have been 20-30 minutes. She came when we first finished and filled one of our cups with water, but didn't ask if I wanted water (my soda was gone). We both also wanted some coffee. Eventually, I just got up and was going to go get the coffee I wanted from the counter, but she was standing next to the computers watching her other tables I think, so I came up to her and told her she hasn't come back to our table and we want coffee and dessert.  Anyways, I was just annoyed that she completely forgot our table and walked right past us several times leaving us with not even water. Otherwise it was great- starter, sandwiches, coffee, dessert (which was the pear tart and fruit tart). The total was about $45 for all of it, maybe kind of pricey.
