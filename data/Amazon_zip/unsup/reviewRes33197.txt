I will drive around the block 75 times looking for a parking spot. But it's kinda worth it. I don't have much experience with Middle Eastern foods, but I do love the lentil soup and falafel sandwich. With extra spicy sauce. Grab an aloe juice. And, $7 in cash later, I'm a happy camper. But get it to go, the seating is pretty uncomfortable.
