Finally went to Sunda over the weekend and LOVED it. We went with friends and shared a lot of different dishes family style. Everything tasted great and had a lot of flavor. A few of my favorites included the ox tail potstickers, the pancit canton and the beef lollipops. (no, I am not a sushi person, but everyone else at the table raved about the rolls. I think the table favorite was the yellowfin tuna roll.) Service was also fantastic. The server was helpful and very friendly, and the manager came and checked in at our table at couple of times during the evening.  To top it all off, we loved the atmosphere.
