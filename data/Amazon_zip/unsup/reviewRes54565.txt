Love the food and eat there at least once a week, maybe twice. My favorite is the salad bar and the lentils, but the Talapia is awesome too. Only suggestion I can make is they consider using chicken breast for the shawerma dishes. Too many mystery chunks of fat and whatever else dangles from those chicken thighs. Very nice flavoring though...Oh, and accepting credit cards would be nice too. Still, I will be there for lunch today or tomorrow for sure.
