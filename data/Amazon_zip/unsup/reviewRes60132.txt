I agree with Alex C., can't stand without Pho Tank in 1 week. knowing noodle pho from other places are better, but they just can't satisfy the craving of pho like Tank does. In this cold winter just wanna stay warm at home, not a movie, not a steak dinner can drag me out of the my house, except Tank noodle. yelp friends! please share your experince. I wonder I am not the only one.
