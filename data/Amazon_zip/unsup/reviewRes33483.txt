don't know why i've never reviewed Yolk. I love this place and whenever I get to pick a place for brunch, I end up here. Lots of choice and variety on the menu, their standouts are definitely the omelets, frittatas, skillets, and pancakes. the california omelet is phenomenal, whoever decided to mix avocados with eggs deserves a gold star. the eggs benedict type dishes are not as good for whatever reason. there's usually a wait on sundays (upwards of 30 minutes for a party of 4) however, the trick i always employ is calling yolk 30 to 40 minutes before i plan to arrive and ask them to write my name down on the list. they're always very obliging and when we get there, we're seated almost right away. however, I just went this past saturday at 12:30pm and there was no wait! crazy :) the servers are always friendly, if not a little harried, and good with coffee refills, bad with water refills. I love the flavored coffee creamers here and our server was awesome and brought over a whole bowl of them. it does get noisy, so aim for a booth, it somehow buffers you from the yelling.
