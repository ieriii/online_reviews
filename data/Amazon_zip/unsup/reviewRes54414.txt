Had been wanting to visit this place for a long time and when I finally did, it did not disappoint. Refreshing take on vegetarian food with enough options to entice the carnivorous kinds as well. Had the reuben - Superb ! 2 thumbs up for the kale and daikon salad. I could eat it all day ! The chili was great too. The hoagie and chikun pesto panini were my less favorite dishes but good nonetheless. Very friendly staff too. Look forward to going back again !
