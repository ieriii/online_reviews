I'll admit it... my friends and I are addicted to GrubHub. Seriously, this place is perfect for takeout/delivery. MNF... no big deal... they'll slop together some of their awesome nachos, and make a few other apps... and all get fed a massive amount of heart attack inducing fried goodness. Props to the kitchen for accommodating my friend's "EVERYTHING ON THE SIDE I'M THE PICKIEST EATER EVAR" disposition. R.J. Grunt's isn't gourmet. It's good. The entrees are large enough to last a small person like me two full meals, the prices reasonable... and the chips... OH YUM. Order in, or go out. It might be a little packed during game time, but hey, there is something to be said about inhaling nachos in fuzzy slippers while praying the Bears don't embarrass themselves too too badly.
