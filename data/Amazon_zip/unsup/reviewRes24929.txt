Let me just start by saying that I cant wait for summer so I can go back and sit on the patio! On my first visit last fall, I didn't know it was BYO so I came unprepared (luckily was saved by Red & White Wines). We took a seat at the outside bar after deciding not to wait for an inside table and were immediately brought chips and a great salsa. I ordered the Pepito w/ Avocado and the wife ordered a Costa Rican. The food only took about 10 minutes even though they were busy on a Wednesday night. It was amazing. It was my first encounter with Lizano sauce and oh yes, I will be back! Large portions at great prices. Gotta love this little family run restaurant!
