Just got back from Chicago and had an amazing time. I wanted to check out Greektown while I was there, and boy was I pleased I did. This place is faboo! I can't rave enough about it...the waiter's appetizer recommendations were spot on. The entrees were delish, service was fantastic, and prices were decent. Try this place...I promise you'll "ooopa"!
