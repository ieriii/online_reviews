Delicious place for brunch! Highly recommend it! Apparently, it is BYOB as the table next to us was poppin' bottles. The wait was a bit long (30 mins), but it was definitely worth it! I ordered an egg-white california omelette with a side of pumpkin pancakes.The pancakes were even better though. Some of the most delicious pancakes I've ever had! They come topped with cranberries. The perfect breakfast treat during the holidays! You will not leave hungry. The price was reasonable and they definitely do serve huge portions here.
