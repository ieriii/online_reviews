Purple Pig's the perfect place for lunch or dinner with friends or business acquaintances without breaking the piggy bank. I was very pleased with two meals I had here and want to go back. Soon. Both times we sat outside under umbrellas on a small patio surrounded by railings with gorgeous planter boxes filled with tall grasses and flowers. Perfect for a sunny Chicago day. Food. Wow. Served on not-so-small small plates, the food was creative and delicious. Deep-fried chorizo-stuffed olives-crunchy and acidic with a bit of heat. Moist & tender chicken thigh meat on a stick, with crispy skin small whole potatoes that were flattened like roadkill. They had a great outer crust and moist baked potato interior. All that on a bed of creamy tzatziki sauce. Cold dishes we tried: roasted sweetcorn kernels mixed with minced walnuts, herbs and vinaigrette; Greek salad with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, feta-the usual, but entirely fresh and very good. We also had pork shoulder on mashed potatoes which was just ok. The pork was moist, flavorful, but a tad too salty and the potatoes had been thinned to the point of runniness. A large bowl of mussels with broth and bits of crunchy vegetables was very good. We didn't even get to the cold processed meats and cheese selections. You can pace yourself at the Pig and have a very good meal at a surprisingly fair price per person for a Michigan Avenue eatery. Or go hog wild. Either way you win.
