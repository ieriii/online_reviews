I have been to the Grand Lux several times and you really can never go wrong. ASIAN NACHOS!!! ASIAN NACHOS!!! You seriously have to get the asian nachos they are so good. The sandwiches are all also good and they always have great service here. Please get the chocolate chip cookies also, there is really no point coming here with out them. I sat at the bar one time and watched as the bartenders made drinks-- they dont mess around. I think it's worth paying the premium to have a few of their cocktails here as well. Try it!!
