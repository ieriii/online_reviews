I'll be fair -- we did stop back in after all. Mainly because our first choice for a late dinner stopped serving and we wanted to be closer to home. The food is still pretty pricey for the area if you ask me though, which you are since you're reading this review. The hubs got the beef stew which he seemed to enjoy, though he was so hungry he probably would have eaten a shoe. He said it was kind of sweet but good. The stew, not a shoe. He had the IPA which he said was fine but it didn't seem to knock his socks off. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty good though the jalapeno in the cole slaw killed it for me. Too spicy. Too overpowering. I had to scrape it off which is too bad since the only way to eat a pulled pork sandwich is with a huge blop of slaw on top, right? There's no real point to the jalapeno being there, so seems to me they could just leave it out. Anyway, I'm still torn on this place. The staff disappears to the end of the bar when the servers congregate post-shift. The space doesn't feel comfy though it's generally well done. I dunno. Don't think it'll be a go-to spot for us.
