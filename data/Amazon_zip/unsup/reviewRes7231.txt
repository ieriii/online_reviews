Sapori Trattoria is a great neighborhood Italian Restaurant. I have only gone to Sapori during the week for a weeknight dinner with a buddy so I have never experienced the restaurant when it was extremely crowded. The first time I went I had the lobster pasta dish, loved it, the pasta tasted very fresh and the sauce was well flavored and the seafood was fresh and yummy. I went there recently and Sapori did not disappointment me. I had the lasagna Alexander, wow! The pasta and tasted homemade, the sauce was perfectly seasoned, the meat was well seasoned and tender.  Sapori is pricey for a neighborhood restaurant, all of the dishes are $20 and over. The cheapest wine is about $30/bottle (the same wine is about 12 bucks in the grocery store). What gives? The portions are enough for three people so there are plenty of left overs for another meal and wait for a coupon, they are always in neighborhood coupon books that you get in the mail. Overall the food is excellent and so is the service.
