I am actually ashamed that I have not yet written a review for one of my favorite eateries in the entire Chicago area. Shame on me. Milk & Honey is fantastic. I would say the big winner is their lunch menu, but I'm also a fan of the brunch.  For brunch they have a pretty small menu, but they have something in all the regular categories (pancakes, bagels, eggs, french toast, etc.). However, what really steals the show in my mind is the yogurt, fresh fruit, and granola...so simple yet perfectly delivered here. It doesn't hurt that their granola is well known throughout Chicago and sold all over the place. Do I have some at home too? You betcha! The lunch menu is really where you can't go wrong. No matter what type of sandwich you like, there will be one (if not many) on the menu that will make you happy. My favorites are Ham and Havarti (hello pretzel roll!), Veggie, and Crabcake (ginormous).  They all come with homemade potato chips and a delicious pickle. The restaurant itself is bright, airy, and has tons of natural light with simple decor. They also have a great patio out front that has tons of seating and plenty of people watching. The service is always good, never bad but not necessarily super warm and fuzzy. The prices are great, especially considering the quality and quantity that you get. I am a huge supporter and go here at least once a month...even though it is nowhere near my place. Totally worth each and every trip.
