I was a complete rookie at sushi. I had only tried cali rolls. I had tried Indie's food numerous times and thought it was outstanding. Anyway, a friend of mine came into town, and told me he wanted to get sushi and some sake bombs. So, without hesitation, I said, INDIE.  That was maybe 3 months ago, and since, I have gone back 3-4 times. FOR THE SUSHI. Sunny Crunchy is friggin amazing, Others that stand out are the popeye, the dragon and the spider rolls. I can't get enough of this place. If you haven't tried it. DO IT.
