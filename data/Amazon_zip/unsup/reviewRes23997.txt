Where did you have a dinner tonight? Irazu. So how was it? Oh just another food orgasm. In fact I was thinking about having a cigarette and no, I don't smoke. This four and a half star, laid back, super casual BYOB put me on my back with an outstanding pressed steak sandwich, some succulent fried plantains and some amazing rice and beans. The guacamole was good, the empanada was a little greasy and the service was a little slow, (but considering there was one girl working ALL of the tables inside and outside, I was more impressed), I still want to come back over and over again, if you do come early if its nice out, limited out door seating. Though you have to excuse me, I just think I need a moment to savor this flavor moment and cuddle with my leftovers.
