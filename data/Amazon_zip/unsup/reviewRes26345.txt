I have actually been coming here for their drinks for literally the past year, but I had never taken the time to actually sit down and order their food. It was good, but wasn't the best I had. I would actually give 3 and a half stars because I love their drinks, especially coconut milk tea, and also they use green tea instead of black, which sets them apart and gives the tea a unique flavor, and their bobas are always nice and chewy. The service is awesome, and the people are also really nice here. When I came, I ordered the garlic pork chops, which was really good, a salmon noodle, and a curry. I really liked the salmon, however, I was pretty disappointed to see that the salmon was just piled on top of plain, white Vietnamese noodles. I really wished they did a fried noodle or something of that sort, it would have really made the dish a lot better. The curry was just alright. I am a huge curry fanatic, so I am pretty picky when it comes to curries. Regardless, the food was still good, but like I said before, not the best I had. However, what was really cool of them was that they gave each of my friends and I limeade on the house, which was delicious, but other than that, I think I will just stick with their delicious boba drinks from now on.
