I'm wondering, with other reviewers here, what I missed. Some of the food was really, really great, and other dishes just seemed completely off and poorly executed. To start off, we were really excited about our server, who was very knowledgeable about the menu, but when it came to actually serving us, he was totally lackluster. We went forever without cocktail refills, and one member of our party had to ask 4 different staff members several times just to get another beer.  We tried several appetizers, the bison tartare, the house poutine, the scotch egg, the duck nuts, and the crispy pork belly. The bison tartare was fantastic, the scotch egg and poutine okay, but the pork belly was served with some squid that didn't really compliment the pork. It was just a slightly weird combination. For third course, I had the scallops, which were fantastic and perfectly cooked. The other guests I was dining with raved about the halibut. For fourth course, I had the gnudi, which was good, but nothing great. Others had the Amish chicken, which they enjoyed, and a few had the pork chop special, which a few complained that the portion was huge for a course progression. Dessert was fantastic-we had the chocolate pave and the peanut butter beignets, both of which we completely cleaned the plates on. It's too bad the service wasn't better, otherwise I might have given it a few more stars.
