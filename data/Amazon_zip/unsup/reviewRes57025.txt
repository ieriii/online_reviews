The thin crust pizza is delicious! This is a really fun lowkey place to grab some beer and pizza. It usually gets crowded so be prepared to wait for a while, although whenever I have that first bite of pizza I know the wait was worth it. I went to karaoke night here once as well and do agree that it was a lot of fun!
