Holy. Cow. And duck. And more. I went to Zed451 with a large group, and had a private room just off the main dining area, Going in, I had no idea it was a pseudo-Brazillian place. I'm guessing they would frown on the term "Brazillian" because they are decidedly upscale compared to most others. The pre-meat food bar as I like to call it was amazing. Plenty of salad offerings, mushrooms to die for, ahi tuna, cheeses, lobster bisque, it went on and on, The servers (not gauchos) brought an endless parade of meet, including the traditional beef offerings you would expect PLUS duck, Aussie wagyu beef, venison, Moroccan chicken, and an odd choice of grilled catfish which was great. Bottom line, it was amazing. I also recommend the apple-infused bourbon. Atmosphere was also great - for our large group they handled everything really well and the room was perfect for 25 people. It would be great for an intimate dinner as well, beautiful room, good service, great overall Currently my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Those who gave this 3-stars are crazy. Also of note, one member our group was a vegetarian and they made a special meal for him and he was RAVING about the meal.
