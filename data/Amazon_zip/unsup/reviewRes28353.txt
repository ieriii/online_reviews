I think you have to love a Mexican restaurant that serves an amuse bouche before your meal. The more traditional dishes seem to be better - I've not been very impressed with things like grilled porkchops. The servers are indifferent but not always annoyingly so. It can get very busy here, so you may need to wait - or get to share a table. They are BYOB.
