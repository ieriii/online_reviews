I really hate to do this but our experience here was sub-par at best. We've been wanting to come here for a very long time and are huge fans of Rick Bayless and XOCO. We sat in the bar area which had a nice atmosphere but this is where the pleasantries end. Chips were soggy, food did not taste good and was cold. Service was just plain bad. We can't understand what all the fuss is about.
