Everything I'm going to say has all been said before, but so be it. I'll keep it short. I hated myself for standing outside, in the rain, for an hour and a half for a hot dog.....until I tried it, and I realized how worth the wait it is. A simple hot dog and polish sausage were so delicious. The fries rendered in duck fat were out of this world. Even if you're not into tubed meat, go on the weekends and get these fries. I can't wait to go back and try some specials and game dogs.
