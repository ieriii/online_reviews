My friend recommended Nana and so we had dinner there on Tuesday. The decor is classy and cozy at the same time. The exposed brick walls and tasteful art made me feel at home immediately. I really enjoyed everything we had - we shared 3 plates, a bottle of wine and topped it off with the most amazing mint profiteroles and chocolate martini (with nutmeg). The food was delicious: interesting combinations of ingredients. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu (which changes frequently). We also enjoyed talking to our server and the owner. Definitely check this place out- I will be back!
