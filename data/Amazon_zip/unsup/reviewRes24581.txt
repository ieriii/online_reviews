I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review for Artopolis. It is, by far, my favorite place in Greektown. The food is authentic, delicious and pretty large portions. The bakery....aaah, that bakery. I want everything. I always get a dessert when eating in, and always take a few tarts and treats to go. The servers are friendly, helpful and efficient. This is just a great place for a relaxing coffee and cake, quick lunch or cozy dinner. I LOVE the Pear Tart, Walnut Tart, and of course... Gelaktoboureko.
