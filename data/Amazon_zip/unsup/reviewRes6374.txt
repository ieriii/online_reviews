Quoted 30 to 45 for the wait. Ended up waiting an hour. 5 minutes before we got seated, a lady walked in and apparently was super important and got service before us. Kind of bummed us out. I almost feel like it's trying to be too many things at once. It feels like it wants to be classic italian, but it wants to be casual, but then you get this feeling of trying to be hip.  Maybe it works for some people? The food wanted to be super amazing, but ended up just being average. Asked for the burger medium, ended up being charred on the outside. But the Bacon Jam is quite awesome. The chocolate mousse dessert saved the whole thing. Sorry I failed on the name, but it's definitely one of those italian cool kid names. I'll probably go back just for this. The service was average. I almost forgot to mention it *shrugs*
