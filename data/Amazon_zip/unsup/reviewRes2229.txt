You've got to admire Doug -- he's doing what he loves (at least he seems like he is), making tons of money doing it (I would assume), and we all benefit! My boyfriend and I went on a weekday at noon (he was off from work) and got some regular hot dogs, a polish, and one weird one. (Pork blue cheese sausage with green apple creme fraiche and toasted almonds.) I actually wasn't a huge fan of the weird one, but I was glad I tried it, and the hot dogs were good. So were the fries. All in all, for me, the ambience and Doug himself, who was so friendly, made the experience. I'll go back to try more of the dogs, but I wasn't overwhelmed on this visit.
