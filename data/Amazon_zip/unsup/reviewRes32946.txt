As noted, falafels are excellent. The curry rice was nice and flavorful. However, the rest was average. I had the lamb plate, and to be honest, it was dry. There is much better lamb to be found. The worst thing was the pitas though, they do not come out warm as they do in other restaurants, and they were also dry, maybe even stale to the point where one broke in half with minimal effort when attempting to stuff with the lamb mixture. Probably would come back for the falafel sandwich if I was walking by and the thought struck me after a night of many beverages. $4 for the sandwich is not a bad deal. Otherwise, I can't see myself making plans to go out of my way to hit this place up again. But hey for $7 for a big dinner plate I can't really hate on this place.
