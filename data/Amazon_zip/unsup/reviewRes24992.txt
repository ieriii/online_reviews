If you are a frequent tapas restaurant patron, I'm not sure this is a good place for you. I go to tapas restaurants a lot, and I am used to getting a lot more food for my money. The food is amazing here, very flavorful, and presented very well. But in the end, I think of it as tapas, and can't justify paying 3 times as much, if not more. The biggest shock was the paella. If you have had traditional Paella that comes in the big paella pan, you're going to fall over when you see how small the paella portion is. Not to mention, that it did not even have saffron in it to give it that paella yellow color. The atmosphere is great, and if you can, ask to be seated in the upstairs room, as it provides a lot more privacy and it's a lot quieter than the main dining room. They also let you sit there forever, and they don't rush you out of there like most restaurants. The service is OK. The servers are very friendly, but they are so caught up in being fancy that they forget to bring you some stuff. Just make sure you don't get charged for it.
