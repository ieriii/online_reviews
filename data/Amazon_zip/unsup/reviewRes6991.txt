This was the first time Yelpers had led me astray. My wife and I where walking through the streets of Chicago. Being tourists, I looked up a place nearby with a great review and I found Q. Ordered a sampler and the meat was a little dried out, especially the beef The Hush puppies were dry. I will say their dipping sauces are second to none. In hindsight, I would have prefered to drink the sauces straight!! Mac n Cheese was good and the sweet pickles were a nice meal start.
