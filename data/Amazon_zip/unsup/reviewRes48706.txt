As some of you can see I'm catching up on my reviews. This is from last summer. Reason: Celebrating a friends graduation from MBA school. Order: multiple items including Belgian beers and a beer from Europe that was made in an old rum cask that was next to our table. We also ordered the Halibut that was flown in that morning. Pork, beef, etc. Thoughts: Awesome. Great. Tasty. All the good things. The fish (at a "meat place") was the best I had ever had. It was bright white and flaky, meaty, clean tasting. The sweetbreads were better than I had ever had. Everything was good, decor was spot on and not pretentious. The waiter was helpful and fast.  Note: We happened to be a few tables from Chris Cosentino.  Crazy.
