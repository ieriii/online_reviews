We got a deep dish pizza to go on our way through town on a roadtrip. I was not impressed, at all. I was expecting lots of flavor from the sauce, but it was so bland! Pretty much just crushed tomatoes. :/ The mozzarella was thick and plentiful, the toppings were good quality, but the crust was too thick and hard and it tasted too strongly of cornmeal. Granted this was my first "authentic" Chicago deep dish experience. I think I'll try a different pizzeria or two before I give up on that style of pizza.
