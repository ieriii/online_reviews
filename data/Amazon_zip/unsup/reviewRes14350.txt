My friend had his birthday bash here the other evening and I was excited to check out this joint for the first time. We had the upstairs section. It was a hopping Friday night and it was packed upstairs and down. We were served Bruschetta, Pretzels and the Popcorn as our apps. All were tasty and good. The Beers were excellent, I had the Wit and it was going down easy. We were given pizzas of different varieties and mini-burgers. Everything was great, but one thing stood out more than anything else, our servers. Very professional and attentive. Good job.
