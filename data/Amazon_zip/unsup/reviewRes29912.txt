Pros: 1. BYOB, 2. easy on the wallet, 3. tasty food Cons: 1.iffy service, 2. curry doesn't come with rice (you have to order a side of rice which is not a huge deal, but I found it odd), 3. compared to other thai restaurants, Opart had smaller portions Overall, pretty good place. I'd stop by if I was in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't make a trip of it.
