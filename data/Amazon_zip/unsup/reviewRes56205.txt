a week ago, this would have been a 5star review. i really dig their pastries and i'm a closet-NesCafe-drinker, so that's all good... but the dinner food....... ehhhh.... where to start? who has a dinner menu, but doesn't have the food listed ready by 6P? they do... ordered the goat cheese appetizer (totally acceptable, btw! ask for pita instead of the toast that comes with it!), and for dinner, my guy asked for no dairy to be served with his meat; our illustrious server proceeded to ask - in all seriousness - if he knew that goat cheese had dairy in it... people, let's try not to flaunt sheltered ignorance, no? the chicken raganatti = meh; it was edible, but i wouldn't order it again. sorta dry, sorta bland actually. breakfast? NesCafe? yeah - i will be here again; dinner - nah. there are 3 other places right up the street that do it better. it was written (sits zen)
