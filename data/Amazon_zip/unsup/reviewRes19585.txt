I had so much fun tonight at XOCO. When we drove past to park the line was only 6 people out the door at 6:30. When we walked back 10 minutes later it had grown to around 25 people, burn! That's fine, I totally expected to wait on a Friday during the first week. Unlike the lines at Hot Dougs the line here moved pretty fast. It took us about 45-50 minutes to order after getting there. We overheard the people behind us in line saying that they were the oldest people there and that made me look around. It really was a pretty young crowd. Once we got in the door my boyfriend got this huge grin on his face and that's when we saw Rick and his smiling face. A guy in front of us said "I think almost everyone here has a food crush on Rick Bayless." I would agree. It really did make the line go faster watching him overseeing the food going out but I needed the long line to decide what I wanted. We ended up ordering lots of food and spent $50 for the two of us. You can't watch someone making churros and not want to eat them. The same goes for chocolate flan cake. That cake was amazing and it was the first thing we ate. Our chips and guacamole were really yummy too. The carnitas with pork and dumplings had a lot of spice to it and it was probably my favorite thing next to the chocolate flan cake. The suckling pig tortas were good and we dipped the leftover bread in the carnitas broth...I highly recommend doing that! The crispy gunthorp chicken in my Milanesa was yummy but the jalapenos in it were definitely packing a punch and I had to take a couple of them out. Watching the salads go out made me want one so bad but I didn't think I'd have room and I was right. Next time I will totally be trying the salad. I really can't wait to come here for breakfast some day soon and pig out on the other pastries and coffee.
