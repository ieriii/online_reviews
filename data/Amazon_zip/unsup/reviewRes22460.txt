I recently went here on a Summer weekend afternoon after an absence of a couple of years. The parking lot was extremely crowded and I ended up parking on the street. It was too bad because this is one of the few places that has carhop service (a throwback to an older era). You walk up to the counter, place your order and then wait for your number to be called. The menu is mostly basic hot dogs, burgers and fries, but the hot dogs are the reason to go. Each hot dog order includes crinkle-cut, crunchy french fries.  This is not a fancy place, but your perseverance in waiting to order and then ordering will be rewarded.
