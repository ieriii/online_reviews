This is my favorite Korean place in Chicago by far. Great food, always consistent. The BBQ-it-yourself items are the best I've had anywhere, I highly recommend the tender baby squid for those who can handle the sight of tentacles. The portions are hefty and every dinner comes with 20 complimentary mini side dishes and soup. I always leave stuffed. Just don't expect extra kindly service from the Korean waitresses, which seems to be the case with many of the authentic Korean restaurants I've been to. They aren't mean, but just understand that the goal is to get you fed, so friendliness is unnecessary. You are on their turf, just stay out of their way when they throw the dishes on your table, shut up and enjoy the delicious.
