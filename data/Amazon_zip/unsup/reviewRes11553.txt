Absolutely delicious! We just moved to Wicker Park and noticed the first weekend that there was this line of people standing around early on a Sunday. What is going on here? Our new neighbor informed us that was the line for Bongo Room and it was the best brunch place ever!! Definitely expect a wait, but the food was worth it. I've never seen breakfast choices like they have there. Carmel/pretzel pancakes, chocolate French toast, it goes on and on! I've been here twice in the almost 4 weeks I've lived here so far, and I know it will be a staple.
