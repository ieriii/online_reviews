This is your grandmother's hotel. That says it all right? I am a Chicagoan transplanted to the Washington DC area. I grew up three blocks away from the Drake along the lakefront in a building that you'll find in art history text books. I had my wedding reception at the Drake. So...you'd think I'd give a higher rating, right? Shoot, I almost gave a two-star rating, if it weren't for the beautiful service I got at this establishment. I guess it's hit or miss if you get a renovated room. I really didn't think that you could get a more dreary room than mine, despite the fact that it was big and had a fairly nice view of the lake. The room screamed of the 1960s, and I don't mean in a cool Mad Men kind of way. I mean in a drab, hadn't been given enough attention way. I mean, it was long and had a separate sleeping and tv area, but why was I longing for the Hilton Suites hotel just half a block away?  The wood trim all around the room was dark, the closet was pathetic, and the wallpaper hadn't been changed since at least 20 years ago. Really, if it weren't for the amazing people who work here who were helpful, friendly, and professional, I probably would have given 2 stars. I just expected more. But...you will see in later reviews that I think highly of Palm Court. Quel dommage.
