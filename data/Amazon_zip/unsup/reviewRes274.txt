Expensive? Yes. But the meal of a lifetime? Exponentially yes. My boyfriend and I are, admittedly, food obsessed. Is 87% of our relationship based on our mutual love for food? Maybe. And so, with no gift certificates or special favors, we celebrated that fact by making the trip to the holy grail that is Alinea to celebrate our one year anniversary last last December (i.e. December 2007). It was fucking heaven in a plastic straw doused with white truffle oil and infused with juniper scent. We now live in New York and I'm still getting familiar with the food scene here but I can say with some confidence that no restaurant here will replicate what we experienced at Alinea. The service is top-notch. There are about 5 or 6 people that attend to your table and if you're like me, self-deprecating to a nasty fault and self-resourceful to the max, you will feel silly at first having so many people attending to you. But, advice: Indulge in the pampering. You are, after all, paying for it. Note: They give you a menu at the end of your meal displaying every indulgence you stuffed down your gullet. Note: Opt for the 24-course tour. Doy. Note: You will be full. Disgustingly, delightfully full. Note: Should you decide on the 24-course tour, your dinner WILL take 5 hours. Note: If you close out the restaurant, they may let you into the kitchen before you leave so you can meet the wondrous chefs who created the works of magic you took seconds to suck down. Note: The experience is worth it.
