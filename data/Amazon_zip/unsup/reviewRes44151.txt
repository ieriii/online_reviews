I had never tried sushi before I went to Wakamono for dinner a few weeks ago. I was a little nervous about actually trying it, and nervous about the etiquette of eating sushi ("Do I use chopsticks or my fingers? Is it one bite, or several? Several might be messy, but one might look pig-ish..."). My nervousness was compounded by the fact that at this dinner I was meeting some new people and didn't want to appear ridiculous.  Here I was, all prepared to dislike it but politely eat some and then go home and just have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for dinner. So imagine how excited I was to discover that I actually REALLY like sushi! I ordered the Gorilla Roll and it was delicious! All this time I have been missing out!  I realize that this is more of a review of my first sushi experience rather than a review of Wakamono, so for those wanting to know what the restaurant itself is like - it was nicely decorated, appropriately lit, intimate, and quiet, and the staff was very attentive. It is a great place for dinner with a small group of friends, or a date.   Thank you Walter F. and sister for broadening my horizons!
