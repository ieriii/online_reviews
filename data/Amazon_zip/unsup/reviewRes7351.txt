Sappori Trattoria wasn't on my list of restaurants to try, but my boyfriend and I gave it a shot after stumbling upon in it in a hungry search on Yelp for nearby restaurants. The reviews seemed solid and and we were able to get a table with no problem on a Friday night at 8:30 so we thought we had died and gone to heaven. The service at Sappori Trattoria was great. We had a very sweet and attentive waitress that was accommodating of one food allergy (dairy, sigh) and one substitution (asparagus for potatoes). We started off with the grilled calamari appetizer and it was very tasty and a sizable portion. The entrees, unfortunately, were disappointing. We split a veal dish with prosciutto and a half portion of linguine vongole. The veal was soggy... not sure if I can really expand on that. Now, I will expand on the pasta as I think that you can tell a good restaurant by their linguine with white clam sauce. This is an offensive comment, but it tasted like Ramen noodles with clams. I couldn't taste white wine, garlic, butter, or clams - I could only taste chicken broth. I'm hoping we caught them on a bad night.
