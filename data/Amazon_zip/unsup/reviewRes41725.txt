Ruth's Chris is my favorite steak house in Chicago. I always get the filet. It is tender and wonderful tasting. The wait staff, except for one time, has always been excellent. Steak is my husband's favorite food so we go to steakhouse fairly often and this is top notch. It is pricey, but worth the money in my opinion.
