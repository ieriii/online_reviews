We were stranded in Chicago after Fargo was hit by a blizzard (taking a train across the northern US in the winter...yeah, well, that's a review on me) and were placed in this hotel. It's been great. The Internet is indeed $10 per night, but that's becoming pretty standard at most hotels these days. Get a smart phone and connect through your carrier. Shush up about that. The room is big and beautiful. The lobby is great. The pool is very small BUT you can swim laps in it (if there are no kids). The gym is small: 2 elipticals, 3 treadmills, free weights, 1 multi-purposed machine and heavy balls. The staff was amazingly kind. Not sure about the location, but you know -- that's why they have a concierge. Just ask. (And be polite.)
