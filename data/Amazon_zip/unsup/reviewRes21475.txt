I heart Mayan Palace! These are my two disclaimers, though (1) It's right around the corner from my house so it's super convenient, and (2) I don't hold Mexican food to a very high standard. That being said, I think Mayan Palace is the best Mexican restaurant in Lincoln Park and definitely one of my favorites in the City. The service is great - sometimes overly attentive - but the staff is great! The margaritas are sure to knock you out - definitely if you are brave enough to order 2:) Plus they're half off on Tuesdays and Thursdays so you can't beat that. The food is delicious - I usually go for the combo meals so you can try a little of everything. And they have a great (winterized) Patio in the back so don't be fooled by what looks like a small dining area. There isn't a single thing wrong with Mayan Palace! Enjoy!
