Have I been hungover when I've come here? Yes. Have I enjoyed it? Yes. Do I want to be hungover and here again? YES. Greasy Mexican Food does a stomach filled with alcohol good. My hangover disappears once I down a massive burrito there. STEAK BURRITOS FTW! Also get the rice & beans... mmmmmmmm. Really though... the people are nice and the food is as good as a drunken tummy could hope for! Thank you, La Pasadita for curing Manders' hangovers for the past 2 years! Love you! Muah!
