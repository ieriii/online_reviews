I really liked my experience at Purple Pig and all it's trendy downtown wanna be European style tapas joint glory. The weather was decent when I went so we sat out on the enclosed patio (next to a heating lamp) and had great service. Wine list was very nice, I had a couple velvety south American reds, went down real nice with the grilled seafood, warm cheeses and grilled scallions. I had a quick one hour lunch, definitely would have been happy to stay for a couple more.
