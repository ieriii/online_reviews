This was definitely my favorite (out of the few we visited during our last trip to Chicago this summer). They earn their 5* just for the service, which was amazing. People were so nice and friendly! Wow! The food was also very good. We had been to a Churrascaria before (in Montreal, le Milsa) but this is definitely a very upscale one! As for the general decor it felt so warm, it must be so nice to be there in the fall or winter with the fireplace and all those candles. We loved it and definitely look forward to hopefully go back there one day! NB. We were there on a Sunday night, so it was very quiet.
