As my wife and i walked the magnificent mile we came apon Xocco. Truth be told I really wanted to go to Fontera or Topolobampo but the wait was to long and we both really were not that hungry. So Xooco it was. This place didn't disappoint, didn't really expect it to. I got the torta with the suckling pig and my wife also got a torts with pork. These were among two of the best sammys I have ever had. The hot sauce that accompanies the torta will make write your last will and testament. Don't forget about the churros pipping hot covered in sugar and cinnamon yummy. If not on this then the next time I am in Chicago I will be back.
