We went with high expectations but were rather disappointed. Went on a "No Menu" Sunday -- i.e., menu depends on local seasonal ingridients of the day and chef''s whim. Had a hard time getting reservations, not sure why as the restaurant was half empty throughout the meal. First course: anchovy with seasonal salad. Salad was good, though it's pretty ballsy to start a dinner with anchovies. Second course: rabbit braised ravioli dumplings. Yummy but skimpy. Could've served 3 instead of 2 dumplings. Third course:Vichyssoie (cold french soup) with truffle oil seasoning, served with a side of japanese greens, tempura battered leek, and shaved truffle. Also very good. Fourth course: Scallop. Hard to describe, but was the best part of our meal. Fifth course: Kona Kampachi with scoop of risotto and pistacio pesto garnish. Tasty. Sixth course: Here was the real diappointment. A piece of cheese with some very overpowering apricot marmalade. This was presented to us as an "intermezzo", so we didn't think it was an actual course. Litlle did we know... Seventh course: Their famed eggs benedict. Good, but we were all in shock that the cheese constituted an actual course. Food was good overall, but not enough for the price, which came to $90 each including tip. We are all seasoned diners, from Chicago, New York, and San Francisco, and so know what fine dining shouild entail. Sixth course should've had meat. The cheese was inappropriate and entirely misplaced. Truth be told, we all left a little hungry. Our waiter was good but staff overall was not particuarly understanding of our disappointment. The chef happened to walk by as we were complaining, and promptly walked away. Not sure that we would come back.
