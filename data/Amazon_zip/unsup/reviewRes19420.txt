So good! You must try Xoco. We wanted to have dinner at Frontera Grill but didn't have the time so we opted for lunch here instead. The sandwiches are amazing. Very complex flavors and a variety of choices. The guac and salsas are some of the best I've ever had. Lastly the churros and vanilla soft serve are unbelievable. I could eat those everyday. The prices are very good, staff is great, and the wait isn't bad. Be prepared to elbow up with your neighbors here, most fo the seating is communal.
