2030 reviews can't be wrong. We made the mistake of coming here during lunchtime and had to wait about 40 minutes but it was well worth it. Just like I had seen on tv and heard from other people, the food here was everything I expected. I honestly thought with their popularity that they would charge more but the prices were fairly reasonable. I like that. I'm just really sad that we came here on a Thursday and didn't get to try the duck fat fries. Sadddddd.
