The sushi here is pretty standard; worth going to if your in the area. Mostly the same sushi rolls you see everywhere.  Unfortunately though (for me), the service is awful. When I went here, I had three different servers come to my table throughout the meal. I'm very used to restaurants, and worked in them, so this doesn't bother me. But there was no coordination at all. Also, my gf asked for a fork (she's chopped stick impaired) and one of the servers said she would get them, then went over and talked to the other servers, then sat down at a few tables over with them and began to chat. After 10-15 mins of this, I went and asked again. At this point I was irritated, but sometimes you get bad servers. At the end of the meal, the server brings our check, and I pay by debit card, she runs it, brings it back, and I sign. As were walking toward the exit (after sitting after signing for 5-10mins), the server stops me from leaving and tells me she forgot to add a drink onto our bill, and we must return to the table and pay it. This is ridiculous in my opinion--I mean, if they catch it after they give you the bill, okay, add it on. But after I completely pay and am leaving? So I pay for the drink on my card again, and leave the place--giving the server(s) a drastically reduced tip because I found this ridiculous--and what happens? The server AND the manager run out a good 100ft from the restaurant asking why my tip was low. Again--ridiculous. After talking to the manager briefly, she said "Oh, I didn't know the situation." Then why are you chasing me down?  Overall, I would hate to give it a horrible rating because the food is actually good. Too bad the service sucks, but they allow take-out and do deliver!
