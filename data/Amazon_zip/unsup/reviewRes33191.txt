One of my favorite food in the city!! I love their salad bar, 30+ items, and the quality is great! My favorite are their salads, cheese, and octopus. I have been their twice. I had salad both time. I ordered their dinner dish for my friends, (don't remember the exact name of the dish, one is lamb something , the other was beef something). Also had falafel and Dates. My friends love the place.
