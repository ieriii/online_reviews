This place is a great place to take a date to. The food is delicious and the lighting is perfect. I like getting simple dishes when I go to places like this because I like to see how they can make something typical and simple so deliciousI got the ravioli piccolo sogno. it was delicious! It was beautifully done. A friend of mine ordered the Scaloppine di Vitello. Her words to describe this dish? Mmmmmmm that seemed to be the only words coming out of her during dinner. It was veal cooked in a white wine sauce. That was also beautifully done. This place did a great job with their menu items.
