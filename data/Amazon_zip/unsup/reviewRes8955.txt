I love all types of cuisine and hadn't had good Middle Eastern food in quite a while. I used to enjoy home cooked meals at my friend's house, so it's hard to impress me! But it doesn't mean I haven't had some great Middle Eastern food at a restaurant! Many of my friends suggested Noon O Kabab, so I figured it couldn't be bad! Noon O Kabab satisfied my craving, but didn't do much to impress me. I love dill rice, but I felt like the entire plate came out a bit dry, including the meet skewers. It was my first and only experience there and I haven't had the urge to go back since, but I would probably give it a second chance! Maybe I was just unlucky my first time?
