I've been meaning to write this review for over six months, which is funny because if I was as prompt as I really should have been, my rating would have been higher. I first ate at Lao Szechuan about 5 years back. Since then I live walking distance from there and have been there or ordered out from there way too many times than I care to count. Food has been excellent and spicy - just the way I have come to expect. Ive had many different dishes there, some very strange sounding but all of them taste good. The dry chilli chicken and szechuan dry chili string bean kind of stand out, as does their spicy lamb dish. But the last three times I have been there (last two months), while the food definitely still retains the flavor, the service has started to get very tardy and rude. Late service, grumpy faces, throwing your check on your table without even looking at you, are all experiences I have had in the last three times. C'mon guys, is my 70 buck check amount not even deserving of a smile while you present it to me? Do I have to beg you 3 times over a period of 20 minutes to get my flipping check? Given that and the long average waiting period standing outside, I have to take away two stars. When service was good and friendly, I was willing to overlook this but now I may probably go back to eating once in a rare while here and even then probably take out.
