This place is ex - Continental Cafe. I see that business says it is closed and now it shows up under Little Bucharest Bistro. Same owner. It used to be on Ashland before. Keeps moving the business or changing the name. I wonder why. I had a private party here. It was a nightmare. The owner promisses the moon and the stars and then he does everything in his power to rip people off. He would do anything for an extra dollar. I had an open bar. He kept disappearing so that he didn't have to serve people for long periods of time. He kept pretending he misunderstood things, so that he won't serve the food, so my guests waited over 1 hour between the first two courses. He said the number of guests I had would fit comfortably there. We could not move, that's how crammed the tables were. It was a private party but he still served people outside and let some in, who were served by the waitresses I was paying, while my guests were being ignored. The music did not work at all. Try to have a party with no music. My husband had to run home, 10 miles away, to bring his own sound system. So my guests were thirsty, hungry and sitting there with no music, so no dancing. It was a hell of a party!Earlier in the week we stopped by to go over some details and he served us juice from an expired bottle. I pointed that out. He appologized and placed it back in the fridge!!!! I have heard many stories of him mistreating his staff and serving questionable food. Of course, that is hearsay. However, after I met him and had to deal with him, I can see why that would be true. He is not a smart business man, because he is too greedy. I even told him that if it turns out well, I will refer the place to my friends. But he was not interested in generating more business. He was too focused on squeezing an extra dollar from every opportunity he had, therefore ruining my night.
