What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is old school Italian done right. You start with pizza bread and a loaf of hot crusty bread, and pretty much everything comes with a soup and salad. My favorite is the spinach soup and house salad. Order the zuppa di mare! It's my all-time favorite, without fail I'll order it. Zesty tomato sauce wrapped about lobster, shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels, calamari, and linguini. If heaven could be served on a plate, that is what it would be!
