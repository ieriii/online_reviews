I love to go to Yolk for brunch! They are have a modern atmosphere, great breakfast, and are moderately priced. I usually get the standard 2 eggs, sausage, potato's, and toast and am able to spend under $10. It does get a bit crowded on Sunday afternoons when I have been there, but the staff are friendly and they are usually able to move customers through quickly to seating.
