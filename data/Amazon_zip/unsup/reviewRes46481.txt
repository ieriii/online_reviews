This is one old school, straight outta 1971 cramped joint. My guess is there was more room to move around on the dance floor at Studio 54. Usually, I don't care about the "intimacy" of the seating. But RJ Grunts revolves around their "famous" salad bar, which requires diners to stand up and walk back and forth to the...well, salad bar. While impossible, a couple of more inches between tables would be nice. That being said the--no joke--inch-thick burgers are cooked precisely to the requested doneness. The servers are efficient and engaging Sunday through Thursday. Fri/Sat? Well, on those nights, the seating isn't the only thing cramped around here. The salad bar really isn't much to brag about, but it's a nice add-on to your dinner. Cross your fingers and hope the salad bar offers tortilla soup during your visit. They cook a deliciously mean one. There always seems to be a Lincoln Park family with an unruly toddler, but I've begun to find that aspect endearing...."HANNAH! STOP KISSING PEOPLE!"
