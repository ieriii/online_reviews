I had a Groupon for Bonsoiree burning a hole in my pocket, so who better to lead me on a culinary tasting adventure than the lovely Brett D., who's been singing their praises since their opening? Bonsoiree is BYOB, so do, take advantage. Once we were seated (very closely to two other tables I might add) we sat, and sat, and sat- not knowing quite what was going on. Were we getting the 8-course tasting, or more? And why we were waiting so long without a second contact? Although casual and friendly is the style here, service could be tightened up. The first dish came out without mention of how many courses there would be still, but there was never a dish that hit the table without a full description, which was a plus. Some of my favorites: -Quail lollipop in a spicy dipping sauce, with lime salt on the rim. Mmm, lime salt. -Prime rib Tonkatsu was succulent and tasty, a true hit. -Motoyaki with crab and scallop meat served in a half shell was incredible, especially the presentation. An oddity: -Cheeeeeese looks like a Cracker! and vice versa. While not super mind-blowing, the cracker that tasted like cheese that tasted like a cracker was a nice bit of culinary magic. But nothing for me, surpassed dessert: -8 chocolates, none of them failed. My favorite had a tiny piece of Sumac leaf on it and I think I could eat Sumac and chocolate every day now! It was like nothing I've ever tasted before... Did I mention we were elbow to elbow with our neighbors? Yeah, Bonsoiree can be a bit tight. At first it was a bit off-putting, but our neighbors to Brett's left were quite delightful, and the ones to her right left us their wine when leaving. Generosity is always a good sign. The night was very enjoyable, although I'm not sure I could enjoy it if I was paying full-price. Thank you, Groupon!
