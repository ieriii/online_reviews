cardboard comparable to little ceasar's. -both thin and stuffed pie. Slow service-ignored us. I am a New yorker who worked in italian joints for years, and also even at an UNO's, which is better. this place had good fresh toppings, but the dry crust was OLD OLD OLD. what a waste of time and tummy space, next time, GINO"S EAST!
