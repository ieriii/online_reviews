A really average food experience and I won't rush back to Zed451. The restaurant itself looks great and it is in a great location in Chicago to ensure that there will always be a nice buzz in the restaurant. The chefs walking around with the food are very knowledable and friendly. Unfortunately, the food isn't anything special and I prefered the old restaurant that used to be in this location called Sal & Carvao. The cold buffet was a real disappointment. Nothing exciting on the buffet and a real let down compared to Texas de Brazil or Fogos buffet. A few cheeses, cold salads, a few pieces of bread, nothing to get you excited. None of the meats stood out, the sausages were very good and the Tuna was tasty. The vension was really poor and probably the worst vension I have ever had. I know that Zed451 isn't looking to rival the all you can eat Brazilian steakhouse however I would pick Texas de Brazil or Fogo over Zed451 anyday.
