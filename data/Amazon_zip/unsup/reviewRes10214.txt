The restaurant we often choose when my wife and I want to be transported back to Italy. Quite authentic, we have enjoyed this gem on 4 occasions. I seem stuck on the antipasto selection which includes great cheeses, vegs and meat. My entre the past two times has been the incredible pasta PAPPARDELLE CON CINGHIALE. All I can say is never thought wild boar could be so exciting.  Other at the table enjoyed the whole fish of the day, baked with Sicilian sea salt crust and the lamb shank. Finally, the wine list offers an incredible selection of Italian wines. Hard to find a weak selection. In fact, picked a wine that carried a $26 price that was a great value for the price. Sprung for desserts and walked out with a check for less than $350 for 6 people including 2 bottles of wine.  What an easy restaurant to help me forget about my old standby, Hole in the Wall.
