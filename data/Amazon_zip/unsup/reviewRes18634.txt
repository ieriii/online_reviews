I have somewhat mixed feelings about the Bad Apple. As a bar, it's awesome. They have a great beer selection for reasonable prices, and the bartender (who I think is the owner) is really knowledgeable and will make recommendations for you.  I was really excited to try the food there because it sounded great, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Both my roommate and I hate onions, so we tried to order different burgers (I think I wanted a mushroom one and my roommate wanted one with chili peppers) minus the onions, but they couldn't do it. Apparently they mix the ingredients together ahead of time and so they can't really change anything. So I just ordered a normal burger, but since I couldn't get what I had originally wanted, I asked for a pretzel bun. They said that they couldn't do that either! I thought that was really strange. Aside from that, the burgers were really good. I was just annoyed at the lack of flexibility. But, I'll definitely try it again, now that they've been open a little longer!
