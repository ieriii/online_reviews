Underwhelming. Maybe it's a victim of too much hype, but I would much rather return to Bonsoiree, Schwa, or Sixteen. I was expecting much more than the heavy flavors and conventional menu. The dessert was the worst I have had at a fine dining restaurant in chicago (I had the corn). The high note was the fois gras, a good meal, but not worth the price with the caliber of restaurants we are fortunate to have in Chicago.
