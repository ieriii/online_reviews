Finally visited the legend, Superdawg, and what can I say - it was alright. The hot dog was good, not a Vienna but larger and still pretty tasty. The fries were burnt-looking but still tasted good. My friend enjoyed his shake. I liked the little idiosyncrasies of the place, such as how they tuck the ketchup into the edges of the box. I am not sure if I'm sold on the whole drive-in experience; I like keeping my car clean and honestly prefer a table!
