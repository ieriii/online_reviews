Delicious!! We ordered the Irish Benny, French Toast, and 2 Eggs Platter. Everything was cooked well and the portions were huge! The fruit that came with the plates were super fresh and plentiful. Service was great even though the restaurant was PACKED.  Strawberry Orange Juice...YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!  Will be back!
