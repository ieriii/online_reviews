I have been eating here for years. My father is good friends with Chris, they went to HS together. I love this place so much I booked my wedding reception here. First of all - the food is awesome. I don't think I've ever eaten anything here that wasn't great. Secondly, they have a salad bar. I can count on one hand the restaurants I know of that still have those. And last, they have very reasonable prices. I have eaten at some shady places that charge more for the same food, that tastes like crap and you get a fraction of the portion. Our wedding reception was EXCELLENT. The food was phenominal, and there was plenty of it. NO ONE complained about the food. We also had open bar, which was also amazing. We had two bartenders who were really nice, and very attentive all night. No one had to wait for a drink. We also had them provide a sweet table. WOW! I thought that meant a "sweet table", and boy, was I wrong! It was a BUFFET. A chocolate, candy, and fruit buffet. I mean, you couldn't think of something that wasn't on this table. Chocolate covered strawberries, mini cannolli's, nuts, fruit cut into little flowers, mini cakes, eclair's...I am sure there are things I am missing as well. The wait staff was amazing. They handled everything timely and were nothing but nice to all of our guests. I cannot tell you how perfect everything turned out. As for dining in, I have no complaints. We are always pleased with the service and the food as well. I would highly recommend ordering the Chicken Al LaVilla. That is one of my favorite things to order there, among others of course. The lobster Bisque is awesome as well as the cream of broccoli.  Reagarding delivery - we order pizza and food every now and then, and it is really good as well. They deliver timely and the food comes HOT. Plus, I think they deliver until like 1 or 2 AM. Plus, I would totally recommend here for a first date, or someplace quiet and romantic to take your sweetheart ;)
