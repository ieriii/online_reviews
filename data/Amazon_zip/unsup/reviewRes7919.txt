Best. Pizza. Place for Italian style thin crust pizza. I find myself constantly coming back. So delicious. Had the diablo and it was the perfect spice level. The prosciutto arugula was amazing and the three cheese white was tangy and tasty for a pizza without sauce. Also the little cannoli's handed out on the way out are prob the best I've ever had (even in italy). Staff is very knowledgable of ingredients and their authenticity. Always an amazing dining experience.
