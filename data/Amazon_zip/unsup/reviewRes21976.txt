Phenomenal. Food was great and I would absolutely go here again. Price- appetizers are about $7-$10. The yuca fries with garlic was worth it. Quality- empanadas, ceviche, yuca fries and oatmeal shake were superb. Lots of flavor and great texture. Quantity- good amouy of food. You definitely get your money's worth. Staff- only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars. Seemed a bit unattentive. We had to do more flagging down of the staff to get served. Atmosphere- Very quaint and somewhat rustic. Great place. I'd definitely go again after collecting cash from my dance moves at the Admiral Theater.
