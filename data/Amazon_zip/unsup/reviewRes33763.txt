I came here for my boyfriend's company party. Who can turn down a free dinner at a nice place? :P We had the upstairs area to ourselves and it wasn't too crowded. The appetizers (calamari, bruschetta with goat cheese, pizza, I forget what else) were delicious and the drinks were strong. I ordered a semi-complicated drink which the bartender remembered. He went around asking people if they would like another drink too. Thats what I call excellent service! For dinner, we had rigatoni in marinara with sausage, rigatoni in an creamy sauce with squash and mushrooms, some kind of chicken and potatoes, tilapia with mushrooms and that is it I think. I had one too many drinks at that point but I do remember the food being amazing! We had chianti and pino grigio as well. My glass was never empty since the waiters filled it often. For dessert we had giant profiteroles which is my favorite dessert ever. The fact that they were giant made my night. We were able to take leftovers of the dinner too. You can guess what I had for lunch the next day!
