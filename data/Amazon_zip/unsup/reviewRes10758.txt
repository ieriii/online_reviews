Oh Piece, how I love thee. Yes, you are crowded but you are worth the wait! Honestly, I come here quite a bit and love this spot. The only annoyance is how long the wait is. Great beer selection - both Piece brew and other bottles. They also have liquor and wine for those that prefer it. The pizza is just so good. Great options on how you prefer it prepared (plain, red or white) and a great pizza ingredient list (including mashed potates - though I've never ventured that route). The atmosphere is really fun - loud music, lots of TV's, occasional karoke nights. Don't expect it to be all that quiet. Piece is a go-to for date night, gathering the girls before a night on the town, good for groups & bday parties too!
