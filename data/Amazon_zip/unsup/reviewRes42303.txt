The yelp reviews did NOT disappoint us tonight! We stopped into Tank tonight on a whim, never having tried pho. My girlfriend can be a picky eater but she loved the #54! I had the #59 and added jalapenos to add some spice. So good! And the price was so cheap! We've paid more for lunch downtown and been far less satisfied...will be back again soon!
