I didn't have the opportunity to eat dinner here (though I plan on coming back next time I'm in town), BUT I did have the chance to stop in for dessert one evening - specific Tiramisu. The Tiramisu at this place is one of the best that I have ever eaten in my life! Aside from gigantic portions, the dessert itself was rich, creamy and decadent. Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts and this place knows how to make it perfectly! As for the service, everyone at the restaurant is extremely nice, friendly and attentive!
