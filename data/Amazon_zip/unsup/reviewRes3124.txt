Seriously.. The wings here are amazing. Some of the best, unique wings in the city. The chicken is plump, fried and juicy. Couple that with some Sassy Seoul or Korean BBQ and you have some tasty treats. The sides are pretty good too but I recommend NOT ordering a large to split between people. There's a lot of it to go around so go with small! Also, the small order of 5 wings will definitely fill you up. I'll have to come here again just to try their Bi Bim Bop and other items, they look amazing too.
