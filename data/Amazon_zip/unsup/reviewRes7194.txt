I used to live around the corner from Sapori for a couple years, and it was always my and my bf's nice dinner date go-to destination. It's romantic (dim-lighting) cozy (dark wood and not toooo large of a space), and inviting. The service is consistently spot on - they are not afraid to hand out freebies (desserts, moscato, appetizers) to keep the guests coming back. The staff is extremely attentive and would always remember us whenever we came. I could rely on Sapori as a solid choice when the parents were in town as well. When my brother chose Sapori as his celebratory dinner destination when he proposed to his fiancee, they were very accommodating and helpful as I pre-arranged to have a bottle of champagne waiting for the happy couple. And the food.... literally everything on the menu is amazing. I have tried probably about 75% of their dishes, and not once have I ever been disappointed in anyway. All are very different, extremely flavorful, and beautifully presented. Oh, how I wish I still lived in Chicago!!! They always have great special events (wine-tastings, special 5 course meals) and are constantly mailing coupons... whether it be for the holidays, your birthday, or just because "Chef Anthony" is feeling generous. Be sure to make a reservation on the weekends though - the place is VERY busy many nights of the week, and you won't be walk in on prime time days.
