Great brunch place! The wait is never too long (although it's super busy all the time)...and the staff is always wonderful and accomodating. The place is spacious and very light. The breakfast bar is pretty cool too. I eat here almost every weekend and have tried most everything on the menu. The food is really really good. And they're great about substitutions! I love this place...it is my favorite brunch restaurant. Yum!
