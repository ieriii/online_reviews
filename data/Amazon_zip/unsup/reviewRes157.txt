Since my first review, I went back here on one other occasion.  It lived up to its hype the second time.  Service was still very attentive, but less stuffy. The biggest difference was I enjoyed the tastes of almost every course on the second visit whereas on the first visit, I thought over half the dishes were misses based on my personal preferences. Presentation was once again over the top in a good way. After being wowed on my second visit, I would come back here anytime. The best dish on my second visit was the dessert that was assembled on the dining table.  It was a work of art and delicious!
