This afternoon I went to Yolk with my college sign language class. We were to order as deaf people would order, which mostly means pointing at the menu. Our waiter didn't have a problem with this until he gave me the wrong order and forgot my drink. Not only did he give me a major attitude while handing me my correct order, but he charged me for all of it. When I went up to the front to pay, I explained the situation and received the most rude behavior I have ever experienced from anyone. He basically told me it wasn't their problem and said "the next time you want to be heard, you should just speak". I was astounded to be spoken that way. This clearly was an issue not only of incompetence, but of discrimination. After roughly handling the situation, he shooed me off. I would never eat at this establishment again, nor would I ever recommend this place to anyone. These people clearly have no respect for their customers, and they don't feel it necessary to treat disabled people in an appropriate way. I can only imagine how I would have been treated if I were really a deaf person. Some people are disgusting, and sadly I can say that I felt the same sentiment from everyone working there. They tried ignoring us when we were calling them over, obviously because we were making their jobs THAT much harder. This was the worst dining experience I have ever had.
