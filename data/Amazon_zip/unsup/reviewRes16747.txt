This is decidedly my favorite spot, robed in cornflower blue velvet and candlelight, it's virtually unrecognizable from Del Toro and Mod before it. The drinks are delicious as is the food, and Mike has been known to make a few drinks that aren't on the menu, which have always been my favorite. It's true you should go early and/or during the week if possible. It's also not the best place to see and be seen as the seating concept prevents people from invading your personal space. That and the no cell phone policy makes conversation actually possible. So round up your best-looking friends and go to the Violet Hour. Now.
