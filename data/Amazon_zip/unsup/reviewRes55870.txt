BEST INDIAN FOOD AROUND.My family & I often visit this place for their great buffet. The decor is wonderful. I myself love anything spicy and i get it here.The staff is amazing with their serivce & very welcoming. After visiting a few other places in the area I would by far say this is #1 on my list.
