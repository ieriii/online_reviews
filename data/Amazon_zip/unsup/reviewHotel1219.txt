This place was fantastic. They gave us a great rate because we were with a very small convention being held at University of Chicago. Plus our room was very spacious and stylish, and we had an incredible view of the downtown skyline. They fix nice strong drinks in the bar downstairs, and the gym facilities were gorgeous. Yes it is a short hike to Millenium Park, etc. But they have a free shuttle for drop-offs, and I took the bus three times in two days and it was a breeze. Simple, straight shot-----you're on, you're off. The staff were also so sweet and helpful. We loved it here.
