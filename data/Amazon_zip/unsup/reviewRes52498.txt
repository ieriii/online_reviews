I almost choked numerous times from the dryness in everything I tried here across the board. It was like eating rubber erasers when I tried the shrimp and I had a preconceived notion that it was going to be dry after the string of dry meats leading up to this constant denouement of bad food. These reviewers must be on crack, were paid by the restaurant, or are tourists from the middle of Kansas with unseasoned palettes. Bad! If I could give it a no stars, I would. FYI...I lived in Kansas before. I would recommend Fogo or Tribeca Churrascaria here in NYC for some real Brazilian BBQ and not the ghetto version of this half-assed buffet with sub-par meat.
