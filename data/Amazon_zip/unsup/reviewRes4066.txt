I'm sure that I'm romanticizing the world of chefs, but if it was my job to satisfy human beings' five senses with five plates of food (we always seem to get an extra!), each plate challenging a different preconception of expectations and in a non-pretentious environment I would think I have a charmed existence. Instead, I'm a chemist.
