I was eager to try out Sprout because its menu looked so unique and creative...full of interesting seasonal ingredients and flavor contrasts. The menu was executed even better than I expected - with lots of complementary flavors on each plate, and a great balance between vegetables, nuts, and sauces that varied with each course. Sprout doesn't fall into the trap of repeating flavors between courses.  For starters we had the soft shell crab (tender, with crisp vegetables, and an avocado mousse) and the foie gras (served in light mousse form on soft bread with colorful golden beets). For mains we had the black cod and the rabbit, particularly notable were the potato and cheese "dumplings" accompanying the rabbit. Just as with the starters, the variety of accompaniments provided a different flavor with each bite. Both the rabbit and the cod were cooked just right. Prior to dessert, a grilled cheese triangle with a tangy chutney was served - it was light, crisp, and flavorful. For dessert, we had the rhubarb and the corn. While I liked the creativity of this course, I thought the strawberry sauce on the rhubarb dish overpowered the other flavors because it was a bit too sweet. The corn had more complex flavors and it was interesting to taste popcorn, caramel, cornbread, and corn pieces all in one bite. Service was attentive, well paced, and friendly.  An extensive wine list is offered, as well as the option to go with a $25 wine pairing customized to each course - which was quite a bargin and provided (even more) great variety. Sprout is definitely high on my list for future special occasions, or just a great meal. The chef is really on to something good!
