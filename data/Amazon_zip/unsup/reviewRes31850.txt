So when I went to Sunda, it was at multiple friends urging to go.  The location of the place makes it difficult to park so valet is probably your best bet if you're going to dinner. I was there for lunch and found parking easily on the street.  The atmosphere and decor of the place is asian inspired, being that the place serves asian fusion (when I say asian fusion, I mean it's a compilation of many different asian foods, chinese, filipino, vietnamese, korean....etc) The food was decent, loved their curry shrimp and white fish... I would suggest hitting up this place for a happy hour or lunch....
