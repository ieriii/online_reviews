Superb Cuban sandwiches. The three of us had the lechon, cubano, and the media noche. We also had the empanadas. The overall impression was excellent quality food! This is the place to go for some quality cuban sandwiches with some excellent flavor and taste!!! We will definitely be coming back and bringing our Cuban family to enjoy!
