LOVE Calo. This restaurant is the perfect example of one of Chicago's hidden gems. It's an adorable little spot perfect for a date or an intimate night among friends. Best spot to sit is by the window for people watching. Service was very attentive and our waitress was a doll. She was around when we needed her, but let us chat away for hours without being bothersome. The portions are huge here as to be expected, and everything coming past my table looked and smelled amazing. After looking over the huge menu for what seemed like forever, I came to my decision: RIGATONI ALLA BARESE with Italian sausage, chicken, asparagus and roasted red peppers in a zesty tomato, garlic and olive oil sauce. Two kinds of meat and my favorite vegetable asparagus. This meal was made for me. Of course it was mouth watering and of course I gave my best effort but I still had half the meal left over in the end but that's what doggie bags are for right? For dessert I had this apple tart which I was expecting to be small, but when it came out it was HUGE. So crispy, warm and delectable. I knew it was time to go when we were the last table in the house and I felt like I had to unbutton my pants in order to move. Great meal. Love it!
