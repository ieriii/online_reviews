I had a birthday lunch here with a friend last week. The place is classy and well decorated. The staff is professional and attentive. The food was good, but the seared kobe sushi that the waiter recommended was just ok, a little greasy. The rest of the sushi was pretty good and very fresh. We also had an eggroll thing that tasted an awful lot like the appetizer at Rockit Bar and Grill. Methinks they definitely creatively alter some of the recipes to suit both restaurants. The waiter did offer us a free dessert for my birthday and let me say, the "Ridiculous" was, in fact, just that.
