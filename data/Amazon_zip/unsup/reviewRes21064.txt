Tried this place on a lark after a nearby event - had done some research and kind of knew what it would be like. The space, though nothing special decor-wise, is huge, goes on and on - we were pleased to be seated immediately at 8:30 on a Friday night. Drinks are pricy but healthy, the wine pour was generous (probably two glasses elsewhere), good martini. Food portions are large. We had mussels vindaloo (plump and not at all chewy), goat ragout, and fries. That was plenty and we are not shy eaters. Service was helpful and effective, waiter's suggestions were right on. We appreciated that they try to do much more than would be necessary to keep this place busy given the location, like an actual chef-driven menu and food philosophy. And warm bread. Be warned, though, this is not the place for an intimate one-on-one or romantic experience - the tables are very close together and you will hear every word of your neighbor's conversation whether you want to or not.
