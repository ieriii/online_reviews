Not sure I would come back and not sure I would do Ethiopian good again, however this place seemed pretty hopping, so why not. We ventured out here on a random Wednesday night and didn't know what to expect. The place itself is just fine- so 5 stars for that- the waiter didn't really seem to know what to suggest to new Ethiopian food diners which I thought was a touch crappy knowing that we'd never been there.  We did a sampling of a number of things and nothing stood out as overly amazing. So would I comeback, probably not.... But if it's your thing, rock it!
