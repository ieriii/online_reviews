I lived a couple blocks from here for a few years. This place is white-bread jazz meets Disney meets psuedo-gangsterism. Other than that, its got some nice atmosphere (the paintings with built-in frames are fantastic). This is not a hip jazz joint. The owner/manager behind the bar will vocally "shush" the crowd... am I 5 years old again?? It's not cool to me! Chris Foreman used to play a Friday happy hour on the hammond organ. His sets are wildly engaging (think looney tunes meets gospel) and one good reason for me to go back...
