There's a reason Fogo de Chao is the best at what they do. Meat = perfect. Even the ones less preferred are outstanding, and the quality is consistent, unlike some competitors. They start with great cuts and grill them to perfection (seriously, it's almost funny how much better the meats here are than a certain nearby competitor). Service = phenomenal. It's the kind of overzealous attention that you dream about in a place like this... when people are bringing you meat on demand, you don't want them to be long between visits. My rule is that if I can eat the meat and clean my plate before someone new gets to the table, they're not quite up to the level of performance I desire. Take that however you want; I'm not yelling at the dudes, but I WANT to be overwhelmed here, people! And at Fogo, you have to really watch how you flip that little red and green card--if you have the green up, the gauchos will swarm you like wasps on a pop can. And I mean that in a GOOD way. Salad bar/sides = fantastic. Even the little cheesy bread puffs at Fogo are way better than anywhere else. And the salad bar is packed to the gills with all sorts of premium stuff, if you go in for that sort of stuff when also offered a non-stop parade of succulent grilled meats. I tend to skip it and save all my stomach space, but that's just me--I'm goofy like that. When all the other spots close their doors and pack up, Fogo will still be there, kicking ass.
