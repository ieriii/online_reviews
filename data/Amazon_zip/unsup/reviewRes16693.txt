I went to India House about a week back, and I am still thinking about the food. Always a good sign. I was there with two friends for lunch and we all got the buffet. Everything I tried was good, although there was one dish of mixed vegetables that was so spicy even I couldn't take it. And I live and die for spice. The simple fact that I ate three times over what my stomach could even hold says it all. My friends loved the chicken tikka masala, but my favorite was a paneer dish. The only drawback was that as we were finishing our third plate of food, the server told us that they were closing and that all the food would be taken off the buffet. We rushed to eat desert, but I barely tasted the sweet rice as I shoveled it in. Would I go back? Yes. Am I anywhere near India House on a daily basis? No. But I'll make the trek again one of these days.
