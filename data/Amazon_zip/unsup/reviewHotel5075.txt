This "club" SUCKS! We went there on a Saturday for my cousin's 40th birthday party. First, it has nothing to do with a hotel! It's a crappy-looking club in a lousy location where they make you pay $20 for valet before making you wait in line to enter. As you're entering, they frisk the guys and check the girls' purses. You are then FORCED to pay $4 to check your coat. If you are with other people, you cannot check your coats together. You MUST PAY separately! The cover that night was $20 for women and $30 for men..really? Someone said that someone from Basketball Wives L.A. was supposed to be there and this was the reason for the extra security. Who cares? I'm not impressed with celebrities and I care even less for pseudo celebrities!The club is small, dark and the music is EXTREMELY LOUD. On Saturday, the DJ played an uninspired playlist of "crap rap" music. The crowd was aggressive and "low end!" We had a room in the back where we could barely see one another and conversations were limited since you had to scream just to be minimally heard. Again, this place SUCKS! One star is too much of a compliment for this hell hole. I WILL NEVER RETURN THERE!
