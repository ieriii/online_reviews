Yummy yummy yum yum. I went to XOCO on a Saturday night and waited about an hour from waiting in line to sitting down and getting our food. It was quite busy, but the line didn't reach outside the doors yet which is tolerable for me. Came here with a group of 5. We ordered the guacamole as appetizer. I ordered the seafood "meal in a bowl" and it was delicious. Very tasty sweet seafood broth. I would love more catfish though. Only had lil bits and pieces that left me wanting more. Bf ordered the aho gado (??)....aka the pork sandwich in a tomato base sauce. It was FRACKEN delicious. I would definitely order this next time. :D Prices are affordable. Mostly $10-$15. I do have to note though that the service wasn't THE best. When we asked for a container to take home the leftover soup, the waiter just plopped the container on the table and left right away. The bowl is in an odd shape to pour the soup into the container....it would've been nice if the waiter just used his superstar skills to wrap it up for us. Other than that, I would definitely be back (on a less busy day!).
