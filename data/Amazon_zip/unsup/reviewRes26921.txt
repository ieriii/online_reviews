O.M.G. What a delicious meal and great experience. We dined fairly late on a recent Saturday night and were thoroughly impressed by the atmosphere, the service, and--most importantly--the food. We started with cocktails at the bar because our table was just a couple of minutes slow, for which we also got a compliments-of-the-kitchen amuse, so no complaints about that, and then moved on to a series of a la carte dishes. Everything we had from the new spring menu was faultlessly well prepared and delicious, with a great blend of flavors and nicely contrasting textures. Particularly memorable were the crab starter and the thyme dessert, although really every dish was one I would not hesitate to order again. Service was attentive without being annoying, and we, being mild misanthropes, really enjoyed sitting several feet rather than inches from the closest table. My husband, who once declared that he was into fine dining but not into tucking his shirt in, was particularly pleased with the overall lack of pretension. Yeah, it's expensive, and yeah, our entrees were maybe three or four ounces of meat instead of 12. So if you judge value by portion size, this is not the place for you. But for everyone else, highly recommended.
