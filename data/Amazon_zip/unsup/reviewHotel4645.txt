I stayed here a few times for business shortly after it opened. It has a nice location, and it's very modern. The staff was friendly. The restaurant wasn't open yet, but the bar was nice. I didn't spend much time there since it was very expensive and I had a lot of work. The rooms were small but nice. Although I haven't been to Tokyo, it's how I picture hotel rooms there based on my expertise from Lost In Translation. I really didn't mind the small space since it was very well designed and decorated. My main complaint would be the bathroom. There's nowhere to put any of your stuff since the sink is a pedestal with no storage. Also, the shower has a curtain that doesn't stop the water from making a good sized puddle on the shower floor. I'm sure the maids love this. I was very pleased with the great staff and nicely appointed rooms, especially at the comparatively low rates for Chicago.
