This place is pretty rad. Went here a few weeks back. Cool neighborhood and the wait, well it was average for a weekend night. Aside from that, the food and beer was good. I highly suggest the double I.PA. Oh, they also have some seriously hot elves working for them behind the bar. I suggest sitting at the bar, if possible.
