My first visit here was on Restaurant Week. I really want to give this place 5 stars but that wouldn't accurately represent the food I ate, It just missed the mark.  When I walked in the restaurant for the first time there was something comforting about it. The place has an old-world charm with a modern twist. Plus, the staff was very friendly and the service was very quick...I sat up at the bar and they set me up very fast, I had silverware, plates, water and a bread basket within minutes of sitting down. For the antipasto, I had the zuppa del giorno, which was a cauliflower and potato soup. It was tasty but it was missing something, after adding a little salt and pepper the flavor really opened up. I think some truffles would have elevated the dish. For the primo, I had tagliatelle del cinghiale, tagliatelle with wild boar. This dish was very comforting, I imagine that if I had an Italian grandmother she would cook me something like this. The dish had subtle hints of nutmeg, cinnamon and rosemary which was well balanced. The boar meat was also very tender. For the dolce, I had the saffron and vanilla panna cotta. This was delicious, it was light, airy and creamy. The caramel on the side had a bit of that burnt sugar taste which made the dish taste like a lighter version of creme burlee.  I would definitely go back to Piccolo Sogno. I highly recommend this place. Buon Appetito!
