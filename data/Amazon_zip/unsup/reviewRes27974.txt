I feel very lucky to have become a somewhat frequent patron of Graham Elliot. Because I've been a few times my rating is an overall summary of all experiences. Atmosphere: I love that the atmosphere is low-key and casual despite being a very upscale establishment Service: The waitstaff is consistently friendly and very knowledgeable about the dishes. We always choose to listen to our severs and they have yet to let us down. Cuisine: I truly love every meal I've had at GE. I like that fact they use seasonal ingredients and their menu changes every three months. Beverages: Their wine list is never bare and they have delicious cocktails that also change every three months.
