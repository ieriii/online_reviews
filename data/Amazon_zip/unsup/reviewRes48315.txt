Loved this place. Went on a Tuesday evening at 9 pm with a reservation. It was packed. We sat at one of the long tables, packed tightly with about 30 other people we didn't know. It was loud and fun. I loved the atmosphere, but I would understand if people were not comfortable sitting that closely to people you don't know. I wore nice jeans and a shirt and felt fine in there. Beer list is phenomenal. For each dish, I asked our server to bring me "something good". He didn't disappoint. The food come in small plates. And it is very good. We went with west coast oysters, smoked ham, collared greens, scallops and chicken. Lovely. Will definitely return on several occasions.
