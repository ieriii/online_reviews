Been here for Sunday brunch a few times. Absolutely love it! Incredible bang for you buck. It is a high end restaurant, excellent ingredients, creative and unique dishes. Tempura french toast, pork belly with poached eggs are awesome. Super large portions as well. Solid bloody marry bar. With entrees only $10-$14 you can't beat it! Highly recommend.
