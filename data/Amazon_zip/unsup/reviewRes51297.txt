Meh. Just like what the rating quote says when you pick 2 stars. Good: Open late, lots of seating, strong margaritas, good location in the square Not good: Food The chicken tacos were to dry for my liking, and the chicken burrito was the same according to my date. Even with all the good things, if I were starving and had no food at home and it was after midnight, then I might consider eating here again.
