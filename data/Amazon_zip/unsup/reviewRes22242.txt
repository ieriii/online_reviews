Superdawg is another one of those "Chicago Institutions" as far as hot dog stands go, but I am sure everyone knows that it is so much more. For starters, Superdawg is an interesting but dying breed of restaurant: The drive in. If you don't know, the procedure is simply driving up to a stall, placing your order through an intercom system, and wait for it to be delivered on a tray by a carhop. But the thing that keeps me coming back every time is the Superdawg itself. Snappy, juicy, and piled high with first rate condiments like every Chicago dog ought to be, but this isn't some run of the mill Vienna Beef sausage that is typically elsewhere. Instead, Superdawg has always used custom made hot dogs, but they taste as good, if not better, than any other hot dog I have ever had. The fries are decent, though honestly mostly an afterthought that are often packed too tightly into the box with your superdawg. I would personally prefer it if they left the fries optional as it would make ordering their hot dogs in bulk more feasible. Still, if you are in the mood for a Chicago Dog done right, look no further than Superdawg.
