This place is pretty much an icon on Milwaukee. Always packed for brunch. We managed to squeak in later on a Sunday as one of the last tables they sat--I think we had like a 30 minute wait. Unfortunately, they were not same side friendly either do to the wait. I ordered a half order of the Chocolate Tower French Toast. I was hoping the would have something with berries, but didn't see anything on the menu and picked this.  I only ordered the half-size and it was HUGE. I would def. recommend ordering a slice or two. It is very rich, but really delicious. I actually ate it for about three days! It is also pretty expensive for brunch. I'm eager to try the pretzel pancakes and eggs benedict! Pros: HUGE portions, Rich food Cons: Not Usually Same-Side Friendly, Long waits, Pricey, Food is too rich at times
