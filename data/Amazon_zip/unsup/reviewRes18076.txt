We've gotten takeout from Xoco a couple of times. The tortas are killer! I've had three different ones and they were all very, very good. I wasn't as impressed with the chicharrones, however. OK, but nothing special. It's not cheap, since, in part you're paying for "Bayless", but still, the most unique tortas I've ever heard of - call it the torta "elevated".
