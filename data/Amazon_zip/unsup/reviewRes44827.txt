OMG...I ate 2 pounds of cheese. Extremely filling pizza. Ordered a small, half spinach half something else with sausage and veggies. It takes a good 35 minutes for the pizza to cook. Ate salad to hold us over because we were stahhhving! Once the pizza arrives the crust is a good 2 inches thick if not more. The spinach portion of the pizza was lacking...spinach. It looks like they just spread single layer of spinach leaves. The other half was full of veigges and a spattering of sausage. Overall for my first stuffed pizza it wasn't bad. Although I've had Uno's deep dish and I would say its about the same.  This is a whole day's meal. I shared the small pizza and we finished it but we were stuffed for until the next day. We walked around for a good 3 hours to help alleviate the fullness.  Be prepared to get "stuffed," I love puns.
