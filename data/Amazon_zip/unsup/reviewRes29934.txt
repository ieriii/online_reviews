During a weekend getaway, I had a most amazing saturday brunch @ Frontera Grill (and let me tell you, I am serious about brunch ... and well food in general)! The wait was indeed 1 hr but so what, no problem. We told them we'd be walking about town during that time and they simply said be back at a specific time to check in on progress. Easy. And the food: huevos rancheros verdes-- aaaamazing, truly. Bright flavors, perfect portion size, fab ambience, fun music, and the staff was actually very nice and attentive. I will return and plan to hit up fellow institution Xoco sometime for churros con chocolate. I trust Rick Bayless with my appetite.
