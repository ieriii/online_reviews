Firstly, it is an amazing space with ingenious decors & space separation. We ordered house poutine - beats the poutine at southern by miles! roasted bone marrow - much better than the bristol. venison carpaccio - delicious & not gamey fish special - fishy the gage prime burger - very very good roast gunthopr farm pork chop - ok roasted amish chicken - juicy & tender fried sea beans - too salty banana split - excellent deconstructed elements coffee & donuts - very good I thought the food was superb & would love to come back, probably more for the appetizer & desserts. I think they are of better value.
