Sorry Demera, you've been demoted. Your food is still good, but you really need to get your act together when it comes to service. I phoned 3 times today to order delivery. Was hung up on twice. The third time I was told, "sorry we are not doing delivery right now. We are too busy." What?? This was just the last in a long line of strange service hiccups. Delivery is especially problematic -- the rules seem to change randomly every other month. I hung up the phone and went to Raj Dashen.
