My wife and I celebrated our 13th Anniversary downtown and being huge Top Chef fans, Sprout was the place for us. The staff was outstanding and while we were early, we sat at the bar entertained by the bartender who recommended some wonderful mixed drinks for us. We sat at the Spotlight Table and while it was still "open" to the rest of the room, we still felt like we had a special secluded area. I started with the foie gras for the first time and was elated! So delicate and tasty. My wife started with the Scallop and was extremely pleased. For the second course, I had the perfectly cooked Braised Short Rib while my wife ate the Black Cod. For the final course, I went with the Corn Brioche and my wife veered towards the Banana. The shaved Ginger Ice between the courses was spot on. The highlight of the evening was my wife asking for her picture with Dale, who couldn't be more pleasant and humble! We will be back in the Spring!
