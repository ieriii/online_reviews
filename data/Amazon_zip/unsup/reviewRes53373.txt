Doug = sausage Jedi. There are many places where the wait gets long, this is one of the places that is worth the wait. When friends come in from out of town I take them to Hot Doug's. The specials are always greater than the sum of their parts. Avoid the lines and go there at an off hour. I've been several times midweek before noon or after 1 pm and walked straight up to the counter. The duckfat fries are nice, but not worth the extra wait, the sausages will blow you mind.
