Ate at Kinzie's last night - daughter, boyfriend, wife and I. We're from WI and were in Chicago overnight visiting our daughter who came in from out of town. Spent several hours researching places looking at ratings and menus. Was between here and Morton's. Decided on Kinzies due to ambience and it's not a chain. Specifically asked for a quiet table off to the side. We wanted this to be a special evening and we had a wonderful evening thanks to the staff there. Started out with 4 aps and bottle of white and red to start breathing. We got 3 bone in rib eyes, one bone in filet, and 3 sides. We split 2 desserts and all got an after dinner drink (port, scotch, etc.). Reservations were easy and staff was very courteous. All food was outstanding, and service and server were outstanding as well. Loved the ambience. Our server (Jerry) was spot on with different recommendations when asked and he provided complementary sauces which we loved. Everyone there did a great job and will definitely return.  Only negative was they did not have anyone knowledgeable about wines there that night. I have wine store and steward experience and sommelier training through the Master Court of Sommeliers "so I went it alone". When someone has an extensive wine list, I like to try something new. I would recommend they always have a knowledgeable wine steward (sommelier) available during busy times, or train all the servers. This did not negatively affect my ratings. Cheers!
