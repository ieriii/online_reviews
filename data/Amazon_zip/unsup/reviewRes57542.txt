Geja's is quite hidden but is often crowded. I personally don't like it when a restaurant and people filled with it from wall to wall, but this place was nice. Geja's does have a very relaxed ambient romantic feel to it. My waiter was super friendly, nice, and accommodating. The fondue was great and the bar was good too. The only reason why I don't go there more often is the prices! But other than that, great!
