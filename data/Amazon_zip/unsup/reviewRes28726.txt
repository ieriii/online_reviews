The pizza was just fantastic...my brother- in-law said we had to try it so we went early on a saturday nite . It was just starting to get busy but we were able to get a nice cozy booth for two.Unfortunatley our waitress did not have much of a personality,but the pizza defininatly speaks for itself!!!The crust was just dark enough, the body was lite and airy ,the sauce was full of flavor and the cheese was browned to perfection. this place is a winner in my book!! looking forward to going back...
