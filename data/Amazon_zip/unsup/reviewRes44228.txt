It's great living just down the street from this amazing bakery. Also could explain why I don't seem to be losing weight when I stop by after working out at the gym across the street. We've stopped in to purchase cupcakes on serveral occasions. They always amazing, and have a great selection (so far, my favorite has been the carrot cake. Hell, even the chocolate peanut butter one is great, and it's VEGAN!) We've also ordered 2 cakes from them for birthday parties. They are amazing, and beautifully decorated. The bakery itself is very small, and a small line will make the bakery itself very crowded. However, they have a large sitting area right next door, with tables, chairs and couches for those who want to hang out and work, or chat with friends.
