You can easily pass the place up if you weren't looking for it. This is a great spot with an awesome array of Belgian beers. I would just go wild and experiment while you are here. The place is very trendy and the time I went I was lucky since it wasn't very busy... so I had time to check out the great flavor in the beer.
