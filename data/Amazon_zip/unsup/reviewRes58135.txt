Came here for dinner on a Friday night and was absolutely blown away by this place! The food was phenomenal- we ordered a cheese platter and one of the three came with this pistachio truffle spread & omg I have never tasted anything like it! My boyfriend was raving about the bacon wrapped dates. I am a vegetarian and super picky at that, I was very pleased with the selection they offered and how much actually appealed to me, this doesn't happen often! Server was attentive and very knowledgeable. The GM was so sweet, I love female operated restaurants! A++ Mercat, we will be back!
