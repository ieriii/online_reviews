As a person who went to callege at Tulane and bummed around NOLA for some time after, I was keenly interested when I ran into Big Jones at the Green City Market benefit at Red Light. There they had an awesome succotash and a peach cobbler so good Mother's would have been humbled had the old lady been able to take a taste.  We followed up by going to dinner last night and had fried chicken. Wow what great chicken. Crispy with a real bite to the meat. You could tell that the chickens got to run around a lot and got plenty of excercise. Cornbread: JUST LIKE down south. White cornmeal and not sweet. It could have used more crunch around the outside though.  Mississippi mud pie: Holy Wonka WOW! That was the richest thing I've ever eaten by far.  The service was warm and friendly just like you'd expect. I can't wait to go try brunch because I hear they have beignettes!
