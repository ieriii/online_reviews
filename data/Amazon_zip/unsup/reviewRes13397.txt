It's sort of an odd niche this place is filling....a brunch joint that does seafood and sandwiches. Huh? That said, it's still a nice chill place to throw back some hangover eggs. I've only ever sat outside, and it's very nice aside from the el roaring overhead periodically but hell that's Chicago. The service was pretty prompt the first couple times we ate there, not so much the last time. Still not all that bad. You do get a freakin' ton of food with the Gonzo eggs & corned beef hash. Gotta give 'em this, the brunch drinks are STIFF.  I'm definitely going to try to make it back here to do the all you can eat crab legs or some dinner entry. So far so good though, the owners are super friendly.
