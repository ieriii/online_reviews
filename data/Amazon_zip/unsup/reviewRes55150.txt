Let me start by saying that the service here is incredible! Definitely what I consider a BBQ Game Changer. I went there for the first time with my friend Becca and some of her girlfriends and was absolutely blown away. According to my buddies, you even get a special treat on you birthday. This was a new idea to me and ended up loving it. The fries and sandwich are served all together bunched up and yummy in my tummy. So the fries end up being covered in the wonderful sauces and grease which dominate the sandwich. Seriously this place is truly as good as it gets within Chicago's BBQ scene. My mouth is watering just thinking about going here again. Thank you for the Chips & Pickles!
