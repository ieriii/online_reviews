Fantastic place for quality of the fondue and the romantic atmosphere. In my experience, great fondue is a hard thing to find- not present in New York for example. Geja's gives you the epitome of fondue- real equipment with a powerful flame; quality meats and breads. Good wines. Reservations are needed (on opentable). Location is great as well since you are close to unique Armitage boutiques.
