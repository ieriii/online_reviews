One of my favorite places to go with a group (regardless of how many people I go with or how much we order I end up spending $20). The bbq process is quite frenetic, but it's fun and everyone gets involved.  A perfect meal involves an order of the fried dumplings, the marinated short ribs, and several large bottles of OB beer.  I disagree about the service being horrible - last night we had 3 or 4 women helping us throughout the course of our meal. While there was a language barrier (at times) we always got what we asked for and we were never sassed or felt rushed.  I do agree that it's smokey, but you do have a charcoal grill on your table. So, if you're averse to smoke, this might not be the best environment for you. If you're fine with it, just wear something that can be washed.
