this is a really solid brunch spot. i had an omlette, my friend had an eggwhite scramble and we split an order of strawberry stuffed french toast. yes--that's right. we ordered 3 entrees for 2 people. they were all really good. not life changing, but really good.  anyway--at 10am on saturday morning, we didn't even really wait for a table, although the place was pretty full. BUT--the hostess was crabby and the waitress was weird. while we were finishing our food, the bus boy was hovering over us and really giving us the "get out of here" vibe. it was weird. and annoying.  however-when we left, the place was so crowded with people waiting on a table that we could barely get out the door. definitely don't show up any later than 10 am if you don't want to wait forever for a table.
