Worth the wait. I went on a Saturday night. I was with three other people. We had to wait about an hour and a half to two hours, but it was totally worth it. Plus we had our wine and chips and salsa to keep us occupied. I split the grilled steak and chicken burrito with a friend. The grilled steak was delish. I wasn't as impressed with the chicken burrito, but will try it again with steak.
