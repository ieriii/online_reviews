I'm often at least a little bit skeptical of places that put incredible effort into decor and vibe. Not that I have a problem with an appealing space, but to me it should always be food first, scene second. I'm happy to report that Sunda does both quite well. I think enough has been said about the decor and vibe of the place--very cool space, great decor, cool bar, beautiful people--so I'll focus on the food. If the very term 'Asian Fusion' has you thinking 'cliche' and 'overdone', Sunda will challenge those stereotypes. Loved the Toast & Jam, Beef Lollipops, and Devil's Basket (I'm pretty sure the titles of these dishes alone speak to the creativity of the menu here). Also, sashimi is not a commodity. It may be pricey here, but you'll get what you pay for in terms of freshness and beautiful cuts of fish. There's also a pretty extensive cocktail and saki list which is a great complement in my book. Be warned that menu items are anything but cheap, and they tend to add up given the small-plates sharing concept Sunda employs. I think it's also fair to say that you're paying a premium for location, decor, and for the privilege of seeing and being seen here. Also, in the spirit of full disclosure, I've had better sushi rolls in considerably less ostentatious atmospheres throughout the city. But for the complete package and really knocking a few dishes out of the park, I'm a fan.
