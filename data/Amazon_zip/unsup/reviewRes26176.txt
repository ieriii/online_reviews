Love it, love it, love it! This is by far my favorite restaurant! The menu is always the same, and I wouldn't have it any other way. This is the best fondue, great salad, cheese, quality of meats/seafood, deserts and the dipping sauces are by far the best. I won't even go to the Melting Pot anymore. As for those that say Geja's is a rip off, the Melting Pot is actually MORE expensive and the quality does not compare. I have been coming here for over 10 years now and I have never once had bad service! The staff is always friendly and willing to accommodate. I moved away from Chicago and every time I come home, I make it a point to go to Geja's . It also has a great atmosphere, it's not as dark as some other reviews say.. I definetly can see people, but it is a bit on the dimmer side, lit by candles and amber lights. To me, this adds to the romantic element of the place. It is very small, so that may be why some say it "smells" like grease.. they use oil for the main course of the fondue, so the later you come, the stronger the sent may be.. just from so many pots cooking all night. I don't find it overpowering or unpleasant. There is only 1 bathroom per male and female, so come prepared to wait for that. Other than that, I highly recommend!
