Must say, some of the best brunches I've ever had came from here! The lines are not so bad if you go at the right time and if you don't got yourself a car you have to stow away. The breakfast foods are fantastic! I had the Meli's french toast, and I think I still dream about it sometime. The pancakes are HUGE and the lunch portions are equally impressive. Everytime my friends and I are in Chicago and are craving a bite to eat, we always end up here. Definitely worth your time if you are willing to wait in line for a bit (my only compliant) on the busy times on weekends.
