So I go to all Chinese restaurants and whether I like it or not end up comparing them to my all time favorite Guey Lon on Irving Park and Elston. That being said, Sun Wah was really good but just can't make it my #1.  I met a friend there around 8 on a Friday night expecting a wait for a table, but got seated as soon as we walked in the door, no problems there. The menu was pretty huge and it was tough but we picked the bbq roast duck and the pan fried rice noodles with pork and bean sprouts. It was my first time with duck and I was happy, duck is good. The noodles and pork were good too, and the portions were huge. We ordered a small of each and ended up taking more than half of each home.  Service was quick to our table as soon as we sat down. Someone was always there to fill water glasses even if only a sip was missing. To be honest though, I was kinda caught up in conversation so not sure how long we were waiting on our food, but it seemed quick. And get this, we got the duck, pork noodles, egg rolls and drinks...$28 can't beat that. Only thing I regret is not getting the peking duck meal.  TL;DR -Great service -Huge portions of good food. -Plenty of value
