I ended up at Sansu after I was invited to join some Coffee Studio Scrabble players that I'd just met that evening. I was very pleased with the food and the ambience. Sort of surly waitstaff, a little loud (but because people are enjoying themselves), lots of orange... it was like being back in Korea. The prices were reasonable, also. But again, the food was tasty. I don't recall how many veg or fish dishes they had (since it is primarily a meat joint), but I'd recommend it for anyone.
