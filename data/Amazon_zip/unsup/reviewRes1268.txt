This place would be even better if only locals could frequent it. :-) I kid, I kid. It's pretty rare to find a place that serves chicken dogs -- at least in Chicago anyway. For that, this place deserves 5 stars since chicken is a mainstay of my diet.  I honestly could not distinguish the difference between the duck fat fries and regular fries. For the added heart disease risk, I'd expect these fries to be phenomenal.  That aside, the place is pretty kitschy and has a fun, retro vibe. The man I assume to be Doug (who takes your order) is always friendly and never rushes you while you place your order. What would make it even better would be if it were open on Sundays. The line on Saturdays can make it a bit of a challenge to pop in and grab a bite.
