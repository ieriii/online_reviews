Went early so it was a bit empty when we got there. Service was excellent, except it seemed like the guys wanted to take the plates before being finished. Food was good. Liked the yellowtail jalapeno. Miso was just ok. Pork shank was cooked perfectly, and the rolls were fantastic. Will go back to try more.
