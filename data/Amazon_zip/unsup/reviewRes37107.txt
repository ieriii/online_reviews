This review is strictly for the dining room area. I've been to the bar which is cool, but the food was a bit of letdown.The portions are small. We were so hungry we ended up at the McDonalds drive-thru. I do have to say though that the beer choices are out of this world. Stay for the drinks and avoid the food.!!
