Went for the first time with a group of 8. the meal was just over $11 dollars per person with two appetizers, two veggie dishes and duck, spicy beef, crispy chicken, tea and rice. It was amazing and we all walked away with spicy mouths and full bellies. The smoked tea duck is something else. My boyfriend and I enjoy, nay, love bejing duck and this was a special surprise. The spicy sze chuan beef was indeed, incredibly spicy but so tender and flavorful. I'll be going back for dim sum which my bf says is worth it. Also, does anyone know how to make the spicy shredded cabbage appitizer? Its amazing and I'm looking to replicate it They lost a star for the service. The staff and servers were not friendly, nor helpful and didn't seem to care whether we were having a good time or not. Plus they let some strange guy take photos of us from outside the restaurant.
