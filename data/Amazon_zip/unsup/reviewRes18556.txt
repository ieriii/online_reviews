cute & cozy lil italian BYOB. portions were huge and it was fairly good italian food. not my fav italian place, but def it was worth a try to head somewhere WAY north out of my neighborhood. looking for an inexpensive girl's night out with bottles and bottles of everyone's wine...? then this is a great alternative to quartino, tapas and BYOB tapas spots that ladies frequent...
