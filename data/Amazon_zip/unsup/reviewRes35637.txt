I'm giving Sun Wah 5 Stars based on quality of the food. My friend recommended this place, and we ordered carry-out, which, on a very busy Saturday (there was a line to be seated), our order took less than 20 minutes. The Beef Chow Fun is a personal favorite, and they do it perfect here. And their "small" order is what I would consider a large order, enough to fill up 3-4 people. The Stir Fried Eggplant filled with Shrimp is possibly the tastiest Chinese food I've ever had in my life. The eggplant has a great texture, yet melts in your mouth. I recommend this dish to anyone coming here. Overall, this might be my new favorite Chinese restaurant. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but when you enter, it's gigantic and spacious. I think it's worth a dine-in for next time.
