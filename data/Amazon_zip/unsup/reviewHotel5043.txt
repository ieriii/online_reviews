Great hotel. I just had surgery and was staying here because my doctors office was right across the street. They gave us a nice quite room. The room was nice and clean. The service was good and the food for room service was good and quick. Valet parking is the only option for this hotel, it was expensive but simple (since some parking garages are chaotic). Check out was simple didn't even need to go to the desk. I will be back if i stay in the city again.
