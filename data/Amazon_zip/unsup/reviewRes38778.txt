I have only ordered delivery from this place but I've never had a bad meal. When I moved into the Avondale area I didn't have a pizza place since I was from Edgewater. They popped up and I ordered. The pizza is fresh and the appetizers were spot on. I will continue ordering from them if they keep up this great product. They also have a HUGE delivery area. I moved up north thinking I would be out of the area but I'm not. Super stoked! And their stuffed may take a long time but it's worth it.
