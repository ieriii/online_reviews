i'm being nice here. there were a few problems with this place. first off, we pre-ordered a stuffed pizza so we wouldn't have to wait too long after we got there cuz i was starving. when we got there 15 min later, they said the pie would be done in 20. makes sense, right? breaded mushrooms were spot on. manicotti dinner was not so good. rib eye steak sandwich was dry. i guess it was cheap, but still. by this time i was dyin for something good. it'd been about 20 minutes so i figured it wouldn't be too much longer until the pizza came. but people who came after us got their pizzas and we still didn't have ours. wanted to be patient tho, so kept waiting and waiting and waiting. took about 50 minutes from when we got there, which would've been normal, but we pre-ordered! the only saving grace, besides the mushrooms, was that the pizza was pretty tasty. similar to giordano's but not quite as dry bready tasting. it was actually bordering on kinda watery, but i kinda liked it. if not for the crappy other food and the long wait, the pizza coulda made it a 4. i think i might try to give them another shot. we'll see...
