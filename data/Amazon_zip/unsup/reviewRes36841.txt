I love this place. It offers great thai, good sushi, a nice ambiance, a BYO policy and you get all of this at a very forgiving price. While there may be better places in the city for both sushi and thai--there are none at this price point. Just make sure you call ahead for a reservation. The BYO policy means tables take longer to turn over--making for a long wait on a busy night.,
