My wife and I dined here last weekend with another couple. While I had heard mixed reviews from others who had dined here in the past, our dining experience far exceeded my expectations. While the space is huge, there are enough smaller rooms and nooks and crannies that it still feels like a reasonably intimate dining experience. As well, despite the large space, the attention from our server was fantastic.  Food was very very good. My strip steak was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Appetizer plate (ceviche variety plate) was delicious, though portions were somewhat smaller than what we had anticipated. Overall I would have rated 4.5 stars, though since my expectations were somewhat lower before we arrived, I rounded up to five. We'll be back, and we would recommend to others.
