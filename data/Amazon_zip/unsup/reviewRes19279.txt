I was searching for places to eat in the north center/lincoln square hood and found this place on yelp. After checking out their menu and seeing the quality of beers they carried, I was hooked. My wife and I checked it out on a Sunday afternoon. It had a decent crowd and we opted to sit at the bar. We had good service, nothing overwhelming but never felt ignored as some have stated. I ordered the Maholo burger and my wife had the Strange Famous. I got my fries with truffle oil and she had the sweet and spicy. Food came out relatively quick and warm. Portions are very good size for the price. I enjoyed my burger and fries. The truffle fries were awesome. My wife said her fries were ok. She did not really care for her veggie burger, but she is pretty picky about those. The beer selection does not disappoint and I would come back for that alone. Add that to a good burger menu we will definitely be back.
