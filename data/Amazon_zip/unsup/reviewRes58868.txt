Great servie and great food. My gf and I have been to Sunda a couple of times. Both times we had a terrefic experience. The first visit, we sat at the bar and had some sushi and drinks. The bartenders were great and extremely friendly. The were also completely honest and persuaded me away from one of their "signature" cocktails, saying that it wasn't very good (in the end they made it for me free of charge!!). The second time we went, we took our parents. This time we sat near the back of the place. The wait staff and food was excellant! As a tip - you really need to make reservations if eating thursday through saturday. The bar is a great place to go after work with friends - but make sure to get there early, the place fills up very quick!!
