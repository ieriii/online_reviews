As a Floridian it can be difficult finding a Cuban restaurant that encompasses that irresistible flavor that only Cuban food has. I have been searching for a place that had more of a vegetarian selection.....especially black beans. There's only two places in Chicago who have vegetarian black beans. When I found 90 Miles, not only did they have this to offer, they also have a tofu dinner thats cooked in a creole sauce AND they also have soy beef empanadas!!!! I'm a fan for life, and so happy they were considerate enough to make the soy beef emapandas for us non meat eaters. This restaurant is authentic, quaint and has a very friendly staff. It reminds me of a few places I used to go to in Florida.
