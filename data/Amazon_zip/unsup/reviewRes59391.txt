I love to cook and this is the best source for top ingredients in the midwest.They source from the very best producers in the US and Europe.They usually have three to four kinds of Prosciutto, four to five selections of lox\smoked salmon. The pates are amazing and they even have fresh foie gras in season. They carry White Lily Flower, all kinds of butters, and the cheese selection is marvelous. The fresh meat, poultry and fish is top, top grade. In addition, the little cafe in the back has some of the best food in town.So, go there even if you are not buying groceries but just hungry.Parking is free. Yes it is a bit pricey but it is the very best.
