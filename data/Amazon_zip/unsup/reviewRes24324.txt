Even though my friends and I waited for about an hour and a half, I thought it was worth the wait!  Please note that this restaurant is cash-only and has cramped seating. I absolutely love eating Latino food. . . I ordered the casado with rib eye steak and a mamey shake (mixed berries). Definitely order the oatmeal shake. . . it is a lot more flavorful than you think. I'll have to come back during their off-time!
