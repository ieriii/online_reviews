OK, so that other review was totally right. Vinnie Chase does work the door. Serious double take. Anyway, good was great. Not cheap. And probably not great is you're a picky eater like my husband. I would definitely recommend the farm fresh chicken and the scallops. Unfortunately, the server didn't really explain that their process is very similar to tapas style eating. So really, we ended up ordering strange amounts of food because we were winging it. The beer selection is like something I have never seen before. Mostly imports and a ton of them at that. Unfortunately, the staff is not well educated and didn't help us make any selections. One more neg.....you are almost ON TOP of the people sitting next to you. Really hard to hold a conversation. The meal for three of us ended up taking about 2.5 hours. A little long if you ask me. Although, at least they weren't rushing us out. Food was good but the overall pretentiousness of the locale was a little overwhelming.
