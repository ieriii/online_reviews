I haven't eaten at the similar restaurants in the area yet but Brazzaz delivered on every account. Great food, amazing selection, attentive service. The only thing I can think of that might be a downside, is that our waiter visited the table too much. My advice is take it slow. There's so much good food and I went too fast and got too full. The staff doesn't rush you at all so chill and enjoy.
