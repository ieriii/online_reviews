This review is probably not fair, b/c we had wanted to go to Tango Sur but settled for Las Tablas instead, AND I was going to a Brazilian place a few days later so skipped on the churrasco. Instead I ordered the carne asada, and while it was good and a hearty portion, I found my medium-rare steak not so rare and a bit dry. I'd be interested in trying the matrimonio, but I did have some of my friend's bandeja paisa - in English, the menu describes both as charbroiled Columbian ribeye, but the bandeja was eons tastier - it had some special sauce that the carne asada lacked. The appetizers were not extraordinary...outside the Chorizo - that was awesome! But the Arepa left something to be desired, I can honestly say that Boston Market's cornbread tastes better. The BYOB policy - I'm conflicted. I mean, $8/bottle is not ridiculous, but compared to "free" at Tango Sur....you catch my drift. As far as atmosphere goes, it's definitely very loud, very rowdy, making it difficult to hear past the person next to you, but it's fun. I'd come here again in a big group.
