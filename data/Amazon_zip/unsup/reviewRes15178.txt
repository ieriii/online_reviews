So we went here on my birthday and had a wonderful meal. Service was quick and friendly. They gave us this nice little private booth that was secluded from the rest of the restaurant, quite romantic. Started off with a great fried calamari appetizer. I had the fettuccine alfredo and my boyfriend had the eggplant parm. Mine was amazing his was a little on the mushy side not so great. Then we concluded dinner with a table side bananas foster. It was delicious and they put a sparkler in it for me for my birthday! All in all it was a very pleasant experience and we will definitely be returning there again in the near future.
