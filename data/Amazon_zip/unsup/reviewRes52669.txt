Hot young men in strange pants offering me pound after pound of skewered meat and I still somehow left feeling meh. I went to Fogo de chao a few years ago and was one of my favorite dining experiences but for some reason I didn't have the same experience at Brazzaz. The meat was good but not amazing, along with the salad bar. The waiters were nice and attentive and with a coupon the price was great. I wish I could put my finger on why this place didn't do it for me but I can't. Most unhelpful review ever? Perhaps.
