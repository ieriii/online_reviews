There was a lot of good things about Nana. I thought the service was ok and everyone seemed very nice. Drink list is good and the coffee is Metropolis. The onion rings are the best I have had ,maybe ever. The charcuterie plate was ok but light on the actual charcuterie. I think it is fair to mention that it is noisy in the back dining room. I SAID IT IS NOISY IN....well, you get the idea. I would also caution that care be taken that what you order is not too pepper laden to eat. I am sensitive to the pepper and ordered the barbacoa special. It was very good but I could not eat it due to the pepper.  Overall, a good place and I support the locavore / organic idea Nana promotes. I would go back again and be more careful of the food choice. By the way, I liked the Bridgeport area and see a bright future for the area.
