Once again, a BYOB ethnic restaurant wins me over! I've been going to Indie Cafe for 2 years now and it's never disappointing. They just remodeled and expanded the restaurant so it's even better! They have fast delivery too.  The food combination of Thai and Sushi is a great twist and accommodates everyone. I take all of my guests here and they're thrilled with it too. Be sure to bring your favorite beverage to enjoy the fabulous food!
