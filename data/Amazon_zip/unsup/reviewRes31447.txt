What's not to love about a place where you can eat a million different dishes with your friends and not feel over-stuffed at the end? Sunda offers and extensive menu of asian-fused cuisine that most people choose to share. They do have big dishes you can eat on your own, but it's much more fun to just order a bunch of hot or cold apps and dig in. They have sushi, noodle dishes, and innovative salads that make it easy to try and share. The rock shrimp, blue crab noodle dish, crab cake sashimi are fantastic. They also have amazing mochi in a bunch of great flavors. The atmosphere is pretty happenin on most nights and there is a lot of great seating available.
