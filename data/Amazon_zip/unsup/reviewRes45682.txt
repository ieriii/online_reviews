Good comfort food, eclectic atmosphere, not so great service. Our waitress was a complete airhead. My friend ordered her dinner and substituted vegetable medley for the mashed potatoes and asked for no butter on the steamed vegetables. Her meal came out with potatoes, not veggie medley. Well, they tried to take the whole meal away and we quicked corrected them - there was not need to take my hungry friend's dinner away because the waitress gave the wrong order/the chef made an error. Well, they brought out the vegetables about 10 minutes later...drenched in butter. So we waited another 1 minutes. Its hard to have an enjoyable dinner experience when you get bits and pieces of your meal at a time. And then the waitress had the nerve to say, "Sorry about messing your order up, but it can be hard when people make modifications to the menu", which may have been meant as an apology, but sounded more like she was blaming us.  Really? Is no butter that big of a challenge for you to handle? The waitress ended up giving us 10% as a "promotional discount", but honestly the discount should have been a bit more than that. It was not enough to convince me to return any time soon, even though the macaroni and cheese is pretty good.
