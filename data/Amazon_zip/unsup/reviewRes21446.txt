My girlfriend took me here on a date last night after our first collective Wrigley Field experience. She's been raving about it ever since she moved her in the spring and swears she goes at least twice a week or more. She's still a size 2, so I don't believe her, but I wanted to check it out. We looked like we were about to head to a classy North Side lounge, which was where we were going, but the guys were dicks so we got our hot dog fix on. So yeah, we pull up in her car after what seemed like a endless drive up milwaukee and ordered four super dogs, three orders of fries, and two chocolate malts. MMMMMM! I'm so glad we went here instead of that double date. I like cocktails and lounges, but hot dogs and fries and malts are sooo much better. And we didn't even have to faux-flirt with any wet haired guy. I love how everything's super...it stuck in my vocabulary. Me: "So Athena, do you want to drive back to my super apartment now in Super Lincoln Park?" Athena: "Yeah, let's get some Super whiskey before we super drive back to Super Lincoln Park!"
