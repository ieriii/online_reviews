The food here is always reliably good. As a former resident in the 'hood, it was a go-to spot for the kind of relaxed, affordable dinner out you want close by. I moved further away, but recently returned for a visit to my old haunt. The place has expanded! The once simple and quaint outdoor is now expanded to a covered tent-like structure (think outdoor wedding thingie with asphalt floor) which amplifies sound x about 20 new tables! It is deafening (no exaggeration) on a busy night - and not at all charming. Add to that, one bathroom for all. Really? Standing in line - in the restaurant next to diners - for 15 minutes?? With another bathroom and some sound absorbing stuff in the expansion area (plus a little more work at giving that area some ambience and charm) this loveable place would be much improved.
