My first time in Chicago and I knew I wanted to stay someplace within walking distance from everywhere that I wanted to go. This place totally fit the bill. You're 4 blocks from the Red Line and a block from Michigan Ave, you really do get a great location for half the price you would pay at Four Seasons, which is down the street. The bed was super comfortable, with plenty of pillows and a down comforter. They were still undergoing renovations so that was slight minus on the noise, but considering that I spent most of my time outside in the city, I didn't mind it as much. You do have to pay for internet, but luckily my friend brought her Verizon wireless card so we didn't have to pay for internet. There's a tiny gym on the 2nd floor that opens in the morning so I got in some quick cardio workouts before heading out. All in all, probably one of the better hotels I've stayed at for the price I paid.
