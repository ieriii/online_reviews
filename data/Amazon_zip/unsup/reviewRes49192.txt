This place is trying a little too hard. Very expensive. Entree was basically inedible (swordfish was WAY too crusted in pepper which completely overwhelmed the taste of the fish). The drinks are good and the gorgonzola ravioli/oxtail ragu starter was phenomenal but aside from that, it's meh. Cheese and charcuterie platter was good but overall, there are better places in Chicago. Would recommend if you just wanted to do starters/cheese/wine. Would avoid the entrees.
