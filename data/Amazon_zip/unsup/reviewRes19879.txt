Got there on a Tuesday at 1:20pm. Waited about 10 minutes till I was able to order. Kind of annoying they dont allow carryout. Being a self proclaimed torta connoisseur I had to try it so i waited. I ordered the Cuban style torta and at first glance thought it was small. This was the best I have ever had, super crunchy bun and seasoned very well. did not give a 5th star due to the price point. after all said and done for a torta and a lime fresh water it was 15bucks.
