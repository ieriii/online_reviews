Went with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day. Since moving to Chicago about 2 years ago, i would say this is the best Restaurant I have visited hands down. The food as you can imagine was delicious our waiter was knowledgeable in all the menu items, even suggesting a few to us. We decided to go with the Fixed Priced menu and it didn't disappoint. The only downside to going that route was the amount of food it brought along, 5 courses, if you can consider that a downside. The best part of the meal was the 4th course, which was a grilled cheese sandwich with caramelized onions. Just amazing.
