I was pretty impressed by Mercat, with the exception of one thing: the food had cooled by the time we got it, so it was not served at the right temperature. In every other respect, it was pretty good. We started with a glass of seasonal sangria. It was a white sangria with pear flavors - outstanding. I loved it. I am going to try to recreate it soon. After that, we did the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. The first wine we were served is one of the best wines I have had in a very long time. It was the Gramona Vino Blanco "Gessami" - a mix of sauvion blanc grapes and muscat. The minerality and crispness was a perfect pairing for the goat's milk cheese we were served. Everything we were served was delicious - except the patas bravas (only average - skip them) - but sometimes the temperature was off. Like the flatbread. We were served a flatbread with beef shortrib with amazing flavor but slightly cold temperature. I would love to go back, despite the temperature. Note: we went on a Monday, and a reservation was definitely needed.
