saw this on Chicago's best and it looked pretty good.. the restaurant has a outside patio and the inside of the place was pretty big with a bar also... the place was pretty busy when i went but luckily we got a seat without waiting.. after reading all the reviews, i was waiting for the horrible service.. but instead, we actually got a waitress that was very nice so that's a plus.. i ordered a steak chimichanga which is a fried burrito.. never had it but it sounded interesting and my friend said it is pretty good.. this is the first Mexican restaurant i went to that loads up their chimichanga/burrito with that much meat! usually places has a decent amount of meat in there and TONS of lettuce and beans.. but not here.. the steak quality was good too and wasn't chewy like some places... for the amount of food you get.. it is pretty cheap! their large horchata is like a x-large size too! cant wait to come back and try their other food!
