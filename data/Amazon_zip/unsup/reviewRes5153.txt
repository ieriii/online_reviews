No question about it...this is one of the cooler places in Chicago and its absolutely delicious to add a little cherry on top of the coolness!  The place makes you feel like you just discovered a small neighborhood gem...If you can picture the interesting/unique restaurants in downtown Denver, CO or San Fran, The Purple Pig has that same feel. Although the portions aren't huge, the food is reasonably priced but the wine is on the expensive side I think. All in all this is an awesome place that I would suggest anyone living in or visiting Chicago try and you HAVE TO finish your meal with the cinnamon flavored ice-cream. Ben & Jerry's...step your game up!
