Though a little on the pricey side, this restaurants has absolutely no negatives in my opinion. The salad bar was excellent, the meat was delicious, and the service was absolutely fantastic. I'll definitely come here again when I swing by the Chicago area. The only negative: there is no Fogo in SF!!!
