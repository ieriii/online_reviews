90 Miles is a vibrant, fun place to dine and arguably Chicago's finest Cuban restaurant. I got that from a Cuban source. The food was excellent and a great value. They are also BYOB. I'd go with 4.5 stars overall here - with only slight debits for slowish service, a very loud dining area, and lack of men's room capacity. We sat in front area, where we were barely audible to each other, and I'm glad we weren't in the back.  The portions are large, and the dinner plates range from $14 - $17, which is very reasonable. We had amongst our group: - ox tail dinner - skirt steak dinner - roast pig dinner x 2 - fried pork medallions dinner; this was mine - with large chunks of tender pork, and with just a bit of tasty fat with each chunk We'll be back, and would look to particularly enjoy a meal on a summer evening in their open patio area.  Street parking was relatively easy in the area. They also take Open Table reservations (highly recommended).
