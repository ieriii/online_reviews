Being greek and loving food, when it comes to greek restaurants Its one of the few times I can call myself a connoisseur. What stood out here, was the menu, I couldn't find a single recipe that you wouldn't find in a quality traditional greek restaurant, making this one of the few non rip-off restaurants claiming to have greek cuisine, whilst also having a great range of tastes. The decor (non-trashy), environment, wine list and even the staff where 100% greek. I really thought I was back home for a second. What really surprised me though, was the that the dishes surpassed my expectations, they where greater in quality, freshness and taste than most restaurants in Greece! It matched dishes you've only tasted from Greek grandmas! Apparently the owner goes to Greece twice a year, to further improve his cooking skills and update the dishes. As if this wasn't enough, the price was one third of what you'd pay in Greece. $20-30 per person! Dont think twice about going here, its great, really tasty and healthy food for a ridiculously cheap price for its caliber! + the service was top notch and really fast, what else could you want?
