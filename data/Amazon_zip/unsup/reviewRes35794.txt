Holy crap DELISH! The waitress Laura is the sweetest in the city and the duck blows my tastebuds right off my tongue because it is sooooooooooooo goooooooooooooood. I have eaten here twice, once with my friend D who had veggie fried rice that he said was really good and I had the duck with noodles with big fat rice noodles and I can't get enough of it. Really I can because both times I have eaten here I have ordered that dish and both times I took a box home with me that was the best lunch for the next day. I love this place so much that I took my friend, who has lived in China and Taiwan, here and he said that the duck on rice was exactly like the duck that he ate all the time in Taiwan except Sun Wah also gives you some veggie with the duck on rice. I would eat here everyday if I lived closer.
