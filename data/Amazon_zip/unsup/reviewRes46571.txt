Solid sandwich, salad bar place and we've been many times. Nice beer selection, really good burgers, interesting 70s decor consisting of photos of past servers. The ribs are good also. The 70s music is a little too loud most times.  We went last night for NYE where all food items were half price - can't beat that! Especially, when most places offer their hoity, toity set menus for twice the price that dinner out would normally cost. Hoping that people tipped last night based on what the full price ticket would have been vs. the half price cost. The servers were really busting their tails - it was packed with people still waiting to be seated after 10:00 when we left.
