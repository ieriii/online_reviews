We were extremely happy & satisfied with our stay at the Palmer House Hilton! We got a GREAT deal through http://hotels.com on the room rate. The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. The location was perfect...we were within walking distance of everything (shopping on MI Ave, Millennium Park, Art Institute, Aquarium, Field Museum and train stops). Also, the concierge was super helpful with recommendations for restaurants and directions. The hotel itself is beautiful (the lobby is amazing) and there are lots of areas to sit and meet up with friends. There are two bars located in the hotel...Potter's Lounge was our favorite spot to grab a drink before dinner. There is also a Starbucks on the street level with has a lot of sitting area as well. Honestly, a great hotel!
