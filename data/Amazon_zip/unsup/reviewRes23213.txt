Crazy amazing and delicious. The crepe filling combos are unusual but super delectable, and they come with possibly the yummiest fried potatoes I've ever been lucky enough to eat. I'm a huge fan of eating out, but my husband is pretty indifferent. Usually when I ask how his food is, he says (and I quote) "Eh, it's all right". Here, his response to his crepe? "Really, really tasty."
