This was definitely one of the jewels of the short weekend trip to Chicago. Came to Bonsoiree at around 9pm for the full tasting menu. I originally booked for Saturday but since our flight arrived slightly early on Friday I called and they were able to change the reservation to friday night. Was definitely an excellent meal. I thoroughly enjoyed all but 2 courses. The BYOB policy also allowed us to enjoy a vouray and a pinot noir at a fraction of the cost that other restaurants would charge. My favorite was the halibut marinated in sake in a green curry sauce. The sake made the halibut very flavorful and moist. I enjoyed the dish even though I'm not a big fan of curry in general. The other favorite was the scallop. The creamy sauce was a perfect choice for the scallops. The oyster leaf garnish was also a surprise since I've never had oyster leafs before. The service was exceptional and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was casual/relaxing yet classy.
