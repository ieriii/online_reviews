Wasabi peas in a can?! Oh, Sultan, you know the way to my heart. As the name implies, this place is more than just a ready-made food establishment; it is a Market - a market of the sorts of things you'd imagine exist all over Lebanon: sugar-covered chickpeas, aloe water, dates, figs, almonds, and, of course, wasabi peas (!!). The falafel was, of course, scrumptious. Apparently I'm a total pansy, however, as I thought the "medium" spice option was kinda hot... [blush]. I still ate the entire thing, however (and even scooped up the little bits that had tumbled from my pita to my plate so that nary a crumb was wasted).
