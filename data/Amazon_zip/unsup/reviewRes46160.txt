I've had great food experiences at this restaurant. Portions are huge, and ingredients are fresh. The menu is huge, and making a decision is so hard because everything sounds excellent. I loved the beet and goat cheese salad, the sloppy joe, salmon, the southwestern chicken salad, the chicken piccata, ...I could go on and on. The drawbacks: 1) long waits 2) lots of tourists (due to its location on Michican Ave/Mag Mile) 3) bad acoustics, and so it's VERY loud in the dining room.
