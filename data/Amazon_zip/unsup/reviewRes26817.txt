The pan pizza is a must with caramelized crust!!!! One piece is plenty as well. Atmosphere is friendly and comfy. There was an overwhelming pine sol scent in the restaurant, but at least the place is clean. Semi open kitchen and clean bathrooms a major +. Street parking relatively easy and non metered. Pizza delivered doesn't lose any quality either. ****And there is a M-F 11-3pm special for a 7 inch pan with one topping+cheese and a pop or tap beer for $4.95!!!!! Crazy deal, missed it by an hour, oh well, hope you can make it!!****
