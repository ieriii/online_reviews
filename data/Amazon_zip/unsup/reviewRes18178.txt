Great liquor and beer selection. Awesome food (especially their burgers, but they actually make great salads, too). Good vibes, good crowd. Bad Apple straddles the yuppie/foodie versus down-to-earth bar culture thing extremely well. Knowledgeable and helpful wait staff. The cocktails I've had there have been a bit questionable, but if you're a scotch drinker you'll be well pleased.
