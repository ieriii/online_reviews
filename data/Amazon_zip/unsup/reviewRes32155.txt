DeLiCiOUS!!! I don't know if I can even give justice to how good the food is at Demera. Now obviously I can only speak to the veggie options, but WOW!!  I tried the tomato salad, veggie sambussa's and an assortment of 4 other veggie entrees served on injera. I also had a glass of South African Sauvignon Blanc, which balanced beautifully with my meal. The portion sizes are perfect, or possibly too big, because that bread fills you up fast! We were over stuffed by the end of the meal. The service was friendly and prompt. It also nice to see this corner of Uptown coming alive with tasty options. I will definitely go back!
