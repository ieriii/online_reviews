I love love love when I go to Yolk and it is one of the best places for breakfast in the city and there are several locations. The french toast, cinnamon rolls and pancakes are all amazing. A friend I was with got the make your own skillet and was very pleased as well. Also awesome the coffee and juices. Nothing is worse than sitting down and having someone poor you a burnt, cold or just bad tasting cup of coffee. In fact that usually puts a damper on the rest of the experience, but Yolk's is always yummy and the juices are freshly squeezed. Atmosphere? Yes yes and yes. It's the kind of restaurant that once you sit down you're really in no rush to leave. I would suggest sitting at the bar if you can. The only thing that could possibly be considered a negative is the wait. It's going to be busy if you come during a prime breakfast or lunch time and they're only open till 3. So if you're looking to not wait, get your ass out of bed earlier.
