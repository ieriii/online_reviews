Nothing knockin' your socks off here...great for the business traveler. No, "Oh Wow" factor...but pleasant and comfortable, nice, efficient. Great service. The linens and drapery need to be updated, and the constant changing of the elevators can be a little annoying. Overall, ok...won't plan to stay again.
