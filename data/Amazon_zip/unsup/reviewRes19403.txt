Yelp came through for me as always and I'm happy to say that Coast Sushi Bar is the best sushi I've had in the city! The dark dining room and swanky decor is the perfect spot for an intimate date or a fun night out with friends. Add in BYO beer, wine, and sake? Can't get much better! We started with the Asparagus Beef....holy delicious teriyaki sauce! Just give me a bowl of rice and that sauce and I'll be happy! Next we ordered a few rolls: Nama jalapeno:  A large piece of incredibly fresh salmon with fresh jalapenos-so simple, so good. Spicy Sweet Potato Tempura: Umm....who doesn't love sweet potato tempura?!? Po Boy: White fish tempura, unagi, cream cheese, masago, spicy sauce, scallion, avocado, tempura crumb, eel sauce. Huge! Delcious! White Dragon: The best!!! Shrimp tempura, wasabi tobiko, cream cheese, avocado, scallion, spicy sauce, wasabi dressing, eel sauce, tempura crumb
