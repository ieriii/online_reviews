The pizza is great, but can be a bit inconsistent at times. The regular menu items are almost universally good but it does seem like they used canned mushrooms on the funghi e salsiccia. Either that, or they need to really get some better caramelization on them before using them. The specials are usually good, but a friend had one w/ lardo this past Friday and disliked it. I, on the other hand, had a great appetizer special of mozz & prociutto sandwiched & fried between breaded toasts. Great ! The wait times can be 30-45 mins or less than 5 minutes, even on a Friday. I was there at around 8 this past Friday and we were seated right away. I guess try and stay away from the 6-8 rush hour.
