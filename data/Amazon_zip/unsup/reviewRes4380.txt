Green Mill is one of the top 3 best Jazz places in the city full of Jazz and Blues. This tells you something, does not it? Jazz famous Kurt Ellis and Patricia Barber had permanent gigs there at different times. Patricia is still playing in Green Mill on Mondays. Excellent musicians are assured on Fr/St as well as other days. If you are out of towner, don't forget to ask staff about the place's history. You'll be amazed ... On Fridays and Saturdays it may get too crowded and at times loud. Though management and staff are doing there best to remind the crowd to respect performance. Also, come early if you want to grab a sit ... Enjoy!!
