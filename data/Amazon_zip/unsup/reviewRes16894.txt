Carnivale is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. The decor and ambiance take my breath away.. and the food is fantastic. It's a pricier destination than my standard dinner fare, but the combination of the food and experience make it well worth the price. Highly recommended for business dinners, entertaining out of town guests, or a special night out.
