Definitely a great Brunch. While I wasn't blown away by the beignets, they were complimentary and that started things off well. Their scone is worth every penny and one of the best I've ever had. Everything was delicious, the waiter was informative and the slaughter their own pig so the bacon is fresh! It's a large place and they didn't overcrowd it by squeezing in too many tables, so it was decidedly quieter than other popular brunch places nearby. This place is definitely the place to go in Andersonville.
