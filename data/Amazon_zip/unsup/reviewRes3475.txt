The last time I was there, I mistakenly ordered the BBQ instead of Seoul Sassy (my favorite) and Crisp was kind enough to correct the mistake and give me the BBQ order for free! Talk about great customer service. The manager also came over to make sure we were happy with our meal. I was really impressed and happy to have an extra meal for the next day! The wings can be reheated easily in the oven. Crisp has the best chicken wings I have ever had! They come in a variety of flavors, Asian style. My favorite is the Seoul Sassy which is a little sweet, a tad spicy, and served with fresh green onions and sesame seeds. I am also a fan of the original BBQ which is spicier/hotter. The grade of chicken wings used is great; large, meaty and quality. It's also pretty affordable for 5 wings (plenty for 1-2 people) or 10 wings (more than enough for 2-3 people).  Two caveats: I've never tried the other Korean dishes, and it's important to keep in mind that this is a 5-star WINGS place, not necessarily known for being a Korean restaurant. Also, if you're sensitive to salt you should know that the wings contain plenty of it (and it tastes good).
