We love it som much the first time we ended up having our rehearsal dinner there. The food is always great yet we realized that the best experience is had upstairs our out back. The main floor is very noisy and if you get seated near the back you are bound to get continuously bumped by the wait staff.  If you can get the squash ravioli, chances are you'll be very satisfied.
