The closest comparison I can make to this place is Kuma's Corner. But I have to say the staff rocks at Lockdown!!! Very friendly helping navigate the menu, etc. I can speak to only what I have eaten here so far and can report the Cruelty to Animals burger was awesome. *(Thanks to my friend and Lockdown regular, Hyalker, for the recommendation) Perfectly cooked and a pretzle bun to boot!!! Mac n Cheese came with this dish and was on par with my expectations....nice crust on top but not too much and a hint of "heat" like any good mac n cheese should have. Beer list is impressive and even includes Schlitz on tap. he he I'll update my review as I eat my way through this menu.
