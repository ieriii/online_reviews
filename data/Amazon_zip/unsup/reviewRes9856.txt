As far as Vietnamese food goes, I've had way better. The waitstaff was a little snooty and the seating wasn't very comfortable. My tuna tartar was boring and the monk fish satay was over seasoned. After the bland appetizers I decided to play it safe and have vermicelli with beef, which is a standard Vietnamese dish. It was just okay. My dad had the duck which was good, but came ungarnished and without any side dishes - just a big chunk of duck. It was a little underwhelming especially because we had read all these great reviews.
