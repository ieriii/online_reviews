One word: DELICIOUS! I had went here with my boyfriend to celebrate Christmas before I left to go out of town and the main courses were delicious! I had their filet and lobster and my boyfriend had the crusted filet (although the waitress didn't hear him and gave him a plain filet). This is one of the best steak and lobster I ever had! It was juicy, tender, and delicious! I love the sizzling sound the steak makes when it comes fresh out of the oven! Ah the sound of great food! However, we also ordered the garlic mash potatoes and broccoli au gratin were BIG disappointments for a place that has delicious steak and lobster! The garlic mash potatoes were plain we had to add a bit of salt and pepper and the broccoli au gratin were bland. The broccoli was still hard and the cheese had no flavor. Also this is my second time there and I never got a 1st floor view. Both times I've been here they throw us upstairs. I would like to experience the first floor view one day. Definitely pricey, but it is worth it for a once in awhile meal. About $130 (including tip and tax).
