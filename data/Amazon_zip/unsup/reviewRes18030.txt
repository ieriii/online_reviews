I have now been here twice and believe that I can write this review without any hesitation... Amazing beer list - I think I had 3 different IPA's all on draft last night. We were seated right away and our beer was replaced in seconds after it was finished. Great place to just hang out in a cool location with chill people. Except for the small baby crying in the corner, I think that is a special circumstance. That brings me to burger paradise. Had the Edmund Fig-gerald the first time which if you know me, I'll eat anything with figs on it. Fig jam is a staple in my household. Delicious - perfect pairings on a burger. Last night I had the Red Dragon with some brisket and red pepper sauce and I shoved the whole thing in my mouth. Awesome. This is about two blocks from my house which means I'll be here at least once a week. Delicious.
