My friends and I love it here! There is not one person I have taken here who has not been back again!The food is delicious and affordable and the people are always friendly! Plus, you can't beat the byob policy.I have never been disapointed when I have eaten here (or gotten delivery) and even first came here because, after studying abroad in Costa Rica, I was in search of some delicious Costa Rican food. It was spot on (no surprise since the owners are from there).I LOVE the Casada and recommend it to anyone as well as the oatmeal shake!!
