I think they might be trying too hard. The inside looks great, cozy and warm with the central fireplace, but dinner didn't knock my socks off. I'm glad this was a corporate dinner and I wasn't paying because I would have felt mildly cheated.  Following the whole build it and they will come mentality, they should have actually delivered fantastic food. The salad bar was good, but everything on it was cold, no hot options. The meats at dinner were tasty but most came out cold or room temperature. I realize they need to do the rounds with the skewers of meat, but we had a party of about 16 people. We should have had preference for the hot meats. I think the Salmon wins, but overall I thought "meh".  The best part of the dinner for me was the blood orange mojito. I had 3 of them, in efforts to drown out some of my coworkers, and just to relax after a busy Monday.  I even opted to have one as dessert instead of one of the menu items. Delicious. I kinda want one now....
