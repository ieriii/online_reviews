One of my favorite bars in town. The selection of Belgian beers and traditional Belgian fare is amazing.  Mussels steamed in white ale with frites and aioli, YUM. Also the lobster stuffed squash blossoms were awesome.  The place is always crowded, (hell, my brother an I had the worst seats at the bar but were quite content)
