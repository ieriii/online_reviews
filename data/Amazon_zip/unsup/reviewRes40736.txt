Having been in Chicago for 3 days and all i was eating was pizza and italian beef, vietnamese food was a welcome change. Before a local friend took me on a scooter adventure, he decided to take me to a Pho place by his pad. It was in the middle of the day so the crowd was light. We got seated pretty fast and the service was good. I opted for the soupless noodle dish (vermicelli- combination Bun). The food came out pretty quick and the food was good. Maybe it was all the italian food i had prior but it was really good! I ate it up...slurp!!! Although when we were there, the power went out, i hadnt really noticed the fans had turned off. I think my crunching and slurping of my food drowned out all that drama. Apparently in a couple of minutes, it came on. Oh well. Didnt phase me!!
