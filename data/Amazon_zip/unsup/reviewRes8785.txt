OK - let me put my review in perspective. I''m Mr. Naperville. That means you can add a little over an hour drive to my intro to this place. It was recommended by a friend who lives in this neighborhood. For truth in advertising that drive time influenced my experience. My girlfriend and I had pizzas and salads. The wood burning oven made the pizza tasty, but the prices seemed a tad high for something that I feel I've had many times elsewhere for less. The salads were good - not memorable. The decor was kind of predictable. Black and white pictures of Italians. Could have been at Maggianos or Buca. If you live nearby it's worthwhile. If you're coming a great distance it's good. I would return if we were going to be in the area for another reason.
