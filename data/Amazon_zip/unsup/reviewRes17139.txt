I'm not well versed in Indian food, but all I know is that I totally broke my atkins regiment. Well not totally, but a little because who can turn away naan and rice. They give you naan with an earthy dipping sauce.  I ordered the Tandoori special ( comes with Chicken, Shrimp and Lamb) which comes with salad, naan, rice and a bean like curry. All I can say is it was a LOT OF FOOD and it was tasty.  I'd love to come back one day and try their saag paneer and lamb vindaloo. I'd definitely come back.
