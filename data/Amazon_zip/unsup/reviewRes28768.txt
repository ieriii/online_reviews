This was my second time at Frontera Grill, but with many years in between visits it almost felt new again. When in a foreign city, I hardly ever revisit a restaurant. It is a testament to the food at Frontera to say I would dine here each and every time I visit the windy city. We checked in with the host/manager, a grumpy old man who seemed irritated we were even bothering him for a table. After being seated, the service got significantly better. Our server was helpful and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. We were looking to try one of the famous Bayless moles, and he suggested several dishes. The food was delicious, from start to finish. The server recommended ordering one small plate and one entre per person, but it ended up being too much food. We were eager to try many things, but beware of the upselling. Each dish we tasted was better than the previous, with the highlight being a duck breast in a dark mole made with bananas. Since I practically live in Mexico (San Antonio, TX), I see and eat my fair share of the cuisine. Frontera, however, elevates and gives new meaning to the term Mexican food.
