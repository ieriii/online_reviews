I mean, the best meal ever, hands down. Grant Achatz is a genius. Not only the most innovative food I've eaten, but its by far the best service you will get at a restaurant. Everyone who waits on you (and its a team-effort) is super knowledgeable without a hint of condescension. The sommelier was younger than me, which made me a) regret my own career choice and b) trust him more. You will walk out of here way po', but super full, and in awe of what you just experienced.
