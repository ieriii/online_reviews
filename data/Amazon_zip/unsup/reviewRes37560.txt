I'll put it frankly-- this was my standby "first date" spot for a long time. They have an amazing selection, the dining area is usually quiet enough that we can have a proper conversation, and the menu is delish. I used to live at Clark and Foster and spent at least 5 nights a week over at Hopleaf, grabbing a quick beer on the patio while trying to get work done. The bartenders know their beer and are more than happy to get you educated on some of their smaller offerings. I'd never really eaten there until the last year and once I did that, it was all over. It's close to the 22, so it's super-easy to get to, and I've never left there unsatisfied. The only drawback is the crowds on the weekends and sometimes the snotty clientele-- too-cool-for-school hipsters who act like they're God's Gift because they know about some small brewer in Belgium that you're unfamiliar with. Luckily those are few and far between and the atmosphere is super-welcoming. Besides being an awesome first date joint, it's also a nice place to relax after work or take people who are in from out of town. It's a genuinely different place, but not so far-flung that your conservative, meat-and-potatoes Dad will hate it. It's also not ridiculously expensive so that's a bonus-- though I am putting down price range as $$$, but that's only because once you find a beer you love, you'll want more of it....and then some more :)
