I love this place. I live a few blocks down and have to resist the urge to run over every day. I got the chicken tenders, they were all white meat, so tender and tasty and really filling. I also shared a half chicken with my mom, it was plenty of food although I easily could have eaten the whole thing myself! The sauces are all amazing.
