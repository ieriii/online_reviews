Really good food. Went here on a groupon. You have to like meat to eat here. Everything was cooked to perfection. They serve plantains and yucca with all meals and I found that to be a little too much starch on a plate. Was very good, we will be back. The service was kind of slow though. I'll give it another chance on that.
