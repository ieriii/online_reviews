Been going to this place since i can remember. Authentic, fast , and cheap! Service is decent. and the place is comfy. IT has in past couple of years become extremely popular so sometimes a little crowded so be prepared to wait in line. Parking can be difficult despite them having a parking lot. A nice perk is that this place is open for breakfast with a mexican flavor.
