What a disappointment. I read a lot of reviews before deciding to take my boyfriend and another couple here and I am totally bummed that I chose it. We sat down at our table to be greeted by the most unfriendly waiter. He was so disinterested and unreceptive. We asked that he explain how the menu worked and he looked at us like we were crazy. You know like at Melting Pot or Fogo de Chao they introduce themselves and how the restaurant works and what they suggest etc... We had to ask for things multiple times and every time we said we were ready for the next course he would ask us if we were sure like 3 times. "Are you 100% sure?" "Really?" YES!!!! Throughout the meal the server and his back waiters kept spilling water on us! They would reach entirely over our plates with dripping pitchers and then overfill the glasses till they ran all over the table. The food was really not that great either. The cheese was disappointingly plain, and the salad was so soaked with dressing I could hardly eat it. You cook everything in oil for the entree and can't even eat your veggies raw if you wanted because they are mingling on the plate with raw meat. I honestly thought the chocolate just tasted like melted chocolate chips. Nothing special at all. You also got a very weak variety of dippers for both the cheese and chocolate courses. Just apples, grapes and bread for the cheese then apples, bananas, strawberries, cake, marshmallows, and pineapple for the chocolate. The Melting Pot gives a far superior selection! In terms of the price I think if the food and service was actually good it might have been reasonable. I would not return to this restaurant or recommend it to anyone! Go to the Melting Pot. They have great attentive, friendly, personable servers and a much better selection of fondues and dippers. To top the night off we realized on the way home we were never served our coffee!
