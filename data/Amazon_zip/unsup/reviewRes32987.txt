Hmmmm. I must admit this was truly a disappointment for me. After reading the reviews and excited about my Yelp food selection while I vacation this was a firework that just fizzed. The wait is extremely long with no seating, just a nasty dirty floor. The service was just a bad as the seating. Once we were finally seated, 15 minutes later someone comes with water. Then we waited another 25 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. Not passing up the chance for him not to come back for another 15-20 minutes I placed our order at the same time. 20 minutes later the server brings our drinks.  Needless to say, the hubby and kids were starving and lost complete patience while waiting for the food. The food was slightly cool when were received it so overall, for the service I have to give Yolk 10 thumbs down. (That is two thumbs per family member.) My hubby's food was actually pretty good, his omelet, though cool, was cooked perfectly. My pancakes on the other hand were less than specular, I ended up leaving them and I truly dislike wasting food. My eggs were rubber like and cold. My kids had the Oreo pancakes. They actually love the pancakes stuffed and topped with Oreo crumbles. Yolk was very generous with Oreo crumbles which was a big hit with the kiddos.  All in all, I believe that this is a tourist place and definitely a hang out for college students in the area. If you have the time and the ability, there are far more better places to have breakfast in Chi-town and you can pass this one up.
