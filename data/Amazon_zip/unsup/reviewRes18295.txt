Came here on the suggestion of a drunken bridesmaid. So, you know the recommendation was legit! Upon entering I had the pleasure of being greeted by an Aussie maitre d. I was kind of thrown for a loop when I heard his accent. Immediate thoughts of bad British cooking came scampering off the rafters of my anglophilic and critical bin of memories from my trip to the UK. Yes I know the difference, but the cooking is about the same, minus some marisupials and turtles on the menu down under... Anywhooooo, was astounded at the menu of cocktails, whiskeys, scotch, and other embodiments of ethanol. Really a class act and served to you buy a sassy and cute bartender, Mandy. If you're reading this, sorry if I misspelled your name. I love you! She's was the resident mixologist, crafting some very strange colored drinks; they were amalgamations of the different syrups, spirits, and carbonated goodness. That was entertainment in itself. Much fun and I took notes. The food menu is just as impressive. With burgers sporting different names from that other "beary" place that serves good dead cow sandwiches, but just as interesting, it took me quite a while to decide on what I wanted to finally ingest. I came to the healthy conclusion that something greasy, medium rare (they got it quite right, actually), served with a side of sweet potato fries in their own homeade catsup (whatever spelling you want) would be a good compliment to my scotch laced cocktail. I was surprised and overjoyed to get suckerpunched in my mouth like that! I'll do it again I tell ya! Sure it is just a tad overpriced for the serving sizes, but then you're paying for the knowledgeable waitstaff who actually know what the hell they're doing in terms of customer flow and mixology. Go here when you tire of ditsy coed waitresses flashing their bits in return for your hard earned plata, you'll be glad you did!
