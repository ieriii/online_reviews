Exorbitantly pricey... For $103 ($51 per head) for two entrees, we got 2 shrimp, three small cubes of beef tenderloin, three tiny pieces of chicken and vegetables(sliced onions, peppers and mushrooms). Cappuccino which is supposed to come with the meal was charged extra. Way too pricey to come home hungry!
