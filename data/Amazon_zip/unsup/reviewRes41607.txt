I love Vietnamese food and Tank was top notch. It may or may not earn the coveted fifth star on a return visit. We arrived on a busy Saturday night and were seated quickly and the service was efficient, but not particularly charming.  We had a curry and a pho and both were really tasty. The curry was flavorful with just the right amount of spice, although we spiced it up with more chili. The pho was a steamy bowl of goodness. And our pork egg rolls were crispy and not greasy at all. We also had the lime drink with ice and club soda and it was refreshingly delicious! I think places like Tank have character, they're not trying to be cute or even particularly friendly, but they get the job done with great food at a super price.
