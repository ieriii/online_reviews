me and my boyfriend went there around 10:30pm.. the atmosphere was very mexican and i loved it.. I loved the pre-appetizers..the salsa was so good and they also gave some kind of beans with chicken.. and it was amazing.. the pickled vegetables were good as well. I ordered a hot chocolate and it was great as well... But why three stars? because the entrees are not that great... I took the risk of ordering a menudo, which i've never tried before.. one of my friends told me that i should try menudo.. so i did without even reading the menu.. well people might like menudo but it's not for me.. i knew right away when i looked at it that it was made with beef stomach.. but i didn't mind since I like trying new dishes.. but i couldn't take more than three bites.. so I gave up on that menudo and started to eat my bf's meal.. i think he had fajitas combinada.. but it wasn't that great either.. may be i should try something else next time.. The servers were very friendly... again I loved the hot chocolate :D
