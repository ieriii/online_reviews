My wife and I dined at the Kinzie Chop House this past Monday for my wife's birthday, and by far, this is one of the best dining experiences we have had in a long time. From the relaxing, fun and engaging staff at the bar, to the extremely friendly and knowledgeable host and wait staff, this was a special evening and dining experience we will always remember. The food was perfect, the staff is not pushy or snobby, and the location is perfect. This was the best prime rib I have ever had, melted right in my mouth. My wife had the fillet, and it was also perfectly cooked and cut. The attention to detail is next to none, and the staff even prepared a custom dessert, with my wife's name on it for her birthday. Street parking near downtown you can not beat it. I definitely rate the Kinzie Chop House as one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! A must for a special occasion, or if you are out to impress, or even out for the best steak you could find around.
