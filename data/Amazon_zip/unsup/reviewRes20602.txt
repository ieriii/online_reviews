Let's get the bad stuff out of the way: I had to attempt getting into Rick Bayless's new place twice. I made the mistake of showing up at noon on a Saturday, when the line was out the door. When I came back around 6, we only ("only") had to wait in line about 45 minutes. I would suggest a more traditional restaurant-style sit-and-order protocol ... Or, take orders from people up to a certain part of the line. Or give out free chips (as it stands, the complimentary club soda is a huge plus). Another reviewer here mentions that you can order drinks and apps in line, but no one there offered to take an order from us ... Now on the to the food and drink ... 5-star food. Excellent bread, fresh and well-seasoned veggies, and, according to my friends, freakin' amazing pork belly. I ordered the "Woodland Mushroom" torta and some chips. It's the only fully-veg option on the menu, and I was expecting a soggy, balsamic-coated, garlicky mess. Instead, I had perfectly sauted mushrooms that were nice and earthy, a mild goat cheese, and perfectly toasted bread. The salsas were good, if a bit mild, and the guacamole was a nice touch--also mild, but flavorful. I had the chocolate espresso as a dessert, and it didn't disappoint.  Bayless uses only local and--when possible--organic ingredients, even going so far as to list out the various farms and cop-ops he uses to stock the restaurant, and this really appeals to me. It's worth an extra star ... but it loses one for the service setup.
