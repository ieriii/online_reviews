I love to run in the mornings and yes sometimes do get hungry really fast.I stopped here with my girlfriend and we ordered, 1 french toast, a bowl of oat meal and 2 glasses of orange juice.and maybe we were just a little in a hurry and waiting 10 minutes for the orange juice to show up may have felt like 20 minutes, but 10 minutes seriously? It didn't seem as if the wait staff cared if we were here or not. the food was ok, service terrible. and the music was way too loud for an enjoyable breakfast
