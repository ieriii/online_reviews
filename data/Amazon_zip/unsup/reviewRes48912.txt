It feels like almost every day I think of the Publican with love. The bavarian mustard that comes with the weiswurst takes the cake as the best condiment seved alongside any dish I've had this year. The whole dish was perfection. Also, the hanger steak & eggs with a mimosa makes for a perfect brunch. The service is great, coffee is great and parking is easy. What's not to love? I guess I don't have to go into extreme detail given how many reviews there already are of this place. Just know that it lives up to the hype in every way and becomes an addiction.
