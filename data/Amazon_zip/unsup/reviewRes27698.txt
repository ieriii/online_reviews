Pequod's is truly a unique spot with great pizza. thin crust is very good but even if you're ant-deep dish, you should try pequod's deep dish. it has carmelized crusty cheese all the way around the pie, just the right amount of toppings and a thick crusty base layer of bread. many other deep dishes from other restaurants pale in comparison.  Their appetizers (sticks, zuccini, shrooms) are right out of the bag but they show up hot and the portions are good sized.  service is good, often younger staff members who can get a little swamped cuz the place is usually hoppin, but their pleasantness makes up for the occassional "two minutes on empty" beer glass.  one of my favorite pizza places in the city.
