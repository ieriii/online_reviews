Its a little late for me to write this review since the last time I went to The Publican was last year. However, I still remember how delicious the food was and how I had an awesome waitress and of course a good time. First off we had several things, we started off by ordering the Serrano from their meat category that was about $12. Then we went onto the main dishes, I had Country Ribs, which were delicious, the meat was tender and juicy that was $23 for a full order. Carloota (My Hub) ordered some duck dish which was OK but not all that ( I also think its not on the menu anymore) that was about $20. He also ordered a dish called Blood Sausage, I didn't try it but he said it was so good, that was $17. The last dish we ordered was Potted Rillettes, that was really good. It is pig pate with a mix of raspberries and it comes with pieces of sourdough bread to spread it on top. Very good. I will definitely come back to The Publican, to try more dishes and to try their seafood. I recommend this place for a date night, friends night, anniversary's or just to dine out. Its a great place, friendly service and great food.
