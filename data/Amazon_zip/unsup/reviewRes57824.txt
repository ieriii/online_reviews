The main problem I had was no refills on iced tea. This was not communicated on the menu or by our server.  The glass was 90% ice with little tea. The server would bring another one which we thought we were getting great service. Turns out when we were presented with the bill the iced tea's COST MORE than our meal.I will not be back until they change the policy on refills or at the very least make it clear that you are charged per glass. I have never been to another restaurant that does not give free refills on tea.
