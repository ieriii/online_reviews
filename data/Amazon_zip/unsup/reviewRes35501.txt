Come on shaws! What the, hey?! I was so pumped about visiting you when I heard about your oyster royster business. My friend and I ditched the whole tent thing since it was rainy, there was a $10 cover and you charged he same prices. When we arrived, you were hoppin.' We headed for your oyster bar, since we had really only come to have a couple beers and suck down a couple slimey suckers. However, the bar was packed. The waitress asked if we were having full dinner service and silly me, thinking she was going to tell us we should go to the other side if we were, told her we were indeed only oystering. She then proceeded to tell me that the oyster BAR tables were reserved for full dinner...Well then what the hell is the other side for?!? dessert?! I kept my cool and my friend and I finally, after running between the oyster and main bars and hoovering over people for 20 minutes, got a table in the main bar. The oysters were great, the beer was over priced and the I loved the popcorn shrimp. Unfortunately, none of that is a recipe for a repeat customer, especially when 4 appetizers and 4 beers cost over $90!
