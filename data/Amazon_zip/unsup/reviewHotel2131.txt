We stayed at the historic tower and I can definitely see why it is called historic. The pipes in that building are so old, every time I shower it sounded like something one of the pipes would burst any second. Also the air conditioner sucked, we had it on the lowest settings but the room would never get cold. Only pros about this place is the location.
