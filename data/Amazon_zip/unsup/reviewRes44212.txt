For our finally mid-day bite in Chicago - this one on day two - we opted for an older member of the culinary scene that I'd actually walked into once prior during the Renegade Art Fair but neglected to buy from due to the line; Wicker Park's own Alliance Bakery. Again scoring free parking and making our way to the shop with ease as hipsters and families alike dined on the sunny patio a stop at the window was mandatory first simply to witness the masterful cakes ranging from Green Eggs n' Ham to Macaron towers to three tiered wedding cakes. With the doors open letting in a cool breeze (and letting out the wonderful smells of butter and vanilla) we next made our way in to see what Chef Peter Rios and a team of youngsters (both in the kitchen and at the counter) had on display and after a few tough decisions we emerged from the shop to enjoy our choices on the patio.  Beginning first with the French classics, my mother selected two Macarons - one Blueberry Cheesecake and the other Passion fruit chocolate - both textbook in texture with a crackling shell giving way to lovely filling, but the Passion fruit Chocolate so cloyingly sweet that between two of us the $2 cookie went unfinished. Thankfully the Blueberry Cheesecake fared much better. Moving next to two of the standards by which I judge a bakery my aunt's and my selection were a Red Velvet Cupcake and the Dulce de Leche Bread Pudding. Beginning first with the cupcake, a $3.50 selection with good notes of cocoa and a tangy cream cheese frosting started out with a good base, but was unfortunately a bit dry - so much so that when my aunt took a bite the back half fell off landing directly on her chest; a comedic event to be sure, but not exactly the way a cupcake should be remembered. Moving next to the Bread Pudding which was served in a small tin topped with a sugar lacquered strawberry and powdered - it was dense and it was sweet, no more and no less but thankfully only $2.50.
