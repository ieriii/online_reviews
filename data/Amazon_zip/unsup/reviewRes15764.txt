Once upon a time, a soon-to-be married gal and her gay friend decided to go out for drinks on a Friday night. Instead of their usual haunts (Lincoln Square, A-ville, Uptown), they donned their hipster costumes and ventured out to the foreign land that is Wicker Park/Bucktown.  After exiting the Damen blue line stop, the gay friend followed his instincts to a strange graffiti-ed wall and opened a hidden door. Suddenly, the gal and gay friend were in a concrete passageway with a velvet curtain at the end. Stepping inside the curtain, they were met with a strange scene: high backed velvet chairs, very dark room, hushed conversations, old fashioned looking bar and chandeliers. The two felt as though they had been transported to another time and place. After sitting down, the two pondered the drink and small plates menu, and after much deliberation, selected their pricey cocktails and a pork shoulder flat bread. They decided that cocktails made with egg whites were an ingenious creation, and proceeded to drink 2 each while devouring their flatbread. The Juliet and Romeo cocktail was their favorite, as was one featuring whiskey and, you guessed it, egg whites. Slightly tipsy, the gal and gay friend paid the tab and wandered out of the bar, slightly shocked at their return to the brightness of the outside street. They vowed to go back when they needed, once more, an escape from the reality of the world. And egg whites.
