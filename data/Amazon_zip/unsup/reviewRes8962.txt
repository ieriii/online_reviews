Shame on me for only ordering delivery from Noon O Kabab. Yet, I continue to order because it's delicious Persian, and too cold to walk over in the winter. Everything I've ordered has been tasty, only problem, there's never any leftovers, it's just that good. Some of my favorites - the hummus, both white and dill rice are outstanding, Eggplant plate, Veggie mix curry, Loobia Polo. You really can't go wrong with anything you order. We had our family over for the holidays, and their 2 kids wouldn't eat anything almost the entire week they were with us. We ordered from here on their last night, and I swear the kids ate more than we did. They devoured everything! Once Spring arrives, a long walk to NOK is in order to check out the dining room, can't wait.
