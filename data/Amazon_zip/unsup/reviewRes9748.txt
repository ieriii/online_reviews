Le Colonial used to be one of my favorite restaurants. The atmosphere is first rate. However the last three times my wife and I dined there with friends, the experience was sub-standard. Service--average. Think about the fact that the menu is presented in plastic like a Greek Coffee shop. There's the tip-off. The barbecue pork was sinewy strips of pork (low cost meat versus a prime section of pork), served on white rice, and backed on half the plate with lettuce. No dressing. Just lettuce. For at least $20 ala carte. Are you kidding me? Caveat Emptor....let the buyer beware. This is an average restaurant masquerading as a high-end elite establishment. Good ONLY as a bar for drinks.
