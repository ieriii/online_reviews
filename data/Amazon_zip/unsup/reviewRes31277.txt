Service was excellent!!! We had reservations for 9pm, got there a little before schedule and was seated right away by a very friendly lady. Our waitress was very helpful when we couldn't make any menu decisions. I had the petite filet and it was very tender. I usually eat my steaks with a little bit of A1, but no need for that here! The lobster mashed potatoes are definitely one to try. Did I mention that the service was amazing? My water glass was refilled after almost every sip!
