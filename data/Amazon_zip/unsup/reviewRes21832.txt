This food really is as good as it gets. First and foremost for the environmentally and humane treatment conscious, as I am, the meat is all grass fed pasture grazed animals, while the dairy and most other ingredients are local. The food is incredibly tasteful, and even on a busy saturday night, our wait was no more than 30 minutes, and worth every second. Definitely try it out, enjoy the fresh ingredients and guilt free eating.
