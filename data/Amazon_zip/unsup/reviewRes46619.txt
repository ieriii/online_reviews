RJ's is like an indie Applebees meets Cheeseburgers in Paradise. The place has charm, but the food wasn't anything spectacular. The salad bar looked most excellent, but who wants to pay $10.95 for a salad? Not me, sorry. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to be entertained at dinner, but I think it's more of a one time thing rather than becoming a regular staple in my life.
