Wow this place was fantastic!! I went on a Sunday night at 8 and it was totally packed, so I was glad we had made a reservation. I got the 4 cheese ravioli with vodka tomato cream sauce...amazing. We also shared some yummy bread and calamari, and the waiter recommended the perfect wine. At the end we had a flour-less chocolate lava cake with vanilla gelato....also amazing. Definitely recommended, just make a reservation!
