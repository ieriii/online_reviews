BEST STEAK OF 2011 Mastro's served me my best steak of 2011.  Every moment from start to finish was perfect. The meal started out great as I loved the the dark, lively dining room with live music and their piping-hot pretzel rolls. Things got better as my gigantic Manhattan arrived. Not only was it delicious, they left the shaker at the table which contained enough for 1-2 more pours.  On to the main event. My ribeye was absolute perfection. It arrived on a plate of sizzling butter, well-seasoned, and the definition of medium rare. To gild the lily, we asked for some grilled onions (not on the menu) and they willingly obliged. Paired with their crack-infused creamed spinach and creamy mashed potatoes...I was in heaven. Unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert, but I'll definitely give the butter cake a try on my next visit.
