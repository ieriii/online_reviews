Looking for wonderful sushi? Perhaps some tasty Thai? Grab a bottle of your favorite beverage and head this way for both. I've tried many different items and have no complaints over any of them. The sushi rolls are huge, delicious, and presented well! Get a few and share with your dining companions because there's plenty for everyone. The Thai dishes are flavorful, and the spicy dishes really have a nice kick. This is a perfect setting to go out with a small group of friends or take a date. However, don't plan on completely intimate conversation on a busy night because the tables are fairly close together. The good news is that everyone around you is very likely enjoying their food as much as you, so they probably won't pay attention to anything you're saying. Your wallet will appreciate this place! When asked about sushi close to my neighborhood, this is my destination. So, drive, walk, or hop off the red line at Thorndale and I'll meet you there!
