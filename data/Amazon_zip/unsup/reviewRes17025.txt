We went here yesterday and it was great! First of all, lets talk about the service. Everyone was super friendly and polite. It was also absolutely impeccable. The moment we were finished with a plate, it was taken away. And even though it might sound like this was intrusive, it wasn't at all. They had the perfect balance of being attentive but not overly so. After we were done with appetizers, a knife that we used for the appetizers was on on a clean plate. Our server took both the knife AND the plate and gave us new ones. Such a small action but shows how dedicated our server was. The food came out super fast which made me so happy. I believe another reviewer said that it came out too fast, which is a complaint I've never heard before. We never felt like our food coming out fast was pressure to hurry up and finish our meal and I truly believe that the staff at Carnivale just wants to provide great fast service. We started off with the blueberry mojito. Mmmm!! I am not a big drinker because I admit that I'm weak sauce but that was delicious and the perfect sweetness. For appetizers, we had the guac, the empanada and ropa vieja. The guac was great as usually and the empanada completely satisfied my empanada craving that Nacional 27 and Las Tablas could not satisfy. My favorite is still the ropa vieja as it has a very unique flavor to it and is just so scrumptious.  We split an entree of pernil and although it seemed a tad bit overcooked, it was still very good. We had the espresso flan for dessert that had ice cream and caramel popcorn on top. Sounds a little different but the popcorn complemented the espresso flan very well. I liked the other flan that I had better before but this was good in its own way too. Overall, wonderful service and great food. I tend to stay away from pricier restaurants as I feel like there's so many good cheap eats everywhere but this is one restaurant that you'll see me coming back again and again.
