I love Demera so much, I work right nearby and have passed it about a million times and finally decided to try it and I'm glad I did because it is outstanding! The food and service are great. We ordered the meat and veggie messob. The injera seemed about the same as every other Ethiopian place but the meat and veggies seemed just a little bit better. There was a little bit less food than at other Ethiopian places but there was definitely still enough.  We also got the sambusa sampler which was great.  It is pretty inside and quiet. I think it's fit for foodies and a neighborhood gem even though there are so many Ethiopian places in the area. We went there for restaurant week and they had a special menu, it is a great place for a date or a special occasion!
