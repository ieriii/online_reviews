Lets face it guys... Korean food in Chicago is just not that great. It seems like Korean food is JUST catching on so hopefully this will encourage better Korean restaurants to open up. Especially with the success of San Soo Gap San, Cho Sun Ok, and others, it's apparent that there is a bigger market for Korean food than previously thought. With that said, San Soo has solid authentic Korean food with reasonable prices. I prefer this place over all the other Korean restaurants in the city mostly because it's 24 hours and I used to come here after a night of drinking with friends... nothing beats having yook gae jang to cure your hang over. As for the quality of the food... it seems to have gotten worse since they got busier. Come here for above average typical Korean food... but not for the pot stickers. If one more person yelps about how San Soo has great pot stickers, I will go mad. It's like saying the chips and salsa at Chipotle is amazing.
