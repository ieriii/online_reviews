I love sushi and this place. I took my girlfriend here on our first date even though she had never had sushi before and now she begs me to go here. Its a BYOB which makes it an awesome place to have a romantic place to have a fantastic meal and a bottle of wine. Or if you prefer the man date and just like sushi, I have even seen some bachelors sling a 24 pack in here and bro it up. Hey, I can't hate on em when I'm there because they know good food. It's a combination of mostly Sushi and Thai food that leaves you wanting more. So don't worry if you don't like raw fish, there are plenty of choices on the Thai side that will help you out. For starters, get some rolls of your choosing (I suggest the Philly or vegas rolls). move on to the main dishes and go for some curry plates is my reccommendation. Hot n Spicy is always done nicely for me. I have never tried any of their desserts so I can't give an honest opinion on what it would taste like. The atmosphere is what you would expect it to be like...trendy. I saw the movie Lost in Translation and thought about going to Indie. I never thought I would say watching a Bill Murray movie would make me want raw fish, but when you think about it they do both stink if you wait too long to consume. The music they play makes you feel like you sat through one long song that reminds you of swimming underwater. The atmosphere relies heavily on uncomfortable looking furniture and dark mysterious lighting. The wait staff is usually very nice and happy, but sometimes takes a long time to bring out your order because they have a small kitchen and smaller staff. Be patient though, the food is awesome. The 20 bucks a full meal and tip, you can't go wrong with trying this place out. Once you have this, you will pull a Jeremy Piven and eat way too much of it.
