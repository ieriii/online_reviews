One of my fave places in Chicago! The bone marrow is the best! Also, the pork lion, brussell sprouts (no really, its good), and the chicken thigh. They also have a great, fresh variety of cheeses and meats. The desserts are okay. There is a great alcohol menu. The service is as attentive as it can be. They are always busy and its a small seating area. The bus boys are always helpful and clear everything quickly so you can usually get someone's attention. The restuarant is small. So there is often a wait.
