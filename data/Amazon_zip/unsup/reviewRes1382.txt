Wow. Hot Doug's is fast approaching 1000 reviews and he is maintaining 4.5 stars. I think that is about all the encouragement you need, right? This joint serves up the greatest hot dogs and sausages anyone has ever had. Feeling conservative? Just go with a dog and you'll be happy. Feeling more adventurous? Maybe you should try out an ostrich or rattlesnake sausage...whatever is on the "game of the week"! If you're there on a Saturday I recommend going with the duck fat fries. They're worth the extra coin. Even if this weren't the greatest hot dog joint in the world I think Doug's smiling face and positive attitude would be reason enough to go back again and again and again.
