This place has a very special place in my heart (umm, and stomach) just because that's where we do our routine weekly Sunday brunch (and analysis of the week) thing with my best buddies. It's almost sinful to skip this or the week goes bad:) We usually go in our PJ's and it's totally OK. If you're a bit late, you might have to wait for a bit. The service is quick, brunch selections are good (I'm happy with my eggs fiorentine), they have fresh grapefruit juice (umm, if you are one of few people who can't live without it, it may be an issue not to get it on Sunday morning), they have mean french toasts, and Chicago Reader. The place is a bit stuffed, tables on each other, but nobody really cares on a Sunday brunch, right? Plus, it might get really interesting sometimes to overhear what the couple on the next table are discussing (well, everyone likes that once in a while, admit it.) It's always packed, but they never rush you to get the check. I've never been there except brunch time, but heard that they have great wine. Overall - this is one of places that will always be close to my heart in Chicago!
