This place is a great place for a date. I came with a couple friends, and as I looked around the dining room, I would say around 90% of the tables around me were on dates. The atmosphere caters a romantic mood. We came here for the tapas Tuesday. I got the ribs (mlik & honey), the pasta, and the pumpkin special (october 2011).  The pumpkin special was the best out of everything. I didn't really like the pasta- (watery?). The ribs were delicious, but I'm from the south, and the sauce style is not the same. However, I enjoyed them thoroughly.
