At Hot Doug's, hot dogs are the beside the point -- the dogs are just foils to the inventions on top of the sausages. The excellent Jamaican jerk, steak and alligator "hot dogs" are noteworthy because of the creative flavors on top. That said, the 2.5 hour Saturday wait simply to eat the Fri / Sat-only duck fat fries was not worth it. Go during the week, where you can have the dogs sans the line.
