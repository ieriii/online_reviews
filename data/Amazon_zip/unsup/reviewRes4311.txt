Oh snap, I need to re-apply my red lipstick! Yes, this was my first thought as I walked in the door. It's rare that a place lives up to my expectations--especially when it's a sizzlin' hot speakeasy straight from Al Capone's day. But the music was hot, the drinks were cold, and the ladies were lovely! Before I get too corny, let me stress I was visiting from Dallas, where our smoky jazz scene leaves much to be desired. So I was just thrilled to be around sloe gin fizz, men in zoot suits, and lots of hair grease. Being the cheap bastard I am, I was a little disgruntled to shell out 12 bucks, but honestly, it's worth it. Where else can you see an amazing live show in a beautiful club like the Green Mill with a (mostly) awesome audience? (By awesome audience, I mean that the people were old and polite--my favorite combination.) The only things I would do differently? Wear a fabulous vintage dress, bring a gentleman to dance with, and get there early! We got there right when the show started, and all the tables were already full. Trying to dance, stand, drink a cocktail, and look suave is not easily done. A beautiful place to wax poetic about the good ole' days...
