Ok I would say that I am really disappointed about Frontera, the reason is because I wanted to eat so bad in this restaurant since the longest, unfortunately my visit two weeks ago was a waste of time and money, the guacamole is good, however the mole enchiladas and the taquitos de pollo tasted really really bad my friend and I couldn;t eat our food since the chicken tasted HORRIBLE and it was kind of black ..at the end we wasted almost $80 dollars.. so sad.. =/
