For my Philly folks, who are already way familiar with how awesome Garces is - It is Amada in Chicago with a great pork belly dish. The bacon-wrapped dates are delicious. The ham/chorizo croquettes did not really impress me. The Holland pork belly(Tocino Con Cidra) - hot damn this was great. I see why it is the signature dish at Mercat. This is a tender, amazing dish with a crazy-good glaze. Warning - it is a small dish(but you should be expecting that at a tapas place). Protip: If you are visiting from Philly, they will not accept your Garces Group card. Bummer.
