Met some friends for dinner a few weeks back and although the food was tasty and fresh I would not return unless it's a special occasion. Yeah it's a cool set up and the service was great but the food was in tiny portions. I know it's not the kind of place to gorge yourself but I'm kinda fed up with the whole "lets see how tiny and elaborate we can make our food" places. We all ordered a few things and shared but overall Ive had better food and for a better price. The duck was really nice and the roll was good but the steak was a bit chewy. I just was not impressed although I am probably not their target clientele. Like I mentioned I didn't pick the place. Just not into spending $50 on good meal. For that price it should have been outstanding. Music was good.
