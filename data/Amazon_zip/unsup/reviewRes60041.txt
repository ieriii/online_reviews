Delish. I know sometimes it's BYOB, not sure if it's just the weekdays. But their food is very good. I LOVE THEIR SAUCES! and their portions are pretty large so come with a heavy appetite. If u don't do BYOB, don't fret, their mojitos are also super yummy! I prefer the squid over the shrimp but that's b/c it's harder to find that type of squid whereas shrimp is more prevalent at restaurants.
