Not good for kids, huh? Well, I guess no other kid is like me then! I ordered the chestnut ricotta ravioli and even if I'm not like any other kid, NO kid can pass up on dessert! With that in mind, I also ordered the chocolate ganache cake and oh my god. It was all great. The pasta was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of chestnut mixed with the ricotta. The carmelized onions, at first weren't exactly my thing, but the more I ate the more I liked them. As for the cake, normally I like moist cakes, and this cake wasn't very moist. It wasn't DRY, but you know.... But this was perfect because the ganache and the vanilla whipped cream, and even the frosting balanced it out beautifully. It wasn't too sweet, and it was very ark chocolate-y. Love, love, love! 10/10! 5 stars! 2 enthusiastic thumbs up! ;)
