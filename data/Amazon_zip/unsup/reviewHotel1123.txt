This is a first-class hotel all the way. We stayed here and I got engaged to the fabulous Kate C. at the Fairmont Chicago. I'm just going to dock it one star for their false billing. They billed me for 5 drinks from the mini-bar and I didn't even have a key to it.When I called down to dispute it they were quick to apologize and "we'll take it right off your bill." Made me wonder if that's just standard operating procedure to sneak it by the unsuspecting few. I doubt it is but buyer beware. Anyway, outside of that everything was first-rate. We had drinks and delicious cheese at the lobby bar. They have a cheese flight to go along with an extensive wine list. It wasn't cheap, but, hey, it's the Fairmont. The rooms were spacious with full-HD tv's. Internet was extra but we didn't use it so, who cares. Oh yeah, no in-room coffee maker was also a negative. You'd think they could provide that if they're doling out robes and rain showers. The bathrooms, btw, were some of the best I've ever been in in a hotel. We will absolutely go back here...and they better not bill me for those drinks.
