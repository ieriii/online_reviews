We love this place! Have been coming here for years and they never disappoint. It has the charm of a diner with the hustle and bustle of the wait staff and the cozy atmosphere of a chic urban cafe. Our faves are the lox platter (one of the more ample ones in the city - and for a great price!) and the huevous rancheros (best hangover cure out there). The al fresco seating provides great people-watching in the summer. Perfect place for catching up with friends or a breakfast date. Highly recommend!
