Well, the name may throw you off. Simply It does not specialize in silver tea seats or modern couches. It is a Vietnamese restaurant and Simply Awesome! This restaurant is definitely a jem. It is the kind of place you meet a friend you haven't seen in awhile and want to impress. Oh, (fill in your name) this place is so cute, the food is authentic and it's cheap! Nice work! That's when you nod at the owner who treats all his customers like old fishing buddies. The owner and his family are the Vietnamese version of the Cosby's. I felt like a regular on my first visit there. My friends who frequent the restaurant have gotten to know the owner and the menu very well. Today the owner sent them away with a bag of fresh bing cherries. Now some restaurants may send you away with some spring rolls. Not this guy! He's giving away his groceries from home. This was only after he treated us to fried bananas. Try the curry, fried rice and clay pot chicken! Make it a girl's night and BYOB. There's something about holding chopsticks that make all conversations better.
