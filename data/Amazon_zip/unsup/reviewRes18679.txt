Good, but not worth the hype. Food is solid, but what went above and beyond were their churros and chocolate drinks, which were unlike anything I've ever tried here in San Francisco. One thing worth mentioning -- the hot sauce from the roasted sucking pig tostada almost put me in the hospital...I LOVE hot sauce, and have never had an issue before, but I was seriously having complications. Hopefully it was just an overly spicy batch, but if not, they definitely should give some sort of heads up.
