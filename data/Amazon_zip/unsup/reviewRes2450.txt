Make sure you know the following before you go to Hot Doug's. 1. You will wait in line outside to eat. Be prepared to wait anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour. 2. They only accept cash. 3. They have very limited hours. If you accept the above, you will have the best damn encased meats of your life.
