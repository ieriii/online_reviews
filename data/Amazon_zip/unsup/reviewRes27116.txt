This is a great stop in Pilsen for Mexican food. The food is great. Authentic and fresh. They will let you order off the menu; if you just want some vegetables grilled and some tortillas. You can not beat the price. And BYOB. Don't listen to Candice. Honestly, would you take advice from someone who dies their hair tangerine and gives El Bo 5 stars?! I think NOT.
