ok, just moved here 1yr ago from San Francisco and this is one of my favorite finds. Food is great, fun combos (duck reuben, bucket o mussels, brisket w/mac and cheese) beer selection is overwhelmingly fantastic, they serve foodtill midnight++ environment warm fun & real. my one recommendation is its not good for groups much past 6 people. Yeah i see these boo hoo reviews - "its crowded, theres yuppies there, the waitress looked at me funny" ---WHATEVER!! if you like serious food in a boisterous lively pub environment, if you like talking to the tables next to you and actually Enjoying yourself, laughing and talking loud with friends - this place is tops.
