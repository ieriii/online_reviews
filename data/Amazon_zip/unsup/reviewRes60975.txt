So we decided to go to the 50/50 this past Saturday and I have to say I am less then impressed, frankly not impressed at all. I had better service at a no name bar then I did at one who supposedly has it name in the circle. Our waitress for our group was more concerned with pulling up her fifty/50 tube top then serving us with the proper service than any corner bar would be able to do. She was rude and short with us, and it took a long time for us to get our drinks. Yes, we understand it was a weekend and it's busy, but one can only think she would be apologetic. Instead she shrugged it off, maybe it was her age, she appeared to be in her early 20's, but one would think with the proper training "service" would be the first task of training. It is apparent that she needs to be retrained on what the proper attitude is. When we go out we don't mind paying a lot for our drinks, which you will do at the fifty/50. but you would think the service would make up for it. A bit of advice, tell your waitress to stop worrying about her tube top and how she looks and start worrying about her costumers first. If that can't be done, well then put on a tshirt!
