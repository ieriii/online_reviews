My boyfriend and I, who have very different tastes, decided to try this out last weekend at the suggestion of other yelpers. We were both very pleased! He had the huevos rancheros (which I may have misspelled) and loved it. I had a breakfast panini made with delicious scrambled eggs, tomato, cheese and bacon. We both ordered the chai latte -- definitely a good choice! The panini was good, but what was even better was the freshly made fig/granola/rice pudding cup that I grabbed at the register. The chai latte complimented it very well. I'm normally pretty generous with sharing new things that I try, but that pudding cup was so good that the boyfriend only got to have one spoonful. Oooohhh yeah. I do have to say that I did *not* experience any problematic customer service. Everyone I spoke to or interacted with was very friendly and pleasant. The girl at the register even offered to keep my rice pudding cup in the refrigerator until I was ready for it so that it would stay nice and cool. Great place.
