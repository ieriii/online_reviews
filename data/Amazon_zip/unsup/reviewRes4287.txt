Great jazzz music, but incredibly rude staff....I've never been to a bar or restaurant that treats its patrons so poorly. The bad attitudes stretched from the door man, to the bartender, all the way to the waitresses. (based on what I read in other reviews, this appears to be the norm for the staff) This would have been a 0 star review if were not for the music, it was fantastic....excellent sound system and acoustics too. Bottom line, there are plenty of other jazz clubs in chicago, go somewhere else if you are looking to have a good time. I would never patronize this place again, nor would I reccomend it to others.
