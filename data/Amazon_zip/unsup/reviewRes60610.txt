I've already been back here a few times and I love it! I've had a burger, the fish and chips, the cornflake fried chicken, and all are great. I've also shared the nachos nirvana and guacamole&salsa&chips, and they are amazing as well. The people I've been with have gotten the pulled pork sandwich, portobello mushroom sandwich, grilled cheese deluxe, and various burgers. All have been great!! The deserts are DELICIOUS... I love their oreo shake, and their brownie in a bowl and it is so chocolaty and warm, yum! And if you have to wait for a table, the bar service is also great!! Maybe next time I will be healthier and visit the soup&salad bar - it also looks amazing :-)
