We picked this spot because it is the closest hotel to Forest Park. We paid amost $200 a night and we did get a suite. The suite was very large- but needs serious updating. The carpets were gross, the wall paper was coming loose, the furnture looked like it had been in a Frat house. Needless to say, the only reason we have chosen this place for a second time is due to it's location. I decided to ask the front desk manager if there were any remodels in the works. She did explain that all of the rooms have been or are in the process of being re-modeled. She also said that the suites were the last one scheduled for re-model. So, my suggestion would be to make sure you request a re-modeled room.
