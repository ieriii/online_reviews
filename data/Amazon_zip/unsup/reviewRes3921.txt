Didn't visit the place, but my buddy said I had to try them and brought a to go order for me. I had the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ. I've had my fair share of Korean style wings, but these had an American twist to them. I love Korean food (as I am Korean) and I love American food... and these had the great combination of both... although if I had to choose between traditional Korean wings and Crisp, I would choose traditional style... but since I had them I developed a craving for them, which proves to me that they hit that perfect balance of the Korean/American fusion style wings. I definitely will be having Crisp again when I'm in a"Should I eat at a Korean restaurant or a diner" mood.
