The food here was pretty good and the servers were on top of it. We just had oen big problem with our waiter being snooty. Therefore, only 3 stars instead of 4. Even though I am a fan and will bring Tony and my mom there when they come up.  It is a very cozy restaurant and we ordered the family style dinner - assuming that we'd pick one appetizer, one dessert, etc... Except, we got ALL of the appetizers, each got the 4 entrees (small pieces of each of course), and two desserts. Needless to say, we were very full of delicious greek food. Their saganaki cooled down pretty quick though and got kinda tough... Still good. Their olive oil really is good, so if you're looking to buy olive oil and are in the area... Do it. Also, the feta on the salad was the best feta I'd ever had.  I will be back and hopefully will have a different waiter.
