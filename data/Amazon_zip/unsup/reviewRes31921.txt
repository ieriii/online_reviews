I ordered the "For One, Vegetarian/meat Messob" with doro alicha wot (basically chicken and an egg), ye-siga alicha (basically a mild beef), tikle gomen (basically cabbage) and ye-dnichena carrot alicha (basically potatoes and carrots) Although I didn't love the food, I thought coming here was worth the experience. We filled up quickly on the injera (a spongy flat bread used for dipping and eating the messob) and felt like kids eating with our hands and playing with our food. The restaurant is extremely warm and the music is relaxing so I'd recommend this place just for the experience. Based on food alone I probably won't return but the service and accommodation was enough to at least write a yelp recommendation.
