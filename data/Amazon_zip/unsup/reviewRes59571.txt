It is a very unique place. Only one I know that is open so late! Food is good and so cheap! When I called them first time to make sure that they are open late, I almost did not go because the lady on the phone barely spoke English, so I thought that I would not be able to communicate with them, because I don't know Korean. I am glad that I decided to go. It is my favorite late night, eat-out spot!
