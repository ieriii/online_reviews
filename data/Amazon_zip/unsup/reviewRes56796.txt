Crazy, crazy, CRAZY good pizza. Literally redefines pizza for any pizza lover - I cannot enjoy anything else after finding this gem!Great atmosphere, love that it's in the middle of a little neighborhood (off the beaten path), that there's patio seating, and that the passionate owner can always be found on premise. The quality of the ingredients sets this place apart from any other 'joint' in town - it is all fresh and it is all addictive!
