I have eaten at Shaw's bar numerous times, and although the service is somewhat inconsistent, the food is always great. The atmosphere is always cheering, although it can be noisy. Try and get one of the boots, if you can, especially if there is a Jazz band playing, if you want to have a conversation while eating. The hot mixed starter is to die for.
