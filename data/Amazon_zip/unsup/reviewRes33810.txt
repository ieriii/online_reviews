I feel like a stalwart has just let me down....like a Chicago institution just showed signs of being a "chain," and until proven otherwise, like a long established friendship just turned into an acquaintance. Service and food are behind this less than stellar impression. Cheese pizza - boring (but it usually is in my book), Pork chops sent back due to being overcooked, and then unimpressive. The Tilapia, an unfortunate mess of sauce invoking a transfer to an unspoiled plate, and finally, the half a roast chicken clearly got a bad batch of steroids as that guy was tiny! Then, our server almost made me want to pull my hair out. Maybe she was really clueless, but I will give her the benefit of the doubt and say she was new. Ask her a question and......"Ummmmm" (crickets chirping), make a request..."Ummmmm" (grass growing).....I swear, I am never one to get riled up over service, but I wanted to stand up and just scream, "spit it our already!" I'm sad.
