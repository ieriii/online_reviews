I was recently at Sunda for an early weeknight dinner. We couldn't get a private table but were perfectly happy at one of the community tables with a 360 view of the drinks bar, the sushi bar, the other community tables and the private seating area -- all great to view! The ambiance was probably my favorite part of Sunda - very River North, a sort of open, contemporary, chic, spacious feel with lot of artistic flair that envelopes you and makes you want to linger. A real-estate that stretches from practically Lasalle to Clark on Illinois is certainly impressive and that space has been put into very good use at Sunda. Customer service was great as well - when a friend of mine couldn't hold her drink (literally), the spill was cleaned up promptly and the drink replaced just as quickly! The food was good but I think I was expecting better. Loved the corn fritters, the roasted chillies but my vegetarian caterpillar sushi looked better than it tasted and a couple of the sides fell by the wayside. The ridiculous dessert ( fried ice cream wrapped inside a carrot cake) was phenomenal but the pudding recommended by our waiter was pretty disgusting. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the night was the drinks menu - again they sounded great, looked pretty great, but flattered to deceive. I have a really hard time swallowing a fruit concoction with more ice cubes than alcohol and forking about 15 bucks for it! In the end, I was glad I tried Sunda, but will probably be hard pressed to find a compelling reason to return.
