This review marks my glorious return to Chicago and Yelp(LOL!). Anyways, this place is one of the more low key steakhouses I've been to. The decor is tuned down a bit compared to the others, although it's still on the classy and fine ambiance side of things. Their salad bar didnt have as much of a selection as most other steakhouses but that's ok because that's not what it's about. The meal itself is phenomenally good. Although....what really does it for me is the roasted pineapple...mmmm roasted pineapple. So DELICIOUS! dinner will run you a bit more(although still worth it) but lunch is only 19.99 so I say, go for it. One of the best deals out there for 20 bucks :)
