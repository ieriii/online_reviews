SOOO much food for a great price! I first went here on Christmas day and thought the place was known for their BBQ. So, I ordered BBQ pork and other common chinese dishes. As I was waiting for the food, I noticed all the other tables were getting whole duck served and carved tableside. I vowed to be back for duck. A month later.... I ordered the whole bbq duck. For only $32 you get a whole duck with Vietnamese dumplings, a HUGE plate of duck fried rice, a BIG bowl of duck soup, and fruit sherbet! The meal is good for 4 people. Fortunately, it was just my husband and I so we stuffed our faces with delicious food! Well worth your money! On top of that, they serve beer and wine, this is the first Asian restaurant I've been to where they serve 312 beer. I'm craving more duck with hoisen sauce as I type and it's 845 in the morning! I will definitely be back but this time with more people to eat the large portions of food with. If you're lucky, the owner may carve your duck table side, just like we did!
