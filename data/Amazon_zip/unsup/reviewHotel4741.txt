I really hated staying at the Hotel Felix. My hatred was in part due to the fact that Priceline led me to believe I would be staying in a 4 star hotel - I wouldn't rate this place above a 2 - and it only gets that much because the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. I've never been more uncomfortable in a hotel room (or motel room, or in any random side of the road travel hotel I've ever stayed at). The room is tiny, and I was awake all night listening to the air conditioner turn on and off (it made a loud booming sound - the maintenance guy said that's just the way it was made). Also, while the eco-friendly thing is nice in concept, it also means that they do not allow you to turn your air below a certain level (central air) - sure the thermostat says 65, but it feels like 75 (or worse, sometimes it randomly blew out hot air). The bed was short (though not uncomfortable) and there was no natural light. The location is good but there are tons of hotels in this general area. Unless you're on a seriously tight budget and need to book through Priceline, I wouldn't recommend staying here under any circumstances. I don't plan on using Priceline again because of this experience - their rating system obviously can't be trusted.
