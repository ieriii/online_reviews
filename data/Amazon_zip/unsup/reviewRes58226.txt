I am so tempted to give this place a bad review just so people stop coming here and we can get a reservation.This is my favorite restaurant. Ever. I've probably been here about 5 times, and every time it's brilliant. I've heard it described as the skate punk Alinea, which I think is so dead on. Actually, I think it's better than Alinea. I've had a dish I didn't like at Alinea, but I've never had anything other than exceptional food here.I come from a family of near-carnivores, who rarely touch a vegetable, unless it's a potato. Schwa served us beets once and we not only ate them, we practically licked the plate. I think that's the mark of a truly incredible restaurant--regardless of the personal food preferences of the diners, they have the ability to make any ingredient taste amazing.Also, they're really fun people to talk to. When I'm waiting for the bathroom (you have to wait in the kitchen), they always strike up conversation with me. That lack of pretension from people I think of as culinary geniuses is exactly why I love this place.
