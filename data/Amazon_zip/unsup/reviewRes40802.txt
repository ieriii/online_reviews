Our first experience at Bonsoiree was extraordinary. The second one was a huge disappointment. We went back recently for their summer menu. All the courses sounded exciting. I did not enjoy the 8 something of summer. I think they were going for that refreshing element, but I felt like I was eating grass. The one course I loved was the scallop moyotaki. It was on the previous menu. It's basically scallop baked in a spicy aioli. The scallop is always cooked perfectly and the aioli is to die for. I still love the restaurant, but would not recommend this particular menu to my friends.
