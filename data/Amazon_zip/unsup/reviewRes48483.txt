The holy trinity of food: oysters, pig, and beer! I could write about it all day but given the multitude of food-focused reviews already in existence, I'll write about something different. I'll focus on coming here on a date vs. coming here with a group. On a date: I came here for second date on a Friday night, 8 PM. We were looking for good food and good beer. We made reservations last minute but the hostess still seated us at a private two-person table at the front of the house. I was either remarkably lucky (the house was full) or batting my eyelashes worked. Probably the former given my ugly mug. It's a good place for a date. The noise and the proximity of other diners doesn't lend to great private conversation but you can still hear the other person. Also, the menu (both food and beer) is so extensive, you'll always have something to talk about. It's also fun going through each item with your date and finding out what he/she likes. Lastly, the bathrooms are off in the corner about 30 feet from the main dining room, so if you're having a horrible time, you can always dial up your friends and give them a status update or plan an escape if need be... not that I've done this before :) In a group: I dragged fourteen of my friends to the Publican. Do not do this last minute! PLAN AHEAD! I called a month ahead for reservations and, even then, I had to negotiate the time we could come in. We were seated at the long, central communal table. I thought it would be awkward sitting next to strangers but our group had no problem siphoning off into its own conversational huddle. Even with fourteen people, orders came out quickly and the server still asked each person about their preferences and helped customize the menu for everyone. For a date or in a group, this is a great dining experience. Farm or sea fresh food prepared in delicious ways, consistently. Highly recommended.
