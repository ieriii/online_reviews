My dad introduced me to Sabatino's years back. It's where he sometimes hung out with his buddies after golf or lodge meetings. I remember being a little intimidated. The first thing you see is a darkened bar room with old men sitting around chatting and drinking wine. One of the first dining areas you see is wood paneled with grape vine patterns. Definitely like something out of a mob movie. First impressions are deceiving. The food is excellent and the people are friendly. Most recently I took my girlfriend to Sabatino's for her birthday. We had a reservation for 6:00 PM but there was no need. On a Thursday evening the place isn't too packed. We were seated right away. The old school waitress was prompt and friendly. We started with a cheese plate, which included four types of cheese (which change often as the waitress explained), grapes, apples, honey and orange marmalade. That's the first time I ever had cheese with honey. It was pretty good. Dinner started with pizza bread and a large loaf of fresh Italian bread. I may have filled up on too much bread and cheese because when my spinach gorgonzola ravioli came, the portion was huge, and I couldn't finish it all. It wasn't the taste. It was excellent, but I had to take the rest home. . For dessert we had the tiramisu, which ranks pretty high on my restaurant tiramisu scale. Yes, I have one of those. It's the perfect dessert.  One thing I should note is that the girlfriend is a pescetarian, and the menu is very friendly to those who do not eat meat, with a pretty good selection of fish and seafood or meatless pastas. They even have gluten free pasta on request. The friendliness is not just on the outside. The menu accommodates everyone. Next time you're going on a date or a family dinner and you want to impress, I would suggest getting a reservation at Sabatino's.
