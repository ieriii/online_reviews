I've been here twice now and can't get over how good the food is. I've had the linguine con vongole and the jumbo shrimp special pasta. Both times I was blown away by flavor and sheer quantity. Clam pasta in a white sauce may be one of my all-time favorite foods and I think this place might do it better than anyone else I know! Also, their pastas are all homemade and you can tell. I never thought I would be able to but there is something definitely special about their pastas. Their desserts are also out of this world. The waiter told us it was the best tiramisu in Chicago and I frankly would not be surprised if it were. I've also had the chocolate raspberry ganache cake - winner! I would absolutely have given this place 5 or 5+ stars if possible except that the second time I came here, the service was absolutely horrendous :( It was just me and a classmate late in the evening and the place wasn't terribly busy. We placed our orders and started chatting, only to realize over an hour later that our pasta hadn't come out yet and we were starving. No one came by to apologize or explain the wait! But when we listened around everyone else was getting explanations and free drinks while they waited. Our food finally came out and there were some sheepish mumblings about the kitchen having some trouble and an off-comment about how dessert would be on them if we wanted. Well, we took them up on that offer because it was kind of ridiculous that we didn't get an explanation before the food came out. But at least they offered.
