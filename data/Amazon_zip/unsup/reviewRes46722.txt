Went for lunch with Mom... our waitress was super great with us first timers, the food was good and arrived quickly. The salad bar looked great but at ten bucks we decided to opt for sandwiches. A relaxed atmosphere with photos of all the servers who ever worked there all over the walls - great idea! Id' go back.
