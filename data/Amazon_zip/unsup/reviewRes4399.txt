One of, if not THE best place in Chicago. Seriously, if you can't enjoy yourself here for an hour or two, there's something wrong(or maybe you just don't like jazz? Eh, no excuse). Anywhere you sit you have a good view of whats happening, it's not so loud to where you can't have a conversation, the cover is usually somewhere between free and cheap, and the drinks are average priced. It's a nice place to grab a booth, have a Manhattan, and feel like you're back in the 1930s or 40s.
