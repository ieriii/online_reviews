It was a Saturday night. Long wait. Snagged a spot at the bar. Worth the wait. The house IPA was good. I recommend the pulled pork sandwich with garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes. Washed it down with Crispin Cider. The cider was $10 for a 22oz bottle but it complimented my meal sufficiently. Good crowd.
