Incredible, succulent duck. One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago for authentic Chinese cuisine. We regularly order the Beijing Duck dinner, and I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Go to Sun Wah!Reservations recommended, but it's worth the (at times very long) wait if you didn't make one.
