A friend just took me here for my first pho experience and i loved it. First off, we ordered #16, i believe. Which is basically make your own spring rolls at the table. i loved that you could put whatever you wanted in them and experiment with all of the different flavors. Next, we got a big ol bowl of pho each, #47. So freakin tasty. The atmos is fun and interesting. SO many different people, crazy vietnamese techno music, and the waitstaff bustling around all crazy. A note should be made: we had about 3 different waiters. you kinda just have to flag one down to get an order through. kinda chaotic, but worth it. Also, make sure if you have any mods you want to make on your meal, that they really understand you. We had to say "extra lettuce" in a variety of ways to get the meaning through. If your in the mood for a fun, yummy, and interesting place, then go here. However, if you just had a long day at work and want to chill out, it prob ain't the best time to try this spot.
