Still sooo good. Wait is long on a weekend but well worth it! Also worth all the praise that people give it. Tip: share an egg plate and a pancake dish. The pancakes/waffles can be too sweet for one person. Definitely DELICIOUS, but just too big of a plate for me. It's also a good way to try the different dishes!
