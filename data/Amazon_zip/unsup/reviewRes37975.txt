Boom. This is the best pizza you will have in your life. You can go around the country, but Giordanos is good as it gets by far. When I was scrolling through previous reviews of Giordanos on Rush i realized that mostly all the reviewers are not from Chicago. They are from everywhere in the country. Which says a lot about how amazing this pizza is. Not only is Giordanos famous, Rush Street is famous. You will have the most fun you have ever had on one street. A lot of people complain on the very long wait to get your order which normally takes 45-60 minutes but if you really want some AMAZING pizza...WAIT!! If you are ever in the Chicago areaand want some pizza, go to Giordanos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
