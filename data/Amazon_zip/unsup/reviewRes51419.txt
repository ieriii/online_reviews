I love Garcia's. The fact it took me 3+ years to discover it's existance since living in Chicago honestly makes me a little sad. First of all, I think their food is amazing. Mexican food can be a sketchy dish around any big city. Where you never really know what you're getting into until you've already committed. Sometimes the hole in the wall places are the best, sometimes they leave you full of regret for days. The fancier restaurants are a bit easier to judge. Garcia's, nestled into the heart of Lincoln Square has a reputation, and it's a good one. The main portion of the restaurant is open and spacious, the bar area is much more cozy. While some of the seating kind of puts you front and center for a good round of people watching the good atmosphere of the place prevails. It can get a little loud with the open space but the great food and yummy margaritas kind of take you away from paying attention to the rest of the world, especially if you are in good company. The menu is pretty expansive and has something for everyone, true Mexican food lovers or not. I love their blended strawberry margaritas, they are reasonably priced and trust me the tequila is in there! I've hit Garcia's for birthday dinners or small one-on-one dinners. I've never had a bad waiter who wasn't pleasent and helpful, even the busing staff checks on you. Needlss to say I've enjoyed myself every time I've paid a visit to this place. Only downside thus far in my Garcia's experience, parking can sometimes be a pain if you're not within walking distance of the area. On a nice night though, who minds a little extra walk?
