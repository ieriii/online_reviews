I recently organized my company holiday party here and was very pleased with the result. Amy, who helped me plan, was accommodating and knowledgeable. Her recommendation that we get the guacamole as our first appetizer was met with positive approval across the board, and the room was perfect, although she said they could accommodate up to 40 people, and with 28, we were rather cozy. Not sure I'd recommend for up to 40.  The wait staff was attentive and efficient, keeping a drink in everyone's hand up until the very last minute of our party, and the heavy appetizers were delicious, particularly the lamb skewers and the ropa vieja. The seating was ideal for what we were looking for- optional tables and seats, but plenty of room to get up and mingle. The staff kept the appetizers coming throughout the entirety of our party and you really cannot beat this place for ambience. It is so bright and festive, the music is energetic but not overpowering, and the high ceilings are great to ensure it never feels stuffy.  I would plan another party here in a heartbeat and am looking forward to trying it out for normal dinner and drinks some time in the near future.
