I love this University Village Italian spot! The rooftop seating was so perfect. I went here for my birthday in October with a friend and it was a great choice. I ordered the Pollo 'Sole Mio': Grilled half chicken + chili pepper paste. It was just the right amount of spicy and it was beautiful. The color was so deep and red. My friend ordered one of the items off of the brunch menu which looked delicious as well. I would so go back here for a nice glass of wine and some dinner. Now to find a date to take me!
