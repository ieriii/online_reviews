Thanks to my fellow yelper Jelena Z for suggesting this fabulous place. We were celebrating a pal's birthday and only had a party of 3 around 6pm. Plenty of tables available at that time however by 7pm this place was jumping. I love the BYOB factor since I know my dining bill won't be outrages. Our server was great and loved my craft beer selection of PranQster and Delirium in my bright red cooler. I started off the evening with a bowl of Miso soup, just the right amount of scallions too. It was delicious! Then the fun started with 3 orders of the Po'Boy Maki signature dish, followed by White Dragon, Unagi, White Tuna and Spicy Crunchy Tuna. I know I am missing a few, must be still in a sushi coma. Our tab was fairly reasonable and server was knowledgeable. Whether you are bromancing with the fellas or getting your swag on with a lovely gal, Coast Sushi Bar is a perfect choice.
