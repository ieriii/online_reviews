Great food, brunch is really good too. They do tend to cram you in there at the bar area while you wait, so go early. It gets a little loud too so if you are looking to have a good conversation, forget about it, just enjoy the food. Update. 11/14/07 Went in last night with 2 friends, the food was even better then I remembered but our server was AWFUL. I hate to complain about service as I am in the industry but she was just so bad. It was as if she just didn't want to be near or talk to us. We sat for 10 min before she approached(she only had 3 other tables all night that we could see) and just dropped the special menu down and just looked at us!! She did the same thing with the dessert menu. We had to flag her down to order more drinks,tell her we wanted to order our main courses and get the check. The busser-food runner was great, very friendly. When we were leaving, we saw her in the service area, reading a magazine!. I will go back for sure as The food really is fantastic but will ask to not be in her section again.
