I know I am a foodie late to the party, but I finally made it! Just in case you haven't read a single other review...GET THE DUCK! Ordering the Peking Duck Dinner (which you are asked to order ahead of time when making a reservation) is a must. The perfectly cooked fowl is wheeled up table side and careful carved into delicious slices of crispy moist goodness. Shove a few of those slices into the steamed buns and go to town!  They make a soup with the carcass as well as a fried rice or noodle dish. We went with the noodle dish, which I enjoyed. The soup was also very tasty. If you are not a fan of duck, the BBQ Pork was also good. Service was just OK, but I didn't really care. It was a great experience, and I do plan to return.
