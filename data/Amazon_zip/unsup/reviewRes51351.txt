So I must be the only person on earth who doesn't like Garcia's, at least from a cursory glance of the reviews here. And from the number of people I've known who go there regularly. A composite of three-and-one-half stars? Wow! I cannot think of this restaurant without thinking of a short-term roomie I had who brought home their burritos almost every night and raved about them. Edward was, shall I say, no stranger to a cocktail. He worked his way through all my hooch, and when I requested that he replaced what he drank, bought one bottle of cheap Eastern European wine, and proceeded to down that the very same night. Hence his temporary status. I have eaten at Gacia's twice, once to dine in and the other late evening with a group of out-of-towners who needed 1:00 a.m. sustenance. I did not like either the feng shui nor the tongue shui of the place. The two-way (entrances on Western and Lincoln) boomerang-shaped narrow room with those awful ladder-back chairs. Just an uncomfortable spot in my estimation. As for the tongue shui, I have an issue with beef sandwiches, tacos or burritos, which are filled with what I like to call "oingy-boingy meat". The meat is chopped into the smallest possible chunks, and every once in awhile you chow down on what is most assuredly gristle. Yuck! Such was my experience with the "steak" burrito there, and I had a mild nausea after eating there. The second time, with takeout, I got chicken tacos. They were not bad, as I recall, but I had probably greased the way with a few beers. I do like to respect the opinions of others, but the mystery for me of the popularity of Garcia's, given the zillions of taquerias in town, persists. The only explanation I can think of is 1) the convenient location, 2) the late hours and 3) the fact that Yelp MUST be populated with many lushes like Edward!
