Sultan's has always been my go-to for a delicious Falafel sandwich. Quick, easy, always yumm. Since I live so far NW in the city, I am rarely in the area to stop by here anymore, however was able to do so with my little buddy yesterday. While he was really excited to try falafel (sounds like waffle, so I imagine he thought they'd taste similar, too, or at least he'd be able to dip it in syrup...), I wasn't too sure about the eat-in situation here. I guess I was a little intimidated, because as many times as I've been here, I've never once sat down at one of their booths, and I was pretty sure they were all always taken.  Well, we got lucky. More than half of the tables were empty, and they graciously brought over a high-chair. My son had his own mini-sampler-platter of pita, falafel, and hummus, which he devoured, and we had a really great Mama & son lunch date. Great place, both dine-in and to go! Oh, and also really inexpensive!
