Caro Mio....My favorite Italian outside of Italy. The gnocchi special is the most beautiful taste my tongue has had in a very long time! The smells alone will create such a wonderful experience!! But, once you taste their insanely fantastic dishes-you will not be able to think of anything else for days. The wait staff is very friendly and energetic...My husband and I love BYOB places b/c then you're not spending an arm and a leg on wine....The bruschetta with fresh mozzarella is also a must...Yum Yum Yum.
