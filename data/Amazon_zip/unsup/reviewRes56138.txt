You can get a Chicago hot dog, greasy fries and a pop in lots of places, but this joint has history and is worth the trip. An unhealthy indulgence.And it helped that it was on the way home from my job out near O'Hare. I could shop for groceries at the Dominick's across the street and then drop by the Dawg for a dog.
