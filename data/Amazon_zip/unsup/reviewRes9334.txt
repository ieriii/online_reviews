During the Top Chef season 3, Chef Dale was famous about his sauce works and the duck fat cook steak! I have tried his tasting menu today and yes, his sauce works and duck fat cooked steak are still the high light of his food. The progression from tartness and refreshes and slowly adding the creaminess and richness into the courses... It is interesting that he has arranged a very nice salad after the beef. The salad definitely help to clean out the heavy flavor from the beef and that wonderful sauce. With the little help from a sweet sorbet, I was ready for his wonder chocolate cake. While the chocolate cakes were not too sweet and too heavy, the richness from the ice cream and tartness from the sauce and the crunching texture from the nuts were mixing very beautifully together. Highlight of the night: Everything... Lol ... Ok... Comparing with other dishes, the sorbet was just fine and the sauce on the bakchoi can be a little less... They definitely did not shine as bright as others
