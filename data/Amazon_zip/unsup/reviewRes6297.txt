I soooo wanted to give 4-5 stars to Wildfire. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but it didn't knock my socks off. Maybe I was just expecting more since I've read all the hype. Maybe I'm just hard to impress. I don't know. We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms. Very tasty but there were only 3 of them. Hmmmm....for a party of two. I let my husband eat the last one as I watched him devour it with great satisfaction.  Since the soup or salad were not included in the price of the meal we went straight on to the entree. Knowing we would be stuffed anyway, why spend the extra money right? I ordered the 10 oz prime rib and I think I really only got about 6 oz of actual meat after cutting off all the fat. That was a little diappointing but it did taste good. The red potato mash tasted all right but was too smooth for me. I like it a little thicker and chunkier. My husband ordered the mushroom crusted pork chops. He let me have a taste and immediately I wished I'd ordered that instead. I was under the impression this was a steakhouse or was I let astray?  Our bill wasn't as high as we expected which eased the pain a bit. Maybe because we left off the salad.  I can't say the food or service was bad, and I certainly wouldn't say to stay away. I just don't think we'll be back since there are so many other options in the city.
