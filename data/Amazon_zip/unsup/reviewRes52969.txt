Unbearably rude and incompetent service, meh food. I know Cuban places aren't made for vegetarians, no big deal, but I ordered a couple of appetizers for my entree so that I could enjoy a meal out with friends--you know, the point of eating out--and first, the waiter essentially rolls his eyes at me, annoyed maybe with the fact that my two appetizers don't add up to the same price as an entree? I asked that he bring them out with my friends' entrees--you know, so we can eat together--and I really don't think this is a huge request to make. I asked him politely, just confusedly, why he did this when I specifically asked they be brought out with the entrees and he scrambles for something, then says condescendingly, "Well... oh, this is because of the table space. Yeah, there's not enough table space so I... (trails off into blah until he just flat walks away). I finish my food--since it was hot and greasy and coagulated-fat lukewarm Cuban food isn't my idea of delicious--at least five minutes before my friends' entrees are served. The guy avoids visiting our table the rest of the time, never brings a sauce we asked for, and delivers the check via proxy. The food was okay, but definitely not delicious. I've had much better, much cheaper. Zero reason to return. Confused by all the raves on here--people must have just been well drunk thanks to the BYOB policy to think they had a great time and meal. Forget this place.
