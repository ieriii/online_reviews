Went here with a buddy two weeks ago for a quick lunch and a beer and really enjoyed ourselves. He ordered the Patty-Melt and I got the Better Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger following our waitress's advice and both were outstanding. We also got the 312 Green Line beer which is extremely hard to find and a good start to a solid lunch. This is a great spot with a cool atmosphere and I highly suggest you try it for lunch if you have the time, but be prepared to spend about $10/meal and an extra $6 for the rare Green Line.
