As a vegan, I love that The Chicago diner exists. I just wish I loved their food a little more than I do. If Yelp allowed it, I'd probably give the Diner 3 1/2 stars. The food can be hit or miss, I've found. The breakfast items my husband and I have ordered have been amazing, as are the vegan shakes. However, some of the entrees are not as awesome as I had hoped. The vegan mac and cheese I ordered one day arrived lukewarm and a lot of the baked goods tend to be dry, which I don't understand because I do a lot of vegan baking and it's not difficult to make moist, vegan carrot cake. However, the vegan cheesecake is awesome and the sandwiches are fantastic (albeit a bit pricey). Like I said, I love that The Chicago Diner is there. It's always my standby if I'm in the area and hungry (or just hungry and can't decide on anything else); I know I can get something there and won't have to risk compromising my vegan diet. ***Edit: I take back the 3 1/2 stars remark. 3 is probably being generous. What the hell is going on with the Chicago Diner?!? I went yesterday and was served a plate of Shepherd's Pie that was ICE COLD in the center! WTF! Seriously folks, you need to step up your game. Just because your shakes are delicious doesn't mean you get to slack on everything else.
