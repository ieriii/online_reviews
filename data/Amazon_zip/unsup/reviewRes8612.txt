After I read ROTD, I headed over to Spacca Napoli that night! The description of the fresh mozz was too much for me to withstand. I went with a friend and we ordered the mozz/prosciutto appetizer along with the greens salad and one red pizza w/mushroom and sausage. Let me tell you the mozz/prosciutto appetizer will have me back for more! I haven't had fresh mozz like that since I was in Italy! Also, the olives they used in the salad were fantastic. By the time our pizza came we were pretty full, but it was tasty none the less. Be ready for an authentic soggy middle though. Overall, I really liked decor, it is a simple Italian design with fun pictures lining the wall. Also the service was outstanding. Even though they were very busy, my water was refilled at half glass! I'll definitely be going back again.
