Best pancakes I have ever had in my entire life. No joke. I am obsessed with these. The white chocolate caramel pretzel pancake. Just thinking about them makes my mouth water. The perfect blend of salty, sweet, crunchy, soft, creamy, all around amazingness. I am planning another trip to Chicago mostly for these pancakes. If they don't have them on the menu I might cry. The rest of the menu looks amazing too, although I'm not sure I could ever venture away from these amazing pancakes. Decorations and atmosphere relaxing yet upscale. Best best best in the world.
