I give Gino's four stars because of my second dining experience there. My first dining experience at Gino's East was simply awesome. I had flown into Chicago and checked into the Crown Plaza hotel. It was about 4pm and had nothing to eat except some peanuts from the plane ride. I looked out my window and saw Gino's East. At the time, I didn't know it was an icon of Chicago. I soon found out why it is after I ate there. The deep dish pizza was too die for! Hands down, it was the best pizza I had ever eaten. About a week later, I was connecting back through Chicago and hit Gino's again. This time, it was right before closing. The experience was much different. The crust did not taste the same. It was like something was missing? Overall, it was just OK. So, next time I'll go back in the mid-afternoon when I'm in Chicago.
