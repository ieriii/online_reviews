Eh, I received a great deal for $80 a night so really I can't complain. I don't think I would stay again unless I received the same deal. The rooms seems small and so dark. No pool, which in the summer would have been nice. I did however meet a ton of people in for a Cubs game and Military. It is pretty lively in the morning and night. Easy access to Michigan Avenue and to pretty much every bus route.
