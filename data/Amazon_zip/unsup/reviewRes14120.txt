I came back for more, because it was so good the first time - and this time it was even better! I got the Guajirito: green plantains (instead of bread), skirt steak, grilled onions, swiss cheese, and a slice of lettuce/tomato. YUMMMMMMM. It was served hot, fresh out of the oven/grill/whatever they cooked it on. It was a little greasy, but the cheese was gooey, the steak was juicy, the plantains were sweet, and I was in love. Strawberry iced tea was delicious as well. I'm considering coming back here once a week until I try everything, since it just keeps getting better!
