After visiting Costa Rica in February, my friends and I wanted to relive our experience by having some of our favorite dishes like gallo pinto, sweet plantains, Imperial (which we provided byob) and Lizano sauce. Irazu has great outdoor seating and excellent vegetarian selections. Parking is easy and there is a wine store across the street.  I haven't had the oatmeal shake yet, but it sounds delicious. So far, I've tried the vegetarian burrito, taco, veggie sandwich and chile relleno. It will definitely be a monthly outing for the excellent food, service, and price. Definitely authentic costa rican.
