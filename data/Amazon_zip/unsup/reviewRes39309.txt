I knew coming there i wasnt going to get quality service..you never really do at real korean joints or I've never experienced it in the past. I didn't expect our drinks to get refilled without having to flag someone down etc. The service we had was definitely not ideal and way below what I expected. I asked if I could have a fried egg on the side, the response I get was "No fried egg! this real Korean Restaurant!" a simple "no we are out" or a "no" would have sufficed, even though I know they serve fried eggs with some korean bowls. When the check came I got up to go pay. Whenever I pay with my debit card I almost always write in "cash" in the "Tip" section and leave a cash tip. 5-10 minutes passed and we got up to get ready to leave and put on our coats, hadn't even left the table yet and the waitress was already scooting her way in and says "No Tip!?!?" I'm not one for stiffing waiters and waitresses on tips because I know they get a bulk of their income from tips but we hadn't even left yet before she tried to push her way through. Pretty bold, rude, and awkward. Service aside, the food was just ok. Definitely had better, and it kinda felt like we were getting the scraps. If you're in for a decent kalbi (marinated short rib) fix, I recommend Joy Yee Noodle House. I have yet to try the other korean places in the area.
