This place was phenomenal. The patio is simply one of the nicest, most elegant, well design and hip patios that I have ever been to. The food was outstanding. I had a 4-cheese ravioli and a little bit of Pork Tenderloin. The pork was juicy, perfectly cooked and wrapped in bacon. Totally totally worth going.
