For the most part, I enjoyed my stay at Hotel 71. You get two views in this place. There's the adjacent rooftop view with pigeons and industrial objects, or there's the magnificent view with the boats traveling under the bridges below. I had trouble with wireless in my room, so after a very nice technician visited my room, I was upgraded from the already nice room I had with the rooftop view to a much nicer room with a fabulous view of the loop below. As a Wilco fan (you'll only get this as a Wilco fan) I was thrilled to have the cover art for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot right outside my window (The Mariana Towers). The hotel staff were nice and helped create the boutique feel. Nice hotel bar. Nice furnishings. I was happy that in both my suites I had a giant bathtub and a nice rain shower in addition. Both bathrooms had flat screen TVs, so I could watch the news in the morning and relax in the evenings. Convenient to the theaters- we walked to Wicked and it was only a few blocks. My suites both had nice chaise lounges for a little post-work relaxation. I highly recommend this hotel for your next business or pleasure stay.
