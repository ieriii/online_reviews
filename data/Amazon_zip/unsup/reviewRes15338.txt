Violet Hour is kind of cool. It's also a little too pretentious to be actually really cool. I have never had any of their small plates or snacks or whatever they are but I've had quite a few of their cocktails. There may have been one or two I didn't like but then again, I'm not hard to please. I loved pretty much all of the drinks. Fun and clever names, interesting ingredients, and house made bitters. So, yeah, kind of cool. As for the pretentious part, the reason it's only 3 stars: The bouncer that waits for people to enter is usually not the nicest. The hostess seating people, the staff in general really. I've never had awful service, but there's just a little bit of snobbery. The rules and the time limits. I've never been kicked out myself but my co-worker was. He was with a couple of people and they got kicked out cause they'd been there too long. ? I'd go again if someone wanted to go. I wouldn't suggest the place myself, though.
