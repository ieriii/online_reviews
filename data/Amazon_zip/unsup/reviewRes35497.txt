"Mommy what's wrong with those ducks? Are they dead?" "No honey, they're just sleeping.... upside down.... and inside out" But seriously, this place serves up some great peking duck and has a pretty solid supporting menu as well. Anything that ends in -mein or -fun is tasty here, and while I have yet to fully dive into their seafood offerings, the rest of their stuff is always well cooked (not overdone like many chinese food chicken and beef offerings) and delicious. Still, the main appeal is definitely the duck. It is most definitely crispy, moist, sweet, tender, and the perfect complement to the bao-esque buns they serve with which to sandwich your duck, hoi-sin, scallions etc. The duck broth and duck fried rice are a nice bonus too. The service is not great and probably the only thing keeping Sun Wah from 5 stars. Nevertheless, as long as you're not in a hurry and you order your second beer before you really get thirsty again, this place is a home run.
