Why? Why do people rave about this place? It's all Rick Bayless hype. Seriously? It's mediocre at best. The Churros had too much sugar coating which had the effect of me biting into sandy bread. And the Aztec hot chocolate? It tastes like any other hot chocolate with Cinnamon. All over-priced. Maybe I should go there and try their sandwich that everyone else is raving about... XOCO- I was expecting more outta you!
