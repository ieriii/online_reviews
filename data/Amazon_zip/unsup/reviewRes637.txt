If you are reading Alinea reviews on Yelp you need to just suck up your nerve and go. It's expensive, pretentious, and worth your time. I have eaten better food but never seen more creative ways to prepare and serve it. The overall experience is fascinating. The service staff (hard to call them waiters) performs a subtly choreographed placement and pickup. Each dish is engineered rather than prepared. You won't find a more interesting way to wile away four hours.
