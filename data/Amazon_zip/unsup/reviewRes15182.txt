Wanted to update and say this might be one of my favorites. We came here for Valentine's Day and it was just great. We actually tried the food this time: - french fries (crispy!) - gnocci (my favorite out of these. soft and yummy) - cod croquettes (my second favorite, almost melts in your mouth even though its deep fried (ithink)) - we also received this awesome beginner compliments of the kitchen, with kind of a pita bread (or something similar to it, but harder than a pita) bacon, some sauce and something else, I forgot but that was DELISH also! Very pleased! The drinks never disappoint and I always end up tipsy after two :) AMAZING DATE
