came here tonight for the $20 prix fixe. The food was very delicious and very fresh. Althought it didnt amaze me that much, I think at $20 a meal you cant complain. Presentation was excellent. Service was good. I had the homemade ice cream for desert which was wonderful. I also had a green tea cola drink which was pretty good. The bacon wrapped pork tenderloin was delicious. So was the corn cake. I will come again to try a different variety of the menu.
