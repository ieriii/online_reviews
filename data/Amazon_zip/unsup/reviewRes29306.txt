I've ordered here for pick up or delivery over 10 times. Each time, they are consistently jerks and speak in a extremely condescending and impatient manner. I wouldn't mind if it was just a matter-of-fact tone and I do not expect syrupy chipper, but I do expect moderate courtesy. Any question or suggestion is met with amazing impatience. EVERY TIME! They are not better when you see them in person when you pick up the food. Some of the food is really good, but some others are mediocre or worse. Their Curry Shrimp Fried Rice is amazing and their Pad Thai is perfect. All other items I've tried including assorted curries and stir-fries, are 6/10.
