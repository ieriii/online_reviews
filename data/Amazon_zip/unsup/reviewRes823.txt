Duck sausage with foie gras mousse (earthy n creamy) and pork sausage with cranberry cream cheese (smokey and sweet). Snappy sausage, perfect pairings. The split top bun is simple yet chewy enough to provide some texture that holds all the ingredients together. They close at 4pm and cash only. Doug is at the counter taking orders; so nice and easy going. Duck fat fries on fri n sat (couldn't tell the difference). There will be a wait. don't bother with the regular menu. Get the specialties. 2 people should share at least 3 dogs.
