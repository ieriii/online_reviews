Food this good and this cheap should NOT be missed!! A neighbor suggested my husband and I try Nuevo Leon for its authentic mexican food and great hospitality-- and we were very pleased at her suggestion! We eat here at least once a month- and it's always less than $25 for both of us together. The BYOB also helps for the budget minded who want to have a couple of Modelos with their Carne, and not pay double the price for them!!I almost always order the Carne Asada- which is such a large portion that I eat half and save the rest for a steak sandwich the next day! :) My husband tries out a new pork or beef dish everytime, and has yet to find something he hasn't devoured.We also took my brother and Colombian sister-in-law (who is a fabulous cook!) there for dinner twice, and Nuevo Leon got the thumbs up from both of them- not an easy feat! :)I highly recommend Nuevo Leon to anyone who wants amazing, AUTHENTIC mexican food at half the price of many fancy-dandy restaurants selling lesser flavor across Chicago.
