I have only experienced the takeout side of the business, however, in that ten minutes that I was waiting for my food the staff were friendly, helpful, and very funny. Behind the counter was a jovial 90 year old man with the hugest hands and the most crushing handshake I have ever experienced. He seemed to be the patriarch of the family, and exuded all the warmth and benevolence of a grandfather.  Once home, the koubideh and dill rice (wow) were excellent. I previously had the Chenjeh (ribeye) wrap, which was also delicious. Noon O Kabab is a must for anyone who digs Persian food!
