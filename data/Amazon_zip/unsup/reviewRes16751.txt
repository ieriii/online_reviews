This is one of my most favorite Indian restaurants. I am a very picky Indian food eater and I really like this place. Add to that I just moved here from India so it is pretty hard to impress me when it comes to Indian food. But India House... I dream of it when I am too lazy to cook which is often. Their naan and curry sauce which they serve when you initially sit down is awesome. I tend to order the same thing each time which is a plate of kabobs and their butter chicken. It isn't as spicy as what I am used to, but I did ask the waiter for " achaar" or pickle and they brought it out for me. The waiter informed me very proudly that it was made specially by them. Husband found it too hot for his taste... guess only one of us has a hot head.
