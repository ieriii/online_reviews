awesome sausage dogs. my group had the rattlesnake sausage, the duck sausage with foi gras, the buffalo sausage and their veggie dog. all very different from your Chicago dog but excellent in quality and taste. the duck sausage was very good! it's about $7-9 per so be ready, this place only accepts cash money yo. we also had the duck fat fries, they were crispy and very good, they won't taste like duck but the oil makes them a little greasier, yummy. get here earlier there is always a long arse line. checkout my photos.
