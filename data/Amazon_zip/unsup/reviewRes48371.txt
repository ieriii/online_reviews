Here's the deal: Gold Coast meets Medieval Times. You're sitting at a long communal wooden table, sharing various meaty pleasures and guzzling worldly beers. Doesn't sound too bad, eh? For being a place with pretentious prices, it's not exactly a calming atmosphere. The place is loud loud LOUD and when our party of 6 stepped outside after the meal, it was the first time in 2.5 hours we could all hear each other talk. I dunno, I'd like to have conversations with the people I eat dinner with? Maybe, I'm like, too retro for this particular dining concept. Ohh, but the food--the food was fantastical, meaty pleasure after pleasure. We had the trio of hams, the sweetbreads (horrified and charmed), the short ribs, the salmon, the bourdin blanc, the fish stew, the chicken--OHHHHH--the chicken. I have to say, the bourdin blanc was hands down the best sausage I have ever put in my mouth (I know what you're thinking...) But srsly. With that spicy mustard? I could have eaten sausage after sausage after sausage. And the chicken was some of the most tender, well-seasoned poultry I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. Well done, there. So I think that if I ever do return, I'll do a couple things differently: a) Reserve a booth to hopefully intimatize (it's a word, right?) the experience b) Ignore parts of the menu (READ: brain) c) Eat a salad beforehand so my body doesn't go into meat-induced shock.
