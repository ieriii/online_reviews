First, I have to admit I love the vibe at W hotels. The changing lighting in the elevators and the house music (this is Chicago, after all!) in the lobby suits me just fine. Last time I stayed, I discovered I forgot my computer mouse. I popped down to the front desk (hidden in the back left of the lobby) and asked where the nearest store was so I could buy a new one. The clerk said, "Hey, we'll just get you one and bring it to your room!" Just like that! And, they did, in 5 minutes! I of course returned it when I checked out. It's the small things that really make service stand out for me. I've had room service here and the service and quality were on par with W's all over. I recommend staying here if you need to be downtown, and you "need" a place above the average, generic chain. I "need" to stay at the W, every time I visit Chicago...
