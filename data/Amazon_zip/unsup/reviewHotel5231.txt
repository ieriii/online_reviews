Location and price prompted my stay here, which are very great factors. The hotel was clean, looked dated, but clean. Staff was attentive, but there was no personality. Which is fine, we were there to sleep and relax. I cant say enough about the location. If you are walking, this is the ideal place in downtown to stay for cheap. Everything you need is within 1 mile, food, walgreens, attraction points/parks.
