On Food: Incredible. For the price, the meal was, by far, the best I have ever had.   On Reservations: Try calling between 1 and 3. Call well in advance and leave the date on the machine (if you don't get an answer). Either continue to call or just wait and hope. They seem to call folks back a couple of days before their requested reservation date.
