Great googly moogly, did we have fun at Sunda last night! Nothing happening in Chicago on a Monday night....wrong! This place was jammed and a great vibe throughout. We basically needed an intervention from our server to stop ordering the rock shrimp...can't image crack being more addictive. Our server, a Miami alum and out-of-work architect, was very friendly, attentive and took our nonsense in great stride. I will return with a support group to mitigate the rock shrimp over-indulgence...
