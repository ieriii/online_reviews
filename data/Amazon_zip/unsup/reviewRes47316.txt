Y'know, I wasn't sure about Lockdown at first. The blaring music, the crazy menu, the beer list......it just didn't sit well with me. But now? Love me some Lockdown. The music isn't quite so crazy, the burgers are phenomenal, the mac and cheese is fantastic, and the beer list is pretty good in its own right too. Even better, if you check in on foursquare, you get a free beer or shot. Since I only ever have one drink when I go out these days anyways, it's a great deal for me. Service is friendly, it's right down the street from my apartment, and now they deliver. It ain't Kuma's, but it's still pretty awesome.
