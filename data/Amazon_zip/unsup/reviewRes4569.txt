Finally made it over here! Only a 20 minute wait on a Friday at 6 pm. We ate: Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes- so tender, very rich and buttery, would gladly order again. Pig's ears with friend egg- BLAH . Did not care for this dish, just tasted like fried food. We didn't finish. Beets with whipped goat cheese- this dish was perfect. So tasty. Mussels- the sauce was awesome, I liked picking out little bits of pork out.  Overall total was $40, a little spendy for not so much food. I'd still recommend, just get there early to avoid a long wait! And skip the pig's ears.
