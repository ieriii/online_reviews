Sublime food. Mediocre service. Something really irked me about the emphasis on branding. I mean the belt buckles were cute, but our waiter had eight tables and one of them was an 8 top. He couldn't keep up and he had no idea about wine. But I would go back for the food. The kung pao sweet breads were the work of a genius.
