I think about Pequod's pan pizza and carmelized crust more often than I'd like to admit.  The fact that leggings are in style means that I eat it much more often than I should. Pequod's, you are the epitome of a love-hate relationship.  I love you. Hate what you do to my belly.  Really though, I love you.
