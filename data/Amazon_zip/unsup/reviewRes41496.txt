I'm not a huge meat eater per se but I do enjoy a good steak sometimes. For a chain restaurant and what not, this place had a classy touch and di not feel like a chain. However, the crowd was really really random. There were some people dressed to the nines and then I saw a guy in a hoodie. We dressed appropriately I would say, he wore a dress shirt and jeans, I had on a dress. Everyone was super nice and attentive and consequently, the service was great. Our waiter, Michael knew his stuff and was really helpful in recommending a wine for us. We went with a South Australian Shiraz to compliment our dishes. We go the seared ahi tuna app which was awesome. We also got the stuffed mushrooms which were good but a little too oily/buttery for me. My entree was the petite filet, no butter. It was cooked perfectly but there was little too much salt. I got the broiled tomatoes which were good, nothing special and probably not worth $8. BF got the full sized filet, butter and all. He really liked it. His side was garlic mashed potatoes, very very buttery tasting (which makes it good of course but I'm a health freak and I couldn't really imagine eating it). BF's entree came with dessert which was MORE than enough to share after such a big meal. A carrot cake and a mousse cup. (See the pics I've uploaded).
