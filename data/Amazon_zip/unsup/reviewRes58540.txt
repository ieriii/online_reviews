My husbands parents were in town visiting during the summer and we decided to try this place. When we got there they were an hour from opening. We were about to leave when the hostess told us that they would be able to seat us. They set up a table for us outside. We were so pleased with the friendliness of the staff. Then we were presented with The Best Italian food I have ever eaten. My over all experience was beyond compare. When you go try the Cappellacci all'Aragosta. It is a Handmade pasta stuffed with lobster in a creamy pink sauce with zucchini. Heavenly!
