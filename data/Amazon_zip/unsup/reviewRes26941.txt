There's something about Nuevo Leon that I'm a sucker for. Whenever I have a craving for the real-deal Mexican food, this is my go-to spot. More often than not, I find myself there at breakfast time on the weekend. I typically get Machacada con Huevo a la Mexicana. It's not much to look at on the plate, but the combination of dried beef and egg with the three colors of Mexico (represented by tomatoes, onions and jalapenos) is simply delicious. Meals (even breakfast) are typically preceded by an amuse bouche, which is a nice touch. Their homemade tortillas are fantastic as well. This isn't a fine dining spot, but you get a lot of great food for your money.
