Loved byob. Fresh tasting. Haven't had uni in a long time and just HAD to order it. It was as rich tasting as I remember although it doesn't compare to the uni fresh from the ocean in Japan. Either way.. Great sushi/sashimi. We had wasabi roll, rainbow roll, volcano roll, hamachi carpaccio special, large sashimi, fresh wasabi (extra fee) -- all for $100! Great food, great ambience, great price, great service... Priceless
