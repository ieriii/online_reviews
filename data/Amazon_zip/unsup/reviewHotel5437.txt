We stayed here on July 5th 2012. I found a good deal on Southwest airlines .com very surprised to only pay 89 bucks. On thing about Chicago is the parking we had to pay 55 bucks. It was valet with in and out privileges. The Rush street area was lively at night allot of restaurant's and bars all pretty pricy but within walking distance. The shops on Michigan ave are about .10 mile to 1/2 mile walk. The staff was very nice and helpfull. If you are lucky like we were you may see a famous person ask the valet at this place to park there car. We saw Brian Urlacler and his girlfriend Jenny McCarty walk right infrount of us. Avoid Jilly's on rush if it is hot NO AC.
