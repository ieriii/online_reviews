You know what? This is not Burger King. Deal with it. The decor alone is worth the trip to this place. So what if you can't get a rum and coke? If you drink Captain and Coke, you don't belong in this place anyway. Violet Hour is doing something different--they're not letting you "have it your way," and maybe that's a good thing! This is the kind of place you go with an intimate group, a significant other, or someone who appreciates atmosphere, class and perfect, and I mean purrrfect cocktails. Don't hate on the pretension of the place; you're the one who walked into a bar without a sign, right? This isn't a slam-bang, martini sloshing, beer-guzzling, sticky floor kinda place. The folks at Violet Hour are giving you an experience. Think Alice in Wonderland, think mink stoles, the swish of silk and flickering candle light, think romance, elegance and seriously attractive wait staff. So get your glad rags on, open your mind, grab a girlfriend and have an experience instead of getting hit on and felt up at a cheesy sports bar. The drinks, oh the drinks. They make their own bitters, and those bartenders work like well-coiffed dogs, lovingly muddling your mint and carefully adding Elderflower liqueur and lillet. They don't screw around, and I guarantee its the best $11 you'll spend in Chicago. I think the no-standing thing is great. I think the no-cellphone thing is great. I think this place is so great, I want to get married here. I want to bathe in the cucumber, rosewater and mint gin cocktail. I want all the negative reviewers to take back the mean things they said! All you narrow-minded fussbudgets, stick to your own bars. If you don't get it, you don't deserve it.
