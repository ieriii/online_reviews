Irazu is great, which you totally wouldn't know from the outside. It looks like a dump, it's about the size of a postage stamp, and inside is an awesome Costa Rican restaurant. :) If you go here, consider trying the potato tacos; they're excellent.  For the meat-eaters, the bistec tico is well worth trying as well. Despite the crowded environment, the service when I've been here has always been good, and I've never had to wait /too/ long for a table.
