Delish! My new husband and I made Carnivale our first stop on our honeymoon food tour...and it was amazing! Latin/Cuban/Carribbean fusion is the best way to describe the cuisine..and the decor. For our appetizer, we had a ceviche trio which was spicey, fresh and delish. I had a delicious marinated, grilled flank steak piled on top of a huge pile of flavorful rice and beans. My husband had a huge porkchop with plaintains and sweet potatoes. The entire meal was washed down with caipirnhias and mojitos (they have a huge list of rums). We were pleasantly surprised by a carmelized date chocolate cake with pineapple ice cream. The incredible service and fun atmosphere made Carnivale a place we will definitely revisit!
