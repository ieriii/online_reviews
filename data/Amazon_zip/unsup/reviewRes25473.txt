It feels kind of superfluous to give these guys another review on top of their 1000+, but I need to emphasize, after somehow ignoring this place for so many years: You just can't not eat here. You cannot live in or visit this city without eating here. You are in a city that prides itself on its food, and this is the place at the very top of the city's collective imagination and, I guess, self-image. THIS is where you take people to show them what Chicago pizza is. This is what you envision when you think about Chicago pizza. At Pequod's, I was looking at the Platonic ideal of pizzas, and it had a caramelized crust.
