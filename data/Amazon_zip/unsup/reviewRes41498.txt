where is the option for five dollar signs on the valentine's prix fixe? but really, it's OK. it still gets a Yelp star for every dollar sign. i wish the whole byob thing would make it's way out to san francisco. bonsoiree has partnered with great wine shops to make your dining experience spot freaking on. the ambiance is perfect, even if you're sitting in the corner with your head right next to the kitchen window. the food is amazing. paired with the recommendations, we could not have asked for a better meal.
