I absolutely love this place. The experience is fun and the food is fantastic. Lamb chops are my favorite. The salad bar is also very good. Also, the cheese bread is TO DIE FOR. Last time I went here, they ran out of cheese bread, which completely ruined the meal for me. But assuming they have everything in stock, this place is a great place to eat. Come very hungry!
