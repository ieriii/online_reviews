I went recently and had to wait for a friend(an hour)due to my cellphone not working.The owner brought me complimentary edamame and the waitress made me feel very comfortable.I ordered the sushi platter and it was very fresh.The atmopshere is lively and colorful,food tasty and the service was attentive.So grateful to have you in hood!
