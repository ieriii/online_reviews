Compared to other Korean Restaurants, just average at best. On the plus side, they use real wood charcoal for BBQing the meats, and lots of panchans. On the negative, the panchans were not particularly spicy or interesting. Most dissappointing was the Service, which as is often the case at Korean restaurants, we were treated as something less than desired guests, not being Korean. They paid no attention to us whatsoever, no refill of water until we flagged someone down, no offer to replentish the panchans, no offer of assistance with the BBQ (not that we needed it, but novices would have) -- and, all this even after we displayed our affinity for Korean by ordering Soju (and, even by name -- Jinro SoJu). Much prefer KangNam, as our favorite Korean.
