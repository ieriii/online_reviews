Six word review: Best brunch I've had in Chicago. The details: I went to Publican for the first time with a group of 10 or so at brunch. From the first sip of the Publican mimosa (which, yes, is made with beer) to the last bite of my side of bacon, my taste buds were very happy, and even a tad jealous after seeing what everyone else had ordered (i.e. the french toast). The service was very attentive, and the atmosphere feels homey despite the size of the dining room. And it's fun to watch the people eating in the pig-stall booths.  All in all, Publican reminded me of a Midwest version of Cochon in New Orleans, which is a very good thing indeed.
