If you want to feel fancy, head on over to Fox and Obel. I had been hoarding a Groupon for months and it was about to expire. I felt an enormous amount of pressure with this Groupon (for some unknown reason) to make good purchases. It was a $25/$50 coupon and I wanted to maximize my Fox and Obel joy. I walked in and was greeted by aisles and aisles of fancy, expensive, gourmet foods. I knew two things walking in: I wanted booze and I wanted cheese Cheese selection was awesome. I got a sexy wedge of Fromager d'Affinois and continued on my gourmet food prowl. The booze selection was a LITTLE lacking, but that didn't stop me from perusing the aisles for delicious adult beverages. I settled on a bottle of Pimm's, because summer is coming and I must consume 500 Pimm's Cups before it's over. I knew I wanted to get a fun, splurgey item I wouldn't ordinarily buy for myself. But what? Then it hit me. Truffle salt! It's was the most expensive salt I will probably ever buy. My husband jokes that he's going to put it in his canned soup, and I told him that he's banned from using it. Those three items put me at $55. It was a fun shopping trip and I wanted to go back to try their baked goods and candy. And of course, more cheese and adult beverages.
