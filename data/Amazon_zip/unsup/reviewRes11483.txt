Went with friends this past weekend on a Friday night and it was VERY good. Granted, we waited about 45 minutes for a table, but we didn't mind too much since we were able to get a beer beforehand. We really enjoyed the ambience of the building and thought the bar layout was great. What we figured out was to go straight to the back of the bar rather than fight to try to get a drink near the front (which is where everyone was waiting). I'm a big fan of German beer, so when I saw dunkleweiss on the menu, I knew I had to try it. It was a delicious beer, so much so, I ordered another one! The pizza came very quickly once we had ordered, and it also did not let us down. The server was also great and quickly took our order but didn't make us feel rushed.  Overall, we'd be happy to come back again, and we're prepared to wait.
