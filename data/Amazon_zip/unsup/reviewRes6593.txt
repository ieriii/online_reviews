My wife and I went here a couple months ago and have a reservation to go tonight with her twin sister and husband. I like bbq more than my wife does, so I'm excited to go back, because I had the pulled pork and it was great. I like that they give you a big portion so you can have it the next day too if you don't eat it all. Good cocktails and big open restaurant make for a good evening out. Close to public trans too.
