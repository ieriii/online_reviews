Coming to Geja's is definitely about the experience. You have the low lighting, violin player walking around from table to table....very romantic. As far as the food I think my favorite is the cheese fondue. The seafood fondue was pretty good as well. Regardless I wouldn't find myself going back to Geja's...it's kind of like a "Been there, done that." kind of thing.
