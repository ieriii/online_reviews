I don't know how anyone who's actually going here with the expectations that "I'm gonna nom on some meat" isn't happy and full when they leave. Skirt Steak is the way to go, although we really enjoyed the grilled baby octopus. Outstanding stuff. Recommendation is to try one of the combination platters to share with you and your co-pilot, an app, and some crazy good coconut flan to seal the deal.
