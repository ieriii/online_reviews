I've been to this place three times and each time it has been delicious!  The first time I went with my boyfriend he go the cubano sandwich and I got the ropa vieja dinner. The cuban sandwich was fantastic! Ham, pork, swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard smashed to perfection in crusty white bread. The ropa was great too. It comes with a side of rice, beans, and sweet plantains.  Be aware, there are no tables in this place. There are about 10 booth seats, so be ready to get friendly with your neighbor.  The owner is very friendly and the food is quick and tasty. I plan on becoming a regular. Try the cubano and a cuban coffee if you are in the mood.
