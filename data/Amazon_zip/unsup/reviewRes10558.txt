2nd time around put a wrench in my first experience, sorry Tony.  Definitely not an equal experience and rather disappointing, I have to be very honest.  Our hostess was rather rude and "gave away" our table as she was about to seat us at it. Huh ?  Certainly didn't get things off to a good start.  I actually ordered the same thing (Ravioli Piccolo Sogno) because the first time I went I absolutely LOVED the dish.  This time around, sadly, I have to report, it was dry, possibly recooked, and swimming in a pool of butter that was not pleasant to my palette at all.  The waitstaff has an issue with wanting to take away plates before you are even done with your salad, etc. and a multiple polite "no, not yet" doesn't seem to work.  My 13-year old son said his gnocchi was "just so-so" and let me tell you, he does not have discriminating taste and is a huge fan of gnocchi wherever / whenever he can get it.  My partner also ordered the same thing she had the first trip, (frutti di mare) but said it was also not fresh tasting.  Sr. Priolo, please, per favore, se prende un cuoca nuova o dice qualcosa in defensa, I am reluctant to reduce your star rating, but I just cannot justify raving to friends about your restaurant if it's going to be mediocre.  It was my 44th birthday dinner too, so I am bummed we spent over $125 for a less than celebratory evening.   Oh, and stick to your original caponata recipe, the one I had on Tuesday, December 2nd, sucked.  1 star reduction.
