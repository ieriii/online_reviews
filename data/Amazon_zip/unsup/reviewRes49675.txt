This place has a special place in my heart :) For two reasons one being their steak is absolutely delicious, from the tenderness to the amount of spices. Every bite gives a little tingle in your mouth. Secondly, this was the place for my first date with my boyfriend. It was a frustrating night because the strap of my shoe broke, and I was super nervous. The staff was attentive, and helped the night go smoothly. Steaks and empanadas are the way to go ! The menu is extensive, and the tables are good for groups as well. They have vegetarian options too. You can scope out the menu online before you head over there :) It can get crowded on the weekend though, with being BYOB and the quality of their food. **Las Tablas moved across the street ! ** It now holds a special place in my heart as my boyfriend proposed to me here in November 2008 :)
