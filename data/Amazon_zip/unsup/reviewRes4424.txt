The frenzy of the autumn quarter is now over (hip hip hurray) and I finally decided that it was high time I wrote my first Yelp review! And what better choice for that than one of the first places I visited when I moved to Chicago? Of course, at the time, Yelp was not yet on the map, but some things just never change and the Green Mill is one of those things. Well, actually, one thing made it even better: it is now a non-smoking space and that's like the cherry on the cake. As for my other favorite ingredient -- yes, I have a very sweet tooth so i often think in terms of food -- it's seeing all those graceful jazz cats do their moves on that tiny dance floor every Thursday night. Some people even come dressed in the style of the 30's and 40's. Between that, the rich decor, the speaker commenting on the songs and cracking old jokes, and the wonderful music/singing, it is such a blast... like traveling through time!
