Just under the 1 year mark of moving 4 blocks away I finally made it to Spacca Napoli- wooo! Outdoor seating on a quiet neighborhood street? Pizza crust that's both thin and chewy? 4 Italian beers and an extensive wine list? A prosciutto and mozzarella antipasto with an 8oz ball of cheese? Unnecessary use of question marks? 7pm seems to be the magic point after which you can look forward to waiting for a while before sitting down (one of the chefs brought some pizza around to those poor souls). They're also now open on Tuesdays apparently. Takes reservations, but not Friday and Saturday. They're very, very close to a 5th star here but for a $13 funghi pizza I want better than button mushrooms. And the aforementioned 8 oz mozzarella ball app ran $15 but only had 2 giant spinch-esque basil leaves. Turn that into a handful of baby basil and life gets real good real fast.
