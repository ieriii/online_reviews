Rick Bayless and his crew rock, big time !!! This is just about the best Mexican food outside of Oaxaca, San Miguel de Allende, DFA, Toda Santos, etc. When on the menu I must have the swiss chard with Queso Blanco - right now a featured appetizer is oysters with habenero mioneta which will make you swoon, tamal de rajas are sublime! No need to go on - everything (yes, EVERYTHING) on the menu will satisfy the most discerning diners.Must go place - my favorite place - the flavors will jump off your tongue!
