We were a bit hesitant at first to book a reservation as the reviews seemed so flip-floppy, but we did anyways and boy were we impressed. I'm happy to say that while dining at GE while on a trip to Chicago, I experienced something so wonderful, incredible, and possibly life changing, that I'm quite sure it will remain unmatched.After taking a seat at the bar, because we arrived early, we proceeded to order a bottle of wine for myself and two girlfriends. Unfortunately the wine was not chilled so we were presented with glasses of champagne whilst the bottle was readied. Our bartender was fantastic, lively and set a great mood for the rest of the night by playing certain songs just for us.Once we were seated, Jeff did everything in his power to make our meal memorable. From working with the kitchen to modify some of the menu due to a food allergy at our table, to the wine pairing, to an extra course of foie lollipops, we were well taken care of. Not to mention the other servers...there's a great team at GE.Pro-Tips: 1. Go big or go home. 15 course tasting menu and the wine pairing...it's so spot on.2. Be open to the experience, appreciate it, and be enthusiastic...any other mindset and this dining experience is not for you.
