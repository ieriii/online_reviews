AH-MAZE-ING. So I heard about this place well after it opened and in that short time span have been dying to try it...rather begging my husband to tag along with me. We called earlier in the day to find out if we could make a reservation and without luck we decided to walk-in and bear the promised long wait. We didn't actually make it in until closer to 9 and we had just enough time to order a glass of wine and a beer from their amazing list (most of the wines I had never heard of and the beer list had about 60 to choose from - 5 of which I could possibly pronounce) before we were sat. The room is comprised of 2 communal dining tables and about 10 2-tops and completely enclosed barn door booths. We sat in the middle of a communal table and while it was extremely loud, we didn't mind the commotion of everyone else's meals going on around us and it gave us the opportunity to preview what we wanted. We had the selection of hams as an appetizer which included a thinly sliced version from Tennessee that was the equivalent of butter. Blake had the pork belly which was beyond words - even for him- which says YOU HAVE TO ORDER THIS. I had the mussels which was served in the all clad copper pot of butter, beer, and leeks that it was simmered in and came with a warm loaf of french bread wrapped in brown paper bag. I barely left a crumb or a drop...and that included the fries cooked with egg and served with garlic aioli and the fresh ricotta we had on the side. I could have passed on the waffle we had for dessert, but I was in such a euphoric state that it didn't matter. I will be going back again...and again...and again.
