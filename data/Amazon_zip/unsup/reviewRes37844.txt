I love the beer selections and the atmosphere. I don't mind the 45 min wait since they have a great bar upstairs where you can sit, drink, and chat. What I don't love is feeling of my arteries beginning to harden as I eat their food. The amount of salt in everything is overwhelming. Sure it gets you to drink more but now I have to worry about my blood pressure? But I'm so young!
