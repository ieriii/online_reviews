Great place for a bite to eat before a movie. The crubled sausage and basil deep dish pizza is AWESOME! Might be my favorite pizza joint in the city. If you are going to a movie however, do a pizza order call ahead, and when you check in, tell them you have a movie time--- otherwise, they don't put the pie in the oven until your table is ready!
