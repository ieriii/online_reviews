What an offal restaurant! I just had to get that sweet one liner out before I forgot. In reality, it must be a great restaurant as it was still packed at 10 pm on Tuesday. In honor of Ryan L.'s birthday, the lovely Brett D. planned a celebration at The Publican. According to Facebook, Ryan's birthday isn't until February, but I didn't want to hurt Brett's feelings, so I decided to run with it. Due to a prior engagement (sorry you suckas didn't get into the Elite event, but you would have gone too), I arrived an hour late, with man date Nikki C. in tow. While there was no way Nikki and I could physically sit anywhere near the table, the hostess kindly offered us the table directly behind the friends. This worked perfectly because I was about 2 feet and 140 degrees away from Erin P., who likes to trade food. Oh wait, did I say perfectly? I meant offally (never gets old). Over the course of dinner, we traded some of our fried-egg-topped french fries and pork rinds for pig ear, tripe, and chicken. Nikki and I also romantically shared large plates of sweetbreads and country ribs, some of which we traded for a bite of sorbet. I think we all came out ahead from the barter system.  Almost everything was excellent. The pork rinds were unremarkable and I'm sorry, but I just can't get down with tripe, no matter where I'm dining. Anything that looks like a honeycomb, chews like an octopus, tastes like beans, and is a cow's reticulum is just kind of unappetizing to me. The sweetbreads and ribs, however, are must-orders. The fries are amazing too. I think they're cooked in baby dolphin fat or something. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for slightly adventurous meat eaters. I can't speak to the fish or veggies, since those seem kind of pointless when you can just eat meat, right? I apologize for all the name dropping in this review. If you feel left out and would like me to add your name, I'll figure out a way to squeeze you in, even if you weren't there.
