I love this place so much. When some family from Austria came to visit my family a few summers ago, we decided to take them here for a unique dining experience. It was my first time here, and I fell in love! The buffet is pretty good, however, I didn't go there much. It was the entres that I was after. (If you only eat from the buffet, like I saw one girl do, you probably won't really like this place. Also, if you are a vegetarian, almost every entre is meat, so this wouldn't be the best place to go.) The entres were all amazing, the swordfish especially. It takes a while for the different entres to come around since there are so many, so go with people that you can have great conversations with. You're looking at an hours-long meal here. Also, I remember this place being a bit pricey, what with all of the fine and high-quality meats they offer. Also, I was there for dinner, so the prices could differ for other parts of the day. The serving staff are all very nice. (Or, at least, they were when I was there. It's been about 2 years since I was last there, I think.) Our waiter overhead my one cousin talking about how he was studying to be a chef, so the server brought him into the kitchen so he could see how everything was assembled! I thought that was very kind. All in all, I can't wait to go here again and relive that delicious food-induced coma. This place makes me feel unashamed to be the massive glutton that I am.
