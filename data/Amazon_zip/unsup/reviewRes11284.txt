For a few moments after our breakfasts were placed in front of us at the Bongo Room, I was pretty ticked off.  Don't get me wrong: The food looked great, and it ended up being delicious. But we live in Cincinnati, and I was immediately reminded that our town, unlike Chicago, plus some other smaller cities I have lived in and visited, doesn't have a single restaurant like the Bongo Room. In other words, a casual and comfortable and unpretentious, yet urbane place that turns out hearty and delicious breakfasts with care and flair. (Cincy's got some nice weekend brunch options, but nothing of this sort.) But I have already digressed.... A breakfast burrito is a standard-issue fare for a place like this, but the Bongo Room's was one of the better ones I've ever had. The fresh house-made salsa was better than what you get in many Mexican restaurants. (By comparison, one of the few breakfast burritos available in Cincinnati is served with sludge that probably is Pace Picante Sauce.) Chipotle (?) sour cream and guacamole were good, too, and the eggs were perfectly scrambled. "Hash browns"/home fries were great, too, although not quite the flavor bomb their mouth-watering appearance suggested. The wife got the blueberry pancakes, which came with this delicous sugar-cookie butter; she said it was almost as good as her mama's blueberry pancakes, and that's saying something.  The Bongo Room serves good strong coffee and, on the weekday morning we were there, we had great service.  If I were more enamored of breakfast food in general, I'd probably go with a five-star rating. Plus, I read about these nightmare lines on weekend mornings.  But based on one weekday-morning experience with no line in sight, it's a soild four-and-a-half.
