2.5 stars. Meat was good, salad bar was ok, atmosphere was ok. I much prefer the variety of choices at the Zed 451 harvest table and its beautifully decorated dining area.  The salad bar was fine, but not quite as many choices as those found at Zed 451, and the choices were not as interesting. Plain salad, or beets, or asparagus; fewer cheese and meat choices, and no salad combinations with tantalizing sauces. The bread basket was delicious- a soft, spongey cheesy bread made with yucca flour and two types of cheeses, served warm. I could eat the whole basket! Meats were decent but many were overcooked, even when they said they were giving me the medium-rare part, but the leg of lamb was succulent, as was the bottom sirloin and garlic encrusted beef. Dessert was a little disappointing; neither the creme brulee, flan, molten cake nor key lime pie were very good, unlike the decadent desserts at Zed 451 (don't miss their butterscotch bread pudding!). Overall, not quite as good as I expected, especially given the reviews. Since there are several choices in the area, I recommend that you try somewhere else.
