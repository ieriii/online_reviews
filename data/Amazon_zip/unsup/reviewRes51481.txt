If you're looking for good bare bones Mexican food this is your place. If you're more into Mexican fusion (like Mixteco Grill & Fridas) or a healthier style of Mexican food you probably won't dig it.        Personally, I tend to favor the more basic style. Moreover, this place is nothing short of a bargain. I paid $9 for a combination platter, a dish which came with a Taco, Tostada, and 2 Enchiladas. The portions were huge and the Tostada had so much meat I could not see the shell. These are not lunch portions folks (even though we were there for lunch), you could probably feed two (moderately hungry) people with one $9 platter, can't beat that. All the items were pretty tasty also. I wasn't crazy about the salsa that can with the chips though, it was bland and almost tasted store bought.      The atmosphere is cozy and has a somewhat industrial feel. While the prices are low the atmosphere is nice enough for a casual date. The server was friendly and attentive and it's not the kind of place where you will sit with an empty water glass for several minutes.      If you're looking for a new twist to an old favorite you won't find it here. However, if you just want a good old fashion Enchilada for a great price Garcia's is your place.
