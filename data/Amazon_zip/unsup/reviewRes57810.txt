Wow! My first time at Nana's was this weekend for the pajama brunch. Wear your pjs and get a free mimosa...what a concept!The food was AMAZING.I ordered the breakfast burrito and about died it was so good.Fresh ingredients, creative blend of flavors, loved it.The service was excellent.Sunlit tables, bright open design.Although I live in Edgewater, I will certainly make the trek south again for this outstanding restaurant.Veggie friendly.I want to go back for the fixed price dinners.
