I'm a regular of Tuan's who gets carry out from this place several times a week. Let me tell you, this is one of the best places in Lincoln Park. The manager Tuan always has me sat down comfortably while I'm waiting for my food, I always get some hot warm tea to sip on, or water when it's warm in the summer.I'm a huge fan of the Basil Jalapeno beef, shrimp springrolls and chicken fried rice. However, what made me write this review was that Tuan recently told me he was trying out a new item on the menu and sent it home with me. It was a new variant of his simply it sandwich, it had fish, mayonnaise, cilantro, carrots, radish, some peppers and delicious it was down to the very last bite! I'm not usually a big fan of fish but this was just absolutely amazing and I think I will order it with my usual when it hits the menu.5/5 stars, great service, great food, and they go beyond the limits to keep me happy and healthy.
