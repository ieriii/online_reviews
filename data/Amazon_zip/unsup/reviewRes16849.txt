I am going to start off by saying I lived in England for a year. Once you have had enough greasy bland and disgusting British food, Indian cuisine becomes a hard and fast staple in your diet. England has great Indian food and a great selection of restaurants and India House can hold its ground with those. This place is better than Devon Avenue . I have been here countless times for the lunch buffet. In general I am not a buffet fan but this one is really good. My only complaint is they don't have a curry dish, but I will let that slide. There are a few real stars on the buffet that deserve real attention. The Chicken Tiki Masala is great. So good that we joke that their is crack in it, because we can never get enough.  Then the other real star is the mango ice cream.. I cannot say enough about how tasty that is. The dinner is about just as good as their lunch buffet, but costs three times as much. Also, veteran tip, get here at 1100-1130am, this way it is not that crowded and the food on the buffet is extremely fresh.
