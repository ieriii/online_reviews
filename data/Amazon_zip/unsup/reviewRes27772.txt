Love it! We've been here at least 3 times now and it has been pretty good each time. The quality is sometimes inconsistent but you can't beat the great price and fun atmosphere. Plan on waiting for a seat. The first time we had the best guacamole dip ever, but were disappointed the other times. It is definitely a place worth checking out!
