Three stars for nostalgia's sake because my mother was a former employee of this hotel during the early to mid-1970's. Minus half a star because the story goes that some of the guest's rooms are apparently haunted by ghosts. I don't believe in ghosts but the constant sound of wind blowing past the door plus intermittent faint cries sends shivers down my spine.
