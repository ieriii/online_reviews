I'll say this first: However you feel about Cheesecake factory, you'll feel the same way about this place. My cousin is a Cheesecake factory fanatic, and she claims everything about Grand Lux Cafe from the decor to the menu items are a carbon copy of Cheesecake factory. That being said, the portions are very large just like Cheesecake factory, and the desserts very diabetes-inducing rich yet delicious. Red Velvet cake: Like most red velvet cakes, very heavy and delicious. Strawberry shortcake: Not a big fan, but never was in particular. Still a big portion size though. New Orlean Beignets: Ok, from the pictures I thought these would be golf-ball sized beignets. Don't be fooled! These are huge baseballs of fried dough - very flaky on the outside and creamy on the inside like they should be, dusted with powdered sugar and served with 3 indulgent sauces. Get these. Share.
