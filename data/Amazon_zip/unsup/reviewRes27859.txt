I live in southern California and I can't find anything as good as Frontera. This is simply my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  Now clear your schedule because the wait times are insane-but it's so worth it. Go with a bunch of people and share. Ceviche: fresh, tangy.. Queso Fundido: Cheese with chorizo sausage, onions, peppers--a cheese lovers delight, a heart attack waiting to happen perhaps, melty, gooey, even a little oily--but you need some oil to soak up some of the tequila. Duck quelsadillas-perfection. Black beans are just right...Rick's cookbooks are also the real deal. My mom has channeled him on occasion. Also, it's just a cool place with trippy art everywhere--even the bartender has a Surrealist Salvador Dali-esque mustache.
