ahh what a disappointment ! !!! we had the caprese appetizer with prosciutto which was the highlight of the meal. the prosciutto and the cheese and crackers were very very tasty also had the pumpkin ravioli which was also decent, especially the pumpkin pieces outside of the ravioli which seemed to have been baked in butter and were savory whereas the inside of the raviolis had a sweet taste, which was a good contrast. but the flavors grew tired after several bites. and the chicken pesto gnocchi -this got old after about 2 bites, gnocchi was nice and tendy, slightly chewy, but the flavor of the pesto was nothing special and hence i invited the tabasco and parmesan cheese to party all over the plate service here was pretty wack, and the wine we had had little particles floating in it bc whoever corked it did it poorly wouldnt recommend
