Yes, a solid four stars. As evidenced by the hundreds of yelp reviews on this place, Nuevo Leon may be the most famous Mexican restaurant in Pilsen. And deservedly so, I think - good ambiance/decor, friendly crowd, very inexpensive, and solid food. This is a great place to take people from out of town and new to the city; good place as a starting/ending point for Pilsen exploration. The food! First, I warn of the guacamole. For some reason, the guacamole is weirdly bland. Couldn't tell you why - there were no less than four types of salsas on our table last night, each of a different flavor and all with enough kick to open up your sinuses a bit. But now the good stuff: I always like the enchiladas and the chilaquiles, and friends have reported favorably on the burritos and taco platters. Also, you will want a horchata. They are more than worth a dollar and really add a delightful cinnamon-vanilla lining to the whole dining experience. Possibly my favorite part of eating at Nuevo Leon is the random, complementary appetizer you are served alongside your salsa and chips - usually a sort of pork-bean-tortilla combo, though occasionally a cup of chicken-based soup. Even for a vegetarian who doesn't actually eat them, the appetizers just make the whole experience a little more interesting and unique than your typical Chicago mexican place.
