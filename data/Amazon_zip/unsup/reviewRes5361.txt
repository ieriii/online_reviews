I have to say it, I had HEARD great things. I had READ great things. But my experience here exceeded even what I had heard and read. The food is impeccably beautiful & so tasty. Perfect small-bite & antipasti accompaniments to the wine & beers they serve. Great after-work wine place.  The beet salad w/ whipped goat cheese is to-die-for, the fried pig's ear (YES, I SAID PIG'S EAR!) is sooo tasty w/ a beer or crisp white wine. The deviled egg is also interesting and inventive. Everything left me wanting MORE. GREAT wine-by-the-glass menu too. Or you can get a little carafe which is more like a glass and a half. I appreciate that! Don't miss the nutella, banana, marshmallow panini for dessert too!
