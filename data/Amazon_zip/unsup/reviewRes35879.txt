I was a Shaw's regular until I lost my full time job. I went there this past week and I was a little disappointed. The service was amazing but when asked to change from a table to a booth the reception was a bit icy. I usually order King crab legs and they weren't as "generous" as in the past and the shrimp cocktail wasn't as impressive either.
