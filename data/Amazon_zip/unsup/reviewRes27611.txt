Honestly I came into this place not knowing whether I'd like it or not, but everything here really blew me away. with just a couple of small exceptions.  The space is really nice - feels relaxed and cool. They played music that could have been from my own playlists... this is always a plus.  The idea of the popcorn at the beginning was cutesy, but it was very tasty. The desconstructed Italian beef was tasty, but I didn't care for the bun. Luckily, this would be the only think the whole meal that I didn't like. My second app, a creamy (squash? sweet potato?) soup was awesome... ginger infused marshmallow that melted for the cream? Awesome! Spicy jam to mix in? Awesome! My only small complaint, which I realize at about this point of the meal, is that they are going to elaborate on every dish in a really monotone, bored manner. Either don't elaborate on every ingredient, or don't act like it pains you to do so. Easy enough! My pork belly entree was pretty good as well, but was quickly overshadowed by the best flourless chocolate cake ever. Damn, that was a tasty meal.
