Food Love. And right in the midst of my neighborhood. Our waitress was helpful in all the right ways from characterizing the flavor of dishes to being all around friendly and witty. We sat outside in back and enjoyed the waning days of summer. The ribs and roasted chicken were amazing. The gnocchi also got the thumbs up. We didn't spend as much time here as I would have liked because our guests were leaving town that evening, but I am dying to go back and almost certainly will.
