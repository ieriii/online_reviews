I've never had a savory crepe so this was a fun first time experience. I had the Greek Crepe (which I find hard to say for some reason, my mouth wants to say "greepe crepe") and it was so nommies. It had several of my favorite things inside - bebe spinach, fresh tomato, garlic, and olives, and some other stuff. It was delightful. I also tried the raspberry sherbet, which was very good. They even served my Sprite in an oldschool glass bottle, how fun! The decor is colorful and service was very friendly. Will be back!
