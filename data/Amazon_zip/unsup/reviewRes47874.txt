My experience at ZED was extremely mixed. I arrived at around 9:30 PM with a friend on Friday, July 3rd. We were meeting a group of other friends, who had arrived just 15 minutes earlier. We choose ZED because of the rooftop. Anyway, when we arrived, we were told the rooftop was full so we would have to put our names down and wait. It was weird because our friends, who were only 15 minutes ahead of us, were able to go right up. Because it became "full" so recently, I assumed we were on top of the wait-list and that we would be up shortly. Several groups of people left from upstairs during the time that we were waiting, but we were not allowed up. In fact, no one else that was waiting was either, so we got kind of suspicious. I almost felt as though it was trying to act "exclusive" and "popular" when it really wasn't. Anyway, after waiting for about 30-40 minutes, we were finally called to go upstairs. Once upstairs, our experience changed dramatically. We met some people who invited us to their table. We ordered bottles of champagne. The service was impeccable - the waiters were bringing us shots of Patron and various appetizers on the house. The food was great - I really liked the egg rolls and cheese fondue. The bread was amazing! The rooftop was also really nice, with a decent view of the surrounding buildings (it was not high enough for a great view of the city, but it was not bad). I recommend ZED, but have to say it was a bit pretentious. And be ready to spend $$.
