I ate at Yolk for the first time today. It was not quite what I built it up to be. Our server, Dino, seemed he was in a hurry, even as we explained it was our first visit. Once we ordered, the food came quick. My girlfriend had the eggs benedict, which she asked me if it was supposed to be served cold? I had the Santa Fe, which was good, with a LOT of avocado! Dino dropped the check, and we saw he was more interested in rolling silverware with the server girls, then dealing with us. I will go back, as the menu still looks tasty.
