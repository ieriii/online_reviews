My husband and I had a wonderful anniversary meal here a couple of weeks ago. It was a Sunday evening, about 6:30 and the middle room only had a few tables filled. The music was at a perfect volume and the lighting was romantic/cozy. Perfect for a special meal. :-) We started with the Taste of Cuba platter, because we really wanted empanadas (why isn't there an empanadas app??) and we weren't let down. They were delicious as were the croquetas! I could have made a meal of just that platter, but I'm glad I didn't. I had the Cuban Style Chicken for my entree and it was absolutely devine. A perfectly grilled skin-on chicken breast with a light (as in not made with heavy cream) garlic sauce that was perfectly seasoned. The chicken skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. It was amazing. The black beans and rice were good and the grilled plaintains were pretty decent too. My husband had the Ropa Vieja. He said it was delicious! I only had a little bite, but that was very good. The steak is shredded and looks like bbq beef, but the sauce is more tomato-y than tangy and is quite a good complement to the meat. We shared a dessert of guava cheesecake and that too was delicious. Seriously, everything we ate here was great! Not a morsel left on any of the plates! I can't wait to go back to try the Cuban sandwich and the honey jalapeno pork chops. Or maybe the salmon or the pistachio crusted chicken or brunch or...or...or...you get the idea!
