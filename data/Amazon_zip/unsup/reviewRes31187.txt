I came here for brunch a couple weeks ago. I was excited to try this place because it is so unique for the area. When I think Bridgeport, fresh, local, and organic aren't terms that usually come to mind.  I ordered something very simple, just eggs, bacon and toast. I was a little disappointed they didn't have rye toast but sourdough was acceptable enough. My friend ordered the burger. I was quite pleased with my meal, although the server didn't bring me any butter for my unbuttered toast and I had to ask for jam. My friend was quite displeased with his experience, however. When he ordered the burger, the server asked him if he wanted an egg on his burger. He said no but when his burger was delivered it had an egg on it. When he flagged down the server, she took the plate back to the kitchen to remove the egg but then the burger came back with most of the cheese gone too. After all of this my friend did enjoy his burger and added it was one of the better burgers he had eaten. The food was great! I'm really interested to try dinner sometime because the menu looked delicious. I'm not completely turned off by the poor service but they really need to work on it!  I don't want an aloof hipster who acts too cool to serve me; I want a friendly and attentive server who acts happy to be there. If it's so painful, get a different job! Trisha, I'm talking to you.
