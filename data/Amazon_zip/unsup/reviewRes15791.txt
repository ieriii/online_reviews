Violet Hour has all the makings of a posh New York lounge, yet has the patrons of a large mid-western town. Hipster staff and a strange mix of folks, I wasn't sure what to make of this place. I'm not a fan of exclusive. I find door men....limited seating......attitude and decor that says...you are not good enough is a bit of a turn off. Not that Violet Hour is like that at all, but this lounge makes a huge effort to stand out in everything is does....from drinks to seating to decor. Nothing is normal, so-to-speak. Drinks, along with the furniture, are a real treat. My visit was a drink before heading off to dinner. "Eyes Wide" was a bourbon drink that caught my eye and a good choice, plus it was strong. With a creation time bordering on 15 minute along with the single long ice cube in the glass, the experience was refreshing in the bar scene. The place is large and I'd recommend sitting at the bar farther in the back to both allow you to see drinks being made as well as for some great people watching. The very back has a small fireplace and some large booth areas. So I'm trying to tell you to sit as far back as you can as I think the farther back you are in the place, the hipper you are, but I'm not very hip per se. Dark both in lighting and decor, it is an interesting experience in drinking and one I'd recommend to try at least once and something fun to take an out of town guest. Final note involves parking as they should have valet for this part of town as parking is a real challenge.
