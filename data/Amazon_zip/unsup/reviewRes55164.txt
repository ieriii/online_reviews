I really dislike this place. The only redeeming quality is the pickles, and they aren't any thing special they are just made of zucchini instead of cucumber. To me this seems like food snobbery at its best/worst- there is no advantage to making brisket out of kobe beef other than to be elitist. Brisket is cooked slow and low because its making the most out of the cheap left over cuts of meat- making it out of kobe only adds expense.  The corn bread is tasteless and dreadful- it feels like chewing on saw dust. OH I almost forgot about the Pretzel Roll!! Good lord I hate their pretzlel roll! Firstly, it totally overpowers the pulled pork or the brisket sandwich-all you can taste is bread. Secondly, I am not sure how they manage to consistently serve these things stale. The crust of these things is chewy like a still half frozen-straight out of the microwave bagel. I keep getting dragged to this place by people who live near it and either don't know any better or don't want to take a cab anywhere else- next time I get stuck going here I swear I'm going to pull a hamburger bun out of my purse to make the sandwich at least half way decent, AND so that my friends will know not to make me go here again. Two birds killed with one stone like pretzel roll!!
