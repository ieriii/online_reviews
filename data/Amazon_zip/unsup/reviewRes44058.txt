Went here for dinner on a weeknight and I do recommend that you make a reservation. I ordered the 18oz bone in delmonico steak and it was perfectly cooked with the mashed potatoes on the side. My experience was good and we never felt rushed at all. My only complaint is that the place is pretty cramped. We were shoulder to shoulder with the folks sitting next to us. Because of this I am giving this place 4 out of 5 stars.
