This place is amazing. Thank you yelpers for suggesting the foie gras. My sister and I spent the week visiting Chicago and somehow lucked out on about everything we did, and one of our bits of luckiness was not a single person in line at 11 AM. We walked right up and were treated with good customer service even when my crazy sister wanted ketchup.
