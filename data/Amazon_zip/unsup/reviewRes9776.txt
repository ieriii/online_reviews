Wow, I must have high standards if I'm the only 3-star rating for this restaurant to date. I'm torn about my rating because I can't give half-stars, otherwise I'd say this was a 3.5-star experience. I came here for Valentine's day with my beau and and we were seated in the back nook. We felt the place was small but ultimately we enjoyed the ambiance. Our waiter was professional, tended to us at the perfect intervals, and at the beginning he offered to tell us more about each dish on the menu. He did this because the menu is minimalist in style (just as you see it online). The dish you actually get ends up being a surprise. My boyfriend loved the unconvential food combinations, but I was less enthused because half the time I found some ingredient in the combination to be obtrusive or not welcome.  I was actually having trouble stomaching my food by the end of the meal because it just didn't fit together. My worst dish was the dessert: I ordered the butternut squash dessert and nowhere did the menu list mercury-weight donut holes (not everyone likes fried food). The ice cream and curry-syrup were delightful, but the squash puree was unsweetened and stuck out like a sore thumb as non-desserty. I suppose I like more continuity with my courses. I also ordered wine, the menu for which is also minimal and doesn't list year or origin. Really?? People have personal tastes and personal experiences with both food and wine... can a girl not know where her wine is from? I know I'm being picky, but I found this to be a little pretentious. I feel that patrons should be given more than a mystery box on a menu. On the bright side, we were given a taste of guava shaved ice, and it was amazing, but this was sadly the most enjoyable part of my meal. Overall we were both pleased with our main dish (him venison, me sablefish), the environment, and the experience, but I simply felt that the dishes were odd. We had a great date, but I'm not sure if I would bring a friend here.
