I'm going to give 3.5 stars on the basis that I believe that they just moved into a much larger space and possibly haven't yet settled there. We ordered two ducks ahead of time, and the table was ready for us when we arrived. We didn't get a waiter to attend to us for around 15-20 minutes. We weren't the only ones looking for serving staff, and you could see other tables standing up, looking around, etc. The food didn't come for another 45 minutes. We might as well have not ordered ahead of time at all, and we nearly missed the beginning of the play we were seeing afterward. In fact, a group of the same number who sat down after us got their food before us. They also ordered duck, and the serving staff actually carved it up right next to our table, when we'd been sitting there for quite some time without food. She also splattered someone at my table while cutting up the duck. Still it was fun to watch her carve the bird with so much efficiency and skill. Finally, our duck arrived, and we had a different server who proceeded to do a hack job carving up the duck. Once we had the food, it was amazing! I haven't had such mouth watering duck in a while. Yum!
