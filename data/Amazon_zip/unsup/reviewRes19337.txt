I should start out by saying that I love gastropubs, and this is definitely that. Decided to stop in and ordered Fish & Chips as well as the Brisket sandwich dish. Both were solid. The Fish & Chips were amazing. They are battered in Guinness and the fish isn't TOO fried, which was perfect. SOme of the other things on the menu looked good, but i think it's safe to say that most regulars agree that the Fish & Chips cannot be beat.
