First of all, boy am I happy I waited all of about 15 minutes... cause I would be giving them a 2 or a 1 star depending on how long my wait would have been. We decided to see what the hype was all about so we headed on our way down on a tuesday afternoon. The line was short and sweet and there were many choices to choose from, so we ordered a total of 5 dogs 4 from the specialty list and 1 bridget bardot. (see my pic) and an order of fries, too bad it wasn't the weekend or I would have opted for the fries cooked in duck fat. As we sat down we got our food in 5 minutes of less... Which was good since we were starving! When I looked at my dogs they didn't look very appealing at all and kinda on the small side for what they were charging, my bill was 45.00! And I was even more disappointed when I took a bite out of each and every one of my dogs ;0(... Nothing to rave about at all! I believe that all good hot dogs should have a snap when you bite into it, none of my dogs had this ;0(... Overall the service was prompt but my search for the perfect encased meat continues...
