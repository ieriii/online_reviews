I enjoy Yolk breakfast. They have a great menu and the food is well prepared. With that being said I have to give my experience with THIS location 2 stars. The problem: When arriving I was expecting a 45 minute wait. This isn't the issue. The issue is the waiting area is a walled off separate part of the building. The AC units don't blow into this part of the building and one whole wall is nothing but east facing windows. Needless to say it was extremely hot. Also, they did not have ANY chairs in the waiting area. What you are left with is a group of 30+ hot, ornery people sitting on the floor or standing for 45 minutes. This is not a great way to start the experience.  When we were called and given a table it was another 20 minutes before a waitress arrived to get our drink order. After spending 45 minutes baking in the sun I was in desperate need for something to drink. I know they were busy. I didn't need my food right away but a chance to order something to drink would have been appreciated. After getting a beverage the waitress disappeared for another 20 minutes. So in reality the wait time was more like 1.5 hours. The waitress, Iris, couldn't have been less personable or friendly. She was stressed which I get being as busy as it was but that isn't my fault as the customer. Hire more people or get servers that perform better under pressure. The food came which was delicious. I had the Eggs Benedict and they were great. I am not done with Yolk as a company I just wouldn't go to that location again unless it was on an off time and not in the summer.
