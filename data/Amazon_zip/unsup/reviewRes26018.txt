Had dinner here tonight with a couple friends during a quick study break. It was all our first time at the restaurant. The owner is super friendly and nice. Service was fast and friendly, as it wasn't too busy on a Sunday night. Prices are moderate, some a bit high for the amount of food in a serving. Decent beef pho at $6.50 if you can't get to Argyle. The atmosphere is cozy industrial with exposed brick walls and intimate, only a few tables in the dining room. Would definitely go back another time.
