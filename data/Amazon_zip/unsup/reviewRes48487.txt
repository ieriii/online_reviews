Not a huge fan to be honest. I read all the great reviews and tried a ton of dishes. I AM definitely a meat eater btw some of the less than stellar reviews were from veggies which is understandable. Definitely over-rated...not the best but definitely not the worst. I wouldn't go back as other places in the neighborhood have surpassed my expectations...but worth a try once.
