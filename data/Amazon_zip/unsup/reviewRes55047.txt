I went with my friend for opening night and was thoroughly impressed. Great funky dining room, eclectic music, exceptional fare, cocktails, and service. The bone marrow with onion jam was not to miss. Our scallops were perfectly seared. My sazerac perfectly balanced. And 2 dollar PBRs? In River North? Fantastic. Ill be back.
