A brunch that lives up to the hype! We arrived for Sunday brunch around 12:30 and there was a 30-minute wait -- we took a standing table in the bar and ordered a French Press. The service in the bar was not very good, our server ignored us twice, then didn't bring us any silverware to do cream/sugar. We had to hunt him down for the check once our table was ready - pretty annoying, so we can see how the other yelp reviews about poor service would be true. We ended up being seated in the bar at the counter facing the kitchen and it was really cool to see the chefs and cooks in action. They were out of the ricotta and pork neck bone gravy, the 2 things we wanted to order. We settled into our bloody mary's to plot our next move. My boyfriend landed on the fried french toast, hands down the best french toast we've ever eaten!!! It has the consistency of a beignet, and the compote that comes with it is fantastic. no need for syrup. I ordered the schnitzel and it was also fantastic. HUGE portion. We split a side of BACON, the BEST BACON EVER. Huge slices, super thick, perfect balance of fat and meat - DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! The food speaks for itself and we cannot wait to go back for round 2, where we hope to get the items they ran out of. Our service for brunch was really good and overall we had a fantastic time. The setting is great and the energy was really positive. We witnessed an owner interacting with the kitchen staff and it was very amiable. The executive chef is nominated for best chef of 2010 by Food and Wine Magazine, just another nod to how great Publican is!
