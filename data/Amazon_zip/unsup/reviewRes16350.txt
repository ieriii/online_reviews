Truly as good as it gets. We made a reservation and when we arrived (table of three), we were immediately sat. We all ordered a round of drinks: mojito's. Fabulous. Excellent mojitos. For our appetizers, we ordered the fresh guacamole and a curried beef dish, kind of like a pot pie that came with sweet potatos. The guacamole was stupendous. OMG. It was so good, we gourged ourselves on it. Same with the curried beef pot pie thing. For dinner, two of us had braised beef with polenta. The meat was so tender, it just fell apart on the fork. So delicious. Truly 5 star entree. My fiance had one of the steak options - we wish we remembered what it was called. It had snap peas in it? But it was delicious and he enjoyed his meal a lot as well. The waitress was phenomenal as well, she was very attentive and made excellent suggestions for the wine we each tried with our dinner entrees. We will definately be going back again. Excellent amibance, service, and food. Great for dates, special occasions, or when you simply just want a really tasty meal.
