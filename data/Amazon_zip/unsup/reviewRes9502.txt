Great ambiance and service. I did the pre-fixe and had the following: egg, mahi mahi and banana for dessert. The egg and dessert were awesome. The fish wasn't so bad but the flavors could have been stronger. Service is excellent....not snooty...very warm. And we saw Dale and he was as nice as could be. Great for a date night.
