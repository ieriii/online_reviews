Another pizza joint in Chicago but of course they put their own twist on things. Headed down to Wicker Park on a Wednesday night around 8 o'clock for a little night out with the lady friend. Pretty busy as expected but only a 20 minute wait. We hadn't eaten since lunch that day so we were both very hungry and our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We originally wanted to order two smalls with a handful of toppings (garlic, pepperoni, mushrooms, and spinach on one and chicken and bacon on the other) which range between $1.75 and $2.00. Our friendly and knowledgeable waitress gave us the heads up to order one large half and half to save some dough. Very nice of her even though it ended up being a $29.00 pizza. She was very good with suggesting beers to our liking. The Camel Toe was ridiculously drinkable at 13.25% alcohol and very dangerous at that. That being said the service was a delight. The serving vessel for the pizza was a large sheet tray and anything smaller would not have been suitable. Holy shit the large is a lot of pizza. Needless to say we walked out with a half a large which turned out to be a full pizza box. Next time I think a small would have sufficed with all the toppings. The brewery sets Piece apart from the rest. The beer list is extensive and have something to suit anyone beer palate. The place was pretty packed but the noise level was certainly tolerable. You could get away talking about pretty much anything and the people next to you would have no clue. Overall I was impressed with the whole experience but then again its pizza. Nothing out of this world and the one qualm...no ranch!? Maybe they didn't want to taint the creation that sat high on our table. The next nights leftovers with ranch took it to another level - maybe they should consider that...or I'll bring my own ranch next time.
