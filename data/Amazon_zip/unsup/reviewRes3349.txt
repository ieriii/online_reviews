Chicken! Big chicken wannnngs! The place was about to close be we snuck in just in time at 845pm and ordered some regular wings with a side of their bbq sauce. It's pretty pricey, 8.95 for 5 HUGE, i'm talking steroid given chicken, WINGs, and u can add on fries and a drink for 2.95 more. The place is small, so probably not the best for having too many people with you but i went with 2 other friends, 2 of us got wings, she got the spicy bbq, and i got the original with a side of bbq sauce, my other friend got one of the bowls when i got my food i was expecting hooters side wings, but the wings are bigger than the palm of my hand! their chicken tastes really good and their bbq sauce is spicy, pretty good, i enjoyed it and was with good company, the price is a little extravagant but it's pretty good for a korean place give it a try!
