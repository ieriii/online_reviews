Can't say enough about this place. Probably does not even need reviews but this is always delicious, always different and I love that Doug is always at the counter.  If you have not been here, do so, get there early and try as many things as you can.  Pheasant with Goji Berry was incredible Mountain Man is one of the best things I have had in a while. Hot Doug's Rules.
