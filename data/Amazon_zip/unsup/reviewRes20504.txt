Wow, best sushi in the city and a BYOB?? Have I died and gone to heaven?? I can't even begin to tell you my favorite thing on the menu, because everything rocks. Definitely get the Wasabi Tobiko though, especially if you have a cold or allergies. It clears up your head better than any cold medicine I've ever used. If you like fresh sushi, you'll love every single thing on the menu.
