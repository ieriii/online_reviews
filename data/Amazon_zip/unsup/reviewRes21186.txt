Love Rick Bayless' food, especially at Topolabampo, but didn't quite feel my Choriqueso torta was worth a 45-minute wait. Very good? Yes it was, but I was getting impatient and very hungry by the time we were eventually seated. Perhaps would enjoy Xoco more if calling ahead to pick up a takeout order.
