This was a bustling place the day a friend and I visited for lunch. Its one of those places I've wanted to try but found nearly impossible to frequent because its only open from the morning to mid-afternoon (it closes by 3PM). I had the Simply Vegetables Sandwhich which includes roasted, marinated vegetables, marinated portobello, roasted red peppers, and swiss on a Bavarian pretzel bun. It was simply delicious!!! Its hard to come by such a tasty vegetarian dish, and i would definitely return to this place just for that dish! My friend (in the true spirit of being in a French restaurant) decided to have some Crepes and those turned out amazing as well. Not too thin or thick and very tasty. We didn't feel like trying out the juices, so i can't really offer an opinion about that. This place would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that our waitress was pretty surly with us (perhaps trying to exude pretentiousness?)
