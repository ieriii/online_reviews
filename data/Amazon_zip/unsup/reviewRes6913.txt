The inside was very comfortable and classy. The service was GREAT, from the hostess to the waitress to the bus guys. Everyone was friendly and professional.  The food was wonderful. We shared alot. They bring out pickles and chips when you sit down. They were very tasty! We ordered the fried green tomatoes and hushpuppies for appetizers. The fried green tomatoes were perfect...not too much bread crumbs and the tomatoes were thick and juicy. The hushpuppies were moist and very flavorful. The pulled pork was REALLY GREAT, moist and delicious!!! The coleslaw was perfect too. The ribs were very moist and loved the bbq sauces! Our sides were wonderful....mashed potatoes and mac and cheese!! Driniks were great too!! Would recommend to small and large parties.
