The restaurant relocated about 1.5 blocks north of where it previously was but is still owned by the same owner, and presumably the same management, so everything is the same food wise - DELICIOUS. Sun Wah is an exceptional nothside option instead of driving to Chinatown.  I went there this past Saturday and had the Peking Duck, which is "off the menu." It cost $32 and includes the whole duck carved in front of you whilst onlookers gaze in envy, a tasty duck soup and duck stir fried rice.  Aside from the lacking service the place was very good. It is about 3.5 times larger than the previous location. It is also has very new-age hip look equip with fancy fans that have tiny fans rotating on a chromed beam.
