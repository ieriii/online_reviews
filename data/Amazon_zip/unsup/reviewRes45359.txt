I had my very first date with my husband here and it's a great place to have that memory! Great beer selection (if you're into that kind of thing), food is interesting without being fussy and is generally quite good. I haven't had anything "bad" here- just some things I preferred over others. Personal taste... you'll have to try for yourself! Lesson: be careful where you have your first dates. You never know when it's going to be your future husband/wife/partner and you don't want to go to a crappy restaurant on your anniversary. This place ain't crappy.
