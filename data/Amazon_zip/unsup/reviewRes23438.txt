Hi my name's Grace and I'm a spice-a-holic. I fell in love with Irazu as soon as they brought out the fresh home-made tortilla chips with the salsa verde. The chips were crispy and salty and super fresh tasting. The salsa verde was spicy and flavorful. The salsa could pretty much complement any of the dishes from Irazu, although not necessary. My boo and I also split a spinach cheese empanada which was a-mazing! The last time I had a empanada was at Tango Sur, where I was highly disappointed. This empanada was 10 x better than Tango Sur. The outside dough was crispy and thin and the spinach and cheese was perfectly melted and oozed out into my mouth with every bite. We also had the chicken sandwich and a breaded steak sandwich, we added hot peppers to both. The bread they used was a hearty french bread (I think). We also added avocado to the steak sando which made it super creamy. I'm sad that we didn't try out there oatmeal shake :( but will get it next time. The empanadas and hot sauce -- are enough to keep me coming back to this place!
