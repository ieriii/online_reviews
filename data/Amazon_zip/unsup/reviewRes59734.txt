Honestly I heard so much hype about this place and it was the biggest disappointment... It is ok pizza and that's being generous but it can't even compare with due's pizza which is the best deep dish pizza by far... And uno's which is the same company and recipe as due's... I know alot of you won't agree but art of pizza just doesen't compare to the original and best deepdish of Chicago...
