food was interesting. The server we had was the worst server i've ever had. From the moment we sat down she expected us to be ready to order and stood next to our table impatiently setting things down on our table and sighing and taking it off our table, then walking away coming back, putting her order pad down on the table like "helloooo, when are you going to order?" waiting, sighing. Very strange. Once she served us, she took forever to bring us our bill. The side dishes they bring are interesting and there are a lot of them which is great but the service was just so bad. However the hostess was very nice, personable and friendly, but our server was just so ridiculously rude. Never been treated so rudely in a restaurant before. I don't know if I'd come back. On top of all the service issues, I have a gluten/dairy allergy and they really don't have much of a selection for people like me. Most of the entrees are beef, pork, or fish.I only saw one chicken entree which disappointed me because I am a fan of chicken! It is cool the way you can cook your entree at the table though.
