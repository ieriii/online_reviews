I've been searching for a good place for pho and I checked this out today. The location is really convenient and the pho is decent but not necessarily spectacular. The soup was a little sweeter than I'm used to (even before adding all the sauces) and the beef slices tasted kind of grainy. The soup could have been a little hotter and the bean sprouts were not very fresh. It's pretty good pho for a reasonable price, but I'm still looking for the perfect bowl of noodles.
