Absolutely the most unique flavors and presentations we have ever had. The wine (get the upgraded wine) was excellent and presented very well with a concise explanation of the wine's provenance. The waiter was a great person with an intimate knowledge of each of the courses. And there was plenty of food. We did not leave disappointed or hungry.
