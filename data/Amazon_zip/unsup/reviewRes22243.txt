First time here. The place is huge, authentic decor, wonderful wait staff (they even cleared the crumbs from our table after we finished with our complementary bread basked). Clean bathrooms, great food! We had the Greek Islands Cold Plate, and for the first time in my life I ate PROPERLY prepared calamari and octopus! I never knew what I was missing! It wasn't chewy, rubbery....it almost melted in my mouth. VERY impressed. Of course the Saganaki was delicious---people complain that this cheese is salty, but that's just the way it is, man. You are supposed to squeeze lemon on it and the acidity adds a delicious finish. Their rice & egg-lemon soup was very good, although a little short on the lemon, so we just added our own since they provided us with small plates full of lemon slices. For my main course, I had one of the daily specials, Kontosouvli (pork on the spit) with all the fixins you'd get with your traditional gyros. It was very good, and filling. It was a great experience--and again, I have to mention how wonderful and attentive the staff was. It was a nice surprise!
