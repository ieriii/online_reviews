I was very excited to visit Frontera Grill as I am a big Rick Bayless fan. Got there at 1pm on a Friday afternoon, and had a lenghy wait, but found a place to perch in the bar, and had some great cocktails - a blood orange margarita - my friend had tamarind, which isn't really my thing (I'm not a big tamarind fan) but was really interesting. Hubby also appreciated the thoughtful beer selection. We started with the seafood appetizer platter - 6 great oysters and 2 different ceviches. The oysters and the sauces were incredible. The ceviches were good, but not to die for. For lunch we tried a few different things - chicken enchiladas w/ Mole, the lamb in parchment special, a couple of different quesadillas. This was definitely good mexican food. Unfortunately it didn't completely wow me, as much as I wanted it to. I'll grant that I have limited experience with "real" mexican food, but when I compare to Hugo's in Houston, for example, it didn't stack up. That said, it was a really nice experience, good service, good food - I would return given the chance and try it again, perhaps at dinner.
