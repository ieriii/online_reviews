My wife and I have gone several times to Shaw's Crab House. We feel it is really fine dining with the fine dining price tag. We do not see taking all of our kids there as that would be an expensive night out. The restaurant is elegant and the decor is very stylish. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful. They will get you anything you need. Shaw's is an exceptionally clean restaurant which says a lot about the owners care of their establishment. The food is very good and fresh but at these prices you would expect it to be. Will we go back, probably for a special occasion type event but it is a place that can be hard to work into the budget in these times.
