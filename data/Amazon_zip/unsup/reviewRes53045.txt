Outstanding Cuban food, atmosphere, and service. We got roasted pork dinner plate (with rice, beans, and plantains) and the frita cubana sandwich (Cuban burger), both were wonderfully done. It was a very hot day, but we had a great time in the outdoor covered patio. The patio was very nicely decorated with a Cuban flavor as well. Would definitely repeat to try out more of their food.
