Sure, they serve you boat loads of meat. Meat so tasty, tender, and grilled to perfection it might make a grown man cry. All that aside, save room for their flan.  Hands down, the best flan I've ever tasted. It is coconut flavored but not so much where it overwhelms the natural flavor of the custard.  That is all.
