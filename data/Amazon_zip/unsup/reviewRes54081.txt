How can you treat people like trash and still exist?Build your clientele of desperate, approval-seeking lonely folks who have a masochistic streak? That's the only way I can see someone justifying patronage to this BAD JOKE of a bar.Ok, ok, we get it. The bouncer is an a**hole who won't make eye contact or acknowledge anyone. I get it, the bartenders/servers are WAY too busy serving their 2 other, much more important customers. Waiting 35 minutes to order once you're in is the norm! YOU'RE LUCKY TO JUST BE THERE, RIGHT?Seriously. If I had self-esteem issues I'd love this place. But I would rather just drink in a nice quiet place with friends.
