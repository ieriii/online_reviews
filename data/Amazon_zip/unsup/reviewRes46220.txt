I went here with a friend who wanted to check it out. The menu is huge! The food we ordered was pretty tasty, and the portions were very large. We commented on how pretty the decor was. For dessert, we had the warm beignets with three sauces. Mmm, I'd go back just for that dessert. Overall, the concept is similar to the Cheesecake Factory - big menu, huge portions, and a little something for everyone. It's a bit too touristy for me, though.
