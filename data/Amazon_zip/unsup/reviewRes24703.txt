I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars here. The place is cute, but not quite as quiet and cozy as I had expected--perhaps i just sat in the wrong section? I noticed a loft area, but I am on crutches, so there was no way that was happening! I ordered the half caesar and the traditional chicken, rice, and lemon soup. The salad was good but very...basic. Just romaine, a little grated parm, a few croutons, and dressing. I felt they could have tried a little harder--it seemed like the kind of caesar you'd get at a Denny's or something. The soup was LEMONY. Holy balls. I couldn't eat all of it, despite my best efforts. I tried adding pepper first, and then salt, but it was too much. It was very good when I dunked the little slices of cocktail bread that came with it, though. I ordered organic earl grey with milk, and that was great--my server kept my mug full of hot water. And for dessert I had the bittersweet chocolate mousse, which comes in a chocolate tulip topped with sprinkles and a fresh raspberry. It. Was. Amazing. The mousse was definitely 4 stars. The carrot cake I took to go for my husband was super-dense and lacked the cinnamon flavor that the menu advertised.
