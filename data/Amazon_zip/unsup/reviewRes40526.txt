Seriously tasteless and overpriced food. Ate here with another couple and were encouraged by all the reviews and were sorely disappointed. Started with artisanal cheeses and meat balls for appetizers. The cheeses were fine, the meatballs were just so-so. Our entrees ran the gamut from pork belly to a cheeseburger. All were okay, but nothing was terribly tasty. The beer selection is nice. The desserts including chocolate rum babba were pretty good. The air of this restaurant is so laden with the smell of cooking fat that I came out smelling as though I had been making french fries over a deep cooker for a month. Parking nearby is also very challenging. Our waitress was really nice which was a big plus. Cost of meal per person including appetizer, desserts, beverages, entrees, tax and tip was $45. I really can't recommend the place.
