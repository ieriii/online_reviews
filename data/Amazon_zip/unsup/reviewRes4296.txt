Yes, the Green Mill is kinda worn, kinda dingy, but who cares. The music is Hot Hot Hot. Any true jazz lover must visit here. Maybe even jazz likers. This isn't easy, everyday Jazz. This is smokin' , crazy, passionate jazz. My date and I came early enough to get a spot towards the front. We had enough time to chat before the band came on, and spent the rest of the evening snuggling and listening to good music. As an added bonus, the drinks were potent and our waitress took fabulous care of us. Please keep in mind, that if you talk during the music, you will get yelled at, and be given lots of dirty looks by the other patrons and the musicians. Basically, if you aren't coming for the music, don't bother.
