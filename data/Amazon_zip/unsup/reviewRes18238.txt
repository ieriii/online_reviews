Tasty food, AWESOME ambiance, and a truly respectable beer list. Plus, huge stack of games and a shuffleboard table in the back room. I would go back and bring friends just to show them the giant dragon sculpture made from cow skull and other bones. Freaky but amazing! Food is a little pricey, but never been disappointed.
