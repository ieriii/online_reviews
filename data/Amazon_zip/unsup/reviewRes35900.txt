really is a great restaurant. compared to other big city busiest fish places ie oyster bar at grand central, jakes in pdx, ray's in seattle, it really kicks butt. you must understand how hard it is to do the shear volume they do night after night, yet still have such a wide, diverse selection of fresh fish. if you haven't been, go, if you go, go more often. we are lucky to have it.
