I'm surprised at anything less than a 4.5 star review of this hotel. While we didn't have much to look at, our room was absolutely perfect complete with a huge bathroom, (yes, the sliding door was annoying, and why do hotels refuse to install fans? It's a no-brainer when sharing!) small sitting area and two tvs. We would have surely paid triple the price to enjoy the same thing in NYC or Miami (newly opened) but not in good ol' Chicago. Pretty central location to dt; perfectly air conditioned. Wonderful bed with three types of pillows if you need them. Nice, clean, small gym perfect for working off the popcorn, steak, tacos, alcohol and all of that amazing food offered in Chicago. Steakhouse was pretty great as was the free drink upon arrival. Don't forget to read the free time out mag if you have time and if you need ideas. (but I'm sure you've arrived with many.) Extremely helpful hotel staff and probably the best maid service I've ever experienced. It always helps to leave at least a couple of dollars daily! Turndown service was an added bonus as was the little sweet treat that we'd save for the next day. Sb coffee was great if you don't feel like going down the street in the 100+ degree heat first thing in the am. Daily water refill was a bonus, as was the mini-bar fridge that we used--no questions asked. Great for yoghurt or leftovers! Door guys were helpful...just don't be caught carrying one of their umbrellas with you like we did for a couple of days. Because apparently, in Chicago, "you only believe it when you see it." How different from Vancouver! Honestly, if you can't afford the trip to NY, this is the place to go and this is the place to stay. You won't be disappointed!
