It was my fiance's birthday and we are both foodies. We also have a rich tradition of trying multicourse meals on one another's birthdays. This place was recommended to me by a friend who is also a trusted foodie. Overall, we left pretty let down. Pros-  -Some of the courses were very good, the first 3 courses were best.  -The sweet plates at the end were good.  -All of the plating was artistic and nice to look at.  -BYOB  -Duck Duck Goose course, I would recommend for those that like duck. Cons- I had made a reservation 2 weeks in advance, I had called and left a message to do 13 courses instead of 8. We got there and they admitted they never checked their voicemail and could not do 13 courses. They tried to do 10 for us instead but then proceeded to nickle and dime us per extra course. -The service was not good overall. For the price, one should expect amazing food and service. The waiter was not proffesional and when describing one course he called part of the dish "some fruit stuff" -they do not pace the meal well. 10 courses took us 3 hours. We became both hungry and bored during the meal. -The red meat was bland and flavorless. One course was so bland that I could barely finish it. Overall, I would say it is much too overpriced for what you get. They need to work on service, pacing, and checking their voicemail.
