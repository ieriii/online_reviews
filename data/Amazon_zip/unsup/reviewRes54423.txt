Heard rave reviews from my sister so I couldnt wait to try this place. As soon as we arrived, the staff was very sweet. They seated us quickly. I decided to try the popular stuff. I got the rueben and chocolate peanut butter shake. The shake tastes literally like a Snickers bar! The Reuben was humongous.. It was delicious and certainly lived up to the hype. The real gem on the menu is the monzerella sticks. I was in heaven and couldn't stop munching on them. Never had vegan cheese taste that good. You must try this place at least once in your life!
