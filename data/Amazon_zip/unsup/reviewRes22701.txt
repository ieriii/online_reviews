After a long workout, I came out of the gym so ravenous that I was ready to eat the leather off my shoes. I tossed aside all plans to eat healthy by cooking at home and made a bee line to Irazu. This place reminds me of hole in the wall places like Paco's Tacos - inadequate lighting, approximately 6 sets of lawn furniture for their outdoor dining area, a couple of stools near the entrance so you can let the smells permeate every fiber of your being... and your shirt, and a small dining area. I ended up getting a veggie burrito with mushrooms, the casado w/ pinto gallo, and an oatmeal shake to wash it all down. The large girth of the burrito made it an exceptional value. I wasn't too keen on the casado (chicken a tad dry) but I absolutely loved loved loved LOVED (does that tell you how I feel?) the pinto gallo. I think next time I'll get 2 orders of this stuff by itself. The portions were more than enough to split between my gf and I. We were both satisfied with the food although neither of us were big fans of the chicken casado. Maybe we should've gotten beef? The shake was pretty darn good though - just like a dirty horchata. I'm an horchata h00r so it didn't take me too far outside of my comfort zone. I think I'll try the pepito sammich next time.
