What can I say? The line was out the door and around the side, it was hardly moving, the place is a little bit bigger than a hole in the wall, the doors to enter were not that big but people were waiting patiently for there turn. I didn't get it until I got in and saw the menu on the wall. And then next to it was the specials. But the best part was when you got to the counter the gentleman taking your order was there for you! He didn't rush us, he answered all our questions, he was making jokes and all along listening to the kids and giving them suggestions. I couldn't decide what to order so I ordered 2 dogs. Between our entire group we ordered practically the entire menu; so, I can't recommend one specific item. I will go back but this time on Friday or Saturday to try the fries in duck fat.
