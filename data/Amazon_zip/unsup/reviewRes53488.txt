Great, great, great, creative menu, definitely a treat. I loved the atmosphere. The service is what makes this place stand out from many fine dining establishments in Chicago and New York, it was such fun to watch, like synchronized swimming. Impeccable. I loved having the menu with our anniversary date on it as well as our names, so sweet, and something to cherish and remember the night by. Fine dining at its best.
