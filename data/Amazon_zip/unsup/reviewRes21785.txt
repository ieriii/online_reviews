This is an amazing little place! We also had Alejandro as our server and all I can say is that we left him a 100% tip! He was awesome, the food was great, and 1/2 price margritas to boot! This was an awesome night out and we will be sure to return. This place is also cheep!! Two of us left a little tipsy and stuffed full for $20! (I have to admit that I had a http://restaurant.com coupon for $10 and they comped 2 drinks for us doing a little table hopping.) I can't wait to go back!
