I did not eat here but I give it 4 stars solely on the beautiful decor and space inside and the nice outside roof patio. I am not into the whole Brazilian meat concept but would definitely go there if one day I craved it. It is such a cool space inside and HUGE! I did get to experience the rooftop patio and it was really cute up there. The only thing I wasn't too into was the chairs were kind of cheap looking and didn't have quite the same feel as the interior, but then again, this is outdoor furniture. They also had some cushioned benches and gazebo-like booths. Luckily, I went on a Monday and we could get a table. Otherwise, I am sure the weekends are packed! I am sure, too, it is a place to see and be seen. I can see the trendsetters, all dressed up, drinking the pricey drinks. Yes, of course, be prepared to shell out a pretty penny for the fancy (or not so fancy) drinks. I spent more on 2 drinks than I did for a whole meal + wine. I would go back there again on a nice night if it wasn't too crowded.
