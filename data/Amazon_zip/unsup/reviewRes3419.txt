Normally, I don't like sitting with people at community tables. Call me crazy but some people just have bad energy and I'd rather not digest my food around that energy...lol. With that said, it doesn't bother me so much at Crisp. Not only are the people that work here friendly but the patrons are happy-go-lucky people that I don't mind sitting at the table with me. I usually order the Original Bad Boy Buddha bowl. It is all of my favorite things in one bowl: zucchini, carrots, spinach, mushrooms, corn, rice, etc. You can add meat or tofu. I usually get chicken. When I am extra hungry (always), I get an order of the wings (BBQ...no, not that kind....Korean BBQ). But because I refuse to have someone walk by and see me eating all of that food (oink), that's usually a "to go" order. Don't judge me....if you go, you'll see exactly what I mean!
