Tip Top Tap!! Shout-out to Hotel Tonight for saving us from paying over $200 for a hotel in downtown. I understand it's my birthday weekend, but why was it harder to find a deal on a Chicago hotel on a September weekend than it was all summer?? Anyway, Hotel Tonight totally came through and we had a great time. I think the overall theme of this hotel is narrow entryways and deep spaces- noted by the elevator and room, bathroom :) Loved the colors in the room, beds, bathrooms - felt very luxurious. Great location!
