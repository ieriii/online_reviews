We didn't want to break the bank at Easter brunch this Sunday, so someone in our family made reservations at Carvivale seeing as their brunch specials averaged 10 bucks per entree. This was my first Carnivale experience, and it was a good one. While I don't really recommend this place for Easter brunch, the atmosphere, drinks and desserts are enough to get me back for dinner. The brunch menu was very limited (about four or five things to choose from), and all but one included sausage, of which I'm not a fan. So I got the french toast which was nothing to write home about. However, the quacamole that came before bruch (while kind of out of step with the whole breakfast thing) was really, really good and very fresh. We all also got mimosas to drink and desserts afterward. The ice cream cake is to die for. Not only is it a work of art, it's so, so good. And the churras were also very yummy. Our service was fast and friendly, and overall, we had a great time. I LOVED the decor, so that made the experience more exciting. I'd say the brunch is an even three stars, but the guac and the desserts bumps it up to four.
