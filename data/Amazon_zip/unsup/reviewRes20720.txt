I've been dying to come here after my co-worker brought in some of XOCO's churros and boy was it worth the wait (almost 6 months and then about 20 minutes or so waiting in the line for a seat in the cafe)! I was even happier that my husband finally did the 50/50 w/ me. We ordered the Weds special which was the pork belly torta and the milanesa b/c it looked scrumptious as the cooks were preparing it and of course an order of churros for dessert. Yum Yum! I wanted to order even more like chips and guac and the soft serve ice cream and the hot chocolate but my eyes are always bigger than my stomach and decided that I'll wait again for the next time I return to this place. And I will go back! We both loved the pork belly b/c it had a lot of flavor (and it included bacon) and the dipping sauce had a nice kick to it. I enjoyed the milanesa as well - great smooth flavor and the salsa went very well with it. Lastly, the churros were as good as I remembered them ... soft with enough crunch and so fresh - none of that ballpark/carnival stuff.  The place is small so beware if you've got a stroller that you need to bring inside. As many reviewers have said, the lines are long and they do move but that's b/c ppl are waiting for seats (do the shared seating too so you don't have to wait as long if it's available). If you're gonna just grab 'n go - that'd be the better option since you don't have to wait as long. Don't worry, there is a host that will help you along the process. Prices are a bit higher than your Chipotle but the experience you get in your mouth is so worth it. Wish this spot was closer to work - but that'd mean I'd have to share it w/ everyone, hehehe.
