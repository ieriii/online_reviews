As I walked through this historic hotel, I almost felt like I was a turn of a corner away from running smack dab into a celebrity or royalty from years gone by. A wonderful hotel with all the necessary amentities for a high maintenance traveler along with all the extra classic feel for a sit and stare kind like myself. Along with that the location is great, staff highly engaged and rooms well suited. A real pleasure to have stayed and feel like a small piece of something much greater.
