The wings are huge.....and the seoul sassy sauce amazing. The service is awesome....only issue I have ever had is having to continue to call back several times before being able to place an order.....to me that is a good sign. I have recommended this place to several people and they have all had great reviews as well. It might be a little on the pricey side....but it is worth it.
