The Beijing duck dinner is just outstanding, and for $30 it's a steal. It includes the sliced duck (for assembly into what I will call sandwiches), duck fried rice or noodles, and soup. Every one of those dishes is fantastic. The duck is cooked perfectly, with juicy meat and crispy golden skin. It's all very authentic, as good as any I've had in Beijing, although the restaurant itself is less atmospheric. A small order of honey roasted pork makes a good appetizer. The fact that it's BYOB is an added bonus, although I believe there is a $2/person corkage fee. Highly, highly recommended.
