Love it. Love everything about it. I came here on my first day in the city and my god, is it delicious. I loved everything there... but most memorable is the Rabbit Saddle. It's an appetizer but I could eat several orders of that by itself as a meal. It comes with a bit of greens, celery and grapes... and that together with the rabbit... it's just.. heavenly.  Oh and the beer selection is good too. But really, I would just come back for more rabbit.
