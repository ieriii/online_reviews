Went here for my first date with my girlfriend, and it's funny because Vietnamese cuisine isn't exactly her cup of tea. However, we both really enjoyed the meal. It's a BYOB so that was really nice and the meal was flavorful. I have to admit the one thing that stood out to me that nite was how dimly lit the restaurant was and how romantic it seemed for a first date. I went based on a friend's recommendation and really enjoyed the nite (although I may have really enjoyed it because of how excited I was to finally get her to have dinner with me)
