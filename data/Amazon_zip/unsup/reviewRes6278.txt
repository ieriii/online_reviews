I love Wildfire! The food is incredible, including their chopped salad, scallops, steak, and drool inducing desserts. Also, they have takeout! You do have to wait a long time if you don't have reservations, but they are always honest about the wait times, and the bar is a good place to hang out if it doesn't get too crowded. The last time I was there, we knew we had a two hour wait on our hands, so we grabbed stools at the bar. About a half hour later, the bartender spilled a martini on my scarf. Now, I apologized to him because it was stupid to have my scarf right there on the bar, but he apologized profusely and brought the manager over. The manager comped our latest round of drinks and got us to a table right away, and then comped our appetizers and desserts. He went so above and beyond that I didn't even send him my dry cleaning bill for the scarf, which he had asked to pay.
