pour l'amour du fromage! Oui. I truly have a ridiculous love for cheese and being lactose intolerant doe not stop me one bit. I've never been to a fondue restaurant so I had many ideas of how it all went down and once I finally had the experience I was completely blown away. To start with cheese and end in chocolate might just be heaven on earth. I picked for dinner a beef and lobster combo which killed all cravings I had in one day. The neat part is you get to be a chef for a night! Yes, I got to cook my own food and watched as the hot oil managed to take on lobster and beef and vegetables all at the same time. Not what I was expecting at all. My friend ordered a sampler and I had the chance to try scallops and the shrimp which were delicious! Then for the finally as if I had any room left in my body... Chocolate! chocolate fondue on fire! roasting marshmallows and then delicious fruit. Our waitress is by far the best best waitress I've ever had in any state or country. Polite, interactive, social beyond belief, assuring, confident, and funny. Though Geja's should totally put more color or style into their uniforms, I loved the intimate decor. One of the best experiences with food I've had to date.
