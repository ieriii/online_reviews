I didn't read any yelp reviews before making a visit to this restaurant. A friend from out of town who dined here with one of his clients suggested that we check it out. When we got there, i was surprised that it was a bbq place. The exterior definitely makes it looks otherwise. The interior is also a bit upscale than what I was expecting. The service, cocktails, food were all really good. I really like bbq but wouldn't call myself an enthusiast. This place kicked it up a notch for me.
