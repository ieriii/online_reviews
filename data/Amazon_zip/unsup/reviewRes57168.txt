I agree with a previous reviewer that the appeal of this place is mysterious. We too made a reservation, and still had to wait 30 min. The food was lack-luster. We were doubly disappointed to find out that one of their options for restaurant week (roasted apple crepes) had been replaced by chocolate flan. Not tasty at all. The atmosphere is loud, and the space is arranged such that you feel like you are in an airport hanger. Obnoxious.
