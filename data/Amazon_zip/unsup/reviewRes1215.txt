The snake is long Seven miles Ride the snake Yeah the line was long. But, totally worth it. Got to meet up with a bunch of cool Yelpers and snack on some encased meats. I was one for two with my choices. Meh on the Banger and touchdown on the spicy Sonoran. After all these reviews, if there's anything that I can add it's that I don't think I saw anyone drinking Dr. Brown's other than me. I don't know if it's an East Coast thing. Folks you are seriously missing out on that stuff. You'll want to add that to your next order. There's my good deed of the day.
