We stopped here for desert after eating at a (yikes!) great chain restaurant nearby. It is a little awkward to be sitting with a group of strangers at a table. I am fine with "communal style" seating - but my husband -- not so much. Therefore, I give the atmosphere an ok, not great, as my husband was a bit uncomfortable. We only had coffee and dessert. Overall, service was ok, not good, not great - they were super busy (a Saturday Night at 10 pm!). However, the dessert was very very good, which pushs my review to a 4 star. Try the Sicilian Iris!! It is like a Donut (they call it Brioche) filled with chocolate chip and ricotta cheese. Ummmmmm, I am drooling just thinking about it now.
