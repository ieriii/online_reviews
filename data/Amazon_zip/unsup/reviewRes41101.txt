Easily one of the best meals I've ever had. Texture and flavors of each course are nicely balanced, and I like the culinary creativity that goes into each plate. The meat course is top notch. My only knocks would be timing and wine service. Our first few courses came out really spaced out, but the final five were one right after another, which makes for a tough time finishing dessert. I know it's BYO, but I dislike BYO places take your wine from the table. We know how to dine, we'll be fine. I will go back, though, next time in town. As good as it gets.
