I'm so surprised by the good reviews. To be fair, I ordered take-out, so I didn't experience the whole "dine-in" aspect of this restaurant, but our food was awful! Cottage fries are bad. Neither crunchy nor soft and really dull in flavor, I hardly touched it. I ordered the Turkey Burger, and my boyfriend ordered the Better Bacon Cheddar Burger. My turkey burger was over cooked, really dry, and basically flavorless no matter how much I drowned it in the 1000 island sauce. I didn't even eat half of it. Instead, I fed the meat to my dog and opted for the day-old spaghetti in my fridge. The only thing I liked about our meal was the Chips & Guacamole/Salsa. It was good, except that they gave us hardly any gauc. Maybe I'm missing something, but it would take some good convincing for me to visit or order from this place again.
