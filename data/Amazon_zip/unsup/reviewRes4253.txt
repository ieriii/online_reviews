My first time here while on this visit and I want to transport myself back come 2am every night. You are dark, mysterious, and have a sexy history. You even have a secret door behind the bar! I loved the swing music the night we caught it, and I appreciate that everyone from older folks to hipsters can drink, laugh and enjoy the show. Snuggle up in a comfy booth, sipping on champagne splits (cheap!) and enjoy the night.
