Tank Noodle, you can pho me anytime you like. I was blown away by how tasty and inexpensive the pho was. This was the first Vietnamese restaurant that tasted authentic. The portion sizes were huge, there was no need to order anything else, plus they were not stingy on the beef. A dinner for two cost me 16 bucks, and that included tax and tip. I would gladly go here again!
