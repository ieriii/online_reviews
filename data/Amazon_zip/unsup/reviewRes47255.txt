I was recently introduced to this hidden gem by a friend. Let me get this out of the way: Crazy amazing burgers like Kumas. There. Now I'm done with the comparison that has been made a million times. But what's different and equally amazing is there build your own mac & cheese section. So many toppings! Now, I will say that I have made an amazing mac&cheese, and I have made a mediocre mac. But that's on me, not Lockdown. I've spied some of the salads (other people ordered, not me--I'm here for burgers) and they look pretty tasty too. The staff is friendly and helpful. I love the outdoor seating as well as the indoor seating with the garage doors open. My only wish is that they had a few more Cider options (maybe on draft) and I wish I wasn't scared to ask them to put a sporting event on the tv. Again, those are my picky little issues. I love this place and have started bring throngs of my friends here.
