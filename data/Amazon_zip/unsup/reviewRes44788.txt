My first sample of authentic Chicago deep-dish pizza in years, and I thought it was ok, but found out a couple days later in our pizza taste-test that there are other better places - namely Gino's East. The calamari and antipasto appetizers were decent. Nothing phenomenal but they were served promptly, which helped tide us over while waiting the typical 45 minutes for the pizza to come out. We got their "special" (sausage, mushrooms, onions, green peppers) but I felt like it was essentially a big, thick cheese pizza with a few good chunks of sausage. But mostly you just get a big mouthful of cheese. I agree with other reviews, that the crust is rather raw and doughy-tasting, which I really noticed and brought the pizza down a notch. I think if I'm going to fill my lovehandles and arteries with something this unhealthy, I'd rather go elsewhere. It was ok, just not great.
