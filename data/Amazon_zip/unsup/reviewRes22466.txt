My visit to Lao Sze Chuan was prompted by it's Michelin Bib Gourmand rating. It was my first trip to Chinatown, and my first experience with authentic Chinese food. Two things I've been dying to try are peking duck, and hot pot. The peking duck was delicious. They served it a bit cold though. A server also served up all the duck wrapped in flour tortillas with a sauce and onions. I found that I preferred the duck itself with some cracklin and sauce. The hot pot didn't live up to my expectations for heat, but the flavor was amazing especially with the white fish and lamb.  The "very Chinese" section of the menu looked very interesting, and I look forward to returning to explore it. I almost want to hold out my review until I do. Service was a bit awkward, but I chalk that up to my white ass being outside of my cultural comfort zone, and not a knock on the restaurant itself.
