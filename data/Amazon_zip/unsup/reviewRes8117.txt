If this is how Italian's make pizza, than keep it! This is not how Chicago pizza (not limited to just deep dish) is defined as. I'm not even a fan of New Haven style pizza at Piece, but I'd rather take a slice from there than at this place.  I ordered the Margherita, and it was literally, a 10" piece of crust, with maybe a drizzle of tomato sauce, uneven portions of mozzarella on the top, with literally (i should have taken a picture) of two tiny crumpled up pieces of basil. How can some of these reviewers say this is the best pizza they have had. I have made better pizza bread at home with a bottle of ragu and a loaf of wonder bread.  Not only was the pizza bad. We ordered mussels as an appetizer. I swear, I have found more junk on my finger after picking my nose than what I found in between these mussel shells.  I STILL CAN NOT BELIEVE THIS PLACE MADE CHICAGO MAGAZINE'S TOP 25 PIZZA PLACES IN CHICAGO. THAT RIGHT THERE JUST LOST THEM THEIR CREDIBILITY.
