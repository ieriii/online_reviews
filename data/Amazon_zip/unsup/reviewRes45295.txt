Decor and atmosphere were awesome. Love the feel of this place - perfect combo of pub and restaurant. Beer list is exceptional, and they serve sample pints, which my wife loves. We started with grilled whiskey wings. They were tasty and had an awesome dressing too (a bitmore sauce would have been nice, but no big deal). Loved the dill/ranch dipping sauce as well. Overall, they were nice, but were not as hot temperature wise as I'd have liked. Temp would be a factor again later in the meal. I got the Wilde burger, my wife got the chicken curry. It took a very long time to get our food. Granted, it was Saturday night, but we waited about 40 minutes. Not a huge deal, but the food was cold when it got to us, meaning it sat for all that time. That was pretty lame, so we brought it up to our server. He apologized and offered to have the dishes redone. We ended up having them redo both meals, which they gladly did. New meals came out in about 10 minutes, and they were excellent. Burger was great - caramelized onions, good bun to burger ratio, Irish cheddar, and excellent fries. Very good. Chicken curry was probably even better. Super tender chicken, delicious curry that actually had a nice subtly about it. Really well balanced. We both loved it. Even with the food snafu, I really liked this place and will surely be back. The manager also took two of the half beers off the bill because of the food mistake, which was very nice. Overall - great atmosphere, good food, they biffed a bit, but made it right, so all's well and we'll be back.
