If you are thinking of going here, don't bother and Head over to Pizza D.O.C. on Lawrence near Western instead if you want that style of pizza. The pizza, ingredients and service at D.O.C is head over heals better than this place. As far as our experience at Spacca Napoli -We ordered a mushroom and sausage pizza and they were very stingy with the ingredients. Our pizza was soggy as well. Our waitress ignored us. Finally came over to take our order after 15 minutes.  Never checked on us after the food came. We won't be back
