Yes, everyone knows yolk for brunch is a great idea. EVERYONE including TONS of tourists in the summer time so be prepared to wait a bit esp on weekends. Inside, bright and cheerful, a customer might find him/herself enjoying a BYOB mimosa or bloody (recommended). As for the menu, I recommend splitting a sweet and a savory item with a friend to take proper advantage of their long list of treats. Service is great. The taste can be a little bland at times, but otherwise recommended especially if you are new in town!
