Having stayed in Chicago on three different occasions this is the first time that I totally enjoyed my stay in the Windy city! The Talbott Hotel was just the perfect place to stay and I will defenetly be returning. A fabulous location! The hotil is simply lovely .... warm, inviting, and cozy. Just the perfect recipe for a perfect weekend stay! And by the way... don't bother to take your lap top...the Talbott has a Mac mini hook up to the flat screen in your room, one click and you are on line! Cannot wait to visit my son again! Many thanks to the gracious and friendly staff.
