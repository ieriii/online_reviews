I don't know anything about authentic Vietnamese, but I know what tastes good, and this place just has good food. My husband had the anchovy soup, which had a wonderful brother similar to Tom Yum, and I had #140, pork and vegetables over *crispy* wide noodles. Both dishes were just wonderful. My husband also got an iced coffee with cream, which was very strong and tasty. I rather like the diner setting, and the napkins, utensils and condiments being in arms reach on the middle of the table. We went at lunch time, around one o'clock, and the restaurant was not overly busy, and the service was very good.
