GREAT AUTHENTIC VIETNAMESE FOOD HERE!I love this place! The soup noodles are very good and very authentic considering Chicago. I highly recommend soup noodles from pho to bun rieu (tomato based soup) to bo kho (stew), etc.The vermicelli noodles or rice dishes with meat, shrimp, fish sauce falls more in the average category. But definitely decent considering your choices in the area. The prices are also very fair. You can enjoy a meal for about $10 per person easily. Best of all, the service is amazingly fast and orderly considering how busy they get. Overall, great noodle soup for good price!
