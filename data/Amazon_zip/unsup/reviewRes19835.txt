We stumbled in here after wandering through Millennium Park. Little did I know, I would have one of the best brunches ever! Eggs benedict, crisp brie potatoes, goat cheese grits, and a bloody mary. Amazing. Unique menu (they even have poutine...). Perfect location (right across the street from Millennium Park). Great service. One million beers on tap. I'll be back.
