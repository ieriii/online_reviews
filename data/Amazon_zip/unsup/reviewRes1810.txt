The best encased meats that I have ever eaten. Not too salty and never bland. So why only 4 stars? 2 reasons: 1) The duck fries were just plain greasy. I love potatoes so if I don't finish off the fries first something is definitely wrong. 2) Lack of info about the casings. Seriously, how hard is it to list whether or not the beef, chicken, and veggie sausages are encased in a pork skin/casing. The fact that this info is not listed (despite the requests for this info) makes me suspect that everything, pork or not, is encased in pork.
