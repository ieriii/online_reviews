Le Colonial is truly an old favorite that I often forget about as the Chicago dining scene is ever-changing. Alas, this is one staple that will never tire for me - a must visit in the Gold Coast. I love the ambiance here. Dark, sexy but still soft and with the lovely touches that make you feel like you are in a scene from The English Patient. And the food? I adore it. Best Pho in the city and each dish is crafted with an overload of flavor. Service is top-notch. I also love this place for a quick take-out for pick-up.
