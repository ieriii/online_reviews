to be honest with you, i been coming to this place for years. as the years goes by, the prices keeps getting more and more expensive. I know there is inflation but the price is way too much for Mexican food. Mexican are known to be good and cheap eats, not this place is all about making money and not caring about the long term client. When you raise the price like that, its not about keep up with the pace of food cost, its really just about the owners making more money.  I know several more Mexican restuarant that is just as good and cheaper, good luck keeping long term clients, you just lost me...... but im sure they dont care.
