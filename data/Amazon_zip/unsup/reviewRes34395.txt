There are a LOT of breakfast choices now in the South Loop. This would not be my number 1 or 2 choice, but it's good! The atmosphere is inviting and the location is great, looking out to the south end of Grant Park on Michigan Ave. The egg items are very good. I've had all of the Benedicts on the menu and they are great. There is a big crowd in the late morning on the weekends, try a weekday and get a more peaceful experience.
