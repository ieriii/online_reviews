Go to Piccolo Sogno and sit outside (no matter how cold it is) -- you will not believe you're sitting in the middle of Chicago. It's one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever been to, and the outside area alone is reason enough to go!  The bar is a great place to start for a drink, and once we were seated outside I did not want to leave! We sampled their fried calamari, which was so tasty it didn't even need a sauce, and a plate of cold ham, cheese and vegetables. I also had the caprese salad which was so good. For dinner, I've heard that their fish is not fantastic, so I had their special butternut squash risotto which I tried my very best not to finish but apparently had to eat every last bite, and also sampled some other pastas which were all really good.  For dessert we tried the chocolate hazelnut cake (can't say there was any left of that) and the pannacotta, which isn't a favorite of mine. We also had a delicious Italian after-dinner drink (Moscato with something else in it, recommended by the sommelier). Next time I want to try the duck and their pizzas. Great atmosphere, great food, can't wait to go back!
