i live in saint louis and there is only one fully vegan restaurant here so when i go to chicago i definitely stop here. they have really good...its 5 in the morning i cant remember what i got, well everything is good there. i definitely remember the mint chocolate chip milkshake (vegan, of course) and the, oh ya, bacon cheeseburger and mac n cheese. that was all really good. they lost one star for bad service one time i went and bad french toast. but go there, its great.
