2nd time here. The first time the Chevre omelet was to die for - perfect proportions of goat cheese to sun-dried tomatoes and pancetta (drool!) This time there were too many sun-dried tomatoes and hardly any goat cheese! However, I also asked for my baby reds to be crispy because the first time they were undercooked and they turned out DELICIOUS! Strawberry stuffed french toast was pretty good: the table's verdict was that stuffed french toast is much better at Toast (mascarpone...mmmmm). Lavazza coffee is always delicious, and refilled after every 3-4 sips. The OJ was warm but was fine after I added ice. The first visit was a definite 5 star event. The second visit, I'd say 4 stars. But the atmosphere is cute and the service is good so 5 stars for Meli's! PS: the fries are excellent! haha
