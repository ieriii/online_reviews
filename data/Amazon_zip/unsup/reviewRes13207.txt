Finally got a chance to hit Revolution as it's been on my list for a while. Luckily we ended up recognizing our waiter so he hooked us up with a handful of different beer samples on the house. Having already been familiar with some of their signature beers we ventured into different areas which I typically don't care for (e.g. Porters and Stouts) which I was all pleasantly surprised with: Anti-Hero IPA Bottom Up Wit Cross of Gold Blond Ale Eugene Porter Double Fist Double Pale Ale Iron Fist Pale Ale Rosa Hibiscus Ale Red Scare Ale Rise American Stout We started out with the bacon-fat popcorn with shaved Parmesan cheese and sage to accompany the beers. Wow. The only negative thing I could say about this treat is that the bowl is much too small. As it was around brunch time some of the menu items were not yet available so I was unable to try the seafood dishes that looked really good, so I opted for the pork belly and egg breakfast sandwich. The meat was wonderfully tender and not overly fatty, and the aioli and arugla added great flavor. The redskin potatoes were also very good. My fiance made a note to point out that her burger was one of the best ones she has had in recent memory. So far this is my favorite brewpub in the city when looking for food that deliveries just as much as the beer. I'm also eagerly awaiting their new bottling/canning shipments so I can start grabbing cans of Anti-Hero at my local Binnys.
