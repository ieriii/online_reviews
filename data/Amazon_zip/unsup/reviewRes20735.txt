Salad and drinks 4 stars. I'm not sure which salad I had, but it had "greens" in the name. I ordered the risotto entree and it was not so hot (not in the literal temperature sense, in the not so great sense) but I would give them another shot. The flavor was good, but it had a sticky consistency. This would be a good spot to take visitors since its right in the downtown area between the shopping mecca and office buildings, and its a short walk from Millenium park.
