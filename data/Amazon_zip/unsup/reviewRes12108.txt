the thing about piece is you have to have a game plan before you go in. if you don't have a game plan you will certainly suffer from "my eyes are bigger than my stomach" and "i think i can handle another wingnut" i've seen it a hundred times. if you are lucky enough to be in delivery/easy to pick up distance then don't worry. no one is going to see you cram that entire large pizza into your mouth and walk in on you cradling an almost empty growler while your passed out on the couch in a pizza coma. sadly, i don't live close enough, so i say, game plan.
