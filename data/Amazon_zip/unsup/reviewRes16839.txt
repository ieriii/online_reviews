Reason: Friends b-day, after drinking and eating at Big Star all day. Ordered: Tequila Old Fashioned, several other drinks. Thoughts: Service was impeccable, wait kind of sucked but that's only b/c I don't wait anymore. (I'm too old and impatient that's why). Atmosphere was cool and surprisingly relaxed. Felt New Yorky but w/Chicago attitude if that makes any sense. Would go back to try food. Music was so/so and off sometimes.
