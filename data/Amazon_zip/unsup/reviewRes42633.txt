I saw a review of this on "Chicago's Best". It looked really, really good so I thought I'd try it out. I ordered a Hawaiian pizza and a 1/2 chicken. The 1/2 chicken comes with two sides so I had garlic mashed potatoes and corn. The chicken was pretty good - moist and the rub they put on it was tasty. The potatoes were disgusting. Couldn't finish them. The corn was ok. The pizza had that kind of fake cheese on it that Dominos used to put on theirs. The bread was kind of doughy - I was expecting it to be more crisp because it was thin crust pizza. Also, the Canadian bacon on it was a generous serving, but it still had the casing on it. That just made it seem so cheap. So, I ate 3 slices (because I was starving) and that was it. So...not sure how there are 5 star reviews here, but whatever...
