It was really really good. The busboys wear mechanics uniforms, beer is on sale, and there is meat. Communal seating leads to pointing at other peoples selections and saying "What the shit is that? Bring me that. I don't care what it's called it smells like everything that is right in the universe." The service was excellent and I was meat/beer drunk so they got all of my money. They've also got those fancy new hand driers, which was a double edged sword because they kept me occupied in the shitter for an extra few minutes while my special lady friend finished off the rest of the mussels. Great place, pricy as hell, food you'll be going on about for days, not pretentious, don't ask what head cheese is.
