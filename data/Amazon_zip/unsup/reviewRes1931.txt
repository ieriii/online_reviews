Sometimes, when life has been too calm, I will come to Yelp and look at the one and two star reviews of Hot Doug's and work myself into a righteous fury of indignation. Who would hate Hot Doug's? Cruel, heartless people with no joy in their hearts for tasty sausages. That's who. If you can't stand the line, get out of it and chase lesser (though admittedly faster) sausages. If you don't really care for sausages, what on EARTH are you doing at the shrine to all things sausage? If you object to the price, get the Chicago dog ($1.75! What costs less than $2 these days?), or buy some duck and foie gras and try making your own damn gourmet sausage. If you don't like the way Doug does business, I have nothing more to say to you, except "Good day, you fool." I have not completely loved every sausage of Doug's, but the sausages I HAVE loved are legion. The catalonian pork sausage. I would eat this with almost any toppings. Or none. It is the best sausage on its own merits. The rabbit and white wine. The mountain man. The three chili wild boar. I could go on. No one, not even Doug, can guarantee you will love the sausage you order. You, noble lover of Hot Doug, are a unique human with wild vagaries of taste. Maybe today you aren't really feeling like anything especially rich, in which case the Bacon Sausage is not going to make you happy on this day. Maybe you really love pork, in which case the chicken sausage will disappoint. Maybe, no matter how much people talk it up, you just don't like duck (who ARE you?) and the foie gras dog will fall short of the hype. In any event, if you go to Doug's and do not love it, I never want to be seen with you.
