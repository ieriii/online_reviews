Sultan's Market has THE best falafel sandwich i've found so far. Part of the secret is how they chop the fresh crunchy falafel into the pita for better distribution. They'll even do up the sandiwch spicy which is my preference. The baba is my favorite here too. Yummy spinach pies...and oh so much more. Love this place!
