Sunday brunch was had in this quite fancy establishment, and most definitely enjoyed by all. The long wait to get your table is not deceiving. We were given an electronic beeper and went upstairs to wait. Once it rang, we went to the host`s desk (on that level) and were seated promptly. I have done brunches in a couple of places and right now, I am hard-pressed to recall a place better than Grand Lux. Grand Lux had an exquisite menu. Lots of selection (but that`s pretty standard when you go to the States), and I settled on the fluffy buttermilk pancakes with walnuts and bananas. I asked for syrup substitution and got maple syrup. My dish was delicious and I could not finish that breaded goodness. My friend ordered an omelet and her plate looked equally exquisite. A vast improvement from Eggsperience because they were not greasy. We had a very good brunch and were beyond full until maybe 8pm. I will definitely return here.
