I went here with my cousin Nick over the summer and I am going to have to say this place was the bomb! I forgot what I ordered, but it meat was falling off the bone. I think it was the roast pork. The food here is pretty cheap too, AND it's BYOB! This place is a hot spot on a summer night. Love the outdoor seating. Cannot wait to come back and my Cuban on!
