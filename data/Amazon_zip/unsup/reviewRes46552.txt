I can't give RJ Grunts any less than 5 stars because I love it so much. You too can love it, if you remember to bring your Purell*... (do you see where I'm going with this?)  First I need to kvetch briefly on the fact that this place gets packed and you can wait forever for a table. In addition, be prepared for some loud (albeit awesome) music and screaming tots everywhere (not so awesome). It might be in your best interest to visit Grunts during off-peak hours, or later in the evening. And STAY AWAY during Zoo Lights: it's a mob scene.  Grunts is so dated, its like a time warp to a TGI Fridays circa 1978 (and I don't even know if that's possible). It's pretty dark in there, but you know what is pretty? All the pictures of the former waitresses adorning the walls. But the main event is the food: the burgers are seriously awesome and they come with homemade chips. Personally, I really love that salad bar.* Fight your way up there, lean away from the sneeze guard, and go for it. Be sure to top off your salad with some tuna noodle casserole. And for your sweet tooth, there's this scrumptious chocolate chip cream cheese "stuff". And jello. I like to get a scoop of each.
