I am amazed with this place! Not only did they turn a run down hot dog stand into the cutest little Cuban restaurant I've ever seen, but the food is amazing and the staff are incredibly friendly. We're lucky enough to live walking distance from this tasty restaurant. Definitely try to steak sandwich served on thick fried slices of platanos. AMAZING.
