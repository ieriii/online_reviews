Mmmmmm Mmmmmm Mmmmmm I do love me some brunch at The Bongo Room. My one caveat to that statement, is that I will only attempt to have brunch at The Bongo Room on a weekday, as the weekends get ridiculously packed with wait times often over an hour. I can't wait an hour for breakfast. But on a leisurely weekday like today, brunch with the husband and child is a divine activity. I've never had anything that wasn't spectacular. The omelettes and breakfast burritos are always delish and satisfying, but the true genius of The Bongo Room is in their AMAZING pancake confections. Luckily for us, my son ordered the banana pancakes topped with fresh strawberries, bananas and a small mountain of flavored whipped cream. The little guy finished less than one full pancake and then the husband and I pulled the plate between us and devoured the rest, after finishing our own breakfasts! It was like warm banana bread and so good we couldn't stop ourselves. This is the kind of place I want to spend all day at and just eat and eat. From past experience I can also testify that the lemon ricotta pancakes and the purple Oreo and raspberry pancakes [for serious people] are also heavenly. Really good Intelligentsia coffee, too! Yum! I'm taking one star away though because of the stupidly long wait times on the weekend and the resulting rude staff when it gets packed. But, for a weekday treat, there is none better.
