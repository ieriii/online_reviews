I've been to this place twice now, once with s group of 7 and then again with just 2. My first experience was really nice, we all ordered and shared family style and everything I tried was tasty. The service was really good too, our server was very attentive and even recommended a really good Indian beer for us to try. The second time I came here we ordered the "feast for two" (and man do they mean that) the menu was not at all clear on what exactly this came with, even the waiter didn't really explain it well. I thought it was a 4 course meal for 2 (soup,salad, choice of tikka masala or butter chicken, dessert) and it was all of these things except the chicken masala was more of a smallish side dish and we were given a big plate of meat. Literally a pile of meat, 2 kinds of chicken, HUGE shrimp, lamb and some cheese, all in a big pile on an onion slice or 2. I seriously had no idea that this was what we had ordered and was a little disappointed since I was really looking forward to tikka masala. However the meat plate was excellently cooked as was everything else. There was so much food it was unreal, so much food-- salad, soup, rice, naan, chicken tikka masala, and about a 1/4lbs each of tandoori chicken, lamb, shrimp and another kind of chicken (can't remember name..?) and then an awesome rice pudding at the end. All in all the food was really good and reasonably priced for what you get. The service was so so. Our server was pretty short with us, and then toward the end of our meal (that was supposed to be a nice romantic one) they started breaking down all of the tables all around us and setting up the lunch buffet very loudly. And we were given our check before we even finished eating, twice. We were all but asked to leave, and this was over an hour before they even close...
