Loud atmosphere; tables are situated mere feet from the deafening bar. Slow service despite being there close to opening. Entrees only include the protein. If I'm paying $50 for a main course it damn well better come with at least one side if not two. Give me a vegetable or something! And no, the sprinkling of parsley on top does not count. Others raved to us about the lobster mashed potatoes but it was only "meh." Mastro's prides itself in being an upscale steakhouse yet there was not even one option of grassfed beef around (all other beef is flavorless to me). So, I ordered the lamb, which was also extremely pricey. The lamb could have been cooked better, but to their credit, my boyfriend's steak was perfectly cooked. Too bad I couldn't taste it.
