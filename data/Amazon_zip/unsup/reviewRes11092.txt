Yum! Loved it. The hubs and I decided to go out for lunch today to a place we've been meaning to try forever. After failed attempts to go to Hot Doug's (a 2 block line in 90 degree heat? Eff that) and Kuma's Corner (no burger can possibly justify a 1.5 hour wait), we found ourselves at Piece. And thankfully, seated immediately! We decided to order 2 small pizzas so we would have leftovers. We got a red pizza with sausage and mushrooms and a white with spinach and artichoke hearts. Both were delicious. We took a TON of pizza home, but I just warmed a slice in the oven and it was just as crispy and delicious. We probably won't order as much food next time, but we wanted to try a couple different pies on our first time. I had the Top Heavy Hef, which I loved (not a big beer fan either). The hubs had the Worryin' Ale, which he liked (too heavy for my tastes). Our server was GREAT. She was really, really nice, which is not always the case at a pub/bar type environment. The name on the check was Elliott, not sure if that is her first name, but she was so sweet.
