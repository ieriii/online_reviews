Have I mentioned that I'm obsessed with small plate-style eating? I really love 1) getting to taste lots of things 2) finger foods and 3) meals that just keep coming. Hum, I sense a new list forming. And Purple Pig will be on that list. When the cute italian boy sitting 3 cm away from you leans over and recommends the lardo ... you get the lardo. And while it was tasty, my tummy was NOT happy an hour later. That probably had something to do with my tummy's lack of familiarity with pure fat. Okay, TMI. ANYWAY, other than that, I have no complaints about my experience here. The food was a really quite grand -- especially the beets with whipped goat cheese. In fact, I think my new motto is "everything would be better with some whipped goat cheese." The waitress was lovely and the wine list was quite extensive (yes, I will have 1/3 bottle instead of only a glass, thank you). All in all, a gem of a spot.
