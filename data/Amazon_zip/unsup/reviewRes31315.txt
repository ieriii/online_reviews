Walked in on a Sunday morning at 11:00 a.m. and we waited a minute to be seated. Fast seating seemed like a lucky break but when we sat down and realized it was a meat free restaurant we were a bit dissapointed. I'm not a huge meat eater and I will try any restaurant once. The server was the friendliest waiter ever. Coffee was strong and delicious, even the decaf. I ordered the french toast, eggs and hash brown. Meh. Ok. I'm a HUGE breakfast lover but I wasn't sold. I'm sorry. The portions look small but I was full when I finished. If you are vegan I'm sure you'll love it. Meat eaters, stay away!
