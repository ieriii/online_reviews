Hello, Fat Girl here. I've experience my first pho here and would like to tell you that I am hooked! The bowl of noodle soup is very generous and guaranteed to fill you up! I like to swirl some of the jalapeno pepper in the broth so it gets nice and spicy. If you're feeling under the weather, have some PHO! then go to the Gym, work out, then sit in the steam room. You will feel much better! I give the waiters props for being patient while waiting for my sis and I to finish our pho. It took us forever to down that noodley goodness! One of the pho is served with bull penis! I always forget to take pics of the description on the menu!
