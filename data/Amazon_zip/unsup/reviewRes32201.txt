Ok, so this is my SECOND time at Demera. My best pal and I went for the lunch special, about 7 bucks a person. YUMMERS! We shared one of those 4 dish meals, one beef dish and three vegetarian ones. All were tasty and delish. On top of that, we had the same server we had last time at dinner, and she is one of those sweet, polite, intelligent servers who does everything perfectly. Eating with hands and only using their injera (a kind of soft roti) to pick stuff up takes some getting use to. I'm still an amateur, so I'm a bit clumsy, but I'm going to keep coming here and maybe I'll get the hang of it.
