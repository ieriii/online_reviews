my favorite pizza in the city! YEAH, I SAID IT. i'm not a deep dish girl, so i'm not even going there (though I've obviously had it, and it's of course delicious.) their regular thing crust is so perfect; $3-ish for a slice, it's huge, it's always hot and fresh, the pepperoni is fantastic. so is the sausage. and the mushrooms, onions, jalapenos, green peppers... a dude works there with a FANTASTIC voice. he probably helped my addiction, but i don't hate it. you'll know instantly when you've met the guy, and then it's imperative you ask him to list the toppings on all of the pizzas. you won't regret it. fun fact - it's byob! i didn't know that until i moved away (living on the same block was a blessing and a curse) which made me sad but it's probably for the best. it's also probably for the best that they aren't open passed 11pm - i mean, drunk art of pizza would be amazing, but i'll never have to live with the regret of stumbling in there reeking of liquor and saying/doing something stupid. save that shit for chicagos on lincoln, they're just asking for it when they're open until 5am.
