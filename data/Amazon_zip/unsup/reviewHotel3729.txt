Very peaceful hotel. We really loved this hotel. The location could not be beat and the rooms were cozy. Great little balcony on our room which sealed the deal. Although we didn't eat at the hotel during our stay we did head up to the rooftop bar a couple times. What a spectacular location and view. We will return.
