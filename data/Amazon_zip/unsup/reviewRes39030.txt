Spring Break 2012!! Woo Hoo!!  So maybe my week on the couch hasn't been reminiscent of old MTV specials; however, when I have gotten out, it has been fun! We lunched today at Longman and Eagle and it was fabulous. We started with the fig, cheese and melon salad. The cantaloupe was unlike any I have ever tasted before. It was extra juicy and had a super concentrated flavor. Our server let us know that this was by design as the melon undergoes some sort of transformative process that makes it more delicious and compresses the flavor. Whatever it is, it is genius! I also had the burger and I will venture to say that the bacon on my burger was the best I ever had. It was extra smokey and really complemented the beef. Not only that, but it came with beef fat fries. Cap all of that off with a Mexican Coke and total win!
