There's a poem on the wall behind the sushi bar at coast, that was written by a little girl. "I love Coast. Coast is the best. Coast is the best. Better than all the rest." I have to agree with the little girl, Coast is quite good. But you are probably wondering why I only gave it 4 stars. Well, when I sit at the sushi BAR, I expect to order and talk to the sushi chef. That's where the real magic happens. However, not at Coast. You order from a server. The guys behind the counter get really taken aback when you try to order for them. Don't make the same mistake we did, just sit and wait until someone comes to you. I'm a big fan of trying the "designer sushi" or "specialty rolls". I like to see how creative the sushi chef's can get. Coast did not disappoint. We ordered 6 rolls. The most interesting roll was the Sunshine roll with ginger soaked tuna wrapped with mango. The tastiest roll was the Po'Boy, with the White Dragon Roll coming in a close second. We went around 6:45 on a Wednesday and there was already a wait for a table without a reservation, so we decided to sit at the sushi bar. We got served right away (well, after I tried to order from the Sushi chef who seemed slightly confused). The place was a bit loud, but it wasn't too terrible.  The rolls we had were very good and a little on the pricey side. Again, we had the designer suhi, not the regular maki or negri rolls.  Those looked quite reasonable, even their dragon roll. And if you BYOB, if you order at least $15 per person they waive their $5 per person corkage fee. So easy to do with sushi. :) We will definitely be back. There are two more specialty rolls we want to try in addition to see how they do their regular rolls. Service was good. Overall very happy, except for the fact that I can't order from or talk to the sushi chef.
