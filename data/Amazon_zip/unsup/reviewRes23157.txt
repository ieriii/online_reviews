Normally for Chinese New Years, a group of us will travel down to Chinatown for our yearly ritual. The last couple of years, we've leaned towards family styles meals rather than Dim Sum. I'm so glad last year we went to Lao Sze Chuan!!! There were 9 of us in the group and since it was Chinese New Years, we made reservations. I'm so glad we did because it was a very popular place! It was super packed and every table was filled. This restaurant is 2 levels with most of the big tables on the 2nd floor. We did a traditional family style meals - ordering between 10 - 13 entrees raging from sauteed veggies, beef, chicken, pork, and seafood. The menu is quite extensive, so either ask for recommendation or bring someone familiar with the menu with you. I really don't remember one bad dish. I thought everything was very tasty. I also went there another time to have hot pot. They have an all you can eat hot pot where you can order as much as you like off their set menu. My friend that came with me has celiac disease and they were very accommodating in making sure whatever we ordered she could eat. The service is what you can expect in another other restaurant in Chinatown. When they are busy, it isn't very fast... but overall, their food is solid and reliable. You know that every time you go, the food will be good.
