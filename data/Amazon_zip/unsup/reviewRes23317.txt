Well, with all the previous reviews, mine might be slightly redundent. But, overall I enjoyed this restaurant. Living just down the road from it, I was happy with its convenience and the food was absolutely delicious.  However, this place may have actually received a higher rating from me, but I was not very pleased with the waitress who took our order. It wasn't necessarily her personality that was bad, but instead the lack of clearity on what we ordered.  When someone says, "I've never been here before, what would you recommend?". That is usually an EXCELLENT clue that someone has never been to the restaurant before.  Having said that, when she took our orders she asked if we wanted the rice and benas mixture, and my father and I never thought to ask if it was at an additional price. Furthermore, we were asked if we wanted it spicy, again no mention of an additional cost.  Needless to say, yes it does state those two things on the menu, hower, it is a very small mention somewhere in the middle of a lot of great food! Next time, don't be shady about it, and I'm sure we would have still ordered the same thing. At any rate, Irazu is a very good place to go, and I definitely will be going back.  Give it a try, but remember to check if the price will be more because of what you ordered!
