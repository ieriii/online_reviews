My great-grandma lived right around the corner at Milwaukee and Devon, so I grew up eating here. As soon as I got my drivers license, this was one of the first road trips I made! I LOVE THIS PLACE! My grandma grew up eating here, too. This is a historical landmark and the best dogs, burgers, & malts in the WORLD! I was in the hospital not that long ago & my mom actually drove all the way out there to pick me up a dog as a surprise treat. This place not only has its own amazing history, but our own family history. You gotta try this place!!! It will turn into a special family treat for you, too.
