DEEP FRIED HEAVEN on a budget especially with this deal: $19.99 = 1 whole Seoul Sassy fried chicken + 2 sides. It's garlic-y, sweet, and spicy. Texture wise, it's both crispy and juicy. Their chicken plays with all of your tastebuds! While I try not to be a glutton, I managed to eat like 3/4 of the entire chicken. Can't say it's one of my classiest moments.  For our sides, we ordered their Superfly Frites and Marty's Magic Mushrooms. The frites were crispy and the mushrooms were nice and juicy.
