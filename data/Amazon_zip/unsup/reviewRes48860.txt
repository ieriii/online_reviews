This is not the place you want to go to if you intend to have a conversation without yelling. Food is okay. I had a selection of oysters which were delicious. My husband ordered the ham sampler which was decent but not outstanding. The pork belly was delicious but the potee was somewhat disappointing. Our food was brought out in no particular order, oysters, ham, followed by side of collard greens and then our pork and potee. Our small table for two was soon overcrowded with plates which I think could have been avoided had the timing of the food service been better.
