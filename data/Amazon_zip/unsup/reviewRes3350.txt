My husband has a slight accent and somehow they mistook 20 wings for 20 sides of Blue cheese! Unfortunately, we ended up with 5 wings and 20 sides of blue cheese. We called back several times and between holding for a manager and the woman who helped us....they were "willing" to let us have 15 wings....if we paid for them....after paying $10 in a SIDE of blue cheese. Even after I tried to talk to them.....they still messed it up. Wow..........thanks for charging me $10 in sauce!
