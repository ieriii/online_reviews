If you're ready to spend some money, this place is fantastic. I can't say enough about the service and the food itself. We had the 5 course tasting which is really more like 10 courses when they throw in the extras. There was only one item that was just OK, everything else was unique and fantastic.  For such a high end place with top notch service, it doesn't come off as uppity, just classy. I know that Chicago has tons of restaurants but we chose this on a long weekend visit and were very glad we picked it.
