At last...terrific delicious thin crust pizza! I saw they were voted #1 by Metromix and decided to try it out. It's not close to our home but what the heck.What did we find? Crispy, tasty, with fresh, fresh ingredients. It doesn't get much better than this. We took the pizza home so I can't comment on the restaurant experience. Had the "red" pizza with sauteed mushrooms, onions and sausage. The mushrooms and sausage were very tasty. I really liked this pizza. We've tried a lot - and so far they are the winner. They have lots of toppings and styles to choose from, sure to be something for everyone. Try it if you want a great thin crust pizza. One more one thing we got a small and it was HUGE, plenty for two with some leftover. Great value. Verdict: guilty of servicing one of the best thin crust pizza's in Chicago
