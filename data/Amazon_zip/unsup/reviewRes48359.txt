You know the feeling you get when you're at a museum or a really nice store and see things behind glass that you wish you could touch? Honestly, that was the feeling I had when the food started coming out last night at The Publican. Oyster stout and oysters, mussels (actually just so-so in terms of quality), frites - best I've had in years, ham sampler - wow, pig's ear salad - great twist on the classic caesar, ubertasty smoked country style ribs, and a succulent duck breast. with white bean puree hen of the wood mushrooms and macerated dates. Great night, wonderful food. Pig-penned it in one of the booths and sat near the CEO of CPS actin' straight bougie with his boys. Take me to swinetown I said, and they sure knew the way...
