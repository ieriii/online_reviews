Came here on a Thursday night (with a party of 20) looking to enjoy a casual dinner for a friend's birthday, with no reservations! Staff was super accomdating. Did not wait long at all, about 10 min tops. I forgot who our waiter was but he was super nice. Before I had appetizers, I ordered the Triple Fist that comes in a snifter. I believe that's a pale ale. It's very fruity and not too heavy! Perfect for a girl and also very strong! :) He made sure we ALL heard the specials of the day, repeated himself three times (once on each end of the table and once in the middle). We ordered appetizers first, it all came out at once, no mistakes and all very yummmmtastic! (I had the polenta fries and steamed PEI mussels) Our table proceeded to order the main entree. Everything came out all at once, again! Everything was so delicious. (Hombre Burger!!) Every time he took orders, he didn't even write anything down and memorized everything, with no mistakes! I really wish I knew what his name was so I can at least give him credit for being a superb waiter. We brought in a cake for the birthday boy. Almost burned the place down but again, our waiter was accomdating to our careless needs and then laughed it off. Those darn trick candles! Never a good idea.. Overall, Revolution Brewing Co is spacious, fun, casual, laidback and everything on the menu is reasonably priced for the portions you get. There's street parking available but it looks as though you would have a difficult time finding a parking spot. I'm not sure cus we got VIP parking right in front as soon as we pulled up! :) I would definitely go back if I'm ever in the area.
