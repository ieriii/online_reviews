My husband and I went there for a CBC event that involved tapping beers from Three Floyds, Stone, and Dogfish Head. It was our first time and we had a fantastic experience. First off, their service is top notch. Because of the special event, the place was quite crowded. Despite that, we were really well attended to and the service staff met our every need, including re-routing our charcuterie plate when we moved from the bar to a table. I also recall seeing the staff hand out beer tastings to patrons that were in the waiting area. They know how to keep the customer happy. Since we were there for the special beer tappings, we knew we were in for a treat with the beer - so I cannot comment on their normal beer selection. I'd imagine it would be tasty. The food was awesome. Everything on the menu looked amazing and of course we ended up ordering way too much. We started with the charcuterie plate which was way better than any other restaurants' boring selection of salami and soppressetta. Our plate had pork pie, head cheese, and a bunch of sausage we didn't recognize. And the best part is they make all of it in-house. Next up were oysters. We didn't know much about the different oceans and seas they came from, but each oyster was a little different and all were super fresh and tasty. We had some grilled ramps to check of the veggies for the night and then finished off with a seafood stew. The stew was awesome - they did not skimp on the seafood part. The mussels in the stew were the largest mussels I have ever eaten. We'll be back - definitely a fantastic place if you like meat and beer. And who doesn't?
