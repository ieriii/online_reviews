This place is yummy. It's colorful and nicely lit if you're looking for a date place. We were there on a weeknight (Wednesday, maybe?), and there was no wait. I ordered the pistachio crusted chicken, and I am so glad I did. It was really amazing. The staff was also very courteous and polite. I'll definitely be back!
