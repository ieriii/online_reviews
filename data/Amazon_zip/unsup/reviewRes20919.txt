that churro was damn good...and it was the cheapest thing in xoco probably! after i waited in a 45 minute line...(although it was a friday during lunch time only 2 weeks after opening and Rick Bayless was cooking on the line at the time) and by the time i got there i wanted to order everything on the menu. i decided to get a side salad with jicama, an oven roasted chicken sandwich with avocado and a churro. if they would have had the watermelon water i would have gotten that too...but it was no where to be found. it's small but interactive. you feel like you're in on all of the action with the wood burning oven and the pastry area doing their thing while you wait and order. not to mention, Rick Bayless cooking for you, hello! it's not your typical short-order. they had a host reserving tables for you, so that when you got your food, you had somewhere to eat. the rule was that you couldn't place your order until he could find a spot for you...which probably made the line longer, but made sense. by the time we got our food we had to eat it uber fast since we were really stretching our lunch hour...but it was worth the wait. the side salad and churro were my faves. the side salad, although sounds blah, shines in it's simplicity with a light vinnegarrete and slices of jicama and cucumber. the churro was crispy and doughy, sugary and sweet. AH-mazing! but the sandwich was OK. personally i didn't enjoy all of the fat i kept getting with every bite, no thanks. the bread they used was awesome and the ingredients were fresh! no chicken next time for me.
