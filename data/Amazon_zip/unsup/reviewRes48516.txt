I would wholeheartedly recommend Publican for a good beer and a fabulous pretzel. I loved the selection of Flemish reds, and the homemade pretzel was divine. However, for dinner, it was pretty disappointing. The seafood I found excellent, but the meat was disappointing. Also disappointing were the "spicy" pork rinds. They didn't taste like much at all. Most upsetting was the fact that we ordered one dish, but were brought another because they had run out of the first. We weren't told that they had run out, or asked if we'd like something else instead. Rather, they just brought us something else.  I think this is a great place to go to drink a rare beer and feel trendy, but spend your money on dinner somewhere else.
