Took a group of 25 to Wilde last night to kick-off a birthday party. From the minute we walked in they were beyond helpful. They helped us store our party supplies for later in the evening, took our drink orders right away and made sure to keep checking in on our time frame. Once we ordered we had our food within what felt like just minutes and the food was so delicious. Our waiter was so on top of it that when I thought I needed a glass of water, I turned to ask and he was walking out with glasses for the whole party. At the end of the meal he even split all the checks making it easy on our party. There was even a yummy dessert for the birthday girls after dinner! The food was great and the staff was terrific. Was the best start to our birthday night!
