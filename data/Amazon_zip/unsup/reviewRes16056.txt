Ok, I know what you're thinking: "OMFG what a loser! He JUST ate at Carnivale's now? ROFL!!11one. That place isn't even cool anymore!" Well get over it. Here's the scoop... The decor is Kleiner-style, like the gaucamole: Huge chandeliers and lamps covered in red stuff. Curtains. Interesting bathrooms. The food is quite good. Well, at least the beef is quite good. We got the ceviche sampler because they didn't have enough Kona Kampachi to bring a full order. Turns out there's a reason for that. All the other ones were teh sucks! So get that Kona Kampachi if you want ceviche. For other apps we had the empanada (excellent with the radish or whatever that red stuff was), the guac (bitchen), and the ropa vieja (very good and perfect for sharing with a few other people). For the main course I tried three different steaks: skirt, ribeye, and filet and all were excellent. I tried my sister's shrimp that came with her fish and it was ok, not great. The real highlights for me though were the plantains and yucca. Best I've ever had. Dessert was small because we were so dang full. Aside from the ceviche incident, the only downsides I found were the service. First, the waitress kept trying to upsell us on more expensive tequila and cuts of meat. That's a little annoying. Also, the wait time for a mixed drink was exceptionally long. That's it though. This isn't the most sophisticated meal you'll ever ever eat, and I wouldn't go to town on a steak and plaintains if I were planning to get totally shitfaced and show off my wristwatch at Victor Hotel after dinner. It is, however, a more complete and upscale alternative to Las Tablas or Tango Sur. Think Rios D' Sudamerica on Armitage, but with better execution.
