What a great romantic spot. I've never had a bad experience at Le Colonial. The downstairs is more formal and the upstairs is relaxed and fun. The restaurant thrives in the summer when the open up the windows and the second floor balcony is open to the street below. The Chilean Sea Bass dish is amazing, but I stopped ordering it due to overfishing. I really wish restaurants would figure it out and start serving Mediterranean Bass or another substitute. I would love to start eating Patagonian Tooth fish again but so long as its on the watch list, I can't with good conscious!
