So here's the thing... I was at Shaw's for the first time a few days ago for lunch. I thought it was just average. But my brand new family-in-law LOVED it and had visited more than once during their trip to Chicago for our wedding this weekend. They gushed about the fried shrimp and the chop salad. They gushed about the ambiance. So Shaw's gets a solid 4 stars just for pleasing them!  Judy, our server, has worked at Shaw's for 25 years. She was really funny and joked with my mother-in-law and aunt-in-law. They got along so well, hugs were exchanged after the check was signed. Judy gets 5 stars for being awesome AND for pleasing these important new women in my life. But again, I thought it was just average. I will go back and try their crab legs and oysters though.
