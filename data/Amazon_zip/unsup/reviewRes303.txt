Alinea = A Celebration of Food. It started with the simple question, "How long is the dining experience?" To celebrate a special anniversary and as my final meal before my Chicago Marathon, my partner in culinary crime and I headed to Grant Achatz's celebrated molecular gastronimic restaurant, Alinea. Securing reservations for this place was the most difficult (aside from Momofuku ko in NYC, which I have given up on) that I have experienced. Even concierge services have trouble landing a table here. Luckily, thanks to the handy 'redial' button, reservations were made and the simple question was posed. We opted to "Take the Tour", which consisted of 24 courses. Yes, t-w-e-n-t-y f-o-u-r. It's pretty intimidating to think about especially if you are worried that you can't finish them (and especially if you were silly enough to eat a pizza pot pie two hours beforehand!). But, no worries, the mission was accomplished. The wine pairings and service at Alinea were quite frankly supurb. The best I've experienced in the U.S. As for the food? It was my best meal ever. Too much to describe, too long of a conversation this would devolve into.  The tour included dessert and an assortment of foods prepared in more scientific-inspired styles I could have imaged (freeze dried cheese? gelatinized flavor packed tomato cubs? basil ice cream? Guiness beer gelatin layer?). My favorite dish was the Wagyu beef from Japan pairing with maitake mushrooms and some secret Elixir. Oh yes, the answer to my gf's original question, "Four hours".
