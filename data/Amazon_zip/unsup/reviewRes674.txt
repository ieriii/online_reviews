I can't say that I loved every single course (there were 24 of them!), but I loved most of them and I loved the whole experience. They are amazingly creative with their dishes, both in flavors and in presentation.  And the wine pairing was fantastic and spot on. The service was also impeccable...down to the last detail. I noticed that every time I used the bathroom, someone went in after to re-fold the ends of the toilet paper and empty the trash...so each person gets a completely fresh bathroom. It's certainly worth the experience...but maybe just once. Given the price tag on a dinner for two, I think we'll probably try a different restaurant next time we want to spend a thousand dollars on dinner.
