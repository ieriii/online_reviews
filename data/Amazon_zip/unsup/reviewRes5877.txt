Small plate dining has taken over. And I like it! Davanti is a fun and reasonably priced restaurant with a lot of good food offerings, with a great wine selection to pair. They dont take reservations, so the wait can be long. But you'll have fun sitting at their wine bar or just go grab a coctail around the corner. They have a great selection of anti pasti, like fresh cheeses and nice meats to go with. IIt would be fun to just sit at the bar with a bottle of wine and munch away on a large selecion of these. The Marscapone polenta with ragu of the day is pretty good. It didnt blow me away with flavor and it's pretty filling. So you may want to reconsider so you can try some other good stuff. Great way to start is the chicken liver pate and the ricotta with honey. We gobbled these down instantly.The white anchovies are awesome. Really good texture and flavor going on with this dish. Dont let anchovie scare you. They're not as salty and much more meaty than the ones you may be use to. Truffle Egg Toast, wow is this good. We ordered 2...Pork belly was good. Not the best I've ever had, but the apple was a smart pairing. The linguine with the sea urchin and crab was a show stealer. Rich, creamy, and perfect balance of flavor. The Roasted cherry tomatoes with burrata and basil is a nice refreshing balance of flavor. Goes great with red wine. Seared octopus and seared halibut are awesome protien dishes. Davanti is new, lively, and has menu full of good items worth coming back and back for.
