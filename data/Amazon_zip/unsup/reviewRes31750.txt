Trendy space gets 4 stars from me. Food gets only 2 and since I love food, Sunda underwhelmed me. Nothing was awesome but nothing was terrible Ibut I've definitely had A LOT BETTER. Big noisy space, cool decor but filled with business diners and women who were made up and dressed up just because they were going to a "hip spot". I found Sunda to be annoying, as someone coming from NYC because restaurants and scenes like that are allllllll over NYC, so bf and I settled for Sunda because it was the only restaurant in the area without an insane wait. App: tuna tartare special. It was tuna tartare sandwiched between two fried wonton skins. It was pretty good but you really can't mess up tuna tartare. A bit salty though.... Main: baked crab roll your classic mess of fusion sushi. Waaaaay too much mayo on top, waaaay too much crunch. By the time I chewed through the mess on top I was wondering if this roll really had the crab that it said was in the roll. I really hate fusion restaurants that do this. Don't go to a sushi spot to order these disgusting sauces up balls of mayo if you don't like real raw fish. Bf's main: black cod with miso. Waaaaaay to salty. Miso flavor was great, the overdoing the miso paste was not. Fish was perfectly cooked though. What a waste. I must've had black cod with miso a million times and I've never had it quite as salty. This was not an enjoyable meal. We will definitely not go back to Sunda on our next visit to Chicago.
