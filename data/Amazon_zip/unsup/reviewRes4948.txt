Unbelievably fresh and unique. My favorites: -Grilled calamari with couscous, thinly sliced radishes, cucumber and pistachio. How could so many disparate components go together so well? The texture of the calamari and couscous are shockingly similar and are punctuated with the crisp crunch of radish and pistachio. The whole thing was lightly dressed with something a bit acidic that brought out the flavors of everything and it all came together perfetly -Beets (salt roasted) with whipped goat cheese and some kind of vinaigrette. When I make this at home, it isn't nearly as light and fluffy. Perhaps not as novel as the calamari dish, but a home run nonetheless -Chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes and a tzatziki sauce. First of all, I have been trying to fry mashed potatoes for two years and have consistently failed where the purple pig succeeded. The thighs were grilled perfectly and the tzatziki sauce was so unbelievably flavorful that we found ourselves using everything on the table to scoop it up. Delicious yogurt flavor but light and tangy as well. We had a couple more items, of which the only real 'miss' was the prosciutto bread balls. The description appealed to me pretty well but the dish itself was pretty salty and without any real punch to it. I would come back here in a heartbeat and cannot wait to explore more of the menu.
