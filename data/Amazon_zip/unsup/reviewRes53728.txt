In the city where hot dogs are king (except for those who use ketchup), Hot Doug's is the Buckingham Palace. Not only can you enjoy the standard hot dog choices, but Doug has opened up a exciting world of exotic encased meats that delights all the senses. And the buns are always fresh. The only problem with Hot Doug's is that I moved 10 miles away from it.
