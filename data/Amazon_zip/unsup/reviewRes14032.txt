The beer here is impressive, the food even better. I had the bottom up wit, light crisp delicious begian beer. I also tried the bourbon barrel aged stout, which was really good. I usually don't like stouts but this was tasty. Service was attentive, the vibe was nice, plenty of parking outside. Bummed I didn't discover this place sooner.
