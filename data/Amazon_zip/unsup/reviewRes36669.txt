I've been going to Indie for over a year now and here's a quick list of why I love it: Romantic cozy atmosphere Amazing crab rangoons! Very friendly service and management Great Thai AND Sushi...rare Crazy Basil Fried Rice Yummy Tom Yum Fast delivery Ever since the winter hit, we've been getting delivery more often, and if you want Thai delivery call Indie! They are also on GrubHub. Sushi delivery that tastes fresh! Wow didn't think that was possible til this place! Love them!
