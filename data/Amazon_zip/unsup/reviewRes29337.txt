I was coming home from work on a Saturday afternoon and needed something to take home, so ran across the street to Opart. Won't be making that mistake again.  It wasn't very busy, but they had only one waiter and it was a little much for him. It seemed like he did things in a timely manner, nothing sat waiting to be served. I got a Thai Iced Coffee and it was 80% ice, 15% Folgers instant coffee and 5% half and half. At least when the ice melted my thirst was quenched.... I got the Pad See Ewe with tofu which was okay except oddly sweet. Not that it shouldn't be, but it tasted weird.... There was a good amount of tofu which is a plus.
