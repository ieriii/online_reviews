I flew out to Chicago to seek out Deep dish pizza, and I found it! Went to Burt's Place in Morton Grove, it was like so what. I was so fired up for Burt's, that was a major reason I flew out. So I got back on with my fellow yelpers in Chicago, and you guys made my trip worth it with Pequod's Pizza. Pequod's was night & day, super tasty. Thanks Chicago! By the way Wrigley Field was awesome too... Respect!
