Well, I was just looking up where this place was located to recommend it to somebody else and I noticed that I'd somehow never rated it here on Yelp.  This place is my favorite pizza place here in Chicago! I only have found one other place that can come close the the flavors that these folks pack into a pizza pie. I really don't even care for pan pizza, but I have to admit I'm sold on the Art of Pizza's pan pizzas which for me is saying a lot! Every time my daughter comes to town The Art of Pizza is one of the places she insists we must go to and I'm always happy to oblige. The only downside to this restaurant is that if you are looking for a nice sit down establishment this would be a letdown. It is a step above a fast food chain as far as the seating goes, but it's nothing fancy by any stretch of the imagination. Keep in mind I'm only talking about the seating and the food is definitely worth the 5 stars in my opinion. I'll continue to go here and will enjoy every bite!!!!
