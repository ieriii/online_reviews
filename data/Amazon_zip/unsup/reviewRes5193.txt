This place was great, I stumbled upon it while walking up Michigan Ave with my brother and his wife. We were in town for the Rock and Roll half marathon and we were in search for a good place to grab a glass of wine (this was pre yelp and foursquare days for me). We were seated at the end of a large table, its almost cafeteria style seating but yet kinda posh and cool. We ordered a big spread of cheeses, crackers, bread and the others in my party enjoyed some meat as well... we sipped on some amazing wines and had a great time. I will definitely go back when I am in town next. I wouldn't go there for a full meal but its great for a lunch with wine or an afternoon spot.
