Midnight on a Thursday and this joint was jumpin'! There was still a line out the door to get in and the place was packed with young and old alike jostling to find some space. (I wouldn't necessarily get there early to snag a booth since you'll just have folks standing crotch-to-your-eye-level if it's a popular night.) The big band still had an hour left in their set and it was such a treat to hear standards like "Do Nothing 'Till You Hear From Me." The announcer performing old-fashioned radio-style commercials and 1940s-esque newsreels also set the mood. Loved it! (P.S. Even though the live music ended at 1 a.m., I believe they said the Green Mill didn't close until 4!) I'll conclude with some unsolicited advice: Just because you think you're a sweet swing dancer does not mean that you should attempt to lindy hop on a crowded dance floor, though it is amusing to watch everyone give you the evil eye when you do.
