This is hands down the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! Forget about bringing all your out of town guests to the other tourist traps... give them something they'll love and bring them here... I know i do!!! Im not even a huge fan of deep dish... I know.. gasp.. but if this place is mentioned in the mix of suggestions I will always say yes because it is that good! Im a huge fan of the caramelized crust... wins me over every time! Their ingredients are fresh and they supply an amply amount to each pie! I usually go with the sausage and garlic.... and i truly believe its the best pizza around! Dont forget the poppers... they're a nice treat to start off with! Also, if you can swing it for lunch they have a pretty sweet lunch special on weekdays from 11-3. For $4.95 you get a personal pan pizza with one topping and a beer or coke! Totally worth it!!!
