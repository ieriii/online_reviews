at tru, the food is tasty, the service is great--everyone knows this. the place wins james beard awards for a reason. so many of the dishes i've had here are permanently seared into my brain as being the best i have ever had or will ever have. however, many people gripe about the overly formal and "stuffy" service and ambiance. well, i am here to blow tru's cover! i have been here twice now (last sept and this june) and got the same server both times--and she remembered! we had a last-minute reservation in the lounge and the main dining room was full, but she negotiated with the chef and we were still able to partake in the 9 course grand collection. very cool. she was friendly and conversational and hardly pretentious, yet we received the same level of service we would have received in the main dining room (except for the purse stool, but i'm sure my purse will forgive me for putting it on the floor :P). at the end of the dinner, i asked if i could show my bf the warhol marilyn print in the main dining room. she personally walked us around and showed us all the art pieces, including one in the upstairs private room. my bf then casually mentioned that i hoped to see the kitchen someday--and she offered us a tour! if you are an aspiring chef like i am, or even just an huge foodie, this kitchen will knock your socks off. it is enormous and even has a separate pastry kitchen. the kitchen staff hardly minded we were there, and in fact, were quite nice! the moral of this story is, if you are intimidated or turned off by the potential stuffyness of this place--don't be. if you're not a total neanderthal and you're polite (and have a coupla bucks to blow!), you will not be out of place. two grand collections + 4 glasses of sake + 2 tastings of wine + tour of dining room and kitchen + tax + tip = $400.
