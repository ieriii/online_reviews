I have a hard time even giving this place a one star. To start, I ordered a salmon skin roll to go a few weeks ago and got a purina jerky treat instead. I could not even call to complain because I was afraid of what I might say. However, we did give it another try last night, hoping for a better dine in experience, but again were left disappointed. The spicy tuna was very fishy, and we couldn't bare to eat it. When we complained about the taste, the manager said that everyone else is eating it and not complaining. This is an unacceptable reply from a manager, and they have definitely lost an avid sushi goer along with some friends.
