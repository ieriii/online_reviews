I would like to send out kudo's to Juanita at Fox & Obel's cafe. Today I went with a business partner, and ordered their combo Grilled cheese and soup lunch. Then I usually order an additional grilled cheese (yes, they are that good). The young lady at the register said I had to have soup with both sandwiches. I explained to her, the manager usually gives me an addional sandwich for $4.00 and no soup. I guess there was so communication problems there, because she rang me up for two combos. After I sat down, I asked for the manager, and a WONDERFUL person named Juanita came to the rescue and took care of the problem, and gave me my correct change back. Thank you Juanita for taking the extra step and helping me enjoy my lunch.
