When I first moved to Chicago I lived in this building and was totally thrilled to have a late night place I could eat at any time I pleased. The french toast is amazing and I love how cozy and dark it is inside. It always feels like I'm hiding out from the city when I'm at 3rd Coast. I was back recently just for some beers and had an excellent time. They have a pretty good selection of drinks and there is a really laid back atmosphere. The waitstaff are always really nice. I just really, really love places that serve breakfast into the night becauase that is when my mouth starts watering for things like the banana walnut pancakes they serve and the applewood smoked bacon B.L.T. Yum, yum yum!
