I went to this place on Friday because a friend recommended it and I had seen it on Check Please! several weeks ago. Boy was this a bad recommendation. First, I LOVE middle east food. I got the veg dinner and it was mediocre, at best. Second, some of the staff could not have been less helpful or downright rude. We waited fifteen minutes to pay for our food. The boss was someplace else and was the only one with access to the cash register. Finally one of the guys behind the counter started taking money and making change out of the tip jar!!! This place is in dire need of a worker's revolt. The management here is clearly incompetent. I will never go back.
