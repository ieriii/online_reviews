The only reasons I'm not giving Fox & Obel 5 stars is because some of their prices are high. Also, when you walk in, there are zero shopping baskets. I would have bought more if I didn't have to balance everything in my arms. Otherwise, this place is foodie paradise. I thought of everything that's harder to find in other stores, wrote it down, and shopped. I didn't have a ton of time, but I found some nice stuff. Also, I really enjoyed browsing their eclectic selection. I bought 4 things. 1 being a pound of steak ($12.50 for flank - not hard to find, but I bought it there for the convenience), some fresh dill, blue cheese stuffed olives and some minced ginger. My total came out to $26 or $27. So F&O isn't cheap, but for your harder to find items, they're perfect. I plan to go again, rather than go to Whole Foods. I know F&O will have everything I'm looking for.
