4 starts for the quality of the food.. which is obviously very much reflected in the prices (read: $$). I'm kinda on the fence about this place, so I'll post the Good and the Bad, and I'll let you decide: GOOD: Our waiter was definitely 5 stars. An Argentinian dude, that saw that we were speaking Spanish to each other and took the opportunity to explain the dishes and the menu in Spanish- excellent cause we didn't have to translate anything to our grandma. For a fancy restaurant, he was able to understand my dad's terrible jokes and play along with. He rocked. The antipasti was delicious, especially the cauliflower, the sun-dried tomatoes and the grilled zucchinis. The added olive oil and thick (honey-like) balsamic vinaigrette made pretty much anything we dipped in, pretty effing tasty. He also recommended that I get the stracci: a papardelle-type pasta with garlic, asparagus, leeks and white truffle oil. It was overall tasty, but nothing out of this world.. and pretty much disliked by everyone in my table. People at our table seemed to really enjoy the fruitti de mare pasta waaay over my dish. BAD Our host/sommelier showed up with 2 bottles of wine that he had decided we were going to drink. Unfortunately for him, my family is as wine-snobby as it gets, and we weren't just going to drink anything he put in front of us. We noticed that although the wine selection was 'extensive', it really only had italian wines and they were all the same brand (just different year)... not really my kind of variety. After noticing that there were no petite syrah, shyraz, malbec or merlot, we gave up with some 07 Pinot noir that wasn't all that bad.  Overall, an OK place for a fancy dinner with a large group - mostly for the service and the attention that you get. However, for a food addict like me, I though that the prices really did not represent the quality and taste of the food, and just felt like I was paying for 'ambiance' and really overpriced wine.
