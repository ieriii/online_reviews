We ate outside on the back patio, which was very nice, and not too crowded. The food was hit or miss for me: the grilled octopus was one of the most delicious things ever...sooo amazingly tender. My roasted beet ravioli, however, was pretty flavorless, aside from the parmigiana sprinkled on top. Nevertheless, with a shared bottle of delicious wine, it was a completely enjoyable meal. Seriously, get the octopus, though!! Lastly, I'm not exactly a fancy frou frou eater, usually, and I dislike nothing more than having a waiter give a little attitude. Not even close at Anteprima, greeters and waiters were incredibly welcoming and not at all snooty. Wheelchair Accessibility Review: Fully accessible through the front door AND they have a little ramp to get to the back patio, which is a very welcome consideration that you don't always find (It's removable, though, so just ask someone if it isn't out when you get back there). Tables are of normal height that you can roll right up, and there was no problem with crowding, or moving the other chair out of the way. Didn't use the restrooms, so I can't speak to the accessibility of those.
