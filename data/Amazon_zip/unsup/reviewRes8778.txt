I've only ever picked up food here - never dined in. However, delicious, flavorful, huge portions. Wraps are especially gigantic! Not knowing how to pronounce some of the words on the menu, we were literally scoffed at the first time we ordered, which wasn't the greatest customer service but whatever. The pitas were a little dry the last time we got food there, but it can't be totally perfect every time, right? All in all, a really solid place with tasty food.
