After my group was done visiting Millennium Park, we popped in here for a late lunch. The food was on the pricier side, but it was pretty tasty. I ordered the half sandwich, half soup combo which was really filling, unlike other expensive restaurants. The best part was the smoked salmon sandwich I ordered- it was to die for. Smoked salmon with mustard, tomato, lettuce and aioli sandwiched (excuse the pun) between two toasted slices of sourdough? YUM. I also ordered the corn soup, which was good, but not my favorite soup ever. The fries were like standard steakhouse fries, so they were a little greasy, pretty thick, and lightly salted. Personally, I like my fries flavorful so I ended up putting a ton of extra salt and pepper on the fries, which made them taste great. I would definitely stop by here for lunch again when I'm in the neighborhood!
