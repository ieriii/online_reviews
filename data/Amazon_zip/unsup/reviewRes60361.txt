I'm a big fan of Japanese food and have been to different Japanese restaurants in Chicago. I'll say Wakamono is one of the worst I've ever been to. My boyfriend brought me to Wakamono for my birthday and I was kinda looking forward to this dinner at first after reading the reviews at yelp. The restaurant look nice, but the food is really bad. We ordered a seared tuna for appetizer, 3 rolls and a couple nigiri. The appetizer is alright, not anything surprise thou. The rolls were bad! They put unagi sauce on every roll they made, which make all the rolls tasting the same. The worst is they put on really A LOT of sauce, making the rolls taste salty. I can't really tell what I am eating except unagi sauce. For the nigiri, it's not good either. The sashimi is not fresh and the rice is not firm. The dinner cost about $70 for two people. I will not come back to this restaurant again. There is another jp restaurant around Lakeview a lot better than Wakamono with similar price. I'll go for that restaurant for sure from now on.
