Dear Sun Wah, thank you for the wonderful dinner. I have been searching for a place like you ever since I moved to Chicago. If it was based on you peking duck, bbq pork, and roast pork, you would have gotten five stars. Not that the rest was bad but not amazing like your bbq and roasted meats. But you have redeemed Chicago for its Chinese fare. See you again soon
