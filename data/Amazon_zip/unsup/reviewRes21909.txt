great tortas, great caldos. it is a little pricey but the quality of the food is excellent. it is a good lunch spot. i went on wednesday for the porkbelly, and it was great. i also had the short rib caldo, awesome flavors. it can get crowded but there are seats available, ordering can get confusing if its your first time. the churros was also good. never tried the hot chocolate but it seems to be a hit. give it a try in you are around the area.
