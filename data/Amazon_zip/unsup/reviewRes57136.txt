Tried Revolution Brewing Co. last Friday night and loved it!  The beer selection was great, and our server was happy to offer ideas and suggestions. The bacon popcorn was great and very unique! In fact, the entire menu offered unique selections that were a refreshing change from the usual.Even though it was packed, we had a beer at the bar while waiting and the hostess came and found us, remembered my name, and got us a great table.  We will definitely be back!
