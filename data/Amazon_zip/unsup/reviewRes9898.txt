Having read about this restaurant for some time, I wanted to try it out with out of town guests from St. Louis. We all loved everything about it - - from the beautiful outdoor patio, to the delicious food. My beet salad and my friend's Caprese Salad, were perhaps, the best we each have ever eaten. But, the real treat of the evening meal for me was my entree of the truffle pasta! I am still dreaming about it! I can't wait to have another opportunity to return.
