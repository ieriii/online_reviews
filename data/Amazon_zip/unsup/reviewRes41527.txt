This place has a big reputation for Uptown folks. I heard about it for months before I finally decided to see what all the hype was about. First, if you come for dinner be prepared to have a possible wait. Come early if you want to snag a table.  FYI: There are several "community" tables where you will be seated if you are only a party of 2 or 3, so you'll have neighbors not with your party at the table which can be a good thing as you may make a new set of friends while eating or at the very least have some interesting conversation. Moving onto the food, the menu is extensive and I found it helpful to have someone along with me that had eaten there a few times before. I ordered a crispy noodle dish with beef. It was very good and a ton of food! You get a lot for your dollar at this place. Spring rolls were also excellent. This isn't a high class joint mind you, but many asians eat at this establishment which for me is a good sign about the food. The pace is fast in this joint and the food comes fast, so stop by in my hood sometime and check it out.
