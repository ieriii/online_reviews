Lets be simple with this one.... A+ : The goat cheese fondue, beer selection and Bad Apple Burger C- : The ketchup, homemade or something...gimme my Heinz. D : The service. Bartending is not ignoring your customers....you are front and center...pay some attention please. And you weren't that busy on Saturday afternoon either. We even attempted to talk to you. Not the first time we had less than good service from this girl either. Maybe you should take the short haired bartender down to server and put the long haired girl that actually took care of us on the bar.
