If you like BBQ, this is THE place to go. Amazing food. The brisket and pulled chicken were my personal favorites. The cole slaw was outstanding - not too much mayo and not too tart and sharp. Atmosphere is relaxed but also, upscale. Waitstaff was attentive and friendly to our 6p table - no small feat! HIGHLY recommend visiting this place.
