We recently went on an Indian kick and in less than a week at here and at Klay Oven. I'm giving both 4 stars, but push come to shove, we're going to go back to Klay Oven rather than India House. Pros: Excellent service. The waiter was prompt, the water glasses kept full, the plates exchanged, the food boxed and check taken care of promptly. No extra waiting at all. Also, in general the ambiance/vibe here is better than Klay Oven.  Cons: The food was good, but not outstanding.  I'd give the palak at Klay Oven the edge by a decent margin.  If I'm in a rush, or in a large group, this is the place I'd go, but if I've got time to spare, I'm heading to Klay Oven.
