I love pizza...and this place doesn't disappoint! (so I'm kinda mad i didn't yelp this ages ago!) Deep dish is great and the crust is amazing. I'm a big crust person...i believe a bad crust can KILL a good pizza. Beer drinkers rejoice! They have good beer specials! on the day i was there pitchers were around $6 ( if i remember correctly) Its a small space so get there early as they filled up BIG time while i was eating!
