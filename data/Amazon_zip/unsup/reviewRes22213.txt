A local institution that we found to be fun and pretty good. It's set up like an old-time drive-in, where you roll down your window, press a button, and give your order to a speaker box, then a server comes out with it a bit later, props a tray up on your door. So it's a fun place, a throwback. And the food is pretty good. It's really heavy and greasy, but if you pull into a hot dog drive-in place, you're probably not thinking salad bar or calorie-cutting. Certainly different from most Chicago hot dog places, which we love, but hey, sometimes different is good. If you drive by, you should probably stop. PS: They don't take credit cards, which bugs the hell out of us.
