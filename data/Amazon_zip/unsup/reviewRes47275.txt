I found a place that rivals the awesomeness of Kuma's, as eveyrone else seems to point out in their reviews. However, the upsides to coming here instead is the lack of crowds. We came in and were able to sit right away on a Friday night. Impressive. My friend suggested the Lockdown Warden which is their signature burger. I wish I could remember everything that was on it now, besides leeks, bacon , shallots and tossed in truffle oil. Truffle oil, when done right, can be amazing. It was not overpowering here- just the way I like it!  They have those delicious pretzel buns I go crazy over, and a good selection of sides if you don't want standard fries. I highly recommend the mac n' cheese, as this is a meal upon itself.  I'm sure in time this place will blow up nice and huge, but til then Chicago, enjoy!
