Tasty, tasty. wow, never had Costa Rican food and I'm glad that my friend Silvia introduced me to this place! Try the Casado which is a traditional dish in Costa Rica. Choose the rib eye steak (it's seasoned to perfection) which is caramelized with onions, served with white rice, black beans, sweet plantains, an over easy egg & cabbage salad. And don't forget to add the Gallo Pinto (the white rice and black beans are cooked together with vegetable and spices). Could there be any more food? I had enough left over for lunch the next day. The place feels like a small road side cafe. Totally low key and no frills. The food is the star here. It's also BYOB which is an extra bonus.
