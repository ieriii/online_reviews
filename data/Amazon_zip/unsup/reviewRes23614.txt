Yum. I've been here a few times now, and every time it's been great. Interesting combinations of greens, cheeses, veggies, and other accouterments make for some tasty tasty crepes. I always get either the Marrakesh, which has cream cheese, caramelized onions, spinach, and raisins, and the inexplicably named Chicago with Muenster and avocado. Everything is very fresh and delicious, sprinkled with fresh mint or chopped nuts. Crepes are around $8 and come with a cup of soup- your choice of ______ puree or cream of _______. Last time it was vegetable puree or cream of mushroom. My friend and I both went for the veg puree and it was delicious. I'm not a fan of Turkish coffee but I imagine if you are a fan, you would love theirs. I usually just stick with the (free!) water with cucumber slices. It's like eating at a spa!
