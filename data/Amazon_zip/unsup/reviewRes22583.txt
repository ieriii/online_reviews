I'm rating this only on the hot dog. This is the best hot dog in the city! The size was perfect and the taste was perfect. This isn't your local vienna beef or other easy to get local beef dog. They must make their own recipe, and it is amazing! This is a dream come true if your a hot dog lover! Check it out!
