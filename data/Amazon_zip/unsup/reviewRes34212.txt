so so so very good. amazing hot fresh bread. the hardest part of the evening (besides choosing an entree) was choosing between dipping my bread in oil or butter. bruschette was fabulous. there was a new drink on the menu, a blood orange martini.  SO tasty. i may be a martini girl afterall. i had NO idea what to order, so the 4 of us shared our dishes.  i had the Pollo Arrosto alla Romano. it was HUGE. the menu said "roasted half chicken", but it should have said, "roasted half of a big ass chicken", because the plate was the size of a small table. but the juice from the chicken mixed with the potatoes perfectly and then presented a 3rd dipping option for my bread. :) my brother had some pork chop dish and i could have swapped with him and been just as happy all night. actually, between the two of our dishes, i don't even remember what the others had at our table. our server was very friendly, you would never have known that it was a busy Saturday night. he was patient and attentive and treated us like we were his only table. a friend of my brother's sent a couple of desserts to our table, and oh man, the chocolate lava cake with the fresh berries and cream. i was blown away with how perfect it was. the cake was so warm, and the center so runny and moist, perfectly combining with the cold (but not too firm) berries. it was PERFECT. so perfect, that i wasn't even tempted by the tiramisu, and hoarded the chocolate cake to myself! (of course, i DID taste the tiramisu and it was so light and airy and dissolved quickly after the first bite. my sister said, "it's so good, and my mouth doesn't even have to do any work! ") very highly recommend, and can't wait to try again :)
