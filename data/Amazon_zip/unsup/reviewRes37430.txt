I don't get why people fault this bar/restaurant for being crowded, isn't that a sign of a good establishment? I have never gotten to eat here because I never feel like waiting for two hours or going to eat dinner at 5. Clearly the food must be good, because even before Check Please there was a long wait. It all smells fantastic, and I would love to try it sometime. I only wish they took reservations or let you order food at the bar. Personally, I love their beer selection, that is why I go here. There are so many different beers to try, and even though the selection at the upstairs bar is smaller, there are still numerous beers to choose. The upstairs is by far less crowded, and the bartenders have always been really nice to me. Even when I couldn't read the sign right in front of me that said cash only. If you want to go out and enjoy a few tasty different beers, without getting blitzed, come here. If you don't want to pay the "high prices" for excellent beer, or you want to get shitfaced, perhaps go somewhere with a $1 PBR special or a house party.  One more thing, go here with people you enjoy talking to because there are no TVs.
