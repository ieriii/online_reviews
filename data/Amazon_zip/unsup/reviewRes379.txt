Given the lemming-like nature of most human beings, poor or rich, it does not surprise me in the least that Alinea receives nothing but accolades from the diners on Yelp and other sites. Admittedly, some praise is actually well deserved, but much isn't. To sum up briefly: Alinea was a huge let down. The dishes were very hit or miss, e.g. loved the oyster leaf but hated the lemongrass drink which was sickeningly sweet. The "chocolate explosion" (My name for it) dessert, personally prepared (Not tableside but rather on and all over out table) by chef Achatz, was visually and viscerally exciting, but sadly, fell flat in the all important flavor dept, all I could taste was an overpowering cinnamon like flavoring. I could go on and on about the other dishes but I'll spare you and myself the agony. What I also found disturbing was that most of the dishes presented were generally very "safe" and almost boring at times. (Compare to Ferran Adria's 35 course tasting menu) You'll know what I mean if you have eaten at restaurants which execute the idea of molecular gastronomy in a manner simply unknown to Alinea. There was no underlying context to the cuisine either- just a bunch of randomly presented experiments for the most part. Last but not least, the hostess who "greeted" us on that late night of September 30th 2011 needs to be retrained. Its not polite to look at your guests up and down as if scanning to see if they are suitably dressed. My wife's 6 month old left shoe costs more than she makes in a month and I am certain, is at least as intelligent. For those who have eaten at the late, great El Bulli , Fat Duck or even Mugaritz, you can safely skip Alinea. If you don't get out of the country much then I suppose you have no choice but to check it out- but don't say I didn't warn you.
