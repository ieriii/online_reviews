Absolutely loved the food! Must try the chifrijo appetizer(can be eaten as an entree)! Great bold flavors! Must get the oatmeal shake!!! Loved the BYOB option! We had chips and water at our table before we were completely settled at our table, now that's what I call great service! Can't wait to come back when I'm back in Chicago!
