The food was amazing. We started with three cheese selection - the truffle cheese was the best. We also had the almonds fried in bacon, which was just ok. My favorite two dishes were the grilled octopus and the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. The seating was the only negative thing about the restaurant. It's communal tables, which is no problem at all, but we were sat near the door and people who were waiting for tables were practically standing on top of us and kept bumping into the backs of our chairs. I will def return.
