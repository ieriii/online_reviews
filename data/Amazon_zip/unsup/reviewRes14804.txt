Went there for a quick cheap lunch. The sandwiches are relatively low priced ($6.50 each). It ended up not being so cheap because I had to try a bunch of stuff. Eveything was excellent. I had the Ropa vieja sandwich, my friend had the cubano, we shared the empenda, fries and a shake. It was all excellent. I cant wait to return. I look forward to the cuban government being overthrown so that we can visit and see how authentic 90 Mile's food really is. Until then, this place is awesome.
