to get a reservation to the #2 restaurant in America, we had to call exactly 2 months before the date we had hoped to attend. we called them right when they opened at 10am and still had trouble getting through! but when we finally got through and booked our reservation, we knew that it was gonna be soooo worth it clear 3 hours from your night: dress nicely, bring a camera with good macro, and come HUNGRY! and prepare yourself for the most amazing culinary experience of your life. I've read many articles on the famous Alinea and Grant Achatz's ingenuity and creativity but I mostly tried to limit my research because one of the best things about this place is the ELEMENT OF SURPRISE!! so i won't elaborate on each of the 15 courses but i will say that it was AMAZING and well worth the hefty bill :]
