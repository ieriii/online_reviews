I want to love this location, but I just don't. I can't really place my finger on it, but this one pales in comparison to the experience at the Oak Brook location. Maybe it is because everything else around here has seemingly closed-down or the entire resturant was full of senior citizens (literally a bus tour was there) when we ate, but everything just seemed so slow and boring. The food was good, but again, nothing spectacular and I expect more from Wildfire. I had a cup of the clam chowder and the parmesan crusted fish with rice and a glass of malbec. Husband had the BBQ sampler plate (every Wednesday - seriously, try it) and a few Matildas. There was nothing wrong, but nothing fabulous and for these prices in a half-empty room, they should be pulling out more stops. And, please, for the love of God, get rid of the onion bread that you serve before the meal - go with a pretzel roll or at least another option without the hated onion.
