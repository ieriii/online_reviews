I'm from England and so don't know anything about Mexican food, but I've never been disappointed by the food here and keep going back. It doesn't feel like it's particularly unhealthy, either, which is a nice change for a late-night stop-off. This location (the largest of the three inexplicably close locations) has a bigger menu, although to be honest, there is never an occasion when you need a burrito bigger than a baby. If you find yourself around staggering around Ashland and Division you could do a lot worse than stop off here.
