I came here today with my neighbor for an impromptu breakfast to catch up. She was craving this place and since I have never been, away we went! Parking was a cinch, but that might have been due to today being Tuesday. We got in and sat at a booth right by the window. The server brought us waters immediately and took drink orders. Looking at the menu took me forever! Everything looked so good. I like southern home cooking and this place will definitely help if you ever have those cravings. I ended up getting the Kentucky Scrambled eggs and bacon with cheese grits and wheat toast. My friend got one egg with bacon, cheese grits and a corn muffin. The food came out rather quickly. The scrambled eggs came with corn, green peppers and onions. Looked like how I make eggs. They weren't pretty but they sure were tasty! The cheese grits, heavenly. I added a little hot sauce at the suggestion of my friend. Wow. I love grits and this was the first time I had cheese grits. I will definitely be getting that again. The bacon had a sweetness to it but not overpowering. It was crispy and crunchy and perfect. Bacon makes the world go round. I will be back again. There are many other things on the breakfast menu that I just have to try. I also want to come back for their dinner menu. If it has as many tasty options like their breakfast menu, then I know I will be in trouble.
