The wang galbi is either not marinated long enough or with skimped ingredients so the meat tastes bland. The meat itself was sliced too thin to be even called galbi. The sam gyup sal was bacon slice thin (which is bad). The veggies and tofu in the soup it comes with (dwen jang jjigae) is not cooked. They must have chopped it up raw and threw it in pre-made broth before serving, like miso soup. There were a lot of side dishes but only about 3 out of the 15 were good. Who cares about the service when the food was this bad. I'm embarrassed to call this Korean food. It should not taste this way.
