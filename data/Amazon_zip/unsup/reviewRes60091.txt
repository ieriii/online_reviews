My friends and I sat at a 4 top across the bar and waited 20 minutes to get our first round of drinks. In that time two deuces between us and the bar were sat. Those tables are waited on by the bartenders. They both got their drinks w/in a couple of minutes after ordering. In fact, one of them even got food before we got our drinks. Our server told us that those were bar tables and that the bartenders were not going to make their customers wait, even though we had ordered way ahead of them. Well that's just NOT cool! Orders should be attended to as they come in and not put on the back burner to help increase bar tips. Shame on them!! Although the food was all really good, this put such a damper on my evening that I'm thinking about not returning. If I do return, I will be sure to sit in one of those 2 tops that the bar has and get the VIP treatment.
