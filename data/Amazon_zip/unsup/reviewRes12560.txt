This place is eh, okay. There is an over abundance of meat, which satisfied the purpose of our excursion. The service was excellent. And the interior is well designed. I was a little disappointed that I had to wait a while for the leg of lamb and lamb chops (those were my favorite). The salad bar had a variety of cold tapas but nothing outstanding that made me go up for seconds (and I was really looking for something to balance all the protein). Plus, the meat was a little on the salty side so be prepared to drink a lot of water afterwards.
