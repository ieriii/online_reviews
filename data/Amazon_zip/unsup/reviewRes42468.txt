Well I've been wanting to visit this place since I moved to uptown in Sept. Everytime I walk by the place seems packed, so the food must be better than the 32+ other eateries in a 2 block radius. I had the oddest experience. Very extensive menu so it took me a few minutes to order. When the server noticed I was ready to order, she came over to my table. I had a very simple question on the preperations of 2 similar items. She kept on asking if I wanted chicken in that... even though that wasn't even an answer to my question. She then got a cel-phone call in the middle of my order. She answered it, had a brief conversation, while still at the table. Being a server myself, I was a bit ticked off. I was finally able to get my order communicated to her, and I thought all would be well after that. An older lady from the kitchen delivered my food with in a few minutes. She didn't find it necessary to put the food in front of me. I literally had to stand up and pull my Pho across the table so I could eat it. Then all the servers abandoned thier tables and sat down in the middle of the restaurant. It was just a random experience. The Pho was Yummy, though. I wasn't sure what to base my tip on though. I'm sure I'll be back now knowing what to expect.
