During my visit to Chicago, I had a couple of friends recommend Mia Francesca for Italian food. OMG! Vite dell'Italia! This place cooks up some awesome Italian! Like the reviewer down below, I also had the quattro formaggi ravioli. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven, it was so friggin' good. The appetizers we started with were the calamari fritti, the bruschetta and the insalata alla francesca. All were sooo good. The calamari was light and not greasy, the bruschetta had great flavor and the salad kicked ass. We were so full from our meal, that unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert. The place definitely gets packed--it's sort of a small restaurant, but damn is it good! Our server was attentive and gave us some good suggestions for cocktails. The host was very friendly and even stopped by our table to see how we liked our food since he knew I was from out of town. Couldn't complain. This place does Italian right!
