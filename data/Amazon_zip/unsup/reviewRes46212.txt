I know it's a chain, but it's one of my favorite places to get a salad. It's owned by the same people as cheesecake factory, but I find the quality of the food much better. However, you can tell it's in the same restaurant family by the portion sizes...their salads are huge! There is always a wait, no matter what time it is, but it's right off Michigan Avenue so I just usually shop around while I wait. Great cookies as well so save some room for dessert or take them to go!
