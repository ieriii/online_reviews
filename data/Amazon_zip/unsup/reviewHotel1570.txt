Hands down one of the nicest hotels in Chicago I have ever stayed at. Service was wonderful, location is great! Room was so comfortable, and had a wonderful view of the Chicago River, workout area very modern with a great view. Would stay here over and over! No reason not to come back. Price was not bad either for Chicago, but we did book on Hotwire.
