Oh AOP, why must you be so far away and not deliver to little old me? Why do I not have a car to visit you more often? Oh goodness!!! It is probably better that I don't live closer to AOP because then I would eat there everyday and therefore would need to be rolled everywhere. This is seriously some of the best pizza I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot of pizza)! I hope to visit here again, sooner rather than later!
