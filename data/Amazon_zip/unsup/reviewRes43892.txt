I ate here last night w/ my fiancee and future father in-law who was intown on business. He picked the restaurant because it was walking distance from his stay at The Hotel Alegro. No reservation and we were seated imediately at a great table. Our waiter was flamming almosted expected a song and dance rutine w/ our list of daily specials Father inlaw had the prime rib. Looked juicey and good just the right shade of pink. Fiance had the rock shrimp risotto. I had the 1lb pork chop. Review of my meal. The pork chop needed more spice rub. I understand that would mask the applewood smoke flavor they are going for; however, not achieved. It was OK. The apple relish would have been better as well if it was served warm. I had room temp steamed diced apples. The best part of my meal was the small portion of risotto on my plate it was actually better then the chop. I ordered onion rings as my side (classy i know). The failed on this one. The onion rings were at least made with the correct onion but they were cut way to thinly. I don't want to eat green bean casserol garnish. Lastly, I was disapointed in the cream brulee. The fired sugar crust was too thick. It is suppose to be think and delicate. The portion was about double what is normaly considered standard. I like the people watching. Lots of executives having powerful looking dinner meetings. Would I go back, probably not; only because I know there is better out there.
