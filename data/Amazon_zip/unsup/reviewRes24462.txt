This was an excellent choice in Greektown to take a break on a hot day, sit on the second level sipping a cold drink, and feel the breeze from the open windows and open doors. We stayed cool and really enjoyed eating here. My favorite was the Mediterranean salad, but there is so much to choose from, including an amazing bakery. What impressed me the most about Artopolis was the upgraded interior. Everything looked nearly new, with polished marble countertops, track lighting, beautiful display cases, and comfortable booths and tables. Halstead is a busy road and it was great to slow down and be the people watcher for a change while we had a fabulous lunch. I recommend it. I need to come back and just order dessert.
