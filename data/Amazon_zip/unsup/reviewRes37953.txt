Giordano's is a must visit when I hit the Windy City. I have tried a couple other spots, but this is my favorite. We had a deep dish sausage and mushroom on my most recent stop. It never disappoints. The sauce is a perfect balance of flavor and a good amount of cheese. I hate skimpy cheese, but that's a personal preference. Go early or plan to wait. The bar area & wait area is tiny, so you could find yourself outside waiting if you time it wrong. We did an early dinner after shopping, which seemed to be just right. Took leftovers back to hotel for snack the next day!
