If you know good food, you don't come here for it. You come here for the atmosphere and to have some guac!  Food: As Sonesh has mentioned, it's decent, maybe even good (depending on the dish), but certainly not great. I usually order the Arrachera (grilled skirt steak) when I'm here. It's good and it does a good job at filling up my appetite. The guac IS yummy though and is a great precursor to your main meal.  Atmosphere: Because of the sheer size of this place, it does look grandeur. Because it is a latin/mexican restaurant, you can expect this place to have some color to it and boy does it have color. It's probably one of the most colorful restaurants I've ever been to. It is pretty inside, so again, you come here for the atmosphere and they do a great job catering to large groups.  Location: You can find street parking on any of the side streets and they do offer valet if you're super hungry or on a date.
