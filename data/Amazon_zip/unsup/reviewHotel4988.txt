I stayed here while in Chicago for a business trip and would not do so again. The rooms are extremely tiny, there is no air conditioner or heater and the walls are paper thin. The bathroom was filthy and the shower didn't work properly so maintenance had to fix it every day. Keep in mind when booking there is also no bar or room service so if you want to unwind after a long day, you can't do it here. I also did not have maid service every day, and not by choice.  This place was also way overpriced.
