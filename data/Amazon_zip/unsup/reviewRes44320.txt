I love sushi and know many places in the city that do it well....wakamono was no exception. However, I would not recommend this place based on the following poor service examples I experienced: 1) My friend and I sat at the bar and enjoyed a glass of wine with our meal. While in the middle of conversation, the bus boy wedged his way between us and took our wine glasses ...and our bottle was 1/4 full. 2) I dropped my chop sticks and had to ask 3 times for replacments 3) We had to wait 20 minutes for our waitress to take our request for additional rolls. 4) Base on the poor service, I left exactly 15%. When the hostess realized this, she came back and said she could barely tip her chefs on this amount - I replied that my service was poor and that I don't tip on the tax. She sighed but in the end I gave an additional 2 bucks. With so many other great sushi places in the city that are willing to give much better service, I don't think a return trip to this place is necessary for me
