Bad service, not so great food & 2 hour wait for a pizza = not returning On a Friday night, we ordered food for pick up around 7:15pm. We ordered a medium thin crust pizza & the cheesebread. When we called they said it would be 45 minutes, which was fine with us. That's reasonable for a Friday night. So at 8:00pm we walked over to pick up our food & they told us it would be ANOTHER 20 minute wait...in their boiling hot, small restaurant. 30 minutes later ...at 8:30pm we asked (again) what the delay was and they simply told us "we're backed up." We saw person after person walk in and pick up their food. After that we decided to walk back home (empty handed) and have them deliver our food. We're only 4 blocks away & our food was not delivered until 9:15pm that night. The reason I gave 2 stars & not 1 was because they did give us a discount on the pizza & waved the delivery charge. However, the food wasn't anything special; burnt thin crust pizza & undercooked cheesebread. We were very excited to try this place, however after that experience we will not be returning. No one should have to wait 2 hours for a slice of pizza.
