I was in the mood for pasta but my sister wanted duck, so guess who won out. I came here expecting nothing special but to my surprise I had a delicious meal. The peking duck, roast pork , pickled veggies and noddles were exceptional. I liked the presentation, especially how they carved the duck table side. Our meal consisted of a few courses, so if you come in for dinner I suggest you have a light lunch.  Sun Wah could use a good interior decorator but for what it lacks in decor it more than makes up for it in delicious food.
