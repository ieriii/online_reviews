It's a fast pace place where the quality is nowhere close to what I expected. I tried a few dishes like the clams with merguez, too oily and lacks the rustic part to a lamb sausage with mild cinnamon flavor. the scallops were not caramelized enough and the chickpeas were overcooked. The poached squid was average and needed salt, the pork chop a little tougher and dryer than expected. Wine list offers a bunch of wines by the glass. Overall, efficient service but nothing exceptional in terms of flavors
