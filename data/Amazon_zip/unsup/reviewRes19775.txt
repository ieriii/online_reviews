Honestly, I dont understand the hype. This place was good, but nothing that I would consider a "must have". Ahogada: The sandwich was unique with consideration to what it was- a sandwich. I ordered it mild thinking it would have more of a bite to it. It was very mild- the only thing that came across in this "salsa" was a Louisiana hot sauce tang (which is fine if you like that kind of thing). However- i was not over the top impressed. Guess the hype was too much. Pepito: Good sandwich. Love the sauce accompaniment. The bread could have been a little softer- like a traditional torta. Churro- good, but have had better. The chocolate dipping sauce was a nice touch. Bayless, you still get four stars for you vision and flavor pairings.
