I'm giving Crisp 5 stars because I think it's about as good as it gets in a quick-service/take-out restaurant. I was drawn in by the sight of the crowds, and quickly understood while they were all there. I won't try to repeat all that's already been said, so I'll just comment I had the Sassy Seoul Steak dish -- it was plenty to eat, but I was sorry when I finished it. Just the right mix of sweet and savory bulgogi and rice. I'll be a regular.
