food is outstanding. we've been twice already. first of all the lasagna is among the best I've ever tasted, the porchetta was pretty damn close to divine and the chocolate tortino desert was suspiciously delicious). Very reasonably priced although there are more lavish ways to dine, like everyone getting salads and apps and a full fish along with a $300 bottle of vino. on the other hand we had a great tasting bottle of chianti classico for around $35.the atmosphere. hands down, the best outdoor dining area I've seen in chicago.the service staff were attentive & on point (especially for a rest. that's brand new). everyone in my party had a perfect experience both visits. definitely one of my new favorites.
