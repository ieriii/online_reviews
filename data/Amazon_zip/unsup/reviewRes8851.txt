Noon O Kabab is Iranian food just like my mom would make. Granted my mother is Guatemalan and my father is Iranian, but that doesn't matter. Only my mother's kabab is equal to theirs. Eating here will have you singing "Noon O Kabab" all over town! The polo, the kabab...just the thought of it makes my mouth water. You would think, perhaps, if the current Administration had some Noon O Kabab they would rethink their policies on Iran, but knowing them, they would probably find a way to take it over, so they can have their recipes and call them their own to fund future wars. (And to all the Vegan Brothers and Sisters, there is dill rice and hummus , but if you are looking for a vegan variety, better try Reza's)
