One of the best experiences one can have with Korean BBQ. I came here with my team in 2010 after a long day at a trade show. The restaurant was packed with narrow walking spaces and the entire room was covered in a hazy by the delicious charcoal bbq smoke. Walking in, you can immediately tell people are having a great time simply because of the noisy and how busy the waitresses are, "Madam! more soju here!" or "Another plate of galbi here!" The food is absolutely delicious. Definitely try both the marinated and the unmarinated galbi. Both are delicious beyond normal restaurants. They serve a cascade of fresh little dishes and the salad is amazing. They do have regular chairs for seating but since we had a group of 7, we sat on the floor, the traditional Korean style. Most of our group was Korean so they didn't mind, but since I'm tall, I would have preferred sitting in a chair. But that's minor, I had a great time nonetheless. Warning: this is quite possibly the smallest parking lot in the world. We had to wait 15min to see 2 people trying to park in tight little spots.
