It's a steakhouse restaurant with adjacent lounge. The rooftop lounge area is not really grand but has intimate vibe to it. Very NoMi-esque. Judging from an interesting fireplace installation at the bottom floor it can be said that someone wanted an ambitious modern decor. I wish I could render similar verdict about their drinks. Very limited options of liquor. Managers should really diversify their bar if they still wish to attract crowd into their lounge.
