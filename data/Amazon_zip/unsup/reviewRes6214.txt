Raved about by my friend's boss (the dining editor of Chicago Magazine), our most recent adventure had to be here. The experience at Davanti started with our garrulous waiter and continued with the great decor. Tasteful amounts of wood paneling, an open yet comfortable dining room, and their wines by the glass and beer menu on a gigantic bottle from table to table all added to the character of the establishment. The aforementioned boss raved about the Cow's Milk Foccaccia, and we were glad we did. Our second course was the Pizza Della Terra, a masterpiece of mushrooms, leeks, and truffle oil on a perfected crisped crust lightly coated in taleggio. I had pegged it as my had-to-have dish before showing up, and our waiter recommending it sealed the deal. We finished with the crispy pork belly with peach mostarda, and the sweet mostarda set off the cured and quickly fried pork belly perfectly. Each was a symphony of flavors and textures, in sync for an impeccable experience.  For dessert we had a few scoops of rather average gelato (Italian vanilla and raspberry) and a torta bacio - a chocolate-hazelnut mousse atop a crunchy base. The torta bacio was worthy of my previous praise, and one of the best desserts I have had for a long time. Undoubtedly a place I will return to soon, and one I shall not soon forget.
