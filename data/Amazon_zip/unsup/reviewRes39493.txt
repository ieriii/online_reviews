This is the place to get amazing Korean BBQ. I love the fact that this place is also open til 4am. You never know when I am going to get a craving for Korean. And normally it's all the time. The first time I came here was with my sister a long time ago around midnight. Since then, I have been here possibly 20x plus. I love the 20+ banchan dishes you get. I always order Kalbi and the hubs like the dak galbi. I think the best part of Korean BBQ is the grilling over the charcoal. The smells wafting throughout the restaurant are just irresistible. The food is always consistently amazing. The meat is fresh and perfectly marinated. I have a huge appetite and when it's Korean BBQ, I somehow have a bottomless stomach. I can eat and eat and eat some more. The service is good and that is surprising in itself. Most of the time, the Korean ladies are rude and short, but it's part of their charm. This is my comfort food restaurant. I immediately feel better after that first bite. And again, the fact that they are open til 4am is key. Nothing like late night BBQ.
