I was very impressed with Kinzie Chop House. I went here the Friday night before Valentine's Day to celebrate with my boy. We started with a bottle of wine and the Tuna Tartar. Then had soup/salad, a ribeye and new york strip, asparagus, and of course he got mac and cheese. We then finished up with dessert, a dessert wine, and martini. The atmosphere was very swanky, yet comfortable and romantic. Our waitress was the bomb dot com. Very knowledgeable, polite, and friendly. The dessert was comped for first time diners. When we got the bill we were pleasantly surprised. We thought we spent a lot more. I'd definitely recommend this place for a date night or even a night out with some friends. The Tuna Tartar was probably my favorite part :)
