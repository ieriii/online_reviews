My boyfriend and I were visiting Chicago since I proposed the idea that it would be a fun place to go to for his birthday. He had never been before so I figured it would be a fun, short trip. We always do a traditional dinner and so after a quick search at our hotel lobby's computer, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse popped up! We both had heard of the popular steakhouse so we gave it a try. What an AWESOME idea! The service was wonderful and the food was out of this world!!!! We both ordered the Ruth's classic which is a combo dinner you can get that includes a soup or salad, the entree with a side, and a dessert. Our server, Andy, was great and even brought my boyfriend some raspberry sorbet along with some candles for my boyfriend's birthday dessert! I ordered the caesar salad which was above average for your typical caesar salad. The dressing was in the perfect amount for me. My boy ordered the onion au gratin soup (which was pretty much French onion soup) and it was SO good. Honestly, I could not describe the flavors because you will just have to go try it yourself. YUM. I am drooling just thinking about it. We both ordered the filet with mine being medium, and my boo's medium rare. The steak came SIZZLING, and I mean SIZZLING on its plate in all its glory! It was an excellent cut of meat and was cooked to perfection. The garlic mashed potatoes were good as well! The service was great and the food better! I would highly recommend this place if you are craving a perfectly cooked steak!
