All (hot) dogs go to heaven because these are simply well...divine! The line is always out the door but it's cool because your iPhone will keep you busy. Doug actually has worked there every time I have been and he's a pretty interesting character. Try the foie gras dog and while you are at it, get the duck fat fries (drooling over the memory of that absolutely sinful treat) but they are only available on Friday and Saturday. There is absolutely nothing like a Chicago hot dog and these are the best. The skin breaks as you bite in making that gentle snapping sound that warns you of the meaty, juicy, warm flavors about to assault your taste buds. You will need to take a moment after your first bite and just be in the moment - you literally won't be able to talk because you are so overwhelmed and happy. When I come back to Chicago, it's definitely a place that I make every effort to eat at and die of happiness for a little while.
