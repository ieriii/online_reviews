This place knows what to do with a steak! It was awesome! My sister's daughters took her here for her birthday and we all came along. There were a total of seven of us. We all met there and valet parked and our reservation was for four o'clock on a Sunday afternoon. We sort of made it family style, because we shared the side dishes and I wish I had gotten the sweet potato casserole by myself. I'll be returning soon. I had a small fillet and for dessert I really enjoyed the creme brulee. If it's on the menu I always have creme brulee. I must admit it's very pricey. With tip we spent $110 each, because we divided the bill by 6, instead of 7, because it was my sisters birthday. It's a great place for steak and the service was exceptional.
