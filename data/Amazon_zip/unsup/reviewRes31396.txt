I came here last month on my visit to Chicago. We were actually looking for Uno's Pizza and we so this place from a distance. My friend then said "OMG there's a Mastro's here! My friend raves about it every time they are in SoCal! They said it's hella good, they have LOBSTER mashed potatoes, and black truffle gnocchi"... ok... well that already sold me. We immediately crossed the street and we made reservations for the next day. The people at the front counter were so nice and we were greeted right away.  They called me the next morning to confirm my reservations, which was good. So we promptly arrived here around 8 p.m. on a Sunday evening. We didn't even have to look at the menu because our friend studied it the evening before, so we knew what we were going to ordered. So we ordered the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi and the Bone in Filet. I've been to Ruth's Chris a few times and all I can say is that Mastro's win!! Hands down!! Their filet feels like it just melts in your mouth! It was so good!!! Ruth's Chris can't even come close to compare to it! The gnocchi was perfect, it had a good amount of truffle on it. You will want to lick the plate. We got the small portion and that we good enough for us to share among 3 people.  The lobster with mashed potatoes was so delicious!!! I will not eat mashed potatoes the same way again! LAST but not least DESSERT!! We had a birthday at our table so the waiter brought out their famous butter cake! Oh my Buddha!! It was absolutely scrumptious!!!! It was warm and it wasn't too sweet. I just love it when the food melts in your mouth! It was so fluffy!!! I wish I can just go back here just for desserts!! I really wished Mastro's was open here in San Francisco! It will knock a lot of other businesses out of business! Thank you Matstro's! I will be back the next time I'm in Chicago!!
