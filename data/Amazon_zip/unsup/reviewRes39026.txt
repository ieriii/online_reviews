I am so thrilled for La Villa, as I saw them on Check, Please this weekend! (This means busier crowds I suppose for me, as they of course got rave reviews). I love that this restaurant is walking distance from home and that they know us by name! They make you feel so welcome like you are a part of their family, and they have been doing it for 40 years. I enjoy Tommy Moran and his accordian for live entertainment on the weekends. It sounds funny and corny, but it's so entertaining and he is the sweetest guy! Love when an Irish bloke plays Italian and fun singalong music on an unusual medium of instruments. I have taken many out of town guests here and they find La Villa very charming and enjoy the ambience. The pizza is fantastic and we pick up or dine in for the thin crust or stuffed regularly. Their extended menu is good too, and the portions are humongous...enough leftovers for many more meals afterward! The salad bar has some fresh options, their appetizers are yummy, and the drinks from the familiar bartender will all impress. Give them a try!
