In a nutshell, food is always fantastic. Service is always great. Food is a little pricey, though. And it's not wheelchair accessible for my daughter. I'd take the wifey here on a date night any day of the week and twice on Sunday. I'm carnivorous and she's a vegan, but she's got me addicted to the sweet potato fries and oh god the vegan milkshakes. Fantastic stuff.
