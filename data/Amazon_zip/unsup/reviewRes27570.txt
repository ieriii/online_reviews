Frontera Grill was Good.  I have had Frontera Grill on my to do list for quite some time. I have traveled to the Chicago area at least 5 times this year and finally made it to Frontera. I made my reservation 2 months ago (they do accept a very limited number of reservations). Without a reservation, it seems like you will be waiting a long time for a table. I liked Rick Bayless on Top Chef Masters and his restaurant was also mentioned by another chef on the Best Thing I Ever Ate food network show. I had Sopes Rancheros: Crispy corn masa boats, savory shredded beef, roasted tomato, avocado, homemade fresh cheese for $8.50. They were tasty, but nothing I would rave about and/or pay $8.50 for again. Platanos con Crema: Sweet fried plantains with homemade sour cream & fresh cheese $6.00. Again..... a tasty dish but not worth the $6 price tag. Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena: Creekstone Natural Black Angus rib steak (marinated in spicy red chile & wood-grilled), black beans, sweet plantains with sour cream, guacamole $29.50. Nice dish, great flavor, but not worth the $$$. I will say that their black beans are the BEST !! If I'm going to pay over $45 just for myself to enjoy a dinner out on the town, I would like to leave feeling that I got my $$$$ worth. That didn't happen here, and that's the main reason for 3 stars.
