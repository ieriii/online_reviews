This was great! Couldn't ask for anything more. The entrees were creative and tasted wonderful. The service was quick and tentative. The meat and fish were cooked spot on. I highly recommend this to any visitors or locals. It isn't your usual Italian restaurant with only marinara to offer. Even their house red wine was lovely.
