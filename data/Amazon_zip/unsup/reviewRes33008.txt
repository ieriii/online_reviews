Used the yelp deal to go for dinner last night and had a great experience. It was a nice evening so most of their patrons were sitting outside, which made the inside rather empty. But, it made for a lot of individual attention and rather entertaining conversation with the very friendly and lively owner. Our party of three started with saganaki, which was fantastic, and we ordered the sausage stuffed chicken thighs, stuffed cabbage, and short rib goulash. Each of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Meat was very tender and everything well seasoned. We enjoy supporting local and family businesses. This one is definitely worth a visit!
