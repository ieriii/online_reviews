The Milanesa Torta is incredible. Ask for the spicy sauce. Order everything to go, walk a couple of blocks, and eat by the river. Not as enjoyable when it's bitter cold outside, but on a mild day it beats waiting in line! That said, it would be worth the wait. The food here is really fantastic, and I like the low-key atmosphere.
