My wife is into fondue and always went with her friends to these places, but she got a groupon for Geja's Cafe so we decided to make it a date night. First thing you want to remember is there is Vallet Parking (10 bucks) because this area is all permit parking unless you can find some main street parking by luck. At first glance from outside this place looked like some sort of basement apartment until you walk it. Open your eyes and just breath! This is probably one of the most romantic atmosphere I've been too. Candle lights, good instrumental music playing, comfortable seats, and amazing food. If this is your first time trying fondue I recommend the Prince Geja Dinner. You get to try a little of everything they have, plus the fruits, bread, and chocolate sauce with Orange Liquor was amazing. The dipping saucing they were amazing (12 that I tried). Here is a little tip, when dipping the jelly like seafood, stab a vegetable under it (with the skewer) so it once slip off the skewer and stick to the bottom of the pot. The experience was definitely work the price! With the groupon and getting 2 Prince Geja's Dinners I was a little over 60 bucks and that wasn't hurting the bank at all. I am a good tipper and the staff was super friendly! Our waitress definitely knew her stuff.
