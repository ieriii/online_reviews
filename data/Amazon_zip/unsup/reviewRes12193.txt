1---Mojitos and bacon-wrapped dates. I've done Cafe 28 four times now, and those have always been apart of each of my visits.  But literally everything else they have prepared has been equally outstanding as well. 2---Consistency in the quality of each visit. This is the ultimate test. Through my range of experiences, they have always exceeded my expectations.  Without a reservation, they quickly accomodate on busy evenings. Both the indoor and outdoor seating areas provide equally relaxed and cultured atmospheres. The food is always stellar and the service never misses.
