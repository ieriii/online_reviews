India House is where's it at! If you crave excellent Indian food and don't want to make the trek to Tiffin, this is your best option, hands down. The food is delicious and the service is consistently on point. I could eat their starter nan chips with tomato dipping sauce for days! Their veggie samosas and chutney are fantastic! I would recommend most of the chicken and lamb dishes I've ordered over the years. I also think their palak paneer is solid. The decor isn't particularly exciting (kind of reminds you of a semi-fancy restaurant in a suburb somewhere), but this isn't really of concern when the food and service are just so good. More hot towels please!
