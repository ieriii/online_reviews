Fresh ingredients, impeccable service, and a creative menu. Not to mention that I grinned like a schoolgirl when I saw Dale Levitski at the other end of the restaurant. I am a "Top Chef" fiend, so I have the same reaction when sighting a celebrity chef that someone else would have when sighting a celebrity actor. My husband took me here for my birthday dinner. We ordered the prix fixe. As a special birthday treat, the waitstaff gave me and my husband a small, complementary glass of champagne. The most amazing item was the cheese course... a mini-grilled cheese sandwich, with hardened cheese on the outside instead of bread. GENIUS!  The downside was that the prix fixe dishes that evening were incredibly rich. My stomach was killing me afterwards (and I mean stop at Walgreens on the way home killing me). I prefer the flavors from other similar-caliber restaurants. But it's well done, and I would try it again. Next time, I will just order a regular entree.
