I was very impressed with the variety of foods they were able to make with seitan. I had the buffalo wings and the gyros, which were both excellent. A lot of the vegan restaurants I've been to try to be all artsy and serve things like sprouts and seeds over quinoa, in micro portions. The Chicago Diner serves hearty meals made of foods people actually want to eat. The Chicago Diner has inspired me to begin cooking with seitan instead of tempeh or tofu.
