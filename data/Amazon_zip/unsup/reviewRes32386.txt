I went there once several years ago with my cousin who told me about it since I don't eat meat. The only problem I had was that the chips for the appetizer were really stale. And a couple of my friends told me the same thing. The place is small, so it is not good for big groups. It is really casual, and the service is really friendly! I'd give it a second chance in the future.
