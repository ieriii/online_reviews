I wanted Burger King. Good thing my girlfriend put her foot down on that one. I went in pouting and came out a happy, pregnant looking skinny guy. The steak sandwich just exploded with flavor and the empanadas were out of this world!! The guy at the front counter could tell we were new by the puzzled looks our pale white asses were giving the menu hanging and handed us the English version. He even made it a point to come out and see how the food was! Looks like the king has be dethroned!
