I love Geja's! It is so romantic and just a great atmosphere. I've gone with my boyfriend and my parents- each time it's amazing in a different way. Everyone that I know has heard of Geja's and has a great story from going there. Definitely somewhere everyone has to try at least once, and will probably go back again and again!
