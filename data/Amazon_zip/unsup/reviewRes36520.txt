I'm not a breakfast kind of guy. Really, I'm not. I probably only eat breakfast a couple times a month. Pancakes, eh. Eggs, yuck. Bacon, eh. But...... when I do go to Meli, I have thoroughly enjoyed every meal there. The menu is unique and very original. I can't help but actually LOVE eating breakfast at Meli. There, I said it. I can't believe it. A few of my faves are the Cloud 9 crepes and the skillets. The stuffed french toast is excellent too. A sip of coffee is a great perk-me-up to start the morning. Very strong and very bold. The wait can be long at times but well worth it for Chicago's best breakfast spot!
