Not sure about the negative reviews here- I had a great meal. My caveat- I never watched Top Chef or whatever and had no idea who this guy was before coming to the restaurant. At the table we started with drinks- all were pretty good. And then they brought out their popcorn- it was sprinkled with cheese and white truffle oil and some herbs- not entirely sure what was on it but it was fantastic. The apps course had some amazing options. The white tuna sashimi was terrific as were the hushpuppy sweetbreads. My dining companions also had the duck satay and the asparagus terrine- everyone loved their dishes. For the entree I had the Great Lake Whitefish - the chai foam with the fish was a great pairing. For dessert we shared the dark chocolate torte and were very happy with it as well. What I liked about the food here is that every bite had a unique combination of flavors, textures and temperature. For example, the sashimi app had whipped avocado, crispy plantains and a passion fruit sorbet. It's all just very interesting and you feel like you're venturing into new territory from a culinary experience. That's something I enjoy. If you do too then check it out.
