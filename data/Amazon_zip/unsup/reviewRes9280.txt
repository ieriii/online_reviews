Other reviewers have it right. I like it upstairs here- it's a great spot for a drink and appetizer date. And I generally hate "upstairs" lounge hangout places, but this place doesn't irritate me like most- maybe because the space itself is nice, and doesn't rely solely on people watching. Nobody else has mentioned it, but this place is a chain- there's one in San Fransisco as well as New York too. I generally avoid national restaurants, but this place's atmosphere just gets it right. I wouldn't go out of my way to get here, but this is my favorite low-key spot to "get away" when I have to come to this neighborhood for other reasons.
