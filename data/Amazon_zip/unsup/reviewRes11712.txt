YES. Try Bongo Room. I've lived in Chicago for 5 years and it's by far my favorite breakfast spot. The wait is long (up to 40 minutes at times), but once seated, be ready for breakfast that hits the spot and then some. This isn't your typical diner style breakfast. Instead, the options are fancier but still hearty. I love the breakfast burrito. The jalapeno flavor tortilla and the spicy sour cream are amazing touches. I've tried the Veggie Croissant Sandwich (delicious) and my friends rave about the hollandaise. The pancakes are a MUST. Though not listed on the menu, you can order just one pancake (instead of 4). The white chocolate caramel pancakes are unreal. Probably not something I could ever order as my main meal (the 4), but the one pancake shared b/w friends is a perfect sweet addition to your meal. This place is a bit pricier when you add up coffee, entree and a shared option. But, wow, great experience.
