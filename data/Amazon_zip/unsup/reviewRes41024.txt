Pho Xe Tang, aka "Tank Noodle", is quite the experience. My visit here with fellow Yelper Extraordinaire Nia W. was fun, but mostly because of the company. However, though the food was okay the whole atmosphere is kind of assembly line. Get 'em in, shove 'em out. It's a large dining area, and the time we were there (lunch on the weekend), it was absolutely packed. I mean, wall to wall people: probably the closest thing to a human feeding trough as you can get. As I said, the food was okay, and the price was right, but there are other less stressful places all over the Argyle neighborhood to find pho and other Vietnamese dishes. Unless your main objective is speed, I would visit elsewhere.
