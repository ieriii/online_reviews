If you're searching for an exceptionally romantic restaurant in Chicago, this is it. Geja's Cafe is a dark velvety cavernous lair of love. I'm convinced that fondue is one of the sexiest styles of dining out there, and once you've dined at Geja's, you'll agree. Bubbling pots of liquid, dark chocolate rippling over fresh fruit, your significant other's face glimmering from the incredibly flattering candle light... yeah, clearly not a first date sort of place. Go if you're in love. Go if you want to make someone feel special. Just go. Oh, and if the L word hasn't been dropped just yet, it will be. Geja's will make it happen.
