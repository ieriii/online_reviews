Very good unique beer selection. Fun neighborhood vibe. Nice interior design including the new addition. The back patio was also quite nice, but very dark after the sun goes down. While tasting the food is important, seeing it is also nice. The food was all very good too. The problem - the service. We waited for a table, to be expected at this popular bar, but then waited an hour quite awhile for our starters amd were seated over an hour before for our entres arrived. When they came two sides of Mac and Cheese were cold. So how long did the food sit around? That said the food was good. Through out the experience the bus boy was incredibly intrusive, barging in to remove things, sometimes while still in use, reach in front of eating mouths and IF he bothered to ask if we were done with something, it was a rude interruption to our conversation. The guy drove me nuts. The waiter was not attentive and mildly apologetic at delivering cold food. Step it up guys! You got a great product. Get the front of house to live up to what you serve.
