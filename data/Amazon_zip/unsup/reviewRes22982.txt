If you want to see the biggest pile of chili peppers in your dishes, go for it. The fire power is all there if you order hot dishes which is denoted by chili peppers on the menu, but if you order all hot dishes, they all kind of taste the same.  I agree with Kake S. that the depth and layers of flavor are not impressive.  My favorites are: chili stir fry string beans and home style tofu. Also, order a couple items from the cold appetizer list, it will help balance the meal and cool you down. In the winter.. their HOT POT are the best. Go with a few good eaters and get the half and half broth(half spicy, half non spicy). Go there early in the evening or expect a line.
