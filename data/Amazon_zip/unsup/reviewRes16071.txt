Jerry Kleiner restaurant - SCENE 2 - CARNIVALE!!!!!!  ACTION!!!!!!!!! Unlike Park 52 in Hyde Park..........you know........the south side folks.......the place MOST folks in the north DON'T go *evil grin*.........sorry, I digress..... Unlike Park 52 in Hyde Park, Carnivale isn't "comfort food" based, but rather a Latin based dishes with a twist. You'll probably find a little bit of everything from Puerto Rico all the way down to Brazil on the menu and that is a good thing. The place has got to be 5 times larger than Park 52, but the decor is dead on Kleiner style. Though you'd never know it in the bar area, the dining area has a soaring ceiling and can hold a heck of a lot of patrons. Wait staff is friendly, attentive, and eager to answer any and all questions. Ceviche is excellent, guacomole is good, but I have a theory about guacomole......it's kind of like sex.....even bad guacomole is GOOD guacomole. I had the skirt steak which was excellent. The bar is a little more initimate but nonetheless still lively with a DJ starting out the weekends. So be it business or pleasure, Carnivale is a must do in the windy city.
