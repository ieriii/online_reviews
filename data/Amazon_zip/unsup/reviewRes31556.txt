Love Mastros. Great date spot, strong food, love the piano in the bar. Careful - the sides are as big as your head and could feed a 9th grade english class. I enjoy the martinis and the salmon is a great steak alternative. Gibson's doesn't do as well with their fish/non-steak entrees as Mastro's does, which make a difference to me. Some attitude at the host station and also sky high prices make it a bit below 5-stars. But you don't go to a steakhouse in R. North for a budget meal.
