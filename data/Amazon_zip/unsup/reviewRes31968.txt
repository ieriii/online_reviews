I purchased a Groupon a while back and finally use it tonight. The Groupon was for an appetizer, entree, dessert and bottle of wine for two people. I've never had Ethiopian before, so it was a great time to try it. Also with that being said, since it was our first time, we can't really compare it to other Ethiopian restaurants... at least not yet anyways. The food in general was good. We had a meat and veggie sampler for appetizers and a meat and veggie platter, which was filling. We also chose a vanilla ice cream with mango for dessert, which was ok good.. nothing special. I do wish they have more wine selections for the Groupon deal though. My cousin ordered a non-alcoholic mango drink which she was not a fan of. The service was friendly and helpful, very pleasant. Overall, we had a good experience.
