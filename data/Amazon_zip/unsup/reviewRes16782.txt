I came here last Saturday with a large group for a bachelorette party. We had a reservation for 12 at 8:30, but didn't get seated until nearly 9:15. That really screwed up our night as we had a show to get to by 10:30.  If the restaurant is unable to be ready for a group, don't accept the reservation! It's really not complicated. The front staff wasn't particularly helpful either. We had to ask for menus to be prepared to order immediately upon being seated. What's saving this review from being 1 or 2 stars is our server and the food. Our server heard that we needed to be out the door in an hour so he hopped right in and got drinks and entree orders right away. Food was served quickly and he brought the bill promptly---without being asked. We appreciated his concern for our time issues. As for the meal, I had a raspberry mojito that was really good. For my entree, I had the Pollo Estilo Billy, which is a spice rubbed chicken with citrus butter and fries. The chicken was amazing! Usually chicken is just chicken, but this was so good. I didn't care if we were late as long as I got to finish. Others in my party got the skirt steak and quinoa and everyone said their food was good.  Despite the inability to seat a reservation on time, the food and the service made up for what could've ruined a special celebration.
