I tried this place for the first time this past weekend and LOVED IT!  The food was absolutely amazing and well worth my trip on the train to eat there.  The food is very reasonably priced and tastes great. I don't anyone would go wrong by eating here at Garcia's. It's a little loud but everyone is obviously having a great time.  TRY TRY TRY this place... You won't go wrong!
