Deelish! Walked in on a Saturday night just before 8 to place an order to go. We heard about this place from a friend who claimed it had the best fried chicken... After a fatty, fried food craving and reading yelp reviews, we decided to make the venture to Crisp. We were able to order right away and decided on the Seoul Sassy and BBQ along with some fried shrooms and brown rice. We sat around for about 7 minutes, if that, while I read up on some Chicago news in the reading materials available to customers. I really enjoyed the casual, yet contemporary decor and friendly, but not too over the top customer service. After arriving home, we began the feast. Our favs were the BBQ chicken and the mushrooms with two accompanying dipping sauces!!! Unfortunately we were a bit let down by the lack of flavor of the Seoul Sassy compared with the BBQ style chicken, but hey overall we thought it was a winner.
