Frontera Grill is a unique restaurant in Chicago's River North neighborhood. It manages to serve pretentious Mexican influenced foods in a most unpretentious manor. The atmosphere is warm and charming and the service here is good.  The food here is an excellent and really shows off Rick Bayless's talent. After eating here, you will be inspired to try to cook Bayless's recipes from his show, Mexico One Dish at a Time. The brunch here is very good and they also have an excellent margarita's menu. The biggest drawback to this place is they do not take reservations, so prepare to wait.
