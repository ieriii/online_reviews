Extremely disappointed in the service that was provided at the Mercat a la Planxa.The excitement & the high expectation of going to the tapas style restaurant was lost in the service provided. The waiter was reluctant to give us the great service he was providing our three neighboring couples, as he did not tell us the chef's special selections or even come to check up on us the entire time during dinner. I would also rate the tapas a being okay as some selections were quite salty for my taste. Made me feel like I'd rather go eat some Chinese dim sum in order to satisfy my cravings for small bite appetizers. I would not recommend this place especially if you are expecting your overall dining experience to be excellent.
