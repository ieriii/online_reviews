I forgot how great this place is ... seeing as how I don't live on the Northside anymore. They have the best crab legs I've ever eaten, and you can't go wrong when there's a bottomless plate (on Tuesdays, I think). Anywyas, I didn't get that yesterday, but a mug of REAL clam chowder really hits the spot when you feel like you're dying from a cold.
