Chicago is a hard place to find good sushi, but this place has it. The fish is fresh. Some rolls are creative, while others are reliable classics. The staff and management are polite and helpful (rare at a busy hot spot). It's a little loud and crowded for my taste, but that's the market voicing its loud and positive opinion.
