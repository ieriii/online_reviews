Had an amazing night here. We had this Gilt City deal which was a four course dinner for two. The food, served tapas style, never seemed to stop coming. The waitress was a bit uptight, but in a way that you would like your waitress to be uptight. I loved the ambiance and the tiles above the kitchen that did nothing but remind me of the Mercat Santa Caterina in Barcelona. I would go into detail but I ate here two months ago and could not do it justice. Unfortunately eating here often is not within my means, but hopefully I will be back soon.
