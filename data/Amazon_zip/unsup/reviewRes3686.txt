So how do you tell if an Asian restaurant is legit? There are actually Asian people eating there. Which was the case with Crisp when i went in for the first time this past Sat night. It was a good omen that didn't disappoint. We ordered a whole fried chicken (which consists of already cut sections individually fried un-battered, and covered in sauce for your eating convenience.) and the medium-sized Buddha Bowl with beef. We were ravenous and it was still too much for us to finish. I was shocked at how good it all was. I'm grateful to no longer have to trek up to Foster every time I want Korean.The food, price, atmosphere, super friendly counter service, and lightning quick food prep makes this place stellar. I'm definitely adding Crisp to my list of top places to eat.
