Love love love Grand Luxe-- well, I love their deserts. Strawberry shortcake is perfect and light and sweet -- definitely big enough for two. The chocolate cake with icecream used to be divine. Seriously, I would close my eyes during every bite just to savor the moment, but they've changed something about the recipe and now it's mediocre.  Now that I think about it, Cheesecake Factory has better food and Grand Luxe has better desserts. Coffee and complimentary bread is mediocre(and that's being generous). Wow, yeah, I love the interior but that's about it. Oh, and don't fall when walking to your seat or the bathroom, it's super slippery!
