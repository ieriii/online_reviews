Erm, how about noooo. Perhaps we ordered poorly (spicy eggplant, egg roll appetizer, jumbo shrimp appetizer, and Governor's chicken), but it was all meh. The appetizers were too doughy. The spicy eggplant was not spicy enough, as far as I was concerned, though the caramelized garlic sauce it was sauteed in was good, but nothing mind blowing. I ended up making my own dish by dousing my rice with the sauce and adding the jumbo shrimps to it. Oh, and they charge you $1 for a bowl of rice, which I did see on listed on the menu, so I was forewarned, but you're not asked if you want rice with your meal, it's just assumed that you do, if you order a non-noodle dish, and then you're charged for it. Where I come from (Houston) the Asian restaurants do not charge for rice that accompanies non-noodle dishes. That, to quote Tony Harrison, is an outrage: http://www.youtube.com/w We were initially enthused about this place: hole in the wall, in Chinatown, a queue of people waiting and hoping for their number to be called by the harried, cheongsam wearing hostess. Instead, our visit brought to mind the dulcet harmonies of that Public Enemy song, "Don't Believe the Hype." Not only was the food unremarkable, the service was borderline atrocious ( I know it's Chinatown, I don't expect kowtowing, I don't even expect full acknowledgement until I have to flag you down, but even after I've flagged you down, you disappear), and the restaurant itself was hot, stuffy, and poorly ventilated. The decor details of panda photos and faux Starck chairs did little to distract from these faults.  Once we escaped, we promptly headed to Aji Ichiban for some Asian candies to make up for this mistake.
