No Menu Sunday. Phenomenal meal. Every course kept getting better and better. Uncommon to find a chef who also makes wonderful dessert. We were gnawing the buttermilk battered quail off the bone with our hands. 2 cheese dessert with sauternes and foie gras sauces were unbelievable. Smoke ice cream with a Boston beignet perhaps the most creative final course I've ever had. Gail Gand and Mindy Segal - you've been schooled... Shortcomings: Agree that some dishes perhaps over salted. Decor, worn dinerware, and lack of beverage selection in lieu of BYOB could use a refresh.
