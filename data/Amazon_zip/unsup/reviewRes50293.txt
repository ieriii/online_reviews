Having moved from New Orleans to Chicago about 2 years ago, I have been wanting to visit Big Jones for quite a while now. My wife had been several times with her girlfriends, but this time it was my turn. The atmosphere is comfortable, the coffee was good, and the complimentary beignets are delightful beginning to any meal. I went with the Bayou Teche Omelet with grits for my meal. For the price ($15), I was really expecting more. I probably had 3-4 crawfish tails at most in the tiny omelet. I was definitely still hungry after I cleaned the plate. Luckily, my wife had ordered the Corn Griddle Cakes, which she could not finish. They were amazing, and I cleaned her plate as well!  Overall, the food was very good and I would return. However, I would probably not order an omelet. This would definitely be a 3.5 star review....
