With 476 reviews, Bad Apple definitely doesn't need any more. But as human nature proves, everybody likes to state their opinion. Everybody already knows that the food is good and the beer list rocks, if not overwhelms some people. But I wonder if they know how awesomely Bad Apple caters to veggies and vegans. No, I am not a veggie nor a vegan, but I am no longer eating dairy thanks to a little something called lactose intolerance. I ordered the legends of the daal without feta or yogurt and honestly, was worried about how tasty a veggie wrap in a burger joint would be. Our server asked me if I was vegan and I told her no, but it turns out that she asked because they have different serveware for the vegans and veggies. Wow! We had a short conversation about how cool it was that they catered to the meatless, animal by-product free crowd and I learned that many of their staff were vegan/veggies, and one of the owners was also a veggie. As a result, they're very sensitive to having good alternatives eating from serveware that has never known meat in its inanimate life. Having been a vegetarian for a few years of my life, I can certainly appreciate the places that go out of their way to appease a minority crowd. Oh, the fries weren't that good, and the ketchup was not better than Heinz, albeit had a unique (non-ketchupy) flavor. My daal wrap? Delicious.
