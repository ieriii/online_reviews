I went here with some friends(Ron & Ilona)and my girlfriend for dinner. This place was pretty cool, laid back, really helpful staff. I haven't went to many Cuban joints but this is mos def the best one I've been to. They have a tilapia sandwich that is just AWESOME. Everyone enjoyed their food...even my girlfriend who is kinda hard to get o eat new things. I like the small jars that they give you for your BYOB drinks. The prices are not too wild and crazy, although if this palce was in the Lincoln park or gold coast it would be VERY over priced...all in all if you want a laid back GOOD cuban meal with little hassle and lots of culture then pop over to 90 miles...!!!!
