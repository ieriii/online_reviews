I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!! I think I may have had the best breakfast of my life this past weekend. I had the pancakes which were apple cinnamon I believe with the granola...they were to die for and I felt like they were somewhat healthy. My sister had the huevos rancheros which were phenomenal. If you are in a hurry this wouldn't be the place to go, but if you want a leisurely brunch and don't mind waiting this is your place!! They really have the waiting system down though....you are put on a list for a table and then wait in line to order...by the time you order your table is pretty much ready for you to sit and your food comes soon after...like clockwork!
