Food was very good, but service was only decent. BF had the eggs, sausage and potatoes. I had the linguine seaurchine crab pasta. For appietizer, we had the tuna bauchette. Food is definitely unique. We probably had a personality conflict with the waiter. He was alittle too fake and salesman like for our taste. We would definitely come back for the food and the old style atmosphere. If i were to rate on food alone, it would get 5 stars. Minus 1 star for the service. If you are looking for a unique italian flare, definitely check this place out. You wont be disappointed.
