Food was really good. Waitress was charming, helpful, accommodating and top-notch. Idiot in charge of seating customers was beyond rude.We made reservations for 5:30. My son and I arrived at 5:28. In front of me, Angela D. (who wrote her own review earlier) was greeted saying she also had a 5:30 reservation. She was meeting a friend. The host informed her that she would be sitting at a lovely table about six inches from her left hip, but it was their policy not to seat incomplete parties. Then I told him I had a reservation for three and my husband was on the way. He said we'd be sitting at the lovely table six inches to my right. Now, because the place is about as big as your average suburban master bedroom, there is no waiting area. So she and I and my son stood in the doorway, waiting for the missing people. Had I been seated, I could have ordered drinks -- for myself and for my husband (who was driving in from Schaumburg). After ten minutes, the host informed me that if my husband didn't arrive soon, they would have to give my table away because (as he pointed to his clip board) as you can see, I've got a lot of people who want to get in here. Even though my husband arrived shortly thereafter and we had wonderful food (I had the pan fried catfish, hubby had the scallops) served by a friendly waitress who went the extra mile to charm our 13-year-old son with samples of various breakfast cereals, I still can't get over the unnecessary rudeness. The policy of not seating partial parties is short-sighted at best and should be stated in advance when reservations are made. And it costs nothing to be polite. Rudeness, on the other hand, just got you this mediocre review.
