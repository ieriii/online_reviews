First off, the neighborhood is TERRIBLE. It really is, I have no idea why nobody seems to mention the fact that this place is in the GHETTO in their reviews. I parked on the street (Uh, hello, a parking lot would be nice) about a half a block down from this 'restaurant' (if you can call it that) and was literally scared to death to walk, even that far in this area, with my kids. I walk up and see that there is a line, I FOOLISHLY thought someone would be kind enough to let me up into the front of the line, since I HAD MY KIDS and all, but no, of course. The best part was I was treated like some kind of monster for even trying. SO SORRY FOR TRYING TO KEEP MY KIDS SAFE, ok? We waited a good 15 minutes and the line was moving so slowly that my kids started getting restless and that was it, we left. Complete disaster, ZERO stars, will NEVER go back. Thanks for nothing.
