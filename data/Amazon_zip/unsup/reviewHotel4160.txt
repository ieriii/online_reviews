Excellent hotel, it's close to anything related to Michigan Ave! Not far from the train, and in walk able distance to a lot of attractions. We walked from here to the Taste of Chicago, as well as up and down Michigan Ave! It's very big, I believe they have two separate towers with a really nice bar and restaurant. Check in was fast and the rooms were clean. The cleaning lady did come at an odd time, but I guess she probably started or ended with our rooms. Elevators are a bit slow but what do you expect with the number of floors. Overall I was very happy with my stay here!
