I rated this a little lower because this seems like the type of place where if you'd like to have a group over 4 you should have to rent the whole place or something. This place is teeny-tiny. The uncomfortable bench made of plywood to sit on for a prix fixe meal made the experience feel a little cheap. That said, our dinner club enjoyed the limited menu--most things were quite good. The parsnip soup was meh and the sashimi appetizer was straight out of a sushi restaurant...but not a creative one. My risotto was a little mushier than I would have liked but all the flavors were there. It matched the barramundi quite well. All the fish dishes were prepared to perfection. Choose the escolar, asian inspired flavors. Quite nice!
