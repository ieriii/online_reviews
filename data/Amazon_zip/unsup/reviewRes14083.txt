I've been craving a good Cubano sandwich. Okay, I probably wouldn't know what a good Cubano is, since most of the ones I've had have been made by gringos. So when I heard about this place just across the river from me, I got excited. I drove today (into their somewhat tricky 5-car lot) but will probably walk and eat outside when the weather's nicer. I just enjoyed a take-out Cubano with Mariquitas (plaintain chips). The Cuban rocked my world. It was so good I would've tried to eat two if I'd bought two. Fortunately for my gut I only had one. The mariquitas were also tasty. They come with a garlic oil that got me excited at first glance. But, a little goes a long way and I only ate a third of the order. I'd like to be able to kiss a woman sometime this year. But garlic fanatics - check it out. There were a few regulars when I came in. I could see myself joining their ranks.
