I experienced nirvana in the form of a sandwich here - a Lechon (pulled pork) sandwich that is. You cannot afford to miss this place. Definitely the best sandwich in Chicago (ok, after Bari Foods maybe but in a different league). The pulled pork was simply devine with the garlic sauce and sweet plantain - and adding the hot sauce completed the whole experience. My boyfriend had the Cubano and it was terrific. There was three cool guys running the show that couldn't have been nicer and checked on us a few times to see how their recommendations fared with us. I am pregnant and envision myself ordering someone to fetch me a 90 Miles Lechon sandwich in the hospital upon giving birth!
