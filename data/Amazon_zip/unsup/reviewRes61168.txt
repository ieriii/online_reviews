We waited in a line that wrapped around the building for 45 minutes. The hostess constantly walked around checking on everyone and they were serving samples of beer. Our waiter was quick, observant and very helpful. We did wait another 45 minutes for our pizza, but after the first bite it was clear to me that it was well worth the wait. This is definitely a must have if you're ever in the Chicago area.
