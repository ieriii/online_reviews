If you're planning to start a diet tomorrow, go to Big Jones today and order everything on the menu. Starting with the drinks, I had a Charleston Mule-- which combines Ginger Beer and Firefly Vodka with lime and soda. Yum! It's a nice summer time drink (one that I won't turn down in fall either). We ordered pork belly with corn cakes for our appetizer. It was awesome-- it pretty much was like the best bacon and pancakes I've ever had. I had the shrimp and grits for my entree: cheesy and delicious, but not too rich. A perfect combo. My uncle had the sweet tea pork chops and was equally pleased. If I can give you one suggestion when going here: save room for dessert. Even if the drinks, entrees, and service hadn't been great, he desserts were so fantastic, it would be hard not to give Big Jones five stars. We ordered the Mississippi Mud Pie and the Red Velvet Cake. Both are delicious. The mud pie is so rich and gooey, and the cream cheese semi fredo that accompanies the red velvet cake is like nothing I've ever tried. I've been dreaming about both since we went here. I love that their focus is local/sustainable food and they do a great job with it. I'll definitely be back!
