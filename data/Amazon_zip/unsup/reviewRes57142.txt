I agree with some of the other reviews here when I say that the best parts of the meal are the appetizers, the drinks and dessert. My halibut entree was kind of bland as were some of my friend's entrees.HOWEVER, ceviches...yum, margaritas and specialty drinks were fantastico! and the tres leches cake was by far THE BEST I've had in Chicago (sorry Kristoffer's). Our server was really charming and funny without being over the top cheesy and was very knowledgeable about his recommendations.We had a great time here and the space is colorful and very fun with several different rooms and levels.I would definitely recommend coming here for a celebratory dinner.
