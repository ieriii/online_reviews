We went on Saturday, for dinner. I should of stuck with my first choice however I ordered Chicken Royal w/ Shrimp Scapi(Combo plate). My company order the Barbaque Salmon which was delicious! The portions are plentiful, prices are right. The row of tables with the cushy, leather seats were very tight. Which made it very difficult to be comfortable because lack of leg room. Friendly staff and good customer service. Nice place to spend time with someone. I'll go back.
