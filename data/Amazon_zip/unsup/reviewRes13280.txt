We always walk by Glenn's Diner and notice how packed it is so when we wanted seafood the other night we thought we'd give them a try. The place is absolutely amazing! First of all, the seafood is incredible. Very fresh, very tasty, and they have some awesome chefs that know how to prepare it perfectly. The greatness doesn't end with the food. The wait staff is incredible. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. Our waiter was great. Although they were so busy, he didn't rush us through our meal. I felt like I was really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy. I had the salmon, which was seared to perfection and my husband had the seafood bisque fettucini (amazing as well). We had the calamari which was a perfect mix of flavors and not over cooked (like most). Overall, I can't say enough great things about Glenn's diner and we'll definitely be back! The only negative is location. Love sitting outside but it is right next to the street/el, however, it really was just fine and we thoroughly enjoyed the food and experience.
