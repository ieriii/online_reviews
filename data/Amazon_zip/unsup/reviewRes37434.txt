It was a super lazy, chilly, sunday afternoon and my husband and I finally decided at 5 pm to get up and leave the house. Hungrier than ever, we make a list of restaurants we have been wanting to go. (this is a great idea for future use also). Suddenly Hopleaf came to mind, as we had been there once for drinks before but have been thinking of going to eat there ever since.  We made the drive up to Andersonville, and were immediately seated on the second floor overlooking the rest of the restaurant. It was so cozy and warm...perfect!  It seems wrong, but we ordered wine and not beer. The wine list is huge and really affordable, not to mention how delicious our Syrah was. As I mentioned we were super hungry, so we ordered a ton of food. mussels, salad, a cauliflower little baked dish and skatewing. My midwest upbringing tends to hold me back from appreciating the delicacy of mussels, oysters, etc...but I'm learning. What I really loved about their mussels was the broth! I could of ordered an entire loaf of bread and lived on dipped brothy bread. mmmm.. Also, bonus, the fries that come with it and the aioli sauce are awesome! Maybe too many though...we attacked them like free corn chips in a Mexican restaurant..definitely took a toll on us when it came to the rest of meal. Salad - Awesome.  Cauliflower baked creamy thing - pretty good, if I were to take out one thing from our meal it would have been that. The side of carrots and chard tasted soapy to me though. (hence the -1 star). Skatewing - Really good - Capers on top made it for me. When I get over my "beer hurts my stomach and wrecks my whole body syndrome" I will be racing back for some good times at the bar!
