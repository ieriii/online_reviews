Fantastic spread of breakfast/brunch/lunch items. You will definitely find something you like. They have some very unique combinations, all delicious, and the secret is in the freshness and quality of ingredients. Organic eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables, excellent cheeses, and freshly squeezed juices. Even their spreads, jams, and jellies are made fresh on site. Yeah, a bit more pricey than My favorite is the Mana Mou skillet. It's so good I have a hard time ordering anything else there. The steak is marinated and grilled so well, very tender and juicy, and combined with the rest of the skillet goodies makes for a kingly breakfast. Just a few notes: They will NOT seat you until your entire party is here. Make sure you tell your party not to be late! For this restaurant, it's totally reasonable and understandable--they really want to make sure that no space is left unused. This is for their benefit so they can serve efficiently, but also for your benefit too. You don't want to wait around at the door just because some seated party of 10 only has 5 people there, but they're using up space you could be sitting in. They get busy after 10AM, and around that time you'll start waiting--and they don't have a big waiting area so if it's winter...dress warm. Service has always been impeccable. Completely first rate, nothing else to say.
