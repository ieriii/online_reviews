Great food and service. Enjoyed the shrimp pasta with a side salad.I highly recommend this dish. At many restaurants the pasta is to starchy or the cream sauce over powers the rest of the dish. Giordanos creates the perfect balance. I've only been here once while on a business trip and would ensure to go back when in Chicago.
