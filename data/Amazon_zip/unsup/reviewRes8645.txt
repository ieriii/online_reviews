We have been searching for a good pizza in Chicago and I feel like we have finally found it. Chewy thin crust pizza lightly topped with fresh and flavorful ingredients baked in a wood burning oven - what more could you want? Maybe a yummy antipasti platter with cured meats, olives, and cheese -YES! We will definitely be frequenting this establishment.
