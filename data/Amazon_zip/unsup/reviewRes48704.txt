My hubby and I came on a Sunday night around 9:00 p.m., and it was still packed. The atmosphere was nice, but I did not like the seating structure. My elbows were literally touching the person next me. I felt as if I was back in grade school eating in the cafeteria. I saw that there were also pig pen like seats along the walls. I'm not sure how I feel about those seat either. They look interesting, but poor servers would have to go in and out of those pens in order to serve food. Now for the food. Appetizer: Bouchot mussels from Stonington, Maine: gueuze, bay, celery, butter and baguette - delicious and huge portion Spicy pork rinds - very good, tasted similar to Cheetos, but better Entree: Farm chicken from Slagel family farm, Fairbury, Illinois: whole or half chicken with summer sausage and frites Half portion - good, but nothing special, taste similar to grilled Greek chicken Suckling Pig - too salty and kind of boring Overall, it was okay, but I don't think I will be back until I've exhausted all my options.
