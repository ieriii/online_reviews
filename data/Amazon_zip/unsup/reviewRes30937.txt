Lightning does indeed strike twice. I've been back to Mastro's several times since the opening and I've never had a regret. This past Friday we headed back for happy hour to launch the weekend and Clark the barkeep did his best Cape Canaveral to put us into orbit. As with space travel, the hardest part is getting that first mile off the ground. Unable to decide what I wanted, he patiently waited for me while other, more decisive customers watched the microdrama unfold. The call was finally made (vodka) and then I left three hours later feeling weightless.
