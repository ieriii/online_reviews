I love Garcia's! I usually get the carne asada, which seems pretty wimpy, except it's so damn delicious! I've also had the burritos, enchiladas, flautas, tacos, and whatever else they put in front of me.My only complaint, such as it is, is that the guacamole is inconsistent. Some days, it's an A+ and other days, it's a C-. But, overall, it's just rocking!
