I wish I would have never tried Sultan's falafel. I am absolutely hooked now. For $4 you can get a yummy, mouth watering, FILLING, falafel sandwich with hummus made mild, medium or spicy. While it is fried, I try and convince myself it is good for you, because, you know, there are some healthy ingredients in it. Just like fried zucchini is good for you because, hey, it's zucchini.
