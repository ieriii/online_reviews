i LOVE this place!! No really, it's an unnatural passion I have XOCO. Sure you have to wait in line 35 minutes to order a sandwich and be seated but its ABSOLUTELY worth it.  I've been there twice and I'd go every night if I had the money and didn't care if I was 1000 lbs heavier. The first time I had the Thursday Night special - a poblano, mole, pork sandwich which I LOVED. The second time my husband and I split the "Pepito" (braised short rib) sandwich and the "Cubana" (Pork loin and bacon) sandwich. So so yummy.  And of course we couldn't leave without having dessert - I HIGHLY recommend the churros (get 3) and the Chocolate Cafe con Leche. I'm not a huge chocolate fan but it was amazing. The Aztec and the Almendrado (chocolate shot with almond milk) are outstanding too. God...now I'm drooling.
