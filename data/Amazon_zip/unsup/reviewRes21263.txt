Loses one star because my personal mexican favorite, the cheese enchilada, was not something I would order again. But oh boy, everything else was tasty.  Here's what I ate that I would recommend to anyone: tostada and taco (with ground beef that was pure joy). Cheese quesadillas. A taste of a tamale (just like my grandma used to make! Good stuff!). A taste of guacamole. Delicious. And deliciously cheap. I can imagine I'll be back...
