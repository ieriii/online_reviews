Exorbitant prices and exorbitant cuts of meat. I had the 33 oz. Chef's Cut bone-in ribeye. Had it for three meals. On the first bite though, I honestly thought I had a shot at finishing the entire thing. The steak was easily the best steak I ever had-- seasoned perfectly, slightly charred, still sizzling, and enormous. As good as the steak was, and I know this is sacrilege, but I really dug the sides of creamed corn and creamed spinach. I have read that vegetarians go to steakhouses for their birthdays just to get awesome vegetables and the creamed corn in particular was an awesome side. I think it might've outshone the steak... It is expensive, but Mastro's is on a tier above the Capital Grille's and Morton's of the steakhouse hierarchy.
