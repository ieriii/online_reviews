We live right across the highway from Greektown, but my husband doesn't like traditional Greek food, so Artopolis is a nice compromise - he gets the pineapple pizza (if you can believe that!), while I'll try something different every time. I like the pastry things (can't remember what they're called) - I love the ham and cheese one. We always save room for dessert - I love the fruit tarts.The only disappointment with the place is that there aren't free refills - the diet coke is a 10oz bottle, which is cute, but not nearly enough, and I hate spending $6 for diet cokes with dinner.
