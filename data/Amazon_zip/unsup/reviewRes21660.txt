The food was totally worth the 30ish minute wait in line...and I hear that's a short version of what the line usually looks like! I had the shortrib red chile soup and it was sooooo yummy I wanted to climb inside the bowl. The perfect amount of heat, veggies and meat. The guac and different salsas were amazing as well, and everything tasted incredibly fresh. I will go back for the hot chocolate and the pastries!
