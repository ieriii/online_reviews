Wakamono is definitely great sushi. I like to think of it as my second choice when Toro is either closed because of weird hours, or such a long wait, that I have to get my sushi fix now now now! That being said, everything at Wakamono is great. Peter Parker roll is amazing, so is Godzilla. Wakamono has a nicer atmosphere than Toro, so if you are looking to get dressed up with the girls, or have a nice date night, wakamono might be a better option. The bar is a good place to sit and wait for a table too. Always delicious. mmmmm Wakamono!
