Any place that can serve me an omelet any time of the day is a big fat fan of mine--for real! They have the fluffiest eggs on that street! Go try one, you won't be disappointed. The prices are a bit high, but hey, if you got some extra pennies in your piggy bank that need to get out, go here! By the way, staff is friendly too!
