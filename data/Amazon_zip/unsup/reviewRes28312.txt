The place was about half full when my boyfriend and I got there, but they still put us at the smallest table in the place, right next to the wait station. No thanks. We moved to a slightly larger table. Ordered our pizza and after waiting about 35-40 minutes, a man came to our table to explain that our pizza had gotten burned, sorry but it will be 15 more minutes. Okay, stuff happens. So we wait the 15 minutes, then another 10. Finally a pizza comes to our table, and it's the wrong pizza. We ordered thin, it's thick. Waited over an hour from the time we ordered and never got to eat, because they screwed it up not once, but twice, and I wasn't about to wait around for a 3rd screw up. We got an apology and they gave us a $15 gift certificate (which seems a bit scant for such a royal screw up), so at least they felt bad about it, but I'm not going back.
