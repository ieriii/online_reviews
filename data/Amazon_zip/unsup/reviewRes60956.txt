It's fabulous. I went to Bin 36 for dinner with a group of friends and we were all impressed. I love wine and cheese (who doesn't?) and Bin 36 exceeded my expectations. Overall we had great service, wine, and our dinners were delicious. The restaurant was too loud but did not negatively impact our experience. I would definitely go back.
