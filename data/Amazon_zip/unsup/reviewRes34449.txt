I found Yolk on my first trip to Chicago when I was looking for apartments here. We ate here 3 out of the 4 days we were in town and a few months later moved into the neighborhood. We've lived here more than 2 years now and it's still our favorite place for breakfast! I've never been disappointed. Try the multigrain pancakes you can get them on the side of most orders instead of toast, they are delicious!  If you are looking for a decadent seasonal treat, try the pumpkin swirl french toast. We were recently given a sample of this and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it! If you get there after 9am you're most likely gonna have a wait but trust me, it's worth it.
