Prologue: So this is a belated YELP post, because I have only recently grown to know & love the YELP community. It was during this trip in April, that I first discovered YELP. I was solo, and YELP was my travel companion! I therefore felt compelled to copy & paste my April post from another community forum so that my fellow yeeps could benefit..... Having stayed here previously in a very small room, I was sure to ask for a larger room with 2 beds when I made the reservation although I was a solo traveler. I had room 1618 and it was very good. Their website reservations are very clear about the square footage of each room - so pay attention when you book so you don't end up an unhappy traveler. There are some rooms that are TINY, TINY. Dollhouse-like! Location: Excellent, excellent. In the middle of the Mag Mile. Need I say more? Rooms: No tub in mine - only a shower. Counter space was very limited - just a shelf below the mirror. Room had 2 flat screen tvs, sofa, chair, coffee table and desk. Free internet. Mini bar, but no refrigerator or coffee maker that you can use in room. Full length mirror and in room safe. Lobby: Elevators are quite small, but there are 3 available. Check in is on the 2nd floor. One computer on 2nd floor you can use to print your boarding passes. Service: I had very limited contact with any staff - so I can't venture an opinion. Food: I was so close to dozens of restaurants that I did not eat at the hotel. I would definitely stay here again, BUT will surely ask for a big room again
