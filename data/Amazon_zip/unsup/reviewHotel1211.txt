easy to get to, great landscaping, amazing conference rooms...this was the best manditory workshop ive ever been to, because this building and its staff were so great. at lunch time...after i copped an extra diet coke with lime and cup of ice...i scooted down to the concierge and asked him where i could find a mailbox. he pointed to somewhere on a nearby wall. i then asked some follow up questions to insure that the postmistress was really going to come and get me envelope. he assured me they would. but i wasnt convinced. so he took the envelope and tucked it in his breastpocket and then said he would hand deliver it to the postmistress for me. alls i know is....the bank got the check and i got to keep my condo. yessss!
