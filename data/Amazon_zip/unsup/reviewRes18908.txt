OMG-the food was delicious-Mexican-home style! We went to Frontera Grill, one of Bayless's other restaurants, right next door, and were told it would be a 2 hour wait! That wasn't going to work with our 7 year old child in tow (or without her!). Were we glad we walked over to XOCO-Rick Bayless himself was manning the cooking line! Garlic shrimp torta, chips/guac/salsa, churros and ice cream, mint iced hot chocolate, local beer-it was all good and the service and seating were polite and efficient. Would go back anytime!!
