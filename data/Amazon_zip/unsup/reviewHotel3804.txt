I recently wanted a little get-a-way and decided to book a room at the hotel for my mother and myself. We also, booked a massage for my mom and a facial for myself. It was amazing! The rooms have a loft feel to them and kind of remind me of the W Hotel concept. The bar downstairs was very posh and packed all night and the Aja Steak restaurant had excellent food and drinks! Some of the decor was kind of random but for the most part is worked. The showers were kind of strange in the locker rooms. Overall, we both enjoyed it and will certainly go back to eat there again. I went back a few weeks ago for a hot stone massage and yes it was amazing!!! The Vertigo Lounge is awesome...and I will take all my out of town guests back to Ajasteak and to Vertigo for a few drinks! They have a chalkboard in the restrooms which is so fun and they have a shot cart and great outdoor lounge section. Loved it!!
