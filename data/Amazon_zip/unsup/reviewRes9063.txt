Pita bread you are my one true friend.  Everything else here is just so-so. It really is a toned-down version of persian cuisine geared toward american tastes. If you're going to present your native cuisine please please don't play to the locale. It's hard to enjoy the food when all the spices that you enjoy and are essential to the cuisine are removed to play more american, or to save money on saffron/jasmine. Thats just my 2 cents you can take it or leave it, but I'll look elsewhere when having a hankering for middle eastern. There is no need to return for a formal review.
