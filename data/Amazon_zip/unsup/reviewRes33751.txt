Had a great meal here! I wish I could remember the name of everything that I ate. My friend and I split an appetizer with fresh basil and tomatoes, and a pasta dish with fresh vegetables. Splitting was a good idea because the portions are huge. I also had the cesar salad, which was just okay. The cabernat sauvignon (by the glass) was one of the better that I have tasted. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The atmosphere was a little loud, but it speaks volumes about the food when it was packed on a Monday night.
