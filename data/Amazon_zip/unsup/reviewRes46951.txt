The food was okay, but nothing special. Portions are a little small. The hanger steak would have been good if cooked correctly (was served way too rare) and the butter on top was a solid, cold disk that didn't melt onto the steak - disappointing. The trout on special was well prepared, but served with a really strange salad of sharp red onions and orange segments - it didn't really go together. Service was good, but I probably won't be back.  They try hard, but leave something to be desired.
