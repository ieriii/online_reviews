There are not many restaurants in the city of Chicago that I've graced with my effervescence more than India House on Grand Ave. The price is not so nice, but the food is totally worth it. I've been attending their lunch buffet for the past six years and although the price has steadily increased a dollar here or there, I've never been disappointed with the quality of the food or its abundance. When I really want a treat, I come here for dinner and indulge in the almighty baby-nan and secret makahni sauce. I've deduced that there might be cheerios sauce in it... Great for vegetarians too, but who wants to spend a ton of money on a meal out with those types anyway? O_0 Love the staff too!
