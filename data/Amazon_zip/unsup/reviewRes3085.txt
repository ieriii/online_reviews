Crisp is excellent, but there are some key things you should know before you walk in. Observation the First: The menu is made of two main items, Fried Chicken and "Buddha Bowls". The Fried Chicken is incredible, I recommend the Korean Style. The Buddha Bowls are excellent for Asian comfort food. Meat/Tofu is extra, otherwise the bowls just come with just the rice, veggies, and a fried egg. Second: Cash only, they have an ATM inside but it charges a fee. Expect to pay $8-$15 per person. Third: The fries are not that great. I'd say skip them. Fourth: The menu is not on the TV screens above the cashier, I remember my first time here I was looking at some random Karate movie and America's funniest home videos waiting for a menu to pop up. I no doubt looked like an idiot, but whatever. The menus are printed and are on the counter where the cashiers are. Fifth: The hot sauce is NOT the red one, it's the pinkish one marked "Aly's Atomic Sauce" and it's excellent, this caught me off guard my first time. Fifth: It's expected that you bus your own dishes.
