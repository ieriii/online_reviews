This review applies to the parking garage service. I am very funny about turning my car over to anyone since I have a hybrid and I'm always paranoid they are not going to know how to drive it. It is quite different at first -took me about a month to get the hang of it! Since I was on my way to a work related event and we didn't know where else to park, this was our only option. The attendant reassured me that they have had experience with my kind of car and I left it. When I got back, they had my car back to me within 5 minutes and it was all in one piece. I guess I have Ferris Bueller level paranoia! I would definitely trust this staff again with my car if I had to park in that area! Sometimes a little extra money is worth it if you know your car is in good hands!
