This is the most fun we've ever had at a restaurant. The chefs serve you as there's no wait staff, and it's fun to interact with them as they explain the dishes to you. The quail egg truffle ravioli? OMG. Ridiculously good. We were there pretty late, and it was the birthday of one of Chef Carlson's sous chefs, so everyone in the kitchen and dining room did a shot together! We will definitely be back!
