I have a fondness for older hotels that are a little down on their luck, so I ignored all the moaning around (on several sites) about the Tremont being . . so . . . so . . . OLD! Yeah, well--my wallpaper is peeling too. I found the Tremont to be very comfortable if a little overpriced (what downtown hotel isn't?) From my twelfth floor room I had a lovely view of the Lake--or would have if that damn Hancock Building hadn't been in the way. The Tremont is close to all the shopping on the Magnificent Mile, the Looking Glass Theater, Water Tower Place, the Hershey Store, Bistro 110--all the jostle and jump of the Water Tower neighborhood. Even though the Tremont is no more than a block from all the activity, Chestnut is a peaceful enough street that my room was quiet at all times. The Tremont staff seems polite and helpful; the bathroom seemed recently updated. The Continental Breakfast ($5.00) was only okay, but it was a sufficient jump start on Saturday morning. I was very happy with my stay at the Tremont and would recommend it to anyone except the most persnickety Felix Ungers out there.
