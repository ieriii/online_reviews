Wsa there on New Year's eve. I was disappointed with the experience at Brazzaz. Compared to my visits with other Brazilian Steak House, this was a disappointment. Our server came at the beginning and he was not seen around. The servers did not stop at our table to serve the steaks. I had to ask people working there to remind the servers to stop in our table too. I had ask this TWICE, which is higly unuusual in a Brazilian Steak house. It might be because of the location of our table. I actually mentioned this to our table waiter at the end that the servers were not stopping in our table. The meat choise was very limited, taste is OK, seems to be more spicy to my taste. The salad bar is fine. I was excited to go to another Brazilian steak house, but it was not a pleasant experience.
