After eating the frites w/ the 2 fried eggs on top, and the Charcuterie plate, we were stuffed. There was tons more on the menu that I'll be back to try, but this seems to be a place best visited with 4 people, who (ideally) all are open to eating from tail-to-snout. This is the kind of place that I really look forward to having many return visits.
