I visited the market last week and noted a few things. The store inventory has diminished, perhaps due to the economy and reduced volume of customers. The guacamole i bought looked alright at the store. However, when I opened it at home, it was slippery, slimy and obviously spoiled. This is just one example as to how the quality of their merchandise has gone down over the years. It's a shame because they used to be respectable and quite the gourmet store. I hope they survive.
