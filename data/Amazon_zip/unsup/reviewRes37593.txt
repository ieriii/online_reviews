Hopleaf has an amazing selection of beers on tap and in bottles. If you like Belgian beers, you will be in heaven. There is no question that the variety of beers makes this a must stop place. The food, however, is nothing amazing, mostly because of inconsistency. At times the kitchen gets overwhelmed - probably because the kitchen seems to be about the size of a closet. I've ordered the same sandwich several times and each time it comes out a little different. Sometimes it's cooked, sometimes it's merely warmed. The mussels are very well done, but let's be honest - it doesn't take a magician to make a mussel taste good. Be warned, however, the bar service can be surly and downright rude at times (the owner can be terse and impatient). Be prepared to wait until a bartender is darned good and ready to serve you because you will probably have to wait a while.  You'll also have to deal with a crowd in the bar that makes it hard to enjoy a beer. Best bet is to get to the bar as early as possible (if not at the open) to get a space. You -will- be shoved around, bumped into and likely have beer spilled on you due to the fact that there are far too many tables and not enough space. Making matters worse, if you're walking on the sidewalk the overflow crowd of smokers on the sidewalk tends to hover and makes passage difficult. Due to the inconsistent service and kitchen I give 3 stars. If Hopleaf could improve on this they would easily earn a 4 star, in my opinion.
