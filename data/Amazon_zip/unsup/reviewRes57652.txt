I've been going to Nuevo Leon for just over 30 yrs. I always have the tampiquena. The plate has a generous sized skirt steak, refried beans, rice, avocado on a chip & a cheese-filled enchilada with mole sauce. Over those 30+ yrs, as I have gone to different mexican restaurants (I don't always get to pick where we go) I always try the tampiquena. In all those years, I have not found one that comes close to Nuevo Leon ON 18th STREET! I have tried the tampiquena at Nuevo Leon on 26th street, and it is NOT the same, so beware. It has a little of everything, so I get to have a variety of stuff, which I like. If you like booze with your food, it's BYOB. They have a small parking lot on a side street east of the restaurant (they validate). Other than that it's street parking and you can usually find it. A word of caution on the tampiquena - If you worry about healthy eating, this dish is not for you. The refried beans are really good and really Mexican. Nice n greasy and tasty. I like to enjoy my food and I have decided to rely on advances in medical technology to save my life later.
