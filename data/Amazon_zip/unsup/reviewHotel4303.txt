I love the Palmer House Hilton. Love, love, love it. But let me be clear: staying elsewhere in Chicago is not a live option for me, as the only time I'm in town is for a philosophy conference that is hosted at the Palmer almost every year.  I imagine one can find an equally beautiful hotel with larger and fancier guest rooms for $185 (plus $30 occupancy tax) elsewhere in the city. But the lobby! The friendly service! The location! The excellent lobby bar and restaurant! The street-level Starbucks! The free internet in the lobby (both floors) and the elevator waiting area of each floor! So I'm a fan, although one can see from reading the other reviews that there are good reasons not to be.
