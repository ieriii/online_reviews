Hot Doug's is amazing! Their menu is always changing with new offerings. Although we waited a really long time when we went here. We went on a Saturday so we could get the duck fat fries. The portion is huge to you can definitely split them between a few people. My boyfriend and I both got the fois gras hot dog with truffle mustard. This was awsome! There were so many great looking dogs on the menu. This is a great place to get your hot dog fix. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the wait is ridiculous, at about an hour and a half.
