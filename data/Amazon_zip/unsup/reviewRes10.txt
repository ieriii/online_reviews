1st I will say I'm not a foodie but I enjoy dining w foodies. The service was impeccable. The presentation of food was truly marvelous. I am allergic to all seafood & fish. My friend is a vegetarian. They prepared special menus for both. Now to the food. Some courses were delicious others were ok. Everything was too small. Even if u liked it was gone in 3 bites. Even though there were so many courses we left hungry & went out afterwards. 2 of my friends are foodies & have been to very elite restaurants. Also, I do not have a need to be stuffed after eating out, but I do want to be satisfied. I was neither which was disappointing considering the price tag. The atmosphere was quiet. Was good girls night out. Dessert was huge disappointment. Dippin dots spread all over table. Price in my opinion not worth it. The biggest irritation was the champaign @ beginning of meal was brought out though we did not request it. I assumed it was complimentary. However it turned out to be $100 each. I only drank part of mine had I known definitely would have finished. Overall had a good evening. Glad I went but would not go again. If you don't mind paying $350 (w/o wine pairings) for 1 meal then consider checking out.
