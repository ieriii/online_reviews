This place is awesome, but not really worth coming to town and waiting in line an hour for. All the regular menu items that I had would make me come here again and again if this place weren't so freaking busy, but I can't say so much of the more unique items here. When I first heard of duck fat fries, I imagined french fries that tasted like... duck! (think taking a bit of crispy duck skin.... auuuughhh....) Alas, my initial impressions were dashed as we tried both the duck fat fries and the regular fries together and though we could tell a difference, we all agreed that the difference wasn't enough for us to consider this a must-have. Onto the specialty sausages... after having tried a crayfish sausage and mushroom/pork sausage, I was pretty unimpressed. The crayfish tasted like an andouille sausage to me, cept more expensive. I expected to see chunks of shrooms in my shroom/pork sausage, but, to my dismay, none was to be found. What most impressed, however, was how the people serving the food and the guy taking the order were really chill. Any request I had, despite the insane business, was handled amazingly well.  If I lived near here I'd probably come here right when it opens or something. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to wait until all the hype dies down before coming here again
