I went to Glenn's Dinner to celebrate a birthday during their All You Can Eat Alaskan King Crab night. The birthday boy and co, were DELIGHTED by their crab, happily munching away. We had a great server Jules, who was fun, attentive and not flustered in the slightest by our large party of 10. I, the resident vegetarian, had the veggie burger- WHICH I must say was TASTY! (I was shocked). However, the asparagus which accompanied by burger was one of the strangest, oddly cooked vegetable sides I have had in quite a while. They were wrinkled, overcooked and DRY. The place is TINY (meaning no strollers allowed), but the fact that their is a wait must mean the food is good. If you are a vegetarian, do not fret, your meat/seafood eating friends will enjoy themselves and you will not leave hungry. However, given my own personal food preferences I would not seek out this establishment for my own dinning pleasure.
