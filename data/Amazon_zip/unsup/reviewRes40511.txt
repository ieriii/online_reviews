So, I want delicious tacos for dirt cheap prices that I remember eating over in Los Angeles. You know, the kind that is just bad for your arteries, leaves your fingers with grease, and makes you happy. La Pasadita is like that. Slabs of grilled meat is wrapped around a warm tortilla. Just pour some of that bottled green sauce (it's crack!) and you're good to go. Horchata completes the meal. And it's so awesomely cheap.
