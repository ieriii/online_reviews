I've come to Gilt twice already, and I would definitely return. One of my favorite dishes here is bone marrow - it's simply not something you see every day. Their mushroom pasta was also delicious, and probably very fatty. The service was very attentive, and though the bar in the front can get crowded, if you get a reservation and sit down at the tables, it is actually still a pretty good ambiance for talking.
