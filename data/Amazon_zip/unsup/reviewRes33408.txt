Mia Francesca gets the upgrade to 5 stars for a few reasons: 1) The quality of food is fantastic, fresh, and consistently meets/exceeds expectations! On my latest visit, I inhaled the roasted pork chop entree in approximately 7.2 minutes. It was juicy, well balanced in flavor, and left me happy and full. 2) Service is prompt, friendly, and attentive. 3) The menu is continually evolving. Change is the one constant in life! Expect it to be an energetic atmosphere, with the tables rather closely spaced together. Definitely want to try dessert here sometime.
