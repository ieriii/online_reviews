I remember when this joint first opened in 2007/2008... I remember walking by and seeing everyone sitting outside during the warmer months. It was consistently crowded and it was always a wait. I moved away from Wicker Park in 2010 thinking wow, I never got a chance to try this place. I was enticed to come here by a friend who gave me free drink tickets....not to mention I was in the area to see my eye doctor at Eye Candy Optics. Smaller than what I thought on the inside, but it was still cool. I heard they have good burgers so I went with the Fifty Burger which includes cheddar, onion rings, bacon & bbq sauce on a pretzel bun. The burger did what it was supposed to do (make me happy) as I washed it down with a few free Makers & coke. I returned months later for a drunken sunday funday and had a blast! Very cool, chill atmosphere! I hear the brunch & chicken wings are pretty good so I def have to come back for them!
