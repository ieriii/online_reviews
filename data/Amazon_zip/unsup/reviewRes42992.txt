This pizza has been voted best Pizza in Chicago for a reason! It's a small little nook and cranny place, that always has people walking in and out with a slice. Totally cheap $2.25 a slice and one of the thick or stuffed is enough for most people, though I always get two so I can try a few different flavors.
