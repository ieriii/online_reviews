It's Taco Bell, with higher prices, but it's Taco Bell. What stands out here are the employees. There must be some kind of contest to see who can be the most chipper/obnoxious employee because they are all smiles and giggles and loud (ringing bells) and want to be your new BFF when they take your order. I was having a bad day once and didn't feel like making nice-nice with them so the manager gave me some cinnamon twists, which I don't like and went in the garbage anyway, but it was the thought that counts.
