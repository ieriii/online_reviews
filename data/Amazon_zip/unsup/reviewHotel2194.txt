The Intercontinental Hotel is a "nice" place to sleep only because there are beds and that is more comfortable than sleeping on the floor. I know I am being harsh, but for almost $300 a night (and that is with a group discount) the bed best be one that inspire me to sleep as soon as I look at it. This requirement was not met. The bed was not comfortable and the pillows are too soft, I could barely sleep the full night without tossing and turning. I am not a picky person when it comes to hotels because my eyes are closed most of the time I am in my room. When I am not asleep, I am watching television. This is were the 32-ish inch flat panel screen "should" be great, but the feed was standard definition analog stations. When not in my room, I was attending the conference I was in Chicago for. Most of conference rooms were good, but some seemed to be extra wide hallways. The reason i did not do anything else in the hotel, like go the gym, is because everything cost extra. I have never been to a hotel where everything (including the gym) was a la cart. The food provided for the conference was good, but the bar closed too early. So in summary: Too Expensive Everything A La Cart Uncomfortable Beds Good Food Bar Makes for Early Nights
