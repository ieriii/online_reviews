The atmosphere is incredibly sexy. Sensual music playing, big lipped stars' photos on the wall...open space, high ceilings--it seems like this was an old factory done up to a beautiful restaurant. Ceilings are hung with colorful giant lanterns and walls are adorned with colorful paintings. After doing much Yelp research, I decided to go with the highly raved about ropa vieja, which was completely worth it. This was one of my favorite dishes eaten in Chicago. We also had the laughing shrimp on a corn tortilla with chihuahua cheese, which was also a favorite. It was such perfection. Had I stopped at these two plates and had another similarly two good starters, this would have been a perfect meal. However, the wagyu sandwich tasted good (but nothing special) and salad with olives and ricotta was pretty off-putting for me. Come for dinner, as there is an expanded menu (lunch only carries mostly sandwiches), live music, more people around (the restaurant really is spacious)...I'm sure the hustle and bustle really makes this place great. Prices are a little high to me for the amount put on a plate. Bathrooms are downstairs and club-like, by the flats machine (genius!) for a long night of dancing and photobooth ($4 for 4 pictures on 1 sheet). Manager was denying our Living Social coupon, saying that we needed to spend a minimum of $50. A little off putting, but our waitress then had to show them the fine printing before OK'ing the bil.
