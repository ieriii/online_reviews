This was the final stop for Restaurant week and it was definitely the best for last!  The evening started off with pickles & BBQ chips that were brought to the table--was not expecting that and they were so addicting we were concerned about spoiling our dinner! For the official appetizer we were all going to get something different and share, but once we saw the shrimp & grits brought over to the table next to us, we all wanted that dish and it was a good thing we all ordered it because none of us would have shared it! For the entree, we each got something different: the kobe brisket (mine), the baby back ribs and the St. Louis ribs. We each had a different side: the poblano cheddar cornbread, the honey butter cornbread and the coleslaw. We all shared a taste of everything and it was all phenomenal! They also brought 4 different sauces and I especially love the spicy BBQ. For dessert, we each ordered a different dessert as well: the key lime pie, carrot cake and the cookies and milk (for which you order 2 of the 3 cookies available...but they ended up giving us one of each for the full tasting without us asking!) . Of all the desserts, the carrot cake was by far the best! Rumor has it that it's the recipe from the chef's grandmother...if that had been my grandmother's recipe growing up, I would be 50lbs heavier! We each took home a doggie bag of leftovers which included them giving us our pick of a BBQ sauce to take home with the leftovers. I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow night! I will definitely be going back here and will not be waiting until next year's restaurant week to indulge!
