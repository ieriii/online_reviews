One of the most interesting dining experiences I've ever had. As a going away present to myself (I'm leaving Chicago for lesser of a food paradise), I decided to splurge and go to Alinea with a friend. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, our every need was taken care of. I know the attentiveness and attention to every possible detail should be standard for a restaurant of this caliber, but it was still impressive and I loved being so waited upon!! I won't waste time going in to detail about each of the courses since the menu changes, but I will say that my favorites were 4 bites of seafood served on drift wood, the black truffle explosion (signature dish), and the desert which took up the whole table and is impossible to describe in a way that will do it justice! I will also say that while everything we ate was delicious, it's the unique presentation and the creativity of each dish that really makes this such a fun experience. We also did the wine pairing and it was totally worth the extra $$. Each wine was a great accompaniment to the course(s) and the sommelier, while a bit of a fast talker, was very knowledgeable and gave a great intro to each of the wines. This was by and far the most expensive dinners I've had but also ranks up there with one of the best. The food, the service, the attention lavished upon you as a diner, it all just adds up to a wonderful dinner experience. While I won't be rushing back (wallet needs a break!), I will without a doubt go back again in the future.
