Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... don't tell anyone about this place. If you're considering going here for brunch don't - because I don't want anyone else to find out about this place. Whatever you do, don't go here. Okay okay okay okay, I'll give you permission to go here, but only AFTER I put my name on the list, ok? While I want nothing but success for the owners of this place, I don't want other people to find out about it because I'm a selfish creep and I want to keep this place all to myself. Soooo... let's just make a deal that we won't tell anyone, okay? For my part, I won't tell anyone about the Nanadict, the papusas topped off with a delectable sauce and poached egg. I definitely won't tell you how it made me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside and seemed to warm up every part of my body. I can't recall ever looking forward to a Chicago winter, but this year is different. I can't wait to come here on a frigid January morning and have the Nanadict to warm me up. I also won't tell anyone about the awesome cherry-chocolate pancakes and that they were invcredible. And finally I won't tell anyone about how having the two as a pair (splitting them with a significant other) was one of the best decisions I've made in my recent life. Nope. I won't tell anyone that. Ehhhh... f'that - THIS PLACE ROCKS!!!!!
