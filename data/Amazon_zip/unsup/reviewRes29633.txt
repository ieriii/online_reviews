I assumed that I would be walking into a "hole in the wall" type of place, but it's actually pretty nice inside! The food was great...we collectively ordered the fried Gorgonzola appetizer, Caesar salad, spaghetti with meatballs and the macaroni and cheese. All was delicious! The service was friendly and quick, but we didn't feel rushed at all. Great, casual place for lunch, dinner or take-out!
