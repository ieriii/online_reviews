We returned to Zed to celebrate the birthday of my beloved princess and enjoyed a delightful meal. The upstairs outdoor bar makes the place a cool hangout in the summer, but I'm here to tell you that it was terrifically warm and cozy in the main dining room during the dead of winter. We had a terrific time here during its previous incarnation as Sal & Carvao, and I think I like the redeveloped concept even more. I have virtually no complaints with the old way of bringing over a dozen kinds of beef, lamb, chicken, pork, etc. around on the skewers, but Zed also brilliantly expands that to include such items as, on the night we visited, swordfish, seared tuna steak, salmon, mahi mahi, and even venison. Everything I ate was delightful, including the items on the harvest table. I guess if I had to complain, I'd limit it to the servers either being very attentive for most of the time, but distant at others. On 3 occasions I'd hoped to exchange my plate for a clean one but no one was around to do it before the next fabulous skewer-de-viande arrived. Our server was extremely gracious throughout the meal, particularly with regard to welcoming us and wishing the little lady happy birthday which was much appreciated. However, they didn't do as restaurants usually do and provide a small birthday dessert. I would never think to raise this as a complaint but it was done for another table just a short distance from ours so it seemed odd. Pleasantly full, I needed to walk a few blocks down Superior before I could even begin to think about getting in a cab to ride home.
