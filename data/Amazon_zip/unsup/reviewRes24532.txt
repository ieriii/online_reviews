We were a 6:30 Saturday night, pre-theater (Auditorium Theatre) 'walk-in' party of two and were lucky to get seats upstairs at the bar (the dimly lit first floor "lounge" seemed cozy but was already filled). Our bartenders (Bobby & Nicole?) were prompt without being pushy, worked well together (they both answered questions for us and made suggestions) and seemed genuinely friendly. The main dining room is grand without being 'stuffy' and had a good energy. We found this place thanks to Yelp but didn't leave hungry or feel shortchanged on the food as some other reviewers have. We had some vegetarian dishes and both the prawns and the shrimp in garlic (what can I say? I'm crustacean crazy). My wife's final say on our meal; "If the food in Spain was this good I'd go back" (during a week in Seville she couldn't satisfy her radical veggie requirements).
