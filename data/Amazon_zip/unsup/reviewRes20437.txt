What a great place! My boyfriend and I went last night right before heading to the symphony and we both really liked it. The service was great and I was especially impressed that the owner kept checking in with us and even served us our food. He seemed very genuine and like a real host. Very cordial and friendly. My boyfriend had the lobster and quinoa dish which was amazing and I had the fish and chips which were perfectly done. There is an array of fun cocktails as well as lots of beer and wine. It can be a little noisy but that might have been because there were a ton of real Irish guys (from Ireland) by the bar. The place sort of reminds me of something you would find in NYC. A pub but much finer. Love the bathroom sinks downstairs too! This place is much needed for the area and I think is a great asset for Chicago.
