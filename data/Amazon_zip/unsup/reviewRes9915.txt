Our story starts with me reading that Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen is an owner. Cool factor just went up a few notches. Now....we decide to pop by on a Friday night at about 7:30....we had to wait a bit....but not as long as I thought we would (45 min). It was REALLLLLY crowded and noisy....so if you want a slightly more civil atmosphere....wait for a table upstairs. This place is bursting with energy....and the wait staff was cool and edgy (girls with tats and spunky attitude)....and the service was good (especially considering how crowded it was) Now on to the stuff that really matters....the food. The pizza is NY style thin crust...and I was stoked to see how many topping options they had (many off the beaten path). We ordered a large half veggie (Banana Pepper, Spinach, Shroom and Onion) and half cheese. The crust was thin, crispy and flavorful. The ingredients were garden fresh...and it was piping hot. For NY style....this is one of the best I have tried. Note: I highly recommend BANANA PEPPERS....they are pickled with a hint of vinegar and add a nice piquant heat to your pie. Much more lively than red pepper.... For beverages I feel they fall a bit short due to their catering to the beer snob....I undestand that they are a brewery, but they are lacking a bit on the selections for those who DONT like IPA/Hope Bomb craft beeer. Call me old school...but I like a PBR, Bud, Point, etc with my pie. I wont nitpick too much....and it didnt change my overall rating. Interesting street cred side note: A coworker who is from New York said he feels Piece is better than his favorite place in Manahattan. Highly recommended....abbondanza.
