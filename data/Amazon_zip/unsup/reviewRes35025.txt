So I used to live in Chicago and planned a trip back with my wife since she has never been to there. Since I work in the restaurant business I always remember Shaw's being great...not so much. We went last Thursday night, the hostess was very friendly checking us in and the seating hostess was friendly as well. Our main issue was with the service and the food. Feeling both rushed to choose our items for drinking and eating from our server is were it began. Once we picked a bottle of wine the server poured the bottle from the neck each time which is not proper wine service, throughout the meal we had to ask numerous times for water. We both ordered the filet and crab combo plate, when our dinner arrived I had plastic wrap wrapped around my crab. I told my server and he said he was sorry and did not ever offer to get me new crab. After cutting into our filets my wife's was undercooked, she order MW and it came out MR. Once I was able to flag down our server to let him know it was undercooked, not only did he have an disgusted look on his face but he handed my wife a side plate to remove the undercooked filet from the table. My wife was not able to get her filet off her fork onto the side plate, so the server thought it would be a good idea to use his hands to get the filet onto the plate!!!!  When the filet returned it was cooked to the order of beyond well done.  Never had a manager come to the table, never got hot towels to clean our hands at the end of the meal and server gave us a dessert sampler for the errors made??!!! Not what we thought we were going to get for spending $300 for dinner. Where I work if a foreign object is ever in the food you buy the meal, that is restaurant operations 101. A small fish in a big pond. Wish we would have spent our money elsewhere...
