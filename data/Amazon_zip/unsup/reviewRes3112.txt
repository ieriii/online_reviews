Crisp chicken? I die. I have never had better chicken. Never.  I had put off going to Crisp because I don't even like fried chicken. But, somehow, when you slather it in tangy Korean sauces, I can't get enough of it. We ordered the whole fried chicken meal with o-rings and kimchi on the side. And then added on a steak bowl. Tremendous! The kimchi was tangy and spicy but I ate a small enough portion so as not to burn my mouth off.  The chopped bulgolgi had the perfect balance of sweet and salty and worked nicely with the sticky rice. I was nervous that we were going to be low on food for four people. That was silly. Not only did we all stuff our faces, but there were leftovers.  I had some chicken cold this morning for breakfast and it was still drool worthy.  If I lived near here I am pretty sure we would eat here once a week. Instead, I will just have to come up with excuses to frequently pass through Lakeview.
