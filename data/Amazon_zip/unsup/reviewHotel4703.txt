I just stayed here for a week in Chi town, and Yes the room is small, but I loved it! I LOVE the modern eco friendly hotel, the service was IMPECCABLE! I had a small problem with a credit card, and they fixed it asap! the front desk guy was awesome, he always knew my name every night when I got home and every morning when I was leaving for work! What hotel does that? The products in the shower were great! The bed nice and soft, the room service yummy, and the room was always clean! My two complaints, the shower curtain, it was too short, and the cable! NO Vh1, Bravo, or MTV!! Whaaaa? I was there a week! Other than that, I believe if you facebook them, they offer deals that are an AWESOME rate. There is also a Whole foods within walking distance, several places to eat, and Michigan Ave is close. it's also across the street from Angels and Kings. Also, the restaraunt Elate is FANTASTIC! (review on that in a bit!) the best salmon I have had in a while, good wine selection, and tasty cocktails! I would DEFINATELY stay there when in chicago!!!
