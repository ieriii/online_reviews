Delicious! I could make a meal out of the appetizers, but then I wouldn't have any room for the wonderful steak. The empanadas were great. We also order a seafood appetizer which I would highly recommend. The steak was cooked to perfection. I can't wait to go back. We didn't get dessert but would certainly consider it next time.
