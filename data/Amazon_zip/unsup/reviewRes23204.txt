I've never had a hotter meal at any restaurant. When they put the peppers on the side of the menu items -- you better watch your step. Szechuan cooking is like a mix between Cantonese and Thai food. You don't get a whole lot of corn starch gummy sauces, and you get a lot of heat in exchange. There are too many menu choices at Lao Sze, and the staff doesn't have the language skills to explain the menu or get a feel for what round eyes are looking for. You're on your own with literally hundreds of menu items - and that kind of makes it a crap toss, unfortunately. But when you hit the jackpot, its a world class experience. We did have one night where everything was off. We suspect the chef was on holiday as they were out of ingredients and there was a general feel of "ship adrift' in the dining room.
