I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't already been said about this place. Randomly my brother picked this place by searching "best skirt steak in Chicago" and found all of these reviews. I happened to have the Groupon so we came for a birthday dinner with the family. All of us got some sort of combination with the skirt steak, my never adventurous brother got the octopus, my mom and I got chicken and dad and husband got shrimp. Everything was awesome, the chicken and steak came out so thin and perfectly cooked, well seasoned and perfectly hot. There was so much I gave my brother over half of the chicken to take home with him. We got the empanadas to start with and they were a little too fried for my liking, they were pretty crunchy. A little softer and creamier center is better IMHO. The grilled calamari appetizer was awesome too, not rubbery at all and great flavor. Mojitos are perfect, they might as well be the best in Chicago. Stay away from the drink with the tequila and grapefruit soda, that one was weird.  And save room for dessert...flan and coffee were AMAZE-balls.
