Great service and great food. Owner is extremely personable and remembers us every time we go in! Everyone is extremely friendly. Food is great; very flavorful but also light and fresh. Pho is amazing as well. Every time we eat there we see someone else getting something that we want to try the next time we come. Very fairly priced. BYOB too!
