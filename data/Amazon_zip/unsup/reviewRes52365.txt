I am a huge fan of deep dish pizza! Gino's is an great place to go, especially if you have a big group. We went with about eight people, and were able to order three different deep dish pizzas! Each of them was really tasty. If I remember correctly, we had the pepperoni, meat lovers, and vegeterian. Loved each of them! The only problem I had with their pizza is that their crust had a little too much cornmeal in it. So, it had a very distinct corn flavor to it. But, depsite that...I still love Gino's!
