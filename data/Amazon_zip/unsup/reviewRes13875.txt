this quaint lil' diner on a saturday morning seems like the place to be.  the outdoor dining and diverse menu attracts many that pass by. this is how i got sucked in. i ordered the scrambled eggs dish with honey ham. i like that they put parmesan cheese and green onions in the eggs but they went a little too crazy on the green onions. the cheesy hash brown patties were really good but i think they burned it a little.  the eggs benedict here are pretty good but i've had better.  on the brighter side, i like how they have cereal on their menu. you get 2 refills and a little bowl of fresh blueberries with your order of cereal. that's kinda nice. despite my complaints of the breakfast i ordered (i did not order all three dishes for myself), i definitely have to come back to try out their lunch and dinner dishes. looking at their menu, they have many different seafood entrees that sound yummy. that's partially why i give it four stars. the other reason is that i like the service and the fact that there is outdoor dining.  aahh...nothing better than enjoying your meal under the sun.
