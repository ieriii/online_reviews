Located in River North, the Amalfi Hotel is in an excellent location. You can walk to House of Blues, great food, and shopping. The El is about a block away. The hotel is very well decorated with modern furniture and design. Unfortunately, you need to be lucky to get a good view. The hotel is surrounded by brick buildings and you're more likely to be staring into an alley instead of the skyline.
