Been here a couple of times, and it's a reliable place for good food on the Magnificent Mile. Perhaps not the best small plates restaurant I've ever been to, but the vibe is great, and some of the dishes are awesome. The crispy pig ears are AWESOME. When you try it, you would never know or think it was even pig ears. All the other dishes I've tried there have been hit or miss, but even the ones that were a miss weren't all that bad...just nothing that ever stood out. Since I (part-time) live in the area, I'd definitely go back there if I were in the mood for that type of food and just don't feel like driving, making a far walk, or taking the train anywhere, but it's not somewhere I'm rushing to go back to. Try to go there on an off-day or off-hour as waits tend to be quite long if you're there at peak hours.
