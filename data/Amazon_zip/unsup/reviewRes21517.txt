Mayan Palace is my favorite! The food here is excellent. I've never had a bad meal and everything always comes out fresh and delicious. The margaritas are strong and great (and half off on Tues/Thurs). The mojitos and sangria are great as well. The staff here also goes out of its way to treat you like family. If you need something, anyone around you will bring it to you quickly. It also seems like they use magic to make tables available, even when the restaurant is packed. Can't say enough about how helpful and awesome they all are. Whenever my friends are looking for a good place to grab some Mexican, I recommend Mayan. This has led to some jealousy when they hear I came back without them . . . So be warned - Mayan Palace is tasty and addictive!
