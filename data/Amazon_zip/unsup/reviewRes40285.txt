I loved this place. The drinks are interesting and reasonably priced. The interior is rustic and cozy. And the food is AMAZING. Every dish was so delicious I am lead to believe you can't go wrong at Longman and Eagle. The wait time is long for groups, but we had to wait only an hour for 2 on Saturday night at 7:30. I can't wait to go back!
