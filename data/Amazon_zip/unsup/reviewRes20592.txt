Perfect meal for lunch. The people there were very helpful in guiding a first-time customer like myself. I had the pork belly special Wednesday torta. It was very delicious, but I forgot exactly what they put in it, besides the pork belly. But I would come back here more often in the future, but the toras are a tad pricey, but they are worth it if you are in the mood.
