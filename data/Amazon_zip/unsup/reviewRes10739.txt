Waited 45 mins for a table (for 4) which is what they said walking in. Everyone's dish was excellent.  They would have received 5 stars just based on food. But the atmosphere is very noisy, cramped, and hurried. You have people standing and walking all around you while you eat, shuffling back and forth to let the waitstaff by; and the people waiting are giving diners the evil eye if they are still talking/relaxing after their bill comes. Speaking of the bill, given the interesting dishes and the decent portions, I thought everything was very priced reasonably (except the 8oz glass of orange juice for some reason). The food is definitely worth the wait, especially since you can kill time by walking around the interesting (2nd hand) neighborhood shops.
