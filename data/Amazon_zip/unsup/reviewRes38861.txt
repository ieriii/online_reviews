We order from here at least once a week, so I think I've had everything. It's also been the pizza place we've ordered from since we were kids. The baked clams are really good, and the bruchetta is good but gets soggy quick so you can't save it for later. The pasta is good too, the broccoli linguine is really good, and my hubby loves the ribs. We have to dine in one day, I've only done that a few times but they have a fresh looking salad bar and the menu is alot more expansive. My dad always got the veal saltimbocco which had swiss and ham and black olives. I'm not much into veal but I do remember that it was really good. Their delivery is sooo super quick, I thought it was just because I tip well!! haha...
