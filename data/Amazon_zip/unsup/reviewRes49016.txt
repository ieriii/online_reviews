We dined here a few weeks ago and can't wait to go back. The atmosphere and seating arrangement (don't expect to have a private table unless you're in their version of a "booth") took some getting used to but in the end you realize it only adds to their charm. This place isn't for everybody and definitely requires some level of being comfortable with talking to and eating next to strangers but I loved it. The food was beautifully prepared and contrary to the other reviewers, I definitely found the portions to be family-style. We (two grown men) ordered two apps, an entree and dessert and found it to be more than enough for a complete dinner (maybe even on the stuffed side). The chicken was outstanding and probably one of the best I have ever had in a restaurant -- perfectly seasoned. You'll notice the lack of salt and pepper shakers on the table. It's because they aren't needed.  Also, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better beer list in the city.
