I wondered in this place by myself one day and was pleasantly surprised. The staff seemed very cool, laid back and courteous. I've had my share of pizza and Piece lived up to the expectation.  Their menu is simple and easy to understand. They're three types of pizza (red w/no cheese, red with cheese, and white) can be ordered in various sizes and toppings can be readily ordered. Be warned, pizzas are bigger than you think! I have a pretty hearty appetite and couldn't finish the small (serving 1-2) in a single sitting. For lunch, they offer a great special, featuring a mini-size pie and salad for a very reasonable price.  The restaurant's open atmosphere is great (featuring some fantastic large-party tables under a huge skylight or the "sunken area" near the large front garage door-like openings) and the place is usually crowded from happy hour until close. The patrons, like the neighborhood in which the restaurant resides, is truly diverse - ranging from young hipsters, to graduate students, to multi-generational families. In addition to their own brewing of beer (growlers can be bought to take home) this place offers a full bar. They featured live music on their recent anniversary and everyone seemed to have a great time. They're also a part of the Bucktown/Wicker Park food tour, which is pretty cool in and of itself.  If you're on this end of the river, definitely check out Piece.
