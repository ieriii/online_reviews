Irazu saved me from myself. After two days of pitchfork and three nights of past 3 am, my body was moments away from just calling it quits. I was so nauseated I didn't know that I could force something into my body. So naturally I did just that. This place... adorable, Costa Rican, small, cute patio, gets rave reviews, has veggie options and the friendliest staff in Chicago. So we sit down and this tall dude wearing a Pura Vida shirt gives us the run down. His name is Omar btw and he's hands down the friendliest mofo on the planet. He gave me a bunch of suggestions which I promptly rejected in favor of the Gallo Pinto. Then he brought us some of that recommended stuff anyway because he could tell that it was about three minutes past where I should have shuffled off this mortal coil. Justin, our gorgeous server, was super fast, nice, chatty, friendly, happy and I think I mentioned more than mildly attractive about five adjectives ago. Those guys are both dynamite and the food lived up to its rep. The hot crispy chips with green salsa to start, then an oatmeal shake. Not my thing because I'd prefer to avoid those calories in favor of something savory but it's as you would imagine: cold, creamy, cinammon-y and definitely shareable. The star of the show was the Chifrijto. We didnt even order it -- Omar brought us a bit so that I would know what I was missing. It might have been a subtle "I told you so" but I prefer to think it was his way of providing me with enough protein to knock out the hangover. Rich, spicy, chewy, beans, pork-y and in a molcajete. Absolutely get this. We got the bill. 9 drinks, 2 veggie burritos, 1 oatmeal shake, 1 diet coke = $25. Rachel Ray would be proud. Cheap eats and awesome service. THIS is why I love Yelp.
