I read about Xoco in a magazine and really was excited. The staff is friendly and they do a good job of managing a high volume of people. I've been here twice and although I think it's good I think it may be a bit more hype. The breads are good, but a little too hard for my taste. Salsas are amazing! Yum! I had the vegetarian torta the first time and then the chicken one. Both tasty, but quite pricey for just being mexican street food in my humble opinion. Not sure if I'll go back because I can get pretty good tortas at hole in the wall places in Pilsen for half the price.
