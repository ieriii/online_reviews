Why have I never written a review before?? I went to the opening and again a year later...YUM! I need to go more. The space is beautiful and the food is very inventive yet authentic at the same time. Gnocchi is the best! And yes, the bread basket is fantastic. Full bar, great wine list and wonderful outdoor area. We really need to go back!
