Ever since trips to Florida last autumn and winter, I've been on the hunt for great Cuban food in the Midwest, even going so far as to purchase a crock pot to slow-cook my own beef and pork. After months and months of hearing great things, I managed to escape the confines of Riot Fest (mmm, the sweet stench of PBR and armpit) at the Congress Theater for the relaxing atmosphere of the Caribbean in the midst of Logan Square. My friend and I decided to cut to the chase and, skipping appetizers, went to the main event, both ordering ropa vieja sandwiches. My dining companion's came on crusty white bread that more than adequately soaked up garlicky tomato sauce and juices from the perfectly tender beef. Being on a grain-free diet, I passed on the bread and was pleasantly surprised that the sliced French loaf was compensated for with extra meat, sweet roasted bell peppers, and onions. Both of our dishes came with yucca fries covered in garlic. Needless to say, me (a garlic lover) and my pal, who grew up on heavily spiced, garlicky Korean food, were in heaven. In a hurry to get back to the Congress Theater, I paused to order some fantastic cafe con leche. Really deliciously sweet espresso topped off with milk. Even my dining partner, not a coffee fan, eagerly finished the leftovers and reconsidered her aversion to consuming caffeine. Service was quick, polite, and very responsive to special requests. No wait on a Saturday! Outstanding, beautiful patio. Oh, and a shout-out to the hostess-- you're stunning and stylish and my friend and I couldn't stop gawking at you all evening. Sorry! I absolutely cannot wait to go back.
