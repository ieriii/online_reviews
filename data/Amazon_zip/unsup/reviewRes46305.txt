yes, the grand lux is full of tourists... yes, it's pricey (as far as MY budget is concerned, anyways)... and yes, you almost always have to wait for a table. all of these things usually equate to a top spot on my "i hate this bitch" list. but, when you have parents that decide to come visit the big city, this is the place to take them. if yours are anything like mine, they prefer things like red lobster & cracker barrel (but who am i kidding, i love chicken & dumplings as much as the next girl), so the grand lux is pretty top-notch. there are many different cuisines to choose from... the decor is great, and you get a lovely view of michigan avenue. and an added bonus, if you take mom & dad, chances are they'll pay! they do not take reservations, but it's worth the wait. and who am i kidding? i've been here sans-parents before, and i still enjoy it.
