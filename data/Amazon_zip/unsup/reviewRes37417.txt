By far one of the best local destinations in Chicago. The crowd is a bit of the pretentious intellectual type but I cannot stay away. Their beer selection is seasonal and amazing. If you choose to stay for dinner, the wait is usually shorter than the hostess tells you and is worth sticking around. Food is moderately priced and worth every penny. I am unsure of what mussels one of the reviewers below me had, because we only come for the mussels. Over the summer they had a Thai coconut mussel option that comes with the most out-of-this-world fries that every mussel fan must try. The York Creek cab mix is extraordinary despite their small wine list. Good for dates or groups. My favorite in summer! Must try!
