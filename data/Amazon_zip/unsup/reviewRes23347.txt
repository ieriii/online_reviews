Irazu is one of those "gems" in the Bucktown area. It is Costa Rican food, which I find very flavorful yet lighter than Mexican or Cuban food. I have been there a few times, and have never been disappointed. There are only about 15 tables or so, so be prepared to wait for a table if you are dining-in during the late dinner rush. You have to walk in knowing what to expect. It is just a little bit above the typical "hole in the wall" feeling. However, the atmosphere is comforting and warm, being a very family-friendly place. Many of my friends who enjoy Irazu love their fruit shakes. Since I am not a shake fan, I have never tried them. But they seem to be pretty popular, with many different flavors including some exotic fruits--and they can be made with either water or milk.
