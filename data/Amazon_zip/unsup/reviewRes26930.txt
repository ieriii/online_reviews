Made the reservation a few months back for Saturday night at 8:30pm. Was really stoked to try this place for the first time. We arrived at 9:00, on time for the reservation, but the table was not ready for us. They asked us to wait at the bar. I got a beer and the gf ordered their special drink, something with avocado in it, she really liked it. We waited about 20 more minutes before our table was ready. Not a big deal, it was busy as hell. We were just happy to get to our seats. Waiter was very nice, recommended some dishes. Everything we ordered was above average. But the sauce that came with the oysters...I cannot even describe how amazing that was. Not quite sure what it was...but it was mind blowingly good. Very happy with the entire night, will definitely head back there again!
