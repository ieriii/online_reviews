I came from California. This is the hot dog of awesomeness! The line is long and definitely worth it! I enjoyed "The Dog" and an Italian sausage. Best ever. Waited on by Doug, a friendly dude if ever I met one! I was told never to ask for ketchup on the "The Dog" or injuries might happen! I didn't ask for ketchup, and now I am a happy man!
