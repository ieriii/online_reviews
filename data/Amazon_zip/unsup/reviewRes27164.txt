Pequod's pizza tastes "lighter" than many other deep dish pizzas. The cheese is not particularly thick or gooey. The sauce is sweet. Those components seem like they come from a different pie than the thick, solid crust. Pequod's says its crust is "carmelized." I think that's just code for "burnt." The restaurant is quite narrow and fills up quickly. It also gets loud. Our server was nice, though there was some sort of mix-up and our pizza was delayed. Pequod's might be a nice change-of-pace pizza, but Chicago has many better pizzerias.
