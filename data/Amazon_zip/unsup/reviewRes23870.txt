If you're interested in Chinese food in Chicago, it's hard not to have heard all the praise for this place. With that in mind, I'd been looking for a chance to try this place for ages, and I'm happy to report that it met my expectations. For some reason most of the Chinese restaurants I've happened upon in Chicago have been Cantonese-style or super-Americanized -- light on the spice and with few interesting vegetarian options. Lao Sze Chuan has pages of exciting-sounding vegetable dishes; it has pages of just about *every* kind of dish, in fact. I decided to try the "Double-fried Eggplant with Fresh Chili," and my meat-eating companion had the dry chili chicken. A word on the service: it's clearly well-intentioned but very erratic. We were greeted by a smiling gentleman (the owner?) who silently held up two fingers in lieu of asking how many we were; later he assisted a table next to ours with very precise and plentiful instructions on how the hot pot should be prepared and eaten. Our orders took a long time to appear, and mine came out long before my increasingly hungry and irritated companion's. Water was refilled frequently, however, and it's a good thing, too -- my eggplant was extremely spicy, though the heat magically stopped right at the point where pleasure would have turned into pain. My companion found the spice one-dimensional, but I had to disagree, tasting undertones of extra-fresh ginger and garlic. The eggplant itself was shaved thin and perfectly soft, no sauce and not much grease -- simple and excellent. The dry chili chicken was a terrifying-looking plate, bristling with more whole chilis than chicken, but my companion said that the spiciness was actually quite bearable. Prices here are a little higher and portions a little smaller than most places in Chinatown, but this is quality stuff. It'll take me many, many visits to work my way through the veggie section of their menu, but I intend to try.
