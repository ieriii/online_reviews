I heard good things about Big Jones...but read mixed reviews on here. My friend and I went in for dinner on Sunday around 630 p.m. It wasn't very crowded but there were a handful of other groups. We started with cups (big cups I might add) of gumbo, which were delicious as was the cornbread. Service was excellent. We were constantly checked in on, the owner came over and talked to us. Dessert was also exceptional. Will DEFINITELY be going back.
