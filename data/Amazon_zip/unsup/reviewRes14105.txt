Any time I try a place like 90 Miles, I wonder how sandwich chains like Subway and Potbelly can possibly survive in Chicago. You take your $5 foot long. I'll stick with a $6.50 taste of Cuba. 90 Miles is your classic, family run hole-in-the-wall. The lively Cuban music in the background is a perfect compliment to the friendly atmosphere created by husband/wife combo behind the counter.  As for the food, I went with the Lechon sandwich -- a pulled-pork-esque sandwich topped with grilled onions, garlic sauce, and a delicious plaintain. I also tried the guava and goat cheese empanada. Simply wonderful.  Only one word of caution to first-timers: be prepared to wait. Even when the line isn't particularly long, all sandwiches are made freshly upon ordering. So be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for your sandwich. If waiting isn't your game, I'd recommend calling in your order ahead of time.
