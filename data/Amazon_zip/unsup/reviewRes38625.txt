My favorite bar in Chicago. Ridiculous, absurdly good beer menu, with at least 30-40 draft choices (at least 10 Belgian) and hundreds of bottled ones. Map Room, Small Bar, Quenchers, et cetera don't even come close to this place. And they're all served in the right glasses. Prices are in the $5-8 range. Food is European gastropub fare, with some great stews and game birds, a killer Montreal-style brisket, and very solid frites. My only complaint is that it gets very crowded on weekends, and you will wait up to 2 hours for a table (they don't take reservations). Best to hit it on an off day, or get there a bit before the evening rush.
