Rick Bayless blew my mind. This is the spot to try! Everything from the tortas to the cafe con leche was awesome. I wish that I had one in my hands right now. I was with three girlfriends and we had the following: Chips & Guac - the guac was SO good, pricey, but delish Chicken Tinga - the flavors were out of this world. I could have eaten five of these. Each bite was heavenly, honestly ridic. Choriqueso - nice amount of spice, loved the salsa Pepito - not my favorite. a little boring for me. my friend loved it because she loved philly cheesesteaks and this reminder her of that. Cafe con Leche with Dulce de Leche added - holy mother of good things, nailed it Churros - perfectly fluffy, not overly sugared and the perfect ending to a fabulous meal outside Next time I'm in Chicago, you'll be able to find me here everyday.
