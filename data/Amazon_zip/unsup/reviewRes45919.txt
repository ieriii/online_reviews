You MUST eat here for breakfast. If not for the atmosphere alone, for the hashbrowns! For the Chilequiles! For the omelettes! For the hand-squeezed orange juice... it is awesome. It kind of has a Cheesecake Factory feel interior-wise. Staff was nice and attentive. The food was just... wonderful. I enjoyed it A LOT and am going back TODAY! I will undoubtedly return for lunch and dinner at some point, probably once I O.D on their breakfast. I wonder what I'll try today. Mmmm. Only downfall is that they apparently only serve breakfast on weekends. :(
