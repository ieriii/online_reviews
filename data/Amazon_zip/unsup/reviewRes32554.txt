This was my first experience at an Ethiopian Restaurant. Demera was a pleasant place to eat. Not crowded, great fragrant spice aroma coming from the kitchen. A very pleasant server and a well appointed room. The menu was challenging to navigate but our server was pretty helpful. The food was both plentiful and flavorful, along the lines of the spicier Indian food. It was a satisfying meal, and if you are price-portion conscious, you will be happy :) One note: Skip the wine here. They really don't know what they are doing with a wine-food pairing, and as a consequence the wine they have to offer is of a quality level that will not really complement anything. Order a beer with the spicier stuff, or just go with a water.
