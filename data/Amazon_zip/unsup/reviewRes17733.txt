It is unmarked and they keep changing the outside decor, so its hard to place for non-locals, but its right in my neighborhood and I go there pretty often. The interior is just amazing in terms of decor and lighting. The lighting is very dim and relaxing and so are the chairs. There is a lot of privacy because of the high backed chairs and placement of chairs. It is a great place to go at the end of the week when you want to relax. All their cocktails are $12 and they are very creative. They also list their cocktails by main alcohol like Rum, Whiskey, etc, so you can actually taste different cocktails without mixing! I have tried many different cocktails there and they are all equally delicious. The most important thing to try there is their food. It is very very very good. My favorites are the tots, which are amazing and most recently, their doughnuts! The doughnuts arrive warm and have a cinnamon coating, they taste like churros and very very yummy. I have ordered lots of other food and you can never go wrong with any of their menu items. They are small plates though, and just niblets, not dinner portions. Definitely recommend and would go back there even if I did not live in the neighborhood.
