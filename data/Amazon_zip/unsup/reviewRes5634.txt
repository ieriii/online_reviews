I wanted to love you but your server was inattentive and sucked - dark hair, glasses, worked the enclosed patio the night of the 6th. Possibly on coke? We wanted to order more food and our plates were cleared and we were asked if we wanted dessert. The server was missing consistently and we had horrible service - I am a foodie and a loud one. I am NOT rushing back to go there and I would have loved to.
