Fine, but nothing special. We arrived and were seated at a nice table in the smaller space nearer the bar. Atmosphere was pleasant for a Friday night - energetic but not frantic. The truffle popcorn at the table was crack in a bowl. The server arrived to take our drink orders. Things started going downhill. Unfriendly and unhelpful. When asked if the bartender serves an Aviation, she said she didn't know, pushed the cocktails on the menu, and walked away. Hmm. Guess we won't find out. We agreed to try the tasting menu. Cesar salad was boring and light on flavor. Anchovy was only flavorful thing on the plate. Pea/mint soup was really nice, though presentation was trying a bit too hard to be hip (pouring from beakers). Fish was pleasant. Beef was fine. Don't remember desert. Throughout dinner different servers took care of us (or didn't). Each was unpolished and distracted. No attention to detail. Great service might have been able to rescue the so-so food, but instead they completely sunk the experience. At this price point, you have plenty of better options.
