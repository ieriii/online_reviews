Whether it's a casual afternoon lunch or the wee hours of the morning after a raging bender, San Soo is consistently one of my favorite Korean joints. My orders always start with the Goon Mandu. These crisp fried dumplings have plenty of scallion and ginger flavor, and come with a tasty soy-chili dipping sauce. Before the dumplings even make it to the table prepare for a flood of a dozen or so Banchan. Banchan are those tasty little side dishes of anything and everything that's fresh from the kitchen, such as kimchi, bean sprouts, seafood pancake, and pickled white radish. Refills are free so don't be shy! If you're going the BBQ route then you can't go wrong with tasty standards like Galbi and Bulgogi. The cuts of meat are always tender and well marinated. My other favorite is the Kimchi Chigae, a flavorful soup of kimchi, tofu, and vegetables. Flavors are well balanced between tart, savory, and spicy. You may expect a lot of heat with its bright red color, but it's relatively tame. It's also big enough for two or more people, so I definitely encourage communal sharing.  Now Korean joints usually have the reputation for cold, indifferent service. I actually find the wait staff here to be attentive and at times friendly, which goes a long way when you're serving a bunch of drunkards who keep mumbling for more Bulgogi and Kimchi. At the end of the day you get awesome Korean BBQ AND they're open till 5AM. What's not to love??
