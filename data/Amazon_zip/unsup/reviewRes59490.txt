We had a party of 33 on a Saturday night. Let me first say that from the onset of this, planning and speaking with Gwen, we should have gone someplace else! Gwen was bossy, rude, and unaccomodating. This was booked weeks in advance also! Her wait staff was overworked, we asked her to have two wait staff for this party. We waited over 1 1/2 hours for our food. My main course was done before my potato came. The salad bar ran out of lettuce. We had to ask for our drinks a two or three times. I do not blame the wait staff. They were making the best of a poorly run situation. The food was ok, nothing that was worth the aggravation. Don't bother with this place unless you are just a party of two or four. Gwen, please learn how to be personable. We had to voice our complaints and she started an argument. You will definately be losing many customers after this party. Sorry
