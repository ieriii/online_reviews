Stopping at The Public for Sunday brunch proved to be the perfect way to leave Chicago. While clearly the place is known for dinner, coming on a warm afternoon, sitting outside amidst all the meat packing buildings, well that's another experience that I can whole-hoggedly recommend. And that's what you should be thinking about here: the meat, and namely the pig (all certified organic and sourced from Dyersville, Iowa, no less!). I actually ended up with the rather excellent fried French Toast, but it was the accompanying sausage that I savored the most. One of my friends ordered the pastrami short ribs, which were about as amazing as something fall-off-the-bone can get. But whatever you do, order a side of bacon; this isn't your thin strip variety but a sizzling chunk of tenderness that melts in your mouth. And what's brunch without a good Bloody Mary? Our table actually went all exotic and tried their Saharan version, a mix of Tito's Vodka and Moroccan spices, accompanied with your choice of beer chaser. A strange idea, but nonetheless perfect. That's all, folks.
