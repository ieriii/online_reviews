First of all, I've been in the hotel for an event and I thought it was well run and the staff was very nice. This past weekend my friends stayed here while visiting for New Year's Eve. I thought the room was a little small but decent enough, and again the staff was fine. However, the hotel was having a huge NYE party and made all the guests wear wristbands. That's fine, but no visitors were allowed without purchasing wristbands for an extra $25 and this information was not given to my friends before making the reservation. The upstairs bar was also way understaffed way too close to midnight.
