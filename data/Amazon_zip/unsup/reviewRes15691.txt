Carnivale was great. I really had no genuine issues that would warrant less stars. My only quirk, just to get it out of the way, was that its kind of in the middle of nowhere. At least in my opinion. Now on to the food/service: Had an 8:30 reservation, showed up at 8, and was seated immediately. The waitress was extremely friendly, and VERY knowledgeable about not only the makeup of the menu items, but their origin as far as style (The cuisine is "Latin Fusion," which is really more Cuban/South American than anything Mexican.) They have a large selection of wines and a few solid beers. Best of all, they have a wine flight for $12 that is basically 3 almost full glasses, of your choice. On to the food: We got the Ropa Viejo appetize which I absolutely recommend. Its basically braised barbecue beef, queso cheese, on top of fried plantains. Unreal. I could've ate that as my meal. As for main course, I had the skirt steak (some spanish A word on the menu), which was cooked perfectly. Tender, flavorful, not fatty, the whole 9 yards. It came on a bed of red beans and rice which were nothing crazy, but fit perfectly with the steak and were absolutely enjoyable. My girlfriend got the Churrasco, which is a filet style steak, with Sweet potato puree. I don't know a ton of details but she loved it. Finally, i noticed before I went their facebook page offered $15 off your bill just for it being Thursday. Waiter added it without issue. Overall, the 5 star rating was more for the fact that they didn't mess up anywhere, and the food was delicious, as opposed for the decor being mindblowing.  I recommend to anyone.
