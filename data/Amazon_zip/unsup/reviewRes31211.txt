After hearing that there was an organic restaurant that opened up in the Bridgeport neighborhood (where I grew up) I just had to check it out. I think it was love at first sight. Not only was the place beautiful, but the staff was super friendly and helpful. The first time my boyfriend and I went to Nana's we had the pleasure of meeting the owner, Omar, and he explained to us the concept of Nana's, and I think that it's amazing what he has done for this community. But what about the food? My boyfriend and I consistently visit Nana's (at least once a week) after our first taste. I have to say, I've only ordered off the regular menu twice. After not ordering their special once, and not being able to order it the next week... I will never make that mistake again! Not only is their food delicious, it looks amazing, and it is so affordable for Gourmet Organic food! I'm a huge foodie myself, and I have easily paid $50 - $70 plates of food that didn't taste as good. My advice is, go for the specials if there is one. It will be the best decision you ever made! Also, go for DINNER! Their breakfast/lunch menu is great, but OMG their dinner specials are simply orgasmic! Go try this place before it gets discovered, because this place is truly a diamond in the rough!
