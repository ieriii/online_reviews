I've not been to many steakhouses in Chicago, but I have eaten my fair share of steaks. Ruth Chris's blue cheese crusted rib eye is just heaven. The salads are fresh, the mash potatoes are buttery and creamy. I could not ask for a better meal. The service is excellent and my experience here is always pleasurable.
