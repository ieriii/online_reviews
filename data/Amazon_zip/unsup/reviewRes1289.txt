I saw Hot Doug's on the food channel's "hot dog mecca's" show. I'm so glad I checked this place out. Some of the best variety of sausages anywhere and definitely with the best names. I mean, a "Dave Kingman" dog or a "Salma Hayek" (because the thing was "Hot!") The only thing I wasn't totally excited about was the Velveeta on my cheese fries, but even that seemed better than regular, sh*tty nacho cheese. Well worth the side trip if you like encased meats!
