I seriously recommend this place to everyone. And I've taken several first-timers there. For some reason people don't just happen upon it and decide to go in. Anyway, their oatmeal shakes really do knock my socks off. I've had several of their dishes (burrito, vegetarian sandwich, and some other things), but I almost always get the potato tacos with guacamole; they're just so damn tasty. I usually can't finish it all, so I'll have my leftovers for breakfast the next day. The servers are always friendly. It gets really busy during the summers, so there's sometimes a wait, but it's usually not longer than 15 minutes. Irazu is BYOB, so don't forget your beer/wine/whatever. A word of warning though: You won't get no fancy glasses to drink your beer or wine out of--it's all plastic tumblers. I'm cool with that, but I'm sure it could be a turnoff to some.
