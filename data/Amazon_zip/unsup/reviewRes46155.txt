I enjoyed my overall experience, although my waiter was a bit rude. My first experience was so great that I felt a need to return. My food was pretty good (jambalaya) and I wish I had gotten the apple pie again. I'd like to return for a date night with the hubby so he can split the pie with me because it's huge!
