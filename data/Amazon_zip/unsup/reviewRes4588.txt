My co-workers and I came here for lunch since we work in the neighborhood and have always wanted to try it out. We got here around 11:15am (they open at 11:30) so we waited outside until they opened. By the time 11:30 rolled around there were probably 12 people in line behind us! This place gets CRAZY packed- by the time it was noon the whole restaurant was filled. I would definitely suggest if you can get here right at 11:30am for lunch you'll be good :) Otherwise, welcome to the world of waiting for a restaraunt in Chicago... The food however was awesome! Each one of us ordered something different and we all loved our meals. I ordered the pork-shoulder which was amazing. I would definitely go back here again, I just don't know abou this whole waiting in line for over an hour... I love food, but not enough to wait for 2 hours!
