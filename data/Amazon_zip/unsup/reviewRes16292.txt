This is definitely a dining experience. The decor is awesome, very chic bar/lounge area outside and an incredibly colorful dining room. Carnivale, according to our server, is supposed to be a blend of all types of South American food. Did not get to sample a whole lot on the menu, but what I did have I enjoyed. The fish tacos were great, very tasty sauce and there was, to my surprise, actually a decent amount of fish in each taco. Homemade guac always deserves props. For my main course, I had the ribeye - highly recommend it. I asked our server what was better, the pork shoulder or pork chop - he claimed the pork chop. Then between pork chop and ribeye? He did not hesitate to go ribeye. I had a bite of a friend's pork chop, and the server was correct - ribeye all the way! One of the more surprising things about this place too was that when the bill came, it didn't hurt too much. Service probably could have been a little better, we waited a long time past our reservation, but this place is very cool and a great value. Definitely check it out, it's worth your while.
