My daughter took me here for a birthday present, and it was one of the best presents I've ever had. The music was fantastic. The wait staff was friendly and efficient. I, personally, like the fact that they try to keep the noise down during the performances. I want to hear the music. We got there early for good seats and were able to enjoy conversation before the show and in between (three) sets. Chilled during the music. Would love to go back again when I'm in Chicago.
