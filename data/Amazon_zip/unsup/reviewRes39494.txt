I don't know if there is better Korean BBQ in Chicago like some say, but this San Soo Gab San fits in perfectly on my 5 star yelp! We were greeted a quickly seated at 3 AM, a table of 5. After a few minutes of perusing the extensive menu, we ordered. 5 entrees brings with it about 100,000 little side dishes of varying little deliciousnesses. It's a trip to try them all, finding ones you really dig, and ones you don't. Then they bring fire to the table, and your meats which you get to cook right there at the table yourself. All this while drinking extra large Korean beers mind you. They were nice enough to make a dish without meat for my beautiful vegetarian girlfriend. Turns out she was eating it wrong, and the waitress, who are often described here as rude, came over and helped her out. It was quite funny. Any who, if its 3 am, you're on the north side, you have a car (they have a parking lot), and you don't feel like waiting in line at some fast food joint, this place should be on your short list! I will return!
