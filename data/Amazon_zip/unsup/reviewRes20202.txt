Breakfast! This is my breakfast review. I will write again when I go back for lunch without speaking about the breakfast pastires, going to Xoco for the hot chocolate alone is worth the trip! I nearly cried tears of nostalgia because his hot chocolate tasted so much like the hand ground hot chocolate that my grandmother used to make growing up...I had the Almendrado, which is a chocolate shot with almond milk. YUMMY! Okay, onto breakfast pastries. I had the Vanilla sour coffeecake and the toasted bolillo. The coffeecake was GREAT. Not overly sweet, even though there is a streusal topping. Very light, airy, and not too rich, which is great because the Almendrado needs to go with something not too sweet or overpowering. Great pairing! I also had the Toasted bolillo, but not tasted. This looks much better than it tastes! it looks rather plain, but packs in a lot of flavor without being too dense.  I'm going back for another breakfast, gonna make my way through all of Rick's wonderful food...
