You are definitely paying for location here. I would say that this is a pretty standard hotel that happens to be in the middle of Michigan. I wasn't taken back by the lobby although the lounge was neat when we stayed. It's under renovation now. The rooms aren't over the top and the desk service is hit and miss. I would stay at the Hyatt.
