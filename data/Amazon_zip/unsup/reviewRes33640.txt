OK, so clealy Yolk doesn't need any more glowing reviews. However, I want to highlight one important detail that may make it easier for newcomers to stick it out for this place after they see the massive waiting line: It goes FAST. Seriously. Rick and I came in at peak Sunday brunch time, and were in and out in 40 minutes. Not that you can't have a leisurely meal - you can, albeit a loud one. But it's always nice to have your food less than 10 minutes after you order, when you're expecting it to take ages. Of the food, I will just say that the Eggs Florentine is killer, as are the breakfast potatoes. One small request: Add some vegan breakfast meats, please!
