A friend and I swung by Hopleaf before heading to Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind at the Neo Futurarium around the corner. Having heard great things for ages, I was excited and immediately gravitated towards the beer list. And delicious beer was had. Flemish sour ale, framboise, and doppelbock. Oh! And they have mead. Mead! It ain't just for renaissance re-enactors, people! So, a few downsides to the evening. First of all, the company. Competition for a table was cut-throat and evidently a pair of women totally stared down my friend while she waited for me and the rest of our party to arrive. Yeesh. Secondly? The food. I wish I hadn't eaten beforehand and had an appetite for the moules frites. This said, I nibbled off my friend's plate of Montreal brisket and fried onion straws... and got super, super ill later. She and I both felt a little woozy after the ludicrously oily, salty frites and onion loaf and were more than thankful to settle into our seats at the show soon after. You've heard of bars over-salting their food to entice you into buying more drinks? This brings that to a new level. Major plus, though: absolutely foxy "bouncers." I put that in quotes because I could've sat on these guys and killed them. But, uh, mee-ow.
