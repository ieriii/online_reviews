When I think of Chicago Deep Dish, this is the first place that comes to mind. Giordanos has a number of locations across the city, and everyone one of them is serving it up right (I'm reviewing this particular location because this was the last one I visited.) I'll be honest, I've never really had anything here besides the pizza, so if you're looking for an in depth review of that, you may have to read someone elses review. Of course, why would you go to a pizza joint and not get pizza? Especially when their pizza is as good as it is. I'm a personal fan of the sausage they have in their pizza. Is not like the kind you see at dominos or pizza hut in those little balls, no, it's the real deal cut from a link kind of sausage. People rave about Giordanos and Gino's East when it comes to deep dish. If you have to decide between the two, rock Giordanos, you won't be disappointed.
