I know it's unhealthy but I can't stop myself from getting the Flaming Cheese for my appetizer every time I go there. I'm not a big greek food buff but I do enjoy it from time to time and of the places in greektown, this is my favorite place so far. Their daily specials are great and I generally end up getting whichever lamb special they have. Please try it out, I think you'll love it!
