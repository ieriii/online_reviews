Tong-Dak (Korean: fried chicken) is very popular anju (Korean: snack or appetizers often served in bars) in Korean bars, and a joint's reputation is often made by the strength of its offerings on these little guys. Crisp's interpretation of tong-dak is very good... almost on par with the best of them, and how they've expanded the sauces/marinades from traditional offerings (either dry or sweet-hot sauce) really takes them another notch. "Seoul Sassy" is my favorite here, and I'd ask for a little side of their BBQ sauce (fairly spicy) as dipping. My only gripe is that they have not yet perfected the art of having every piece come out to have consistent done-ness level -- I've found that the drumsticks were cooked perfect and moist, while the breast was pretty dry. The two guys (Jay at the counter, Doug mostly doing the expediting) were talkative and their banters with the customers definitely adds to 'eating out in my hood' experience, and they're very accomodating with special requests (glass of water, taste of sauce, etc.). You can trust food coming out of the kitchen being ran by guys like this. The bowl and the wraps is... well, roughly speaking, similar to the burrito bowl and burrito deals you might be accustomed to from Chipotle, except it's Korean fillings -- can't go wrong with that! I enjoyed the communal style dining set up (big table with benches), the myriad Asian sodas and drink offerings, and playful decor -- but wasn't so hot on the 80's hair metal bands on rotation. (Minor gripe... and let's face it -- who hasn't really had experience of following along the chorus of a Bon Jovi song or two?) Thanks, Doug and Jay!
