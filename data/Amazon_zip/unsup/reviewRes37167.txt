The food is incredible here! Unusual flavor combinations make for a luxurious meal, and their wine and beer selections are also great! My friend and I ordered the steak frites and mushroom crepes and split the entrees - perfect pairing, and even had room for dessert. We were stuffed, but the portions really weren't outrageous and though the establishment is pricey, it's worth every last penny. The atmosphere is casual, but perfect for a romantic meal, or dinner with friends. The wait staff was surprisingly helpful and friendly; it seems like such a rarity these days! Even when it was completely packed and people were shoulder-to-shoulder waiting in the bar area, we only waited 15 minutes of the half hour to 45 minutes the hostess estimated. Hopleaf, you exceeded all my expectations and I will definitely be back for more!
