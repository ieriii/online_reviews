Great contemporary Pan-Asian food with Latin inspiration! Our server was friendly and energetic, and almost everything we had was delicious! Some of the food was a little on the greasy/salty side (i.e. the green pepper appetizer) but items like the Brussel Sprout Salad and the Oxtail pot stickers had great, unique flavor! We made a reservation through OpenTable and I'm glad we did because the place was packed! The restaurant itself is very loud, so it's not the ideal spot if you;re seeking relaxed atmosphere or quiet conversation... but if you're looking for a fun night out with friends or your significant other, this would be a great choice! (Lots of eye-candy, too.... patrons and waitstaff alike.) :)
