Where to start? How about this...Anteprima is the poster child for mediocre faux-Italian restaurants that seem to have peppered the landscape of North Side neighborhoods in the past 5 or so years. I give this restaurant 1 star because the maitre'd was very helpful and polite to us when no one else seemed to give a crap. The appetizer platter we ordered mirrored so many of the milquetoast school picnics I frequented as a child...mushy, bland pasta salad creations that all tasted the same, underripe olives, and not a hint of seasoning to be found! Most of the entrees were sold out when we ordered at 8 p.m.(!), and the orrichiette with boar sausage tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 3 hours. The service was dismissive and forgetful, the decor confused, the food overpriced. Nothing about this restaurant was redeemable except for that poor maitre'd.
