A friend and I went in for lunch, and see what all the fuss was about. We were seated quickly, and the service was fast and polite. However, the food was terrible. I ordered tostados, which were greasy and left me feeling sick for the rest of the day. They were covered in so much shredded lettuce and sour cream, that I wasn't sure if I even had any meat on them! Yuck. I won't be going back.
