Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but my rice noodle soup with seafood was just mediocre. Sure, the spring rolls and the egg rolls were decent, but nothing extraordinary. And what's with the staff rushing the customers out the moment they put down the utensils??  Nevertheless, dinner at Tank satisfied my chilly, drizzly night craving for a brothy noodle dish. Had it not been for a comfortable car-ride to and from Uptown (a far, far away land from downtown via CTA), I probably would have regretted choosing to eat here that night.
