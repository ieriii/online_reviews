Amazing. Innovative and fun! The service was impeccable. At the end of the night, they offered me a pashmina wrap when I was feeling chilly! I really enjoyed the down to earth attitude of the waitstaff. I've been to all the other top restaurants in Chicago, and received the best service here by far. The food was great- very different. I felt quite full once we got to the 17th course, but luckily my date finished it for me! The wine offering is extensive as well. We had a 1988 Echezeaux and a 2003 Puligny-Montrachet Cru which was AMAZING. I loved the atmosphere too. Very "Inspector Gadget". If you have VIP clients to entertain, or something big to celebrate, I highly recommend!
