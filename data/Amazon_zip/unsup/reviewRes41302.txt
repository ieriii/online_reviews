After living in Uptown for almost 2.5 years, I am embarrassed to say I never visited Tank Noodle until 2 months ago! I am rather picky when it comes to my meals, so I honestly believed I would not find anything on the menu to suit my tastes. I could not have been MORE wrong!! Their menu is huge.....they probably have about 300 dishes!! I ordered a spicy chicken and rice dish and let's just say I almost fainted from both the spiciness and deliciousness!! Not only was the food really good, but the dish itself was HUGE! I had to go back home and lay down because I stuffed myself....thank goodness I only live a block away. My joke about this place is that I "ate like a tank," and you will, too, guaranteed! Whether you are a picky eater or someone who loves all types of food, GO TO TANK NOODLE. This is undoubtedly a secret treasure of Uptown.
