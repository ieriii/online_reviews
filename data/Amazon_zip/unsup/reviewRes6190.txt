My first visit to Wildfire was not memorable, having ordered a burger I was not impressed. The service was however very good. Having just tried Wildfire again last night, I have to say it was much better! Their French Onion soup has a great depth of flavor, and the Ribeye Medallions were great. I also had a side of potatoes au gratin, which was a bit greasy but still tasted good. Their desserts are very good.  The decor of the restaurant is very comforting, making it a great experience for the wintertime.
