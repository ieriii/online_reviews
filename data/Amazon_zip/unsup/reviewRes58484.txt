My husband and I were craving crepes in our new Andersonville neighborhood. We read the reviews about Icosium that basically all say good food, bad service, so we went in expecting that. The food was, indeed, delicious and reasonably priced. The service was actually terrific! Full disclosure - we went for a late lunch at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon. We were seated immediately, our order taken promptly, and the food arrived shortly thereafter. We didn't wait around for the check, but we weren't rushed out either. It was a lovely experience and we're looking forward to returning.
