My first official yelp as a Chicago-an! Piece had great beer and good pizza. Recommended by our brew-master friend we came and drank 4 varieties of their micro brews. Delicious! They pizza was great too. It was not traditional deep dish but still equally as good and tasty. I could have done without all the tv screens blaring sports games and our service was nice but not entirely attentive. However, definitely a solid four stars.
