I can't wait to go back and sample more! This place probably does not need my review, it was packed and is very popular! The chicken in walnut sauce was out of this world and the appetizers that we ordered were great. The service was great too! Good persian food, a bit on the pricey side though compared to others and other byobs. They have a full beer and wine list too.
