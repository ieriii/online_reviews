I love W Hotels and try to stay at them when I can. The W Chicago Lakeshore is located right on Lake Michican (well, across the street from it) and has the typical W feel and vibe. It appears as if this was an older property that was converted into a W Hotel a while back. Not the coolest or newest of W properties that I've stayed at, but when I'm back in Chicago I'll stay at the W Chicago Lakeshore again (or check out its sister property, W City Center).
