I've now been to Cafe 28 3 times (or tres veces for the Spanish speakers), once for brunch and twice for dinner. While the food was excellent for brunch, the service that day was lacking. You can see Kate W's 2/27/2010 review for more, as I was her dining companion on that occasion. The service was better for both dinners. Dinner 1, had the Papas Rellenas appetizer, which was very good. Entree? Nothing memorable either way. Dinner 2, cup of soup (good) and Cuban Roast Pork (very good). The server also recommended a very nice bottle of wine for the table. The service seemed a tad slow, but may have just been "relaxed" and seemed slow to us because we had to be someplace. All in all, Cafe 28 is a nice place. Good food, nice atmosphere. The menu isn't huge but there should be something on it to please everyone, even picky boyfriends. Prices are a little on the high end, but then this is a nice restaurant, not a taco stand. Service can be a tad hit or miss, from my experience, but is more hit than miss so far. I'll definitely be back. Voy a volver.
