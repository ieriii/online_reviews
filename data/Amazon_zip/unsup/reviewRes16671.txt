Rewind back to 2007: This place is my favorite Indian restaurant. Fast forward to 2010: Meh, not so much. I came here over the weekend to devour my oh-so-favorite papdi chat and crab curry. Just the thought of it makes me drool like a dog, and India House always has done these two dishes best. The papdi chat ($5.50) was definitely up to par and was extremely delicious. The four accompanying chutneys were also scrumptious. The crab curry?? Meh, not so good. Very disappointing. The curry was extremely bland with scant crab. Tasted like it was reheated. Definitely not worth $20.95. It just isn't the same like it was back in the day. The service was S..............L........................O.........................W. It took 45 minutes from the time we ordered to when our entrees came out. For "reheated" curry? Unacceptable. Minus one star for service. Minus one star for bland curry. Average.
