I know I know... Many of you are going to see my review and immediately think, "ONLY 3 STARS?! Get this crazy broad a Thorazine!" I ordered Pequod's for my friends as a "thank you for helping me move in muggy weather" present with very high hopes, especially since they were picked as Food Network Magazine's best pizza of Illinois. We ordered a thin crust with spinach, shrooms, and onions and a pan crust pizza with just cheese. I was taken aback by the high price ($42! Gah!) for only two pizzas. My only thought on the caramelized crust on the pan was "eh". I ended up liking the thin crust veggie one more, especially since they had a good topping to sauce ratio (lots of toppings! not too much sauce.) I'm definitely willing to give this place another shot, especially for some deep dish pizza.
