This place is a guilty pleasure of mine. Its an upsized Cheesecake Factory, as if that was really necessary, there are crowds, tourists, encyclopedic menu, crazy portion sizes.  Despite all that, this place has become one of my old standbys. The benefit is, if you have a large group of people everyone can find something they like. Even of there are only two of you, if you can't or don't want to decide what cuisine you want, you can come here and get pretty much any type of food you like, and its all decent. Now, I have to skip dinner tonight because I went here for lunch today and had appetizers, the Cajun steak and the carrot cake, which was a sick amount of food. I was so full I had to walk back to the loop in the heat to work try to work some of it off.
