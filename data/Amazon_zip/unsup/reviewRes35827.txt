Had reservations for 10, and table was waiting for us when we got there. It's a large space, and every table was filled. We thought it was a regular BYOB, so we brought beer and liquor, but we were informed by the host that it was a $2 per bottle of beer uncorkage fee and a $5 per bottle of liquor, so we ditched our beer back in the car and ordered some of the beer off the menu to go along with our liquor. It took awhile to get a servers attention, and we probably had to ask about 4 times to 4 different servers before we could get ice and glasses for our beverages. But once that was all out of the way, dinner was great. We ordered several beef, chicken, tofu, and noodle dishes, but the capper was the Peking Duck. We ordered a couple of ducks, and the server carved it up at our table. With the duck comes buns, and later duck soup, rice and noodles. The duck was good, and we polished it off handily. The service here is a bit slow, but not bad for a restaurant this size. Prices are very reasonable (total bill pre-tip for 10 was $150). Portions are good, and everyone was stuffed when we left. I would say all of the dishes we tried other than the duck were average to above average, but the duck is the reason we came here and it didn't disappoint. This place is suited well for small parties and larger parties alike. Overall a good experience. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other dishes... and more duck.
