I lived at 1260 n Dear born for year's lived at the third coast I first started going there in the early nineties. Hands down the hippest coffee and late night spot in Chicago. The Coronation chicken salad on french bread has been outstanding, never changing their ingredients. They never got cheap with ingredients. Some of my happiest memories in Chicago were there, eating ,drinking coffee, and playing chess. until the wee hours of the morning. Cheers, E.L.
