The food was amazing, and the portions plentifully. The three stars is for the ambiance (pretty loud), the HORRIBLE ventilation (you WILL smell like meat and smoke when you leave), and the service. We had so many different people come to our table that we were confused as to who to ask when we needed something. The night ended with us having to hound down someone who would a) respond to us and b) give us our check. Definitely not happy about that. We also began to run out of room for all the plates of food they brought. At one point we had like 15 small round dishes of stuff - totally could have put it all on one platter!!! So if you're patient and don't mind the bad service, the food is definitely worth it. If this is your first time, let the server show you how to cook the different meats. They are experts and it will make your meal so much more enjoyable. One last thing - the parking lot holds like six cars, and it is a VERY tight squeeze, especially if you have a bigger car. I would highly suggest you take the Western bus or car pool if possible.
