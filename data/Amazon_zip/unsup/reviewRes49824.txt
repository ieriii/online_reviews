Had walked by Las Tablas during the summer, smelled the wonderful scents coming from the place and decided we had to try it. Finally went last night w/ the hubby and daughter to celebrate my birthday.  It was a Monday evening so we were seated right away and service was exceptional the whole evening, very attentive and informative.  We started with the pitcher of sangria (no longer half priced on Mondays) but still very good - not at all watered down. Then ordered the empanada combination plate - 2 cheese, 2 chicken and 2 beef, and they were very, very good. The two sauces were very tasty, not 100% sure what all was in both but one had jalapeo and cilantro, the other was more parsley based. The entrana (grilled skirt steak) was really, really tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked exactly to our specifications - medium rare. The sides were all (as discussed in many of the other reviews) really, really dry. Our daughter is a vegetarian and had the paella - rice with lots of good veggies and good flavor which she enjoyed. Flan was coconut based (not my favorite) and drizzled with cherry sauce (love cherries but not on flan). So the only reason I didn't go 5 stars are three very slight negatives 1) the dry sides, 2) the flan not being in keeping with my expectation of good caramely flan and 3) the bathrooms being way out of the way - which as someone else mentioned in their review would be fine if you haven't had a pitcher of sangria! Not sure how'd they'd manage to rearrange them though and the 'living room' arrangement on the way to the loo was quite nice. Overall it was a good night - would we go from the southwest suburbs to the north side just to visit Las Tablas, not likely. But when in the area, we'd absolutely go again.
