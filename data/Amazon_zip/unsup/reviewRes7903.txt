The place seems so unassuming, but serves up some very, very tasty pizza. We got right in on a Tuesday night and there were only a few people here. A good mix of families and couples. White or regular- take your pick. We both had traditional pizza (with red sauce.) He had the Salsiccia, which I found good, but not very exciting. I had the Diavola which offered some awesome spice and lots of flavor. The wine list here's pretty good- and our waitress really knew her stuff. I wasn't blown away by the wines we got, but the pizza made up for it. Oh and don't skip dessert- we had the Tartufo, which is like chocolate custard rolled in cocoa powder and a bunch of something (seemed malted- not quite sure what it was) at the core. Yum!
