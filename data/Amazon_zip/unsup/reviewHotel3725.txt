The rooms here are nice, really nice. Great style, great bath products, amazing mini bar and snacks - repeat, amazing mini bar and snacks. Bed is super comfy and you get about 8 pillows. Great views of the city, just be sure you close both sets of blinds/per window to avoid giving the surrounding buildings a peep show. Went to the rooftop bar a few years ago and the drinks and apps were great, but i can't comment now if this is still the case. Everyone who works here is really buttoned up, nice and helpful. The elevator situation is a bit confusing, but who cares. I think the price per night is actually pretty generous.
