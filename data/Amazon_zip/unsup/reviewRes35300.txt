Recently went to Sun Wah with a couple of friends (That is to say, they're a couple). I was third-wheeling it (woot). The room is sort of cafeteria-like, in that it is essentially a large, open room, packed with tables, which are in turn packed with the many, many people anxiously awaiting delectable duck dinners. It's pretty noisy, and you're pretty close to other tables. If I hadn't already annihilated any semblance of intimacy at my own table by crashing my friends' date, I imagine that it would not feel very...cozy/personal/intimate anyway. Still, they manage to provide you with a genuine dining "experience." it's memorable, and with a table side carving, they really do make it special. Besides, a restaurant full of happily bubbling patrons is a good sign that you're in the right place--you get the sense that people are excited to be there. Service was pretty slow, really, but it's so hard to CARE when they've delivered the amazing cuisine (and also just because they're nice people, and the place was PACKED). We split the duck dinner (I won't rehash it again--it seems it's received plenty of explanation here, as well as on Sun Wah's website), some sticky, foamy, taco-shell shaped things, and brought our own wine and beer. Wow. Just wow. What a great meal. If you like meat, and particularly duck, you absolutely cannot go wrong here. They're doing something pretty special, and it is worth a trip.
