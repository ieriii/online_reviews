Sushi places are popping up like crazy all over the city, so I depend on yelp to let me know where to go. Well, Wakamono stands out and I would highly recommend. Good date spot. Note: There are 2 doors. One for the bar and one for the restaurant. I did not know this so if you walk into the bar area, don't be immediately worried of the dinginess. The restaurant area is nothing like this. Appetizers sound delicious but we went with the usual... edamame and seaweed salad. The house blend for the seaweed salad was very refreshing and not store bought. Good start with the complimentary soybeans that are glazed with a teriyaki type sauce. *wakamono roll 16 - lightly torch-seared tuna & salmon over shrimp tempura, unagi, spicy sauce, daikon sprouts -A fatty roll, big pieces of lightly seared fish on top. Be aware for ppl with fears of 'raw' fish. This is not your typical Cali roll. *kani chung roll 12 -king crab, tempura crumbs over spicy albacore tuna, torched asparagus, unagi sauce, toasted sesame -One of their most popular rolls, this was very good with the crumbled lump crag on top but I thought the albacore tuna had a weird color. This would bother some, but it tasted phenomenal. *godzilla roll 14 - shrimp tempura, crab, avocado, cream cheese, spicy unagi sauce, tempura crumbs, wasabi mayo, scallion -The combination of spicy unagi sauce and wasabi mayo gave this a slight kick that was quite delicious. One of our favorites of the night. Dale Levitski was seated next to us, so I figure with all the choices for sushi in this area and a Top Chef runner up chooses this place, then it says something. Food was excellent and will be back.
