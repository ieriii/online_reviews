2.5 stars -- 3 minus 0.5 for the price/quality ratio. I went for breakfast. The savory empanadas were good enough. The French Toast was also good. Food ans service were okay, but we ended paying 40 dollars for a small-to-medium size breakfast for two, and we felt we overpayed for the quality/quantity of what we got.
