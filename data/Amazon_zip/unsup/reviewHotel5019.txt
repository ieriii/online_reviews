For the price and previous ratings, I expected to have a nice relaxing time at the W. I was there for a wedding, and I have traveled to Chicago many times before, but this was my first time staying at the W. First, there is no direct shuttle for guests from Midway or O'Hare. Second, there are 4 elevators for 33 floors so there is ALWAYS a long wait (at least 10 minutes) for a lift. Third, the cleaning staff came to clean my room at 9am on a Saturday morning and never came back to clean, replenish towels, or make the beds. Forth, was charged for mini bar items that neither I, nor my guest, used. Fifth, when I checked in around 1130pm the previous Friday, there was a very loud music in the lobby lounge making it nearly impossible to hear the receptionist tell me where my room was, nor was there anyone there to help with my bag. Lots of negatives for the "5-star" hotel. However, there were times where the staff redeemed itself: The strap to my heel broke and I was able to call the concierge to get super glue to fix it, and the valet hailed a cab for me and helped load my bags. Also, after contacting the managers regarding the extraneous charges, they did reimburse me. However, if given the option to stay here again I would rather stay at one of the hotels down the street a few blocks down where I've stayed there before and had much better service
