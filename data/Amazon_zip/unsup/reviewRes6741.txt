I tried again as the family likes the place and maybe I just have an aversion to BBQ, but I liked my meal less than the first time. Went Ribs this time hoping that their competition style would bring me back in line with the rest of you. In the end, they too let me down. The service was still top notch and for that I cannot complain.
