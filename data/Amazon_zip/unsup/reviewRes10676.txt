So I tried again because the owner was kind enough to contact me after the "less than stellar" experience I had on my first visit. Here's my bullet-ed update for easy reading: - The service was hands down excellent. But being a cynic, I may have to attribute this to the fact that our reservation had lots of stars and "yelp-control" next to it. Regardless, this does indicate that Piece cares about their customers' opinions (a refreshing rarity) and that perhaps next time I come in as a regular schmuck the service will be equally great. - The beer was just as yummy as my first visit. I will again briefly sing the praises of their micro brews: it felt like an explosion of beer-goodness on my tongue with a perfect balance of sweet malts and bitter hops (and all that other beer-lingo that makes me sound like I know what I'm talking about). The beer is damn good. enough said. - The pizza was much better than our first visit, no burnt parts and the combination was especially delicious (artichokes, tomatoes, and chicken on the "white" pizza). So my next excursion to Piece will most likely occur on a Sunday evening for their pizza and growler deal - sounds delish!
