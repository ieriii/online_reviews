Brunch with the ladies. To sum it up, tasty but pricey. We got there really early knowing that it gets packed. 9:30 was just perfect, because by 10 the line started. I had the BLT benedict which was really tasty. Plenty of food - lots of potatoes and two servings of the benedict. I ended up taking half home (which, not surprising does not reheat all that well.) My friends had the traditional eggs benedict, one of the breakfast burritos, and we shared one red velvet pancake. With our coffee the bill came to nearly $50 for three people (I'm not used to Chicago prices, clearly.). We learned a valuable lesson - if you want to try one pancake (which they offer up) know that the one pancake will cost 75% of what a full stack would be. So our one pancake was close to $6 when we could've had a full stack for $9.50. Ouch. It was yum though. I likely wouldn't go back, but am glad I tried it once.
