I was behind two other groups of people who had just entered the door before me. Once each group was seated I was denied a table and told that the restaurant closes at 2:00pm. (It was now only a minute after 2:00pm). I had another table of friends at the restaurant and their waitress was going to allow me to sit with them and order but the owner came running over to the table and said I already told her No. Even though another couple was just being sat at the bar and handed menus at the same moment I was still denied service.I have always loved this restaurant in the past and have sent so many people in who are now regulars but after this discriminatory act which I was told is Nothing Personal I will not be back and will ask my friends to also abandon the Bongo Room because of the poor customer service.
