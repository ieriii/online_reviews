The ribs were really good. 13 dollars for a full rack of ribs, salad and a side pasta. Yeah you can't beat that for dinner. So tender and good, one of the best places in Andersonville...so far. The service was great plus they give you more than enough butter than you need for the bread.... talk about the way to my heart. My only complaint was I didn't care for the BBQ sauce on the side. I prefer something more smokey and this sauce was sweeter. Not really my favorite. So I left that alone and the ribs were still really good. At that price you can't beat it.
