Oh how I wanted to enjoy my stay at this historical Chicago hotel. I really hate to write a negative review of this place, but I call it like I see it. My wife booked our room on http://priceline.com. That was probably our first mistake. We ended up getting a room that was fit for a stowaway on the Titanic. Our section of the hotel must have been undergoing renovations, because it was dark, dingy and not well maintained. Our room was small with a beautiful view of the fire escape and alley. To make matters worse, they gouge you for a $10 fee to use the fitness room. Not cool at all. I'm sure the Palmer house was the picture of elegance in the 50's. Unfortunately, the part of the hotel they stuck us in was dingy, poorly lit and outdated. I guess they treat their http://priceline.com customers differently. I doubt if I would ever book another room or even recommend the hotel to my out of town friends. Yes! It was that bad.
