Nothing went wrong here but I will still try to visit all the different restaurants in Greektown...This definitely may make the top five I'm guessing. The best gyro I ever had, very good sagnaki, great spanikopita. The atmosphere is busy yet not distracting- servers are knowledgeable and polite. Prices aren't bad but I would definitely recommend trying different things especially the spanakopita.
