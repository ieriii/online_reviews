As always their food is amazing. The bread is always fresh, the pasta has the perfect bite and the sauce the perfect slip.  I have no complaints except for tonight. My friends and I paid in combination cash and cards and while we should have asked for change we assumed our server would bring it back. She pocketed the $80 which would have given her a 50% tip! We had to ask for out change back. Sorry that's just me griping but seriously? On the plus side when I asked for the wait time for tonight there was an hour and forty five minute wait. That wait was cut to zero when a manager tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I wouldn't mind sitting on the pation which they just opened seeing as the rain had stopped. Score! Aside from that over the more than 10 years I've been here, I have always had great service and excellent food!
