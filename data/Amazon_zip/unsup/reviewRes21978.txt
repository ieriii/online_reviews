I went here today with my boyfriend. The food was amazing. I order the Mediterranean chicken, which was a little dry, but the rice on the side was amazing. My boyfriend practically inhaled his food. We ordered baklava as a dessert, and it had to be one of the best things I ever ate. The wait staff here was unbelievable. They seated us at a four top and promptly removed the extra settings in a very polite manner. The busser made sure I always had water and cleared everything quickly. Our waiter was hard to understand but funny and helpful sometimes. We are planning on going back next time he's in town. (:
