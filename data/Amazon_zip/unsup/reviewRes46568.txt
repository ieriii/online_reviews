Funny thing was I heard great things about their food, but that prob got them a two. The atmosphere of this place is what made me enjoy it. From the pictures on the walls to the hilarious menu captions we really enjoyed eating here. Hell I guess its your usually Clark/Lincoln Park Restaurant: They don't need good food to get people in the door so they don't care. Darn it all to heck!!
