This place, with its many locations across the Chicagoland area, never fails to please. I've been to a few of them, and they are always consistent. Right down to the handwriting on the menus. This time we had the bruschetta (amazing,) and I had the rigatoni dei sardi, which was cooked in a delicious red sauce, and had mushrooms and sausage. No matter what pasta I ever get here, it's always great. For dessert, we tried the tiramisu. I'm by no means versed in the ways of tiramisu, but it was nevertheless delicious. We were, however, wishing they would turn up the air. Being the middle of August, and after a couple glasses of wine, it got a little warm. Very minor complaint.
