Rick Bayless, you never cease to amaze me. I have been to Frontera for brunch and dinner, and both meals were fantastic. Like Topolobampo, the ingredients were so fresh and the flavor combinations were amazing in every dish. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and the service was good. I really wish I liked tequila, because the margaritas looked awesome. With Rick Bayless' extensive background in Mexican culture, all of his food is extremely authentic and makes you look at Mexican food in a completely different light. Keep in mind to make reservations extremely far in advance for dinner, especially for a Friday or Saturday.
