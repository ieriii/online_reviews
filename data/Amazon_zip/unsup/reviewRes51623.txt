Oh, Garcia's, how I love you. I have never wanted to eat anything else but the cheese quesadillas, and they leave me happy every time. The margaritas are really what I go there for, because I pitcher (of regular flavored, other flavors are more) is only $22, and they do not skimp on the tequila! I prefer frosted to on the rocks, but either way, you can't go wrong! And they have possibly the best "while you wait chips" I've ever had.
