This place rocks. It's a old-fashioned drive in with the works...good hot dogs, burgers, even the fish sandwich is worth it. I also really like the vanilla shakes. This is the place to be on a lazy late night, ordering food from your car and enjoying it sans seatbelt. The drive-in aspect really adds to it as the servers bring it to your window. Come without thinking about calories and enjoy.
