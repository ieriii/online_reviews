The prix-fixe dinner was very good - there is no ala carte option. Enough choices to satisfy a range of diners. We were promptly seated and attended to. The room is intimate and attractive and quiet enough for conversation. My Ono fish was too salty, but everything else was solid. The Mint salad was very clever and tasty. Our server could not have been more attentive or helpful. She guided me expertly through the menu and I was quite satisfied. I did not see any mention of a wine pairing on the menu, but I may have missed it - our server offered it to us verbally. My dining companion and I sampled some of the wines and sadly in this area we were not impressed. The white wine was served much too cold which muted its taste to blandness and the reds were simply not on par with the excellence of the food. I truly enjoyed my dinner, but the restaurant needs to take the reins of the wine program and ratchet it up several notches to make the pairings worthy companions to the dishes.
