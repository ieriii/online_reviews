We come here often for brunch, as it's walking distance from our home. The service is great, and the only day we ever have to wait, is on sundays. I adore their drink menu...an almond latte-esque drink is divine, and another cappuccino drink that comes with a shot of rum...deliscious. Sometimes im underwhelmed by their food. But overall a good spot.
