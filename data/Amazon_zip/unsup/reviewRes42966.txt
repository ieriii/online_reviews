What do you do when you have a craving for pizza and your friend is in the mood for chicken? Go to Fogo ASAP. Friday night we both had a hankering for something different and then I remembered this place specialized in chicken and pizza. Sounds like an odd combo, but it fit us just fine. She got the chicken and it was great. Really tasty, grilled well, the skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. Plus she got a quarter and they gave her two breats pieces which isnt typical. The black beans on the side were good too, they were really think, almost stew-like. I got the pizza; a slice of Margerita to be exact. The flavors were good, very thin for Chicago standards but not enought for me. It was well done, but somehow it was a little soggy..maybe from sitting out for awhile. Im really picky about pizza crispiness, so it probably wont be an issue for most. You could tell the ingredients were fresh and good quality. I'm excited to try all the interesting pizza combos and toppings on the menu!! Also, the owner is super nice and friendly and there are personal family pics on the walls. Just gives it a nice atmosphere although beware the place is super tiny and best suited for take out.
