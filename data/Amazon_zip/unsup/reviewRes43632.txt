This review is a bit biased-- it was my birthday on 11/11/11 and after dinner, my boyfriend proposed to me. I was already in a great mood, so Kinzie would have to mess up pretty badly to screw up my dinner. Luckily, they did a great job. Service was stellar-- they were polite and helpful without being intrusive. My boyfriend made a reservation and noted that it's my birthday. They called to confirm and asked if there is anything they could do for us. They ended up giving us a great table, an intimate and spacious booth tucked away in a little corner. The food was delicious. I had the prime rib and ate the entire thing. They give you a selection of sauces and they are unlimited. I've never had that touch at a steakhouse, and it was certainly appreciated. At the end of dinner, they brought out a complimentary birthday flourless chocolate cake. I left the restaurant practically waddling.
