I'm sitting here trying to think of something to complain about and I can't. We went to the Saturday Underground very recently and EVERYTHING was fantastic: service was attentive without being overbearing, and every course was amazing.  My memory is already fading, but standout courses included 1) the amuse, just one bite that contained several things including fish and house-made mustard, 2) lobster bisque with just a touch of spiciness and a piece of lobster tempura on the side, 3) crab-stuffed quail with quinoa with fig and french mushrooms of some incredible sort on the side and 4) a plate of 6 types of dessert, about 2 bites each, that made me wish I could always order 2 bites of every dessert on a dessert menu. Only the salad was unremarkable, but only in comparison to the other courses. Really, it was amazing. The caliber of food and service make the Underground well worth the $65/person for 5 courses. We appreciated being able to bring our own wine, and they earned the $5 corkage fee by constantly keeping our glasses full.
