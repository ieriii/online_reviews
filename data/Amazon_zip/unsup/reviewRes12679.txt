I love this place! I have been twice, once on my birthday and again on Valentine's Day. The food is amazing, the service is impeccable. The servers always treat me like I have some crazy amount of money or something, I'm not sure what it is, but I feel like royalty when I dine here. They are very attentive to your every dining need. The salad bar is amazing. There is an additional bar with lobster bisque, rice, black beans/bacon, and other delectables. There is a huge glass wall with row upon row of wine bottles. I am not a wine person. But, I enjoy watching the Wine Aerialist do flips and acrobatics with a harness in front of the wine bottles. Dinner and a show, it's pretty neat. The upstairs level is for private parties, and some extra over-flow seating. The bathrooms are upstairs, they have a goregous stairwell going past the wine wall, or an elevator to get to the bathrooms. Aside from the private party area is a private bar. I envision having my wedding here. But I'm not willing to spend the extra $50pp for an open bar so I will only book if they let me bring my own liquor... Will repost with the update on this subject. I definitely recommend this for a nice dinner out. It has been fantastic both times I have dined here. I would say it is comparable to Fogo de Chao, but waaay better than Brazzaz.
