Great neighborhood place. Excellent service. One of the biggest beer menus I've seen in this city comparable only to Hop Leaf. We went on a Friday night and waited about 20 minutes for a table. Enjoyed the laid back atmosphere at the bar. Bartenders were prompt and definitely went the extra mile to pour a beer correctly (for example, despite the fact that the bar was packed I watched one bartender take about 5 minutes to pour a Peche Lambic to avoid extra foam). I'm not huge on beer but that was a definite thumbs up in my book. I had a pear martini which was excellent. The service was excellent. The place is great- not pretentious at all. Very comfortable. The food was surprisingly VERY good. I don't even think you could call it upscale bar food. It was actual good food. The BEST part about our meal was the curry seasoned fall squash with raisins. I would go back there for this dish alone. We also had the olives which were good. I had the veggie burger for dinner. The server told me it was homemade but when it arrived it looked like it was once a frozen veggie burger. I could be wrong. Should have gone for their regular burgers which I hear are excellent. I'd defintely go back for dinner or a drink.
