So I have been in Calo about 6 times and most of the time I'm stunned by how much I get, how good it was and what a great value it was. Howvever this last weekend, we went and I was a tad underwhelmed. While the portions were substantial, the food didn't seem to have that same "snap" that it did in the past. Additoinally, the service was a bit awkward. Let me explain. A party of 4 adults and two toddlers begins ordering and then as we get to the third adult, the waiter says "hold on, let me get your wine before you order." Huh???? Anyway, this was typical for the night and a little off-putting. Nonetheless, I can recommend the pasta dishes and can say that the portions are large and filling and they are generally good. However, the olive oil based sauces are not so exciting. I prefer the cream based even though they are quite heavy. I will go back and hope next time service doesn't overshadow a good meal.
