I've been here several times and loved my dinner each time! The colombian platter is yummy (I love the grilled plantains!), but beware of the portion sizes. They are huge! You can easily split the platters between two people or plan on taking home a good sized leftover bag. I have been able to get a table quickly on the weekdays, but it may take longer on the weekends. Also, there isn't really a 'waiting' area, so you end up crammed up next to the patrons seated right by the door. Bonus points for BYOB!
