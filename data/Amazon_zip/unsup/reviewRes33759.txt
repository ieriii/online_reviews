The food was excellent. The service was friendly, attentive without being obtrusive, and very detailed. The price point is very similar to Francesca's on Taylor & definitely worth it as far as food & service are concerned. Perhaps we're stuck in our ways, but the space was small, cramped, and totally cacophonous! Perhaps the usual clientele doesn't object, but we prefer a bit more room between tables, and we like to converse with each other at dinner. That said---the husband had a vodka on the rocks with a twist ($6-very reasonable for the area) & the roast chicken. I had chicken breast with a rosemary, garlic white wine sauce. Roast potatoes came with both entrees. We shared 2 scoops of frozen deliciousness for dessert-pistachio gelato for him & raspberry sorbet for me. The waiter (Felix) was wonderful to us. He staged our take-out entree order perfectly so it was still warm when we got home, even though we had to drive clear to the UIC area! Kudos to Felix and the kitchen.
