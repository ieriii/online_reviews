With our usual good foresight, we decided to head to Piece Pizza during the recent Wicker Park Street festival. Turning onto North off of Ashland we noticed people were walking faster than we were driving, and decided to reroute our pizza choice to another- Pequods. Being a Sunday night we assumed we would be seated rather quickly, but Pequods being Pequods, there was a wait. We were told 35-40 minutes, which was spot-on. It was also nice that we were given a menu to pre-order so once seated we would have a limited wait for our food.  Once seated, we ordered an appetizer and began our wait. I really liked the simple atmosphere of Pequod's. The bar is pretty centrally located in the eating area, but it is relatively bright and cozy. The restaurant was actually pretty quiet and the whole place kind of reminded me of a pizzeria in Northern WI I would go to with my family after a day of fishing. The salad and cheesy garlic bread we ordered were fine, mostly just tasty bites to tide us over in our wait for the main event. The pizza was awesome. I agree with others assessments that the amount of cheese is less than some other pan pizza joints, but I preferred it. The cheese tasted less rubbery and more gooey goodness. The sauce was also great with a tinge of sweetness. Finally, the sausage on top was ample and delicious.... It really makes me rethink my use of turkey sausage in everything at home. We ordered a medium, and were only able to eat 1 piece each (2 people) so we took lots of pizza home- a treat for the rest of the week. I just really loved this place.
