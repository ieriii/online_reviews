All the postive reviews are right! This place's peking duck is fantastic. The bacon wrapped shrimp are a guilty pleasure and everything is so cheap. One of my favorites! Just a tip, if you're going during the weekend or Friday/Saturday night be sure to make a reservation. I showed up at 7:30 without and it was an hour and a half wait. They do have carry out service though as an option.
