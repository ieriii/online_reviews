In the list of things I miss having left the North Side, Spacca Napoli easily beats Lake Michigan. That is how good this pizza is. I am a die hard pizza snob. I don't eat deep dish, I don't eat delivery. Places regularly considered the best always fail to impress me. This is not out of some awful misanthropy. The fact is, I've been to many of Italy's Pizza capitols, and have had my socks literally knocked the fuck off of my body by a pizza. With that said, Spacca Napoli is the best pizza I've had in America. Hands down. I don't know what to add, other than a wonderful anecdote: The owner heard from his server about my reticence over trying a calzone (being, how do I say this, not currently a member of a fraternity). The owner personally came to my table to explain to me the origins of the calzone, and we had a spirited argument about Northern Italian versus Southern Italian culture, and after that I was so charmed I couldn't turn down his goddamned calzone. Turns out, the calzone was fantastic. Delicate and flavorful, and well worth the half-moon shape. Immediately go to Spacca Napoli. Go right now. Whatever you're doing can wait.
