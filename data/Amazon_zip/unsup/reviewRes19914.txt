Lunch at The Gage? How fancy!! The Irish flexing their culinary skills in a 3 million dollar gastropub = great success.  For those of you not in-the-know, a gastropub is basically food that you would find in some divey murky pub in the backroads of Ireland, but classier ingredients are used and the food is presented as upscale. [It's where rich people go to eat expensive comfort food, basically] You don't need to be dressed up to be a patron of this fine establishment, but you'll feel more awesome, so throw on a suit or some heels. Most of the people in here during the lunch hours are business men drinking martinis and beer - or the real housewife variety... or college kids like myself, being taken on a hot lunch "date" by their rich uncle. HANDS DOWN the best fish & chips you will ever eat out of a roll of newsprint this side of the Atlantic. Fantastic burgers and interesting takes on classic sandwiches [I had the olive oil poached hawaiian tuna sandwich... I was thinking tuna-steak, not tuna salad... but it was lovely. yes, lovely]. ++'s = they have scotch eggs. SCOTCH EGGS. I dare you to find a fancy restaurant with a Scotch Egg. If you're reading this review and you often visit fancy restaurants, you probably don't know what that even is! They have curry chips [fries]... traditional Irish street food. --'s = For my sandwich being 16 dollars, I wish they had done something a little more interesting. High quality ingredients, yes, but not huge on flavor. fun facts : the bar was built in Ireland and shipped overseas by the owner, who's son now runs the bar. Billy Jr will be the one walking around asking about the food... he likes to make the rounds and make sure that everything is quality. So overall, it's a fun place to spend some money on food so delicious you'd have to travel to Ireland to get it. Full Bar, cute Irish waiters and relaxed atmosphere.
