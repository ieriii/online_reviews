I keep cooming back no matter what. Their beer is delicious.  Big fan of the IPA, which they run out of from time to time. Wit, is very good, even teh porter which I usually do not like, is good. Burgers, especially the Workingman, is the bomb. Sauteed onions in beer on top bacon and cheddar. Might be the bset burger in Chicago. Sure it's $12, but its SOO GOOD! Other hits are the polenta fries and the sweet potato discs. Mussels in cider and blue cheese are heavenly. I miss the ones that they used to prepare in a belgian style, but the replacement mussels with spanish chirizo are also very tasty. Generally crowded and noisy, you will likely wait for a table at prime eating times - parking kinda sucks, but if you look hard enough, you can park for free on the side streets fro free. Highly reccomended!
