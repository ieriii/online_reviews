We were excited to check out this highly reviewed spot for brunch last Saturday. We came away disappointed - more with the service than with the food. We ordered drinks, which arrived promptly. Our server seemed very distracted and we had to repeat every part of our order to her. The fabulous focaccia came out pretty quickly. Then we waited and waited and waited, even though the place was busy but not a madhouse. Eventually the asparagus arrived. Then we waited more than 20 minutes. It was clear that the server had totally spaced out our main dishes. The woman who came to clear away our plates seemed confused when we told her we were awaiting more food. We waited several minutes longer. Finally my scrambled eggs came out. Alone on a plate. Tasty but presentation left much to be desired. By the time my husband's risotto arrived, I had finished eating and TWO hours had passed. To the restaurant's credit, they removed the charge for the very tardy risotto, but service was a mess. Improvement is needed.
