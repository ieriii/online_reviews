I was so so so excited to eat here. I'd completely drank the kool-aid and was fully on board the Rick Bayless bandwagon, despite hating the food at XOCO. Maybe it was because it was restaurant week, but I got the worst tacos I've ever eaten in my life. Because I don't live on the wild side, I usually order basic dishes because it's tough to mess them up, and someone like Rick Bayless should be able to revolutionize the taco. That was just not the fact. It wasn't spicy or salty, or gritty or gross. It was just... bleh. Bland. Boring. Flavorless.  Unacceptable for Mexican food. The service was alright, but I assume they are used to a tremendous amount of traffic and therefore should be able to run the shop accordingly. All of the servers seemed rushed, overworked, and kind of reminded me of the greeters at Walmart. Just plain sick of the cog. I don't think I'll be back, this is strike two for Rick, and I just can't handle what this would do to my respect for "Top Chef".
