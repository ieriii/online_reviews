The dogs/sausages are really top-notch - as far as encased meats go, of course... but the thing that really puts Hot Doug's over the top is Doug, himself. He's a genuinely nice guy. He's always friendly and he doesn't turn people away if they're in line by closing time - even when that line is down the block.
