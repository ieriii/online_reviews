I've been coming here for years. After reading some of the other reviews, I agree that they have been a little inconsistent in delivering the best quality and service at all times.  REGARDLESS, it's hard to find a better falafel sandwich in Chicago. Their ingredients (pitas, Jerusalem salad, sambal...etc) are always fresh, as are their soups. The cous-cous dish on Sundays ranks up there too. Spicy falafel (plus tomato) and a small lentil soup and I'm good to go!
