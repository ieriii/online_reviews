Silence engulfed our table after our food was served. We were busy eating- and moaning- deep in a foodgasm. Am I allowed to say that on yelp? To say that the food was great is an understatement. It was absolutely excellent, hands down the best food I've ever eaten. We ate the Dagwood (with macaroni and cheese) and the Reuben (with sweet potato fries). We also got a side of cole slaw. The sandwiches were hefty- meaty, savory, and delicious. I actually ate the Reuben with a knife and fork. Sounds sacrilege, but I had to cause it was so massive. The fries were great, the mac & cheese was superb, and the cole slaw was pretty run of the mill. Ah, but the sandwiches! You just might need to light up a cigarette after eating them. Somehow, after eating all this great food, we found room for dessert. We split the lemon coconut cake. It was pretty good, but because it was refrigerated (probably because of health codes) it was pretty dense and a tad dry. But it was flavorful and citrus-y, so I'd eat it again.      The diner is funky and the people are friendly. I'm not from Chicago, but now I have a reason to visit.
