Piece is a good place for thin crust pizza. There pizza is not incredible but it is very good. They have a lot of toppings to choose from and the pizzas are a good size. They also have a really good beer selection. They have some beers that I believe are brewed on the premises. Not positive about that but wherever they're from they're good. I've been here a couple times. The 1st time my pizza was a little undercooked. The second time its was cooked well but the cheesy was a little runny. The atmosphere is nice and open. It does get a little bit packed later on in the evening but its got a good crowd and the staff is pretty good about being attentive. This seems like an especially good place to go with a large group cause the pizzas are big and have a lot of options. It may be slightly pricey for pizza but its good and worth the dough. Definitely give the beer a try it takes it from a 3 to a four star place.
