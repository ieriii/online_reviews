Bottom line: The Hopleaf is still a special place, come have a beer. When it comes to a bar like the Hopleaf, which has been rated by Beer Advocate as one of the best places in America to get a beer, you have to take a step back before you try and evaluate it. As of this writing 747 people have come before with their opinion on how well the Hopleaf serves a beer and food. We came through the door having read approximately 0 of those reviews and honestly with no expectations other than having heard from my brother (who we're visiting) that this is one of his favorite places for a drink. So we were expecting it to be good but didn't have any baggage demanding for it to be. The hardest thing that I can imagine for a place as popular and trendy as the Hopleaf to do is maintain itself with out losing its authenticity as a beer drinkers bar. So far, at least they are staying the course. We found it easy to strike up a conversation with our neighbors at the bar, Joe, a long-time local and John, an off duty employee. They were happy to debate the merits of the various beers on tap that night (goose island http://bit.ly/XnAUa was running a promotion) as well as introduce us to the fantastic Barbancourt Hatian rum http://bit.ly/cdcMVm behind the bar.
