I don't think I have anything but good things to say about the bongo room. The wait.. yes is long, but once you get in and try the food.. you won't be sorry that you waited! We sat at the bar, which is not a bad choice because the service is still great. Bloody Mary was excellent and they offer many kinds. We had the Eggs Benedict.. and let me say the portion is HUGE. Luckily we shared but everything was cooked perfectly. Have heard the pancakes and everything else tastes like dessert.. but if you're a savory person.. don't worry they have plenty to offer on the menu!
