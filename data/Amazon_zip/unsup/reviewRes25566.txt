This still keeps the dazzling first impression I had of the place a year ago. We did the chef's tasting last year and enjoyed every bit of it. This year, since the family travels to Spain at least once every year we were yearning for the comfort tapas and ordered those a la carte. My review will be based on comparing the ones I'm familiar with in Spain: Jamon Iberico: Not sure what's their source, but it's not as dark as I'm used to. However it's shaved thinly and less fatty than most Jamon Ibericos, so I personally enjoyed the flavor sans that fat. Melts in your mouth! Octopus with Potatoes & Paprika: I know this more as Pulpo a la Gallega, and it's pretty spot on. More garlicky than normal, slightly less meat than one would normally serve, and a tad overcooked than its usual preparation, but still delicious and the closest I've had to the real thing this side of the Atlantic. Patatas Bravas: Much more cutesy and less messy than the traditional presentation. (You get 7 slices in a row with a bit of the salsa brava on top of each) But it's perfect! I judge tapas restos on this dish, and the fancy plating doesn't mask anything - the flavors are dead on. Croquetas de Bacalao: These are little babies compared to their cousins in Andalucia. I couldn't get the bacalao flavor I was hoping for in this one, so this is probably the most disappointing. I wouldn't get it again. Sadness. Pork Belly: They definitely know how to win a tocino-lover's heart. Sangria: Fabulous. Probably even better that the hangover-inducing ones you'd get in Spanish bodegas. The seasonal ones are magical amalgamations of delicioso. Mercat has become the new go-to tapas resto over Cafe Iberico just because the dishes are slightly more reminiscent of the Spain we love and visit every year. Authenticity is still there despite the fancy ambiance and plating. I'd give this a fifth star if I could actually afford to eat everything I want on my own, but I'm on the whim of the padres' Spanish cravings.
