I love coast's sushi more than any other sushi in Chicago! I love everything about this place (food, price, service, atmosphere, BYOB...), but the only drawback is that they do not take reservation on the week end... which makes it hard to get a table and make my plans there. So I don't go there on the week end...too crazy!
