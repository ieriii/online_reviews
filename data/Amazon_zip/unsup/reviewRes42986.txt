AOP is my favorite chicago style pizza place! The pizza is seriously addictive. The crust is flavorful with a slightly salty taste....the cheese is generous and stringy and the sauce is slightly tangy and full of flavor. Once I tried AOP I craved it whenever I wanted a piece of pizza. No other place compares. Delivery takes a while, but it is worth it. If you eat there you can buy by the slice. It is super casual and they just expanded so there is plenty of seating. This is a locals secret...give it a try!
