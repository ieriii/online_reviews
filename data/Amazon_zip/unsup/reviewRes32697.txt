We used a Groupon there tonight and had a wonderful time. Delicious food, and really pleasant service. There were some reviews about how the service was slow, so we had prepared ourselves for a leisurely evening, but we were actually out of there in just over one hour, even after having dessert. Really delicious food. Thanks for the Groupon, Demera! We'll be back!
