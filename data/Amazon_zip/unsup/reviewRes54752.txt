we love breakfast! aside from the wait if you sleep in, this is as good as it gets in chicago. the eggs are always delicious; the greek twist on all the menu items is refreshing and unique; the coffee is good; and the food is always fresh. the restaurant is usually packed on the weekends, but the crowd is never too loud and the service is prompt and friendly. we visit Meli regularly and are never disappointed. give it a try!
