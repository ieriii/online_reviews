when you absolutely positively got to have inventive sushi regardless of price-performance, just so you can get you beak wet later on that evening, then I suggest this place - but its crowded, and many other patrons might make you loose your appetite for beak wetting.  Dark and moody in an 80s come 90s - which is an ambiance that I usually trust over wood walled sushi dens...  I guess it can go both ways, fresher seafood and staler rice at the dark 80s places? if you know what I mean?
