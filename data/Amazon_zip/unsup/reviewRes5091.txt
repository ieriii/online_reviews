The afternoon before I came to this restaurant, a New York Times article stated that the happiest man alive is a tall, well-off, married, Jewish Chinese-American who resides in Hawaii. Before I departed from work, I declared that I will somehow become happier than this man, since I already had a 3" height advantage over him. This goal will never come true, as I will refuse to become kosher and deny the pleasures of The Purple Pig. Cured meat sampler? Yes please. Deep fried brusselsprouts? Omnomnom. Fried chicken with tzatziki sauce? I could die a happier man than the one mentioned above. Don't get me started on dessert. The Purple Pig offers a great atmosphere with pretty decent prices. The imported wine selection is pretty decent, as well. I am a bit sad they don't take reservations (though I completely understand), and i wish they were just slightly more affordable. I guess I'll just have to save it for special occasions.
