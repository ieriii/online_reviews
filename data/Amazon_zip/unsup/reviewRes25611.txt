I use to live down the street from here and stopped here many times a week. Nice, laid back atmosphere with good Greek comfort food. Freshly baked croissants and spankopita are good in the mornings. An absolute must are the pommes frites....french style fries that come with mustard and feta cheese to dip and are served in a cute cone. The Nestea frappe is also good. One of my favorite entrees is the crab cake salads. A nice place to eat without breaking the bank. Oh, and get to know Steve and he'll always set you up right. Just beware of the bakery case...although the pastries look enchanting many of them are not as good as they look. Try the bakery a few doors down for that type of fare.
