PIZZA PIZZA----Little Caesars----PIZZA PIZZA. Oh wait, I was at Pequods, not Little Caesars or Pizza Hut? Never would've thought, because this pan pizza tastes very similar to a Pizza Hut pan pizza. Hmmm, I think they order from Pizza Hut, place this CRAP on a plate, jack up the price 40% (To compensate for Lincoln Park rental rates), and serve it to you with a smile----Lincoln Parkers will never know, right? Just jack up the price, and they're happy :) Ok, to the order----we started with the garlic cheese bread (no marina sauce?)----tastes just like cardboard....YUM! A small pan pizza----tastes just like pizza pizza----Little Caesars. AVERAGE, 2.5 stars, at best----sorry, just how I see it.
