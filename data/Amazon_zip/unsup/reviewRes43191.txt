I truly love coming here, sitting outside enjoying the view of division or inside cozy by the fireplace.. The food is always great and I love the tea selection.. The granola is deadly and delicious.. However, this does not justify how terribly rude the staff is (except the bus boys- they are sweet as pie).. The staff at the counter is cocky, rude, extremely full of themselves and as far from hospitable as possible.. I've even had one of the girls roll her eyes at me.. Really? and it's not just one- it's every single counter person I've encountered.. I'm here atleast once or twice a week, one would think they'd show customers, especially loyal customers a little gratitude.. Unfortunately several of my friends and clients have had similar experiences.. They all need to just breathe it out.. Whatever is bothering you, close your eyes and take a nice deep uujayi breathe...
