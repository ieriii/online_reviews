I love coast because the sushi is great and nothing beats BYOB. My last experience at Coast wasn't as good as usual. The rolls seemed to be much smaller than usual and although they were good the 3 rolls we ordered didn't leave my friend and I satisfied so we had to order more. I've tried a few different rolls here and my favorite continues to be the volcano...I don't love spicy food so I was worried I wouldn't like it, but it's actually not that spicy at all!
