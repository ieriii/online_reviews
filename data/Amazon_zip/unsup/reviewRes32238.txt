Delicious. The Menu is an array of different dishes ranging from middle eastern to Italian to Mexican and many more. Everything is mega healthy and vegan. but don't let that scare you, very delicious and the prices aren't bad considering most special vegan places such as this can be pricey. The overall vibe was nice. waiter totally cool and the decor was modern and cute. grab a booth if you end up going. i sat at an ultra small table.
