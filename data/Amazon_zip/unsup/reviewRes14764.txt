Truly one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to. You want old school Italian, this is it! The atmosphere is really welcoming, and every table seems to be enjoying a great time. Through the course of our evening here, we observed 4 tables celebrating birthdays. My uncle introduced us to this place, saying it looked like something out of the past of Chicago, and it does! We are talking Old Chicago charm here. It is truly a hidden gem. You will get so much great food for an unbelievably reasonable price here at Sabatino's. For $16.95, I got the eggplant parm that came with soup, salad, AND a pasta side! I will tell you a secret though, make SURE you order the tortoni for dessert. You can't get this excellent, rum-flavored ice cream ANYWHERE in Chicago except if you go to the hidden Italian places on 24th and Oakley Avenue.
