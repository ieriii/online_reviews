Delicious!!! I've never had Ethiopian food before so I was super excited to go check this place out. The food came out with the most amazing fluffy spongey light flatbread (beware, it's so easy to inhale...) the little dishes seem like the amount of food is small... until you dig into it... it was hard to finish.. boyfriend & I tried our best (and we have HUGE appetites) and we couldn't polish it off.... We ordered a beef, a lamb and a mixed legumes dish. The legumes was my favorite!!! And while I don't usually eat lamb, it was very good. It also came with some side dishes as well... AMAZING!!!! Very filling... so flavorful (a tad bit on the salty side.. which is why the bread works so well with it... the bread also has a slight tang to it which I LOVED) The waitresses were all smiley and super sweet. And I loved eating with my hands :] More foods need to be eaten that way.... I have a whole post (with pictures) on my blog here: http://misstiffie.wordpr
