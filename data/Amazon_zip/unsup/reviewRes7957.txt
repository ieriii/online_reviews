I can say, as a REAL Italian who has been to Italy several times in my life that Spacca Napoli is one of, if not the best & most authentic representation of Italian gastronomy that Chicago has to offer. The owner is true to himself and his product. He does one thing and he does it better than anyone! You won't find Chicken Vesuvio on this menu or (God forbid) Chicken Parmesan. It's just Pizza Napoletana, just the way it is in Italy. Bravo to the owner and staff. Keep doing what you do! In boca del lupo!
