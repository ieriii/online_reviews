Bourbon. The disciples of this wicked and seductive elixer crowd this wonderful gastropub, patiently waiting for the militantly anti-vegan delicacies on the menu- like mallard duck pate, beef fat fried potatoes,and wild boar sloppy joes. An excellent menu with lots of unique artery clogging choices- washed down so well with the multitudes of bourbon choices on the vast drink menu. Did I say bourbon? Yea, its noisy, yea its busy, but they offer bourbon flights! Oy! The sign on the window says, Eat. Sleep. Whiskey. I am in love.
