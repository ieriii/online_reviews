This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The service, food, wine selection, amazing cheeses. Heaven, really. They have a very comprehensive and well researched wine list. I love the options glass/carafe/half bottle/bottle. We ordered many wines, mostly the little carafe size which is enough for two people to share. The allows for many tastings, and we played around with them - pairing with their fabulous cheeses and 'swine'. Our waitress was amazing and we took her advice on the cheeses, as the list was extensive. The buffalo cheese was my favorite of the evening. We tried many small plates (there were 5 of us), taking our time to savor each - I guess we were there a couple of hours. Easy to lose track of time there! The rabbit salad was just fantastic (told the kids it was chicken and they couldn't get enough), the stuffed fried olives were tasty, eggplant was delicious, We had the 5 cheeses and the pig platter. So amazing. I can't wait to return to Chicago to visit this place again. A perfect evening! "one jillion stars" -my 7 year old. (and he didn't even get any wine)
