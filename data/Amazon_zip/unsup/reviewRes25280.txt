5 stars. Period. Deep dish perfected: caramelized crust and tangy sauce, fresh toppings and cooked to perfection (in my book, the cheese should just start to be browning, the crust should be crusty on the outside and cooked through in the middle (not soggy/doughy/undercooked). The service was attentive and pleasant (when I dined in) and pickup was a snap (also a friendly/pleasant experience). The decor is a blend of pizzeria, tavern, something, but I barely remember it -- I just remember getting a gorgeous pizza pie delivered to our table and loving every bite of it. Pequod's nails it. I love their pizza. I do. I'll be going back soon. P.S.: Dining in is definitely better than pick-up, but I'd say the same for all pizza. The drive home always allows the pie to cool a bit too much in my book.
