Another in a long line of great Chicago specialty burger/beer restaurants. This one definitely hits the mark on both having a great and wide selection of both burgers and beer. They have one of my favorites on tap Ska Brewery's Modus Hoperandi. You have to enjoy any beer with such a clever name. They have tons o' great beer on tap and a very extensive bottle list. The burgers are made with beef from Pat Lefrieda. Known for its special mixes of ground beef. Fresh and always juicy. And quite the variety of choices on your burger. From a blue cheese burger to a brie burger. A pork belly burger to a mushroom and chickpea burger. You will find one you like and want to try everyone else's burgers. The fries are well done and also come with a boat load of options. The waitstaff is knowledgeable on pairing the right beer with the right burger. Can get a bit noisy in there but I have always had a good time. Oh, and as mentioned in many other of the reviews for this place: the cheese curds are just like crack. Mmmm crack fried cheese!
