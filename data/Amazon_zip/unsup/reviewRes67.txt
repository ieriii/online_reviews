We had an anniversary dinner at Alinea last July, so this review is long overdue. I had one of the best meals of my life. I don't remember that much, except the salad we cut ourselves on the table, the three-part pea dish, the pasta hanging on some pole and we wrapped ourselves, and the dessert... Oh did I mention the service is impeccable? I will start calling to make reservation for this fall, I need to make this an annual thing. :)
