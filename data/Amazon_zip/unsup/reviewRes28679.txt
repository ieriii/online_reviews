Quite honestly, I was somewhat skeptical with the idea of "fancy" Mexican food but Rick Bayless and the Frontera Grill was able to make me think, "wow, this is like tasting Mexican food again for the first time." Being from California, this is quite a feat. The must have item here is definitely the Chicken Mole, it brought a complexity of flavor that was hard to beat.
