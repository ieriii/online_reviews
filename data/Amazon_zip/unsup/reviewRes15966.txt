There is a reason Violet Hour has received primarily 5-star reviews.  The atmosphere is alluring, beautiful, and interesting.  The drinks are inventive and delicious.  The music is not only a cool, appropriate selection, but played at a volume which is conducive to conversation.  If you haven't been, GO. And follow Laura A.'s advice, go early or on a weekday.
