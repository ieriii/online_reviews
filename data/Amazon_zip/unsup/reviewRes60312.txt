Delicious! After walking by several times and jealously watching the people sitting outside eating their amazing-looking rolls, I recently got take-out (Oedipus roll without mayo).It was amazing! The fish was delicious, the avocado was ripe, and the soy sauce came in a cute little bottle.I will definitely go back and try some of their other rolls soon.
