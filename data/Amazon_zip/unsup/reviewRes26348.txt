So I've been twice now. I really wish this place was better because it's in a nice spot and has a nice view of the park, but it just doesn't measure up. Nothing is particularly bad, it just all comes off as indifferent. It kind of feels like a Midwestern attempt at a fancy restaurant. They are definitely aiming at the business crowd, so maybe that's the problem. I don't know. However, I won't go back. I'd rather walk a little further or settle for less ambiance, especially at this price point.
