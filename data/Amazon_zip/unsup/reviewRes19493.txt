Pretty good. I really liked the churros although I wished they were a bit fluffier rather than crunchy. I had a jamon torta, which was very tasty and I was glad there was so little bread since that often takes up the entire taste of the sandwich. I also had the jamaica agua fresca, which is one of my favorites normally in other restaurants. I don't think it was amazing here, but it was fairly good. I only waited 20 minutes from 11:40ish until about 12:05, so not bad. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because of the price. Yes, the food is REALLY good... But paying 15 dollars for a drink, a churro, and a sandwich just seems silly.
