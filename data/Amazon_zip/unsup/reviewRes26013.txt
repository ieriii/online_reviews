I know another 5 star rating from me, what can I say I like to pimp that which I like. Simply It was great Vietnamese food. Only thing we didn't try was there noodles, but I'm in Uptown with such regularity I was looking to experience anything but noodles. The coconut, mango and beef is not to missed under any circumstances. Everything was tasty, colorful, and vibrant. Not a complaint for me, but a warning to others. Close quarters and noise are to be expected, but then again so is a great experience. It's simply worth it!
