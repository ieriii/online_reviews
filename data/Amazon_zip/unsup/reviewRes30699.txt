I have been to Sunda several times and always had an amazing time. However, this weekend I went with my sister and we could not have been more disappointed. The service was awful, the food was mediocre. And just to top off the evening the women next to me dropped her water glass and a shard of glass cut my foot. Other than a quick apology, very little was done to remedy that situation. My foot continued bleeding throughout dinner. Overall it was not an enjoyable evening. We will not be in an hurry to return.
