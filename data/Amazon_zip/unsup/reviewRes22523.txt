It's loud. It's full of tourists. It's crowded.  But it's still a Chicago classic. They get you in, feed you, and get you out. How many years have they been doing this? I tried all three dinners on the table last night, and all were Six Flags. To summarize my above review, bring your out of town friends to Greek Islands, go there before a game, go there when you want good Greek. Or go to Parthenon, the other G-town classic. What do I care where you go? SIx flags. More flags, more fun!
