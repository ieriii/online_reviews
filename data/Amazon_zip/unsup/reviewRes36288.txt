I love this place! Great sushi, very reasonable prices, great service. The crab rangoon is amazing! The sushi is very fresh. Everything I have tried, some more basic rolls, some speciality rolls, was amazing. They do serve alcohol now, wine list isn't too bad either, One of the best sushi places in Chicago!
