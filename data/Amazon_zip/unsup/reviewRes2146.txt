It's okay. The hot dogs are good Chicago-style hot dogs but not the best you can get. The more exotic sausage creations (Gator, rattlesnake, rabbit, etc.) are good, but dude totally overdoes it with the sauce and cheeses. The duck fat fries are a little skinnier and crispier but I can't really tell the difference. I don't care for Doug's fries, duck fat or not, because they're not blanched and double-fried like the best fries are. If you see a line, keep driving because it's not worth the wait.
