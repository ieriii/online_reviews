Brazilian Steakhouse done right! I was completely surprised in a good way with ZED. Took my parents here when they came in town and thought I was taking a risk considering how reserved they are. I couldnt have been more wrong, they loved it! From the great pre-dinner cocktails at their fabulous bar with cool waitstaff, I was highly impressed from the start. The owner of ZED must have forked some serious $$ for the decour & ambiance as it was brand-new, crisp&clean to perfection, and had a great vibe. Wine selections were very good along with the well-written menu and food selections. Great for carnivores as well as provided an excellent salad bar (I hate that word, reminds me of pondersosa steakhouse back in the day) which my mother loved. The meat selection was awesome, from Lamb to Filet, all unique and differently prepared, thoroughly enjoyed. The only big turnoff is buffet style (get out of your seat and wait in line for the salad bar) but fortunately there were no old ladies in the line (there were also 2 different salad bars to choose from). Although I'm not a big fan of the turn your stone over and smoke signal for more meat thing, their runner meat carving system seemed to work well, no complaints as the entire table was well fed. Other Brazilian-type steakhouses like Fogo, Brazzaz, and Texas aren't able to compete with ZED 451.
