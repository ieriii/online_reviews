I showed up here at 8 am: a wet rat on a rainy Wednesday morning. My friend was an hour late (traffic), but the cute waitresses kept my spirits high with coffee refills and sympathetic smiles. When she did get there, my companion ordered a gigantic vanilla latte (scrumptious) and two eggs over easy (perfect) with hash-browns (fried well with a lot of herbs and seasonings). I went with the red velvet pancakes which came with some mysterious, super-sweet crack sauce, which I found to be overwhelming. Don't expect to finish your meal here. And consider staying away from the sweet stuff unless you've got the right kinda tooth and a stomach of steel. I regret not going for something savory. The prices are high, but my friend's biz picked up the tab, so I can't complain about that one.
