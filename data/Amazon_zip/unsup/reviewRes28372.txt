This place is alright, coming from the South and living a few years in Mexico City have made me have a high bar for Mexican food. I thought the food overall was a bit bland, maybe its more targeted to anglos who dont like spice. Overall the food was good but it seemed like everything was coated in an extra layer of grease, even the tortillas seemed deep fried.
