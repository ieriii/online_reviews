Well, I love it. DELICIOUS vegan and vegetarian food, good portions and a friendly, laid-back atmosphere. Oh, and I can order beer, including picks from Two Bros. brewery. That is a plus. My favorites are the Pulled "Pork" Sandwich, the Polenta and the Chicken-Fried "Steak," though I'm sure i will add more favorites as I try new dishes. My better half loves the French Toast and orders it every other visit. The few desserts I've sampled (carrot cake, chocolate cake, some other kind of cake) didn't impress me quite as much, but I am more than willing to overlook it. Maybe the milkshakes are better...
