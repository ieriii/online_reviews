OH MY EFFING GOD!why have i not been here before? i always walked by, for the past year and a half since I moved into lp but never tried it.a few days ago i finally had time to walk in, grabbed some lunch and tried their special sandwich. I had the beef one it was sooo good! with all the sides it came with and a smoothie it was the perfect lunch ever!it was cold the other night too and i wasn't in the mood to walk down the street to pick it up. So I ordered delivery, got their beef noodle soup and it was just the perfect pick-me-up! this place is soo good, i ordered and they said it would be 45 minutes before it would come, it only took me 20 mintues to get my order, GREAT! good, fantastic and overall awesome place!-John
