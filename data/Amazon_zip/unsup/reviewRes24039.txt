The is one of the best Greek restaurants in Chicago. The lamb is some of the very yummiest I have ever had. The service is usually excellent. The wine is uniformly good. The free valet parking is a nice touch, too. But 4 stars instead of 5 because their prices seem just a TAD too high for what you get.
