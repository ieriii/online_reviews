I've been to the Lockdown a few times now. There seems to always be a problem every time I go but the owner Paulie always charms us with some free drinks and good conversation. NOT this last time. First of all when greeted I asked for a margarita which seemed to annoy the bartender. He didn't even put salt on it and I'm pretty sure there was only an eyedrop of liquor in it. Then our food comes out and my order was wrong. And my friend that had mussels that had a handful that were dead. When I told the bartender/worst manager ever his reply was "well what do you want ME to do about it?" To which I replied "I'm just letting you know so it doesn't happen again to someone else." He then asked my other friend if anything was wrong with hers. When she said no he said "I like her." I then said "oh but you don't like us?" I couldn't believe how rude he was! Finally another bartender that had been taking care of us also said the next round was on her. She was much more sympathetic and saved this review from getting 1 star.
