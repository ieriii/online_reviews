I hit the bar for a meal before meeting some friends later in the evening and I was pretty impressed. Aside from the drunk douchewad who was screaming at the top of his lungs every 5 minutes seemingly as part of his conversational tone (no game etc.), it would have been a stellar atmosphere. Hey, I get it , I was in the bar portion of the restaurant, but cmon you drunken, red faced clown, it's not a frat party and you were easily 40 years old, so learn how to handle your liquor like a real man. Once he left things became quite good. I had the cedar plank salmon drizzled with a brown sugar & soy sauce glaze. It was an enormous piece of fish, and could have been cooked a little bit less (the plank keeps cooking it for quite some time I am sure, so pull that sucker off the burners a little quicker), mashed potatoes with steamed broccoli on the side. The broccoli was literally an entire head! Nice glass of clos du bois chardonnay on the side and I was good to go. I'd definitely return, and look forward to trying some of the land based products :-). Looks like the make a pretty mean cocktail in there as well, but I stuck to the wine.
