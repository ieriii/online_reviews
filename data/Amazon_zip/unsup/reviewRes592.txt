If you're a foodie and have the spare cash -- and especially if you already live here in Chicago -- then it would be an enormous mistake to never visit Alinea. It is absolutely everything that the critics say: Innovative, creative, thoughtfully prepared food with some of the best service you will see and a calm sparse, New York-chic setting. The way the food is presented beats some of the art I've seen in galleries around here. It's often a shame that it must be eaten. That was only literally the case on one course that I had there the other night: the beef course was incredibly salty and lifeless and the Guinness glace/gel only added to the saltiness. For one of the main course tastes, it was very disappointing. The others were fine, but compared to -- as an example -- Charlie Trotter's, I found myself wanting more flavor and less artifice in a few of the courses. The bacon on the trapeze, though? Genius. I realize the menu changes (and this was on as of March 2007), but I hope it's a permanent fixture. I thought the wine pairing was well worth it and the sommeliers were obviously very knowledgeable, and I appreciated that while they (and the other service) was solicitous, it was not stuffy. In fact, I've never heard so many random pop culture references made at a table at a formal restaurant. The servers and sommeliers in fact, appeared to be hipsters (who happen to know a lot about food and wine). I'm not sure I'd return any time too soon (for one thing, I'm now broke!), but as I said from the start, it is ranked as one of the top restaurants in the entire country, and if you're interested in innovative cuisine, you really should try it at least once.
