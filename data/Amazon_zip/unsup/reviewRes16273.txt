I've been going to and ordering from Calo for over ten years, since before they remodeled and became all fancy. Anyway, I ordered a pizza and a caesar salad last night for delivery and was told it would be 25 CENTS PER ANCHOVY on the side. Isn't a caesar traditionally made with anchovies? And isn't that a ridiculous, ass fuck price for a side? Who the hell charges per item? Do I get charged per mushroom slice on a pizza? (Probably if I ordered mushrooms). So I called a few minutes ago and spoke to the manager (some douchebag named Anthony, right) and explain to him in civil terms my concern and he replies "Sorry but that's the price. If you want an anchovy it's 25 cents per anchovy." And when I asked him if the same reply would be given if I were in the restaurant, he said YES!! Fuck that place and fuck their food and fuck their new, hip look. The food isn't that great and the pizza was so wet, I could have wrung it out and watered my plants with it. I hope the place catches on fire with Anthony inside and he has to wrap himself in his goddamn precious anchovies to keep from catching fire. But be careful, it's the smoke that usually kills. You shithead.
