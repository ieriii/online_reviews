We stopped by after a long day of museum going. I was a little intimidated by the line. But it was moving! And there was beer! Awesome Mexican beer! And the most perfect sandwich with the most perfect spicy tomato sauce. Alas, it was not my sandwich, but my companions. Mine was not as tasty, but still good. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but if I were in the neighborhood, I would stop by for churros and hot chocolate.
