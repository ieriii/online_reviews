Le Colonial is pretty awesome. It was a windy Sunday and we were shopping in the neighborhood. We walked by Le colonial after we smelled something good and made a reservation for an 1.5 hours later without any problems. The food is very tasty. It was a far cry from the average Asian food that I've had since moving to Chicago. Not only did each dish have lots of flavor it was also at the perfect spice level (for my tastes). Both the tasting menu and the vegetarian menu are nice additions. The drink list and wine menu are also impressive and well selected.  Service was flawless. I will definitely be returning. Also looking forward to hitting up their sister restaurants in SF and NY when I'm there.
