i have never had a bad meal here and the service is always beyond friendly and helpful. their seasonal menus are fantastic. the pastas are always fresh and the meats always tender. the panna cotta is not to be missed. i go here when i'm ready to drop some cash because i will have to have 3 courses and a bottle of wine. the prices are reasonable for the type of atmosphere and cuisine. they also have a small patio in the back with 5-6 tables in the summer. great place.
