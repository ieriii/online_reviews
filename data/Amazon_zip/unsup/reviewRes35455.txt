Six very attractive people like to eat dinner together. With my bottle of red in tow, I met this group at 7 pm on a Wednesday.  We were seated at a table meant for a large party - and it was topped with a lazy susan. Two bottles were open and one was chilling. You gotta love BYOB. As far as atmosphere goes - its all about eating with your friends, not the ambience. Enter super friendly waitress - who was well versed in what was in the food (and saved me from having pork broth on my lo-mein!) We put our order in - of course the Peking Duck, with buns and noodles, and soup made from the leftovers from the carved duck. Veggie Fried Rice Lo-Mein with Scallions and Ginger Mushrooms in Sweet sauce EggRolls Octopus Whiskers (which was basically calamari) The food came out in such a nicely timed manner. Watching the duck be carved was even a fun experience for me. And it was deslish. Its served with a hoisin sauce, pickled something or another, and carrot strips). The super yummy dinner was followed by a really deslish home made watermelon sorbet, and a mango sorbet. Mind you, we brought our own wine - but actually made it out of there for less than $90 for all of that really filling and yum food. You may read other reviews that mention a very attractive, friendly, and well spirited table. That would be us, and we say "You're welcome, we're glad we made your night even better..." I would totally go back here again, plus its very close to home. Highly recommened for someone who hasn't had Peking Duck before!
