Four plus hours of synchronized waitstaffing, water pouring, dish serving, restroom guiding, wine describing, and dessert indulging. My friend and I both had the chef's tasting menu, and it was fascinating to see the two different interpretations of the basic foundation of each course. The location was all about clean lines and contrasting blacks and whites. As a dessert afficionado, however, I feel I can't give the true (hardy har har) full five stars because the dessert, which was much feted, no longer included a separate chocolate selection. Sad. However, I must say that TRU offered a new and exciting handbag experience: each individual's purse gets its own little seat. Charming, non?
