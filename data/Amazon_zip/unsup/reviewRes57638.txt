I've had better. There are way better restaurants in Pilsen. I've heard this restaurant reccomened by many people and the place is always crowded. I was just not impressed when I actually ate the food. The food was too greasy and overall it was just plain meh! I do enjoy mexican food just not from this place. I dont see what the fuss is all about.
