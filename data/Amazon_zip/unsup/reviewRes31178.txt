I went to this place for brunch with friends I was visiting in Chicago. I enjoyed my meal very much. The set-up is nice and inviting, as was the staff. I had the breakfast burrito, which was good but my friend had the nanadict which was even better. I should have ordered that. Oh well...next time. **I recommend the Nanadict and the warm banana bread as a starter if they have it. Yum!
