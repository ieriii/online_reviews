Best Chicago-style pizza in Chicago, if not anywhere. Granted that's really arguable but it's my favorite place to bring out-of-towners and they always end up loving it. What really stands out to me is the sauce and how the seasonings/spices just work really well with the ingredients and crust. I love how it's pay-by-the-slice and a simple dine in. They've got two TVs going to keep you entertained if you like but it lends it self to fairly large parties and it's rarely been busy but never enough to not accommodate me and whomever I'm with. I do think the warmth of the pizza is fine, no complaints like others, but obviously it'll taste better coming straight out of the oven. Only thing I've noticed is the one time I've gotten delivery the sauce wasn't as sensational as dine-in so I don't know if that was a fluke or what. Also, it closes too early but really I don't want it to ever close.
