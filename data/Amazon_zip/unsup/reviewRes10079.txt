Fantastic dining experience! Saturday night. $6 for valet - totally reasonable. Waited at the bar only moments before being seated on time for our 6:30pm reservation. Crowded but in the "this place is so good that all the cool professional people like to hang out here" way, not in the "ugh too many hipsters make me claustrophobic" way. Italian waiter. Everything sounded beautiful coming from his mouth. 1. Antipasto platter to share. Yum. Lots of veggies, a little cheese and meat. 2. Insalata di Pere - arugula, pears, goat cheese, lemon oil. Divine. 3. My entree: Spaghetti Neri "Fruitti di Mare" - Oh. my. goodness. Best seafood pasta I've ever had. Black spaghetti! Succulent bites of crustacean! Seriously amazing dish, if you don't order it, make sure someone at your table does so you can try it. 4. Friend's entree: Paglia e Fieno con Vitello ("Straw & Hay") - also delish. The veal ragu makes it meaty and hearty and awesome. 5. For dessert, the baked stuffed apple is the way to go! Overall, best quality and taste I've found for these extremely reasonable prices. Still a special-ish occasion kind of place for me, but I'm certain to return here, which - with the amount of good food and chefs in this city - is saying a lot.
