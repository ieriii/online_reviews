I went here last night (a Wednesday night) with two friends and to be honest, had pretty high expectations. Luckily we had reservations, the place was pretty busy and I had no idea how small it was. One friend was there before me, the other was running a little late. Our table was ready with water and everything, but they wouldn't seat us until the entire party arrived. Okay, I get that if they were going to give our table to someone else while we waited or on a weekend, but the table was there and empty waiting for us. Why couldn't we just sit there? Anyway. The service was just okay. The waiter was nice enough and knew the menu well, but the food came out pretty slow. I ordered the barramundi as my entree after asking the waiter which of three choices was the best (the walleye, the barramundi, or the crabcakes). It was just alright. I've had barramundi elsewhere and this didn't impress me. It was supposed to be served blackened with a honey lemon butter. I didn't taste honey or lemon, just butter, and it just seemed greasy. It was served with potatoes that were also equally greasy and broccoli that seemed to be formerly frozen. For $25, I expected something A LOT better. Maybe I just got a bad dish? Maybe it was a bad night? I'm not sure, but I won't be back.
