Now this is a 5 star restaurant. Pricey but worth the price. We tried the chef's selection of oysters, the chef's selection of ham, the basque fish stew, apple salad, farm chicken, sweetbreads and for dessert the sorbet and the chocolate cake with an olive oil/sea-salt ice cream. Add in liquor and the tab came to $200. Everything was excellent, but the chocolate cake with the crazy ice cream took the cake (ugh, pun). Phenomenal.
