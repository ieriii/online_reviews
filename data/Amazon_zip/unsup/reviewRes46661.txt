My wife and I reserved two tables through Open Table on the night of our wedding to get together with out of town friends. Twice the amount of people showed up and the staff at RJ Grunts did an AMAZING job at accommodating. Everyone was seated in a reasonable amount of time for a Saturday night. Upon hearing we had just gotten married, my wife was even presented with a complimentary dessert. Thank you RJ Grunts, we'll be back!
