I hear the food is supposed to be good but I may never find out. Had a reservation this past Monday for 14 people. We were running late and had our hotel communicate to them we were coming - which they were fine with. After driving across town we arrived and the table was given away. Then they lied to us that the hotel concierge had said we may or may not be coming. We were ok to wait and have a drink but after standing around for 30 min they asked us to leave because we were taking up too much space in the entry. Granted we were late but no remorse, no courtesy and outright lieing? They seem to be having alot of success since opening and have forgotten that spreading a little love is the best way to be around for the long term.
