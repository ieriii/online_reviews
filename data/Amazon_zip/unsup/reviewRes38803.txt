I've ordered delivery many times from La Villa. I have been inside once and it has that homey, old-style, family Italian place vibe. Pizza is ok. I have to admit that I'm not a big fan on Chicago-style pizza, whether stuffed or thin. If you want a real thin crust pizza you have to go to St. Louis; Chicago just doesn't understand cracker-thin crust, but I digress. I get their chicken dishes. My favorites are the Chicken Marsala and Chicken Francese. I love their Italian salad - it is large enough to be a meal but I split it up into two servings. The pasta with pesto sauce is good, too. I ordered the linguini with white clam sauce once, but wasn't able to eat it because they left the clams in the shells. The clam shells made it smell too fishy for me to even try, but that is my hang-up. It is a shame because I love clams when they are not in the shell. Oh, well. My mom visited and got the breaded pork chops which she enjoyed. And OMG the Cannoli is homemade and so delicious.
