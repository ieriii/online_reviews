Wishbone is my favorite family-friendly restaurant in the 'hood. We've never had to wait for a table, they always have crayons on hand, and there are babbling babies in every direction you look. But what's so nice is that they actually have good food! I get to rest easy knowing nobody is judging me for bringing my *spirited* toddler into a restaurant and enjoy something delicious. They have plenty of veggie-friendly options too and serve breakfast all day.  Oh, and they have an adults only section for those of you who don't want to wave "hi" to my little girl through your entire meal.
