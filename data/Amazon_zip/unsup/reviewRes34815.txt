I had tried sushi in the past and truly thought it was the most disgusting thing I had ever tasted. Then a friend FORCED me to go here as a b-day dinner, and I am a completely changed person. Even though I just tried this last night, I could eat it again today. Must try! Tried the avacado & shitaki rolls first and was completely happy with my choice. I tried my friend's more adventurous crab rangoon and lava rolls, which were amazing. MUST TRY!
