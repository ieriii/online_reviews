We had been dying to go here and finally got the chance this past Sunday. We walked in and were told there would be a 30 min wait, so we sat in their "lounge" area where we were told we could order a drink. Service there was a tad bit slow. We finally got our beers, I had the "Willie" - very good, but strong - and my hubby had the "Workingman" - just okay. The place looks really nice, I love the light fixtures.  We were seated after about just 20 minutes of waiting, which was great. What was not so great is that we were seated right next to some very loud, obnoxious, drunk jerks. At first, they weren't bothering us, but after a while they decided to speak to us and pretty much insult us. I immediately asked for the manager and requested to be moved - which they did. What was really awesome was that she then went and spoke with these idiots and told them to knock it off. I then heard her tell the waitstaff that they were cut off and if any of them ordered another beer, to call her. They eventually got kicked out.  She then came to our new table and apologized profusely, bought us a drink each on the house (tried the Iron Fist - very good!) and offered us dessert. She also thanked us for calling those guys to her attention. So, service, definitely an A+. I really appreciate how they handled everything, how attentive they were, and how they really tried to make the experience end well, even if it didn't start that way.  The food is pretty good too. The rib-eye steak my hubby ordered was tasty (although I don't usually like rib-eye). I had the mustard-herb chicken sandwich - it was really good. We also shared the bacon popcorn cause everyone we talked to raved about it. I have to say, it's not really my thing so I'll just leave it at that. Overall a good experience. I'll definitely be back.
