1. Had 8:15 reservations but hostess mentioned it would be 20 minutes since they were running a bit behind. Got seated at 9:30pm. 2. Waiter took our drink order. But then had to request the bus guy for our waiter since we never got our drinks. Waiter finally came so we could request our drinks AGAIN. 3. Second round of drinks, we requested an Amstel Light, waiter brought back a Stella. He apologized but then it took him yet another request for the drink to bring it. 4. We received our check and waiter charged us 4 orders of salad bar AND the meat. Not one of us ordered meat. Our dinner 'chip' had been on the black side all night requesting "no meat". (2 friends were vegetarians and 2 friends were full from salad bar). 5.Gave our ticket to valet, took them 30 minutes to bring our car back. (the reason car was the late was because the two couples that had been waiting for their cars BEFORE us...the valets lost their cars. This is not an assumption of what happened. I personally talked to the victims that this happened to). OVERALL: The food was good but way overpriced. When you spend money like that, the service and the ambiance needs to match. Which in this case...IT DID NOT!! I don't recommend AT ALL!!
