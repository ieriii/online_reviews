It was my first time eating Cuban food, and thanks to my experience at Cafe 28, it won't be my last. Try the Ropa Vieja and the Cuban Roasted Pork. The meats were so tender and flavorful - no knives necessary! Plus I have a secret love affair with plaintains and this place loves to serve them up! Run over there! And oh yes, that flavored butter was awesome. Even the flies were trying to get in on the action (ah, the perils of patio seating).
