I love this place! When I come in here, I am always surprised about spacious and clean this restaurant is. You can easily get lost in here. Makes me feel like I'm in a 5 star hotel with the tall ceilings, almost like a palace (not that I've ever been inside a real palace before), but you get the idea. Yeah, the prices are kinda marked up, but that's expected given the prime touristy location. However, they make up for it because of the huge portions. I've been here handful of times and always bring home leftovers. If you have at least 4 people in your group, I'd recommend the Asian Nachos (not because I'm Asian), but because it's pretty good. But it's too much of the same thing for 2 people. If it's just a party of 2, I'd recommend just getting one appetizer and one entree. I did that and still brought some home afterwards.
