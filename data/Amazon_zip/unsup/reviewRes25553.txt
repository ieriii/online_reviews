3.5 stars - the sangria could've been a bit tastier and it is on the pricey side! We were here for a group celebration and had a really nice time! Overall ambiance was nice and our service was consistent and joyful. We sat at a table near the window - it looked right over Michigan Avenue. Since we were in a large group, we just ordered a bunch of small plates; I was really pleased to see a large selection of vegetarian/fish options. In addition to the deliciousness, I thought the dishes were quite imaginative. Would definitely recommend for those that like this type of food.
