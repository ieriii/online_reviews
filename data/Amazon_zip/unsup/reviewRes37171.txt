The Hopleaf is my jam. I, along with the rest of Chicago, love this place. The beer list is extensive and cheap (River North makes me forget how much alcohol is supposed to cost), the food is killer and the staff are awesome. I wish I lived in the area. As it stands, I come here once a month for This Much Is True. Come for the storytelling, stay for the $5 Allagash Whites. And the mussels. Holy balls, the mussels. And frites. And dipping the frites in the mussel sauce. One of life's greater experiences. Just awesome. It's always busy so don't come starving.
