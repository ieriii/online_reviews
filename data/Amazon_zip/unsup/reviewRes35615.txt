Lobster roll was fairly decent - but mostly I just loved the service and the "welcome to our family run restaurant" feel by all the people that work there (not sure if it's family run - but they sure made it seem that way). I was only at the Oyster Bar - but honestly, that seemed like more fun an atmosphere than the more nicely appointed restaurant itself.
