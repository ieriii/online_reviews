Definitely a fan of the expansive brunch menu at Wilde. My Diet Coke was the only thing that fell flat at our table. My party ordered a variety of dishes: beet and goat cheese salad, chipotle turkey burger, buffalo chicken sandwich, and - of course - the breakfast burrito (because what brunch is complete without a breakfast burrito??) Everything was great. Also thumbs up for the library-esque decor and no wait!
