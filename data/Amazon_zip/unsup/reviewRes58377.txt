I don't know why everyone loves it so much. Maybe it's the atmosphere... I tasted their pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket and I must say that it's nothing that I couldn't make in my oven or a crock pot. Even though whole q seems to be sprayed with a smokey febreze (that's how I imagined it at least :p LOL) inside, you won't taste any real smoke in the meat. I must say that I was very disappointed with the food I was served, not because it wasn't cooked well, but because it promised to be bbq and it didn't deliver. If you want to taste how the real bbq should taste like visit Smoque BBQ (I absolutely love this place even though I'm not the fan of the atmosphere). If you want to get together in a goldcoast atmosphere (how Jenny H. said), then q is a good choice.Tasting their meat I came to realization that if the restaurant offers you four different sauces to cover up the taste of meat, it should tell you right away that it's not a real bbq. Anyway, I gave to stars for pickles.
