The food is decidedly good here. I think the vast majority of people here will agree to that. I don't think it's an amazing value though. I don't think I've eaten $60 worth of food there, which makes it difficult for me to go back. I did enjoy a couple of tequila cocktails, which were worth $10 a piece. Perhaps I'll go back to the bar, but I can't see myself heading back there for food on my own.
