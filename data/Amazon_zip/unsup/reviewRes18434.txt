Checked out The Bad Apple on a Friday night around dinner rush, and still only had a 30 minute wait. For a place this hyped, that's not bad at all. We were seated and almost immediately visited by our server. I know many reviewers have complained about the service, but ours was fantastic. I was immediately overwhelmed by the drink menu. Hundreds of options staring me in the face was a bit much, not to mention the two page draft list. The immense selection caused me to miss that my favorite hard cider was available, but if your biggest complaint is that the drink selection is too big, you're doing pretty well. I decided on a sandwich, rather than a burger. I went with the Tango and Hash, which features brisket hash, two over easy eggs, and white cheddar. It was delicious, but messy. Throughout the meal, our server was in and out to refill drinks and remove empty plates almost before we had a chance to notice it was needed. Despite what others have said, there's very little I can find to complain about here. The skull-heavy decor was lacking, but that's probably the only real complaint I can come up with. And the ketchup was just fine.
