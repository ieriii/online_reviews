AMAZING! Seriously, AMAZING AMAZING food. I was completely blown away. With a name like "Purple Pig" (I'm from out of town), I actually thought it was some sort of BBQ joint (sorry). So I wasn't sure what to expect when some colleagues of mine decided to dine here for lunch. The service was fantastic. Our server helped us make some really great decisions for lunch. A few items that really stood out for me: the smear! Specifically, the crushed tomato smear on top of the toasted garlicky bread. It was out of this world good - so of course, we had to get another order. Also, the octopus. I was a little uncertain at first, thinking it was going to be chewy, but it had a meaty texture and delicious flavor. Again, amazing! Also had an assortment of veggie dishes, razor clams, the breaded pork - fresh and succulent flavors. Everything tasted so good...I wasn't disappointed with one bite. I can't wait to get back to Chicago and try some more dishes! Be forewarned - the dishes are all meant to be shared. So, make sure and go with at least 2 but ideally 3 people.
