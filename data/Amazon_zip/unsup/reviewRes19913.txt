Having heard horror stories about lines, I made plans to get to XOCO for breakfast at 8:00am on a weekday. I had a breakfast empanada and an order of churros. The empanada was decent, though not spectacular, and was topped with a little too much cheese. The churros were fantastic--amazing what one can do with fried dough and some sugar. I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant--modern, yet warm and inviting. It really was a bit of an inspiring and invigorating place to start the day. Yes, perhaps it is a tad expensive for a relatively simple breakfast, and I see how long lines could quickly kill the mood, but overall it is a solid place that I hope to visit again.
