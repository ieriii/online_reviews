Living in the "south" I guess I should know what fried chicken tastes like at least. Had lunch here with my sister and sampled the Seoul Sassy and the Spicy BBQ sauce! Both were really really good... I tended to like the spicy bbq better than the seoul sassy - but everyone wins no matter what flavor they choose. I was very impressed with the flavors... the dining room is a little cramped, but that is a very good sign that the food is worth sitting on top of people and sharing large tables. Was totally a fan of the bar seats that face outward onto the street. We were able to enjoy our chicken and watch the snow fall outside.
