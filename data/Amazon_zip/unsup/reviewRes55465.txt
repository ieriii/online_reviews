Made reservations for 8:30 pm but had to wait til past 9:00 pm for a table. The wine list was extensive and the waiter helped make a selection. It was just ok. Had the antipasti (sp?) appetizer shared at the table. Some items were ok but overall nothing great. My pasta dish was very good. Black linguine noodles with seafood (mostly calamari) in a tomato broth/sauce. I'd order it again.
