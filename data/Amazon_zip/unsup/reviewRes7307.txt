The food and atmosphere at this place are outstanding. Came here with a big group, and the service couldn't have been better. We ordered a ton of food (which we later discovered wasn't necessary due to the huge-ness of their portions), and we weren't disappointed with any of it. I'm not a corn bread fan, but even I had seconds of this stuff. I had the pulled pork and fries, and it came with an assortment of bbq sauces to choose from. ALL, were delish. Everyone was happy with their food, and the mac n cheese was the standout of all of the shared dishes. Go here and expect great food and service, but make a reservation. The place was packed!
