This is a fancy restaurant. It is fancy because it has a glossary and because the people eating here look like they like fancy things. But it was good food. Lots of fancy food. And fancy people! I can't remember what we had. Here's my best estimate. I think the bill came over to a little bit over $100. -"Whipped feta" with cucumbers -Water served out of fancy glasses -3 expensive as hell cheeses that were probably good if it weren't for my poor peasant palate. And some fruit jam that tasted like jam. Mmm jam. -This big pork steak thing, with some funny-named sausage spread and a tiny salad that tasted like lemon and grapes. It was good. And expensive. But, hey. -Some sort of marinara sauce with feta? cheese, and then mixed with neck meat. Of an animal, I'm guessing (human neck meat would be strange and probably illegal). -Chicken skewers, with fried something-potatoes. Like those chicken poppers (that got discontinued?) at mcdonalds and fries, except where everything is much better. The chicken was...really juicy. In a good way. Very satisfying actually, I was surprised you can even do that with chicken. And there was this yogurt sauce thing beneath it, the kind you usually get slopped all over your gyro. -Octopus and potato things. It was good octopus and potato things. -"The sicilian eye of iris in italy" or something fancy. It amounted to ricotta and chocolate melted inside of this fried dough. It was good but cost $7. It had powdered sugar on top. Hooray. -Some fancy salad with some nut or what not, and then asparagus. Mm. This place is good. But it's out of my budget, so back to McDoubles and McChickens for me. Pretending to be rich without the existential crises was fun for an hour, though.
