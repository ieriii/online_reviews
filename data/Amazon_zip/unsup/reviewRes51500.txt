Given my respect for Yelpers' opinions, I am shocked to see how highly regarded Garcia's is. whatithink's review is spot-on. If you give four and five stars only for a lot of food and a good price, then you should also give Old Country Buffet five stars. Garcia's IS cheap and serves huge portions, but the food is really not that great. The cheese in the burritos isn't melted and the beans just sort of taste like lard. Also, the burritos are so big because about 75% of that is rice. Meh. Will it do in a late night pinch? Sure, I'd go there over Taco Bell. But when I have a craving for Mexican food for an actual dinner, there are so many other options that serve truly high-quality food.
