I took the whole family to Demera. It was the first time for the kids and my wife and I hadn't had Ethopian food in over 10 years. It was very good. The appetizers were delicious and the main course sampler was also top notch. Nice selection of African beers. The food was spicy, but spicy flavorful versus blow your mouth off spicy.
