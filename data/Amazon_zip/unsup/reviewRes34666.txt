Great place for easy, every day kind of sushi! I prefer Sushi X for takeout or delivery. Their decor is fun, but there are cosier places. With that said, if you do decide to dine in, I recommend going with a small, chill group of friends. I like going with girl friends when we're looking for an easy BYOB evening. For food, I suggest their honey roll, their Philly with fresh salmon and easy cream cheese (they like to load up on the cream cheese, so easy is still plenty), their spicy boiled shrimp (ebi) add avocado, spicy tuna, and their crab rangoon roll or red dragon roll if you like the big, crazy rolls. I also highly recommend their miso and their creamy ginger salad. Their rolls are huge, so you likely need only 1.5 - 2 rolls per person. On average, $20-$25/person.
