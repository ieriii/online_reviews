One of my favorite pizza places. Micro-brewed beers are awesome, I wish their better ones were available for growler fill ups. The wait would be doable if the bar area was larger or had a better flow. Service can be hit or miss. Usually the ladies that work there are on the ball. The wanna be hipster guys working there need to wake up before they come into work.
