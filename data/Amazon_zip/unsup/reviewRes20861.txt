First and foremost the food here was great, filling and tasty. The service was attentive if our particular server was a little cosy (I like people but I need to get to know them before I want to hang out). One issue that should be noted: this is NOT what I would consider a gastropub. Why? Because they don't have more than 20 beers on tap. I would guess they have about 10 which is acceptable but not really on par with my expectations.
