This place looks questionable from the outside - it's just a big black box of a restaurant - but I'm so glad we went in! We were meeting folks here and they already had a table, so I have no idea how good initial service was. We came in and pointed to our friends and the staff smiled and waved us in. I found the service to be friendly and relaxed. They were always there to make sure we were ok but weren't up our asses. Bonus for the BYOB. And it's hands off BYOB to boot! I hate it when you go somewhere and they take it to divy back to you. We just plopped our bottle on the table and took care of ourselves - also - no corking fee! We ordered edamame (fab, hot and lightly salted - yum!) and four rolls per couple. Everything we had was delicious - I especially liked the Buddha roll which came with a yummy dipping sauce. I swear I had no hope for it as it's just a veggie roll - but it was sooo good. The bill came and I was scared. Edamame and 8 rolls of sushi? And not just lil' sushis - special monster size rolls - I was expecting it to be super pricey. With the bill split in half - per couple - we paid a low to average cost for a really nice dinner! I mean it... like fifty bones. That's almost cheap. All in all - I had a great experience here. Interesting rolls, BYOB and nice service. I'll be back.
