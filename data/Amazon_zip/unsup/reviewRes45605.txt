Went to Wilde for Sunday brunch. Totally got sucked in by the exterior. The patio was full of beautiful plants and the open windows; overall very inviting. Once we got in, we were unfortunately seated in the back of the restaurant, where no sunlight could reach. We did get in an interesting table, though. Low, with big, comfortable chairs, in this pseudo set of a library with a fireplace. Little confused by the ambience of this place. Why were we setting between two fake bookshelves, with lowlight in the middle of the day, listening to the top 40 blare through the speakers? Plenty of flat screen televisions around the area, which had the federer/nadal, match on. The overall dcor seemed to be somewhere in between a old spice commercial and retirement home (we think it was going for an old Irish themed restaurant...not working) Our server was okay, at best. Once again didn't seem to fit in with anything else about the restaurant (except maybe the top 40). The servers were all wearing light green colored polo shirts and khaki shorts with old cocktail aprons. His style of service was non-existent. "Hey guys, what can I bring you besides water?" was his opening remark while sitting down across from us. Very uncomfortable. We got bloody marys. Okay, way too salty. Had to ask for water refills numerous times (for Sunday hangover brunch, not acceptable). For food we order the brunch burrito and a baked egg dish with brie cheese. Wanted this dish without the ham, server didn't even know if that was possible, had to go and ask. Got it without the ham, incredibly salty, can't imagine what it would have been like had the ham not been omitted? Brunch burrito was mediocre. At least its giant portion could have made up for that, but we couldn't even get half way through it. Best part about the brunch was the rosemary potatoes. Overall, bad food, bad service, awkward ambience, great rosemary potatoes!
