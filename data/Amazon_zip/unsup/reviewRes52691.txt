Brazzaz is the best steakhouse I've been to in the city. Oh man, we started of with an amazing salad bar, I forgot to mention we sat right by the window while tourists looked at our diner and gave us the thumbs up. The Brazillian Beer was very good as well. They gave each patron a token, one side says more meat, one says less. I think the night we went, they had about 15 - 20 different cuts of meat including prime rib, filet mignon, lemon chicken, lobster, pork etc. Literally, within two seconds of turning the token over, we had five "gauchos" in line waiting to serve us. Service was outstanding, our waiter Phillip (?) was exceptional. The cheesy warm garlic bread, and fried bananas were excellent also. Reservations are recommended but not necessary, it was about $50 each for two people, with drinks and tip about a $150.00. Fantastic.
