I love Mexican, been eating it around the city for many years and this was a place that had been on my radar for some time, especially after my cousin moved to Pilsen last year. Finally got to try it on the 2nd. Went with two others, arrived on the early side of dinner ~ 5pm. While we were able to find a nifty parking spot in the somewhat hidden free parking lot, the restaurant already had a nice crowd and small line for the main dining room. We brought a few bottles of wine, no corkage fees to be found on the menu, and dug in to our inexpensive meal. Chorizo tostados looked really good and not greasy at all. Taco plates are cheap as heck! I splurged and ordered shrimp fajitas, and got a positive response from the server which got me excited. Huge plate of steaming veggies and shrimp which provided plenty for leftovers the following day. As we were enjoying our wine and lingering for a few more minutes, the woman behind us stopped at our table to ask what I had ordered, as it smelled so delicious. The only downside was the guac, which on the menu for my order stated it came with avocado and rice, but it was just a squirt of somewhat industrial looking guac, but that didn't turn me off, as the veggies were so plentiful and tasty.
