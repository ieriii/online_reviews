We came for a birthday, and it took me 1 month to book this reservation. We came on a saturday & still had to wait 20 minutes for a table. The service was slow to start, meaning that we got plenty of water & popcorn, but couldn't order for a while. I have to state that the place was BUSY with loud rock music & an older crowd. We debated whether to order the course menus, but seeing how bored looking the couples around us were (just waiting for food), we decided not to. We ordered popcorn (free) - coated with fat & cilantro, YUM bruleed fig - good, wish there was more cuttlefish fettuccini - ok, very fishy sea scallop - very good wagyu shortrib - very good roasted pear - ok pistachio pudding - YUM with cocoa nib! The food was in small portions that are sharable between 2 people. However, I think it's too expensive for the amount of food we ate, and the music was too loud.
