I loved everything I ate at the Greek Islands. We had a shrimp dish (I won't even attempt the spelling of the name), some roasted red pepper appetizer, a yummy bean soup, and of course the flaming cheese. Actually, the flaming cheese is the primary reason I even seek out Greek food, but I digress... The atmosphere inside the Greek Islands is pretty darn cute. You feel kind of like you are on the streets of a little village. The service is good, but really almost too good. It became a running joke at our table that as soon as a sip would be taken from the water glass, someone would rush right over to top it off. I personally don't appreciate that kind of hovering, though I reckon it is preferrable to not having the water refilled at all. Overall, my experience at this restaurant was fantastic and I would definitely return. Opa!
