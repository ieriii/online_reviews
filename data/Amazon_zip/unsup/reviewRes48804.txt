We saw mixed reviews for this place, but one of our friend's friend strongly recommended it, so there we were. It is an impressive space with lots of beautiful lighting, tall ceilings, and beautiful (rustic) seating. The bathrooms are a sight (you have to see it), and the bar is gigantic. We ordered spicy pork grinds, country rib, frits, spaghetti squash, oysters, mussels, waffle, and lemon tart. I have to say, everything was beautiful to look at, but not as tasty as I'd imagined. Some are too salty, too dry, just not really worth the money or the hype.
