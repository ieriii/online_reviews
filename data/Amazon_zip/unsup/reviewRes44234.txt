super cool cakes and pastries. their food products aren't the best i've had, but they're decent. i often use this place as a study venue and, for that, it's a great destination (although it fills up often) - nowhere near as noisy as a starbucks, and you're supporting independent local business.  sadly, the coffee sucks. but i think starbucks' coffee sucks, too, and i'm clearly in the minority on that opinion.  the jaded hipsters working the counter aren't particularly friendly, but they're not slouchy. i emailed inquiring about a birthday cake order once via alliance's website but never got a reply.
