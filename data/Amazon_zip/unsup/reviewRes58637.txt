I heard this was the best Mexican food in Chicago. It is not. The food was not just mediocre, it was bad. I ordered the tampiquena and the enchilada de mole was filled with and topped with....a ton of cheddar cheese! What? It was disgusting, greasy and I was so disappointed. The salsas were not anything special, the meat was low quality, and the veggies were wilted. The guacamole tasted like it came out of a package. The beans were dry and bland. There was really nothing I liked about this place and I cannot believe all the hype surrounding it.
