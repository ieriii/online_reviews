We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The location was great. It was within walking distance to most everything: Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile and Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due. We had a beautiful view looking over toward the river and the Wrigley Building. I stay at Embassy Suites whenever I can and find them to be consistent in quality where ever they are. This location was no exception. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The complimentary breakfast was excellent. The hotel staff was helpful and attentive to our needs. We had a wonderful stay.
