So i finally went to this place on a tuesday night last week to catch up with a friend who is moving away. I thought it was nice, and had a pleasant time- but im not rushing to go back. We walked in at about 11pm and gave our name and number to the host and walked down to Flat Iron to get a couple cheap drinks, and go the call about 30 mins later. Ok, so seriously, i dont think this place is straight out of Alice in Wonderland. I hold that book/movie/story in very high regard and there just wasnt enough whimsy there to sell me on it. The only thing i thought was reminiscent of it were the tall chairs. I had the Hush & Wonder and the Juliet and Romeo. Both were good- i liked the Juliet and Romeo better even though im not a gin drinker, it was very refreshing and light. My friend had the Dark and Stormy and the Empire Builder. The Empire Builder was REALLY GOOD. All in all, the experience was just ok. Drinks were good- but not as strong as everyone says (maybe im just a booze hound), and the ambiance was cool, but not enough to awe me. I probably would have liked it better if i could have sat at the bar. This is someplace i would go drinking with my mom when she comes into town. hilarious highlights: -dude next to us saying "this drink tastes like SHIT" (wonder what he got) - the girl across the room who kept streching her leg out and putting her foot in her dates crotch. She obviously came for the classy atmosphere.
