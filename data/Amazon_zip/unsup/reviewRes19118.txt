So good! I had no clue what anything on the menu was but I heartily enjoyed my meal. All three of the people in my group enjoyed their food. Its definitely not like any other place I've been. Its mostly sandwiches (I can't recall what they call them) but some are baked and some are pressed so there's variety. Its a small amount of tables so be prepared to wait and possibly share a table. We ended up getting to know our table mates and it was fun. If you're nearby, I highly recommend this place. Btw, I think the name of the restaurant is pronounced "cho-ko" but don't quote me on that, lol.
