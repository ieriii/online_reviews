This place was really great... the food was really good and the price was very fair. I ordered the Clam Carpelli and it was delicious. I ordered carry out, so I didn't get to do the whole dining experience but the staff was nice and it seemed like a great sit down place too. I will definitely be back to dine in, and I recommend it to everybody to try as well!
