Piece is still as great as ever, but on Monday I encountered two things that I had never seen before: 1. Good service. My visiting Steelers-fan friend wanted to watch the Monday Night Football game, but our seats were too far from any of the TVs. He asked the hostess if we could be reseated (this was after we had ordered drinks) and, despite the 95% full dining room, she moved us to a booth on the higher level, less than twelve feet from a large screen. 2. Chocolate pizza. You need to save room for dessert. Take home most of your dinner in a box if you need to. The chocolate pizza is amazing. The crust is the same as their regular pizza, which helps to offset the sugar explosion atop the pie. Marscapone cheese, chocolate sauce, and some other kind of flavoring like perhaps hazelnut. Wow. And like the regular pizza, it still tastes great after it's cooled to room temperature.
