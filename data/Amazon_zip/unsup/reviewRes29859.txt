I'd say this place is my new fav thai food resto in Chi-town. I stopped in one day on the way home from a long hard day of work and was delighted with the freshness of the ingredients and flavor. I had the pad thai as I always do and this one stood out from all the other pad thai dishes I've had so far in Chicago. There is something different and I can't quite put my finger on it but it's fabulous! So light and yummy and full flavors. I felt good eating it and not bad at all. No mystery here, just good quality thai food.  Woohoo, so glad it's right around the corner. :)
