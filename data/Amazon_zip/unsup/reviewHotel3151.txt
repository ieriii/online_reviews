For the amount, I wasn't too impressed. While I do enjoy the decor, it's a little too trendy for me. The loud, thumping music and the candlelight at night -- gimme a break. Plus, they gave me a smoking room when I requested a non-smoking room. Then I asked for a non-smoking room again and they didn't switch me even though they had other rooms. Annoying! Breakfast was yummy the next morning though, I will give them that.
