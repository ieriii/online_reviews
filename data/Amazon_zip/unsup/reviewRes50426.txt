Now if you are in Chicago visiting or just moved there this is a good landing spot financially and socially because its a sports bar at its finest and celebrities pass through alot especially sports Celebs. The atmosphere is more lay back energetic than Technotronic/punk. Every time i have been there the bar seaters always strike good mature conversation and the staff is super responsive awesome and on it. It has a couple of levels so you can also book a level for a private party or something of the sort and it comes with a massive package list of options, which i think is pretty neat. It has the main bar on the ground level. A lounge in the basement and a seated dinning area on the second level over looking the ground floor. Its a good bar to spend a staturday night at if you want conversational clubbing + there is no dress code.Prices are reasonable $ - $$$ because they have bottle service for 350ml bottles and 750mls as well did i mention that they sell 40z Oh Yes!!!!! Their food is amazing and personaly i would give it 5stars for food found in bars because its Delish. Vallet parking is available as well in the single digits and there is always a good crowd ranging from 21 through 50 but a good mix they all come dressed to impress. If you enjoy sports bars then you will not regret spending your money here over a good game. I think its wicker parks finest for young professionals.
