I have just been once before this place re-opened, but the best meal of my life. Ever. Just loved the food, and loved the environment, love the BYO idea. Love that you get to interact with the chef's. Loved the music playing. Just my idea of the perfect meal. Don't love that you have to plan three months in advance, though. I actually might be in an upcoming Budget Travel issue suggesting this place.
