Listen LISTEN dearest owners/management of F&O: What happened? Why oh why have you turned into an overpriced Dominick's? oh gosh I feel like that is being rude to Dominick's. This used to be my super favorite place to shop for fresh seafood - great meats - awesome vegetables - Now all I get is : "no we don't carry that anymore, no you can order it and it will be in two days? no sorry never heard of that?" Oh gosh and the service - they seem some deer in the headlights perplexed..... Do you all remember when the fish case looked amazing and you could arrive and decide what you wanted to serve for dinner by perusing the selection ??? now it is just blah and empty - two blocks away the Dominick's seafood looked fresher. and seriously who is in charge - empty slots-empty trays - I guess F&O is not long for this world - they have a new cafe? WHY? are they a restaurant? F&O focus on what you are a MARKET = call dean & deluca maybe they can help. Please train the produce people to order things from USA! (like jewel) I don't need new zealand apples in June. sigh now I have to traipse to Treasure Island but seriously - I can't waste my time going to F&O - and so if I have to go to two other stores why buy my cheese here when I can go to Pastoral and they are WAY more service oriented.... yea maybe they should just rearrange and be a coffee/take-away/candy shop and leave all the fresh food behind don;t waste it! As my mom says - you can never go home - I will relish the memories and hopefully Treasure Island will have me back
