Stayed here on the, "Come and Play" promo rate of $139 per night which included 2 nights of parking and 2 free cocktails. Great deal. I have stayed at SO many W hotels...I used to prefer this one over Lake Shore but I'm starting to re-think that. The rooms at Lake Shore are bigger. We stayed in room #1715 which was a Wonderful room with a king-size bed. I was shocked at how thin the walls were--I heard the baby crying in the room next to me. UGH. I've never had this problem during prior stays. Front desk staff is very accommodating. Kudos to the maid for replenishing our Bliss toiletries every day with new ones (even if we still had full ones). I found the bartender in the Living Room bar to be completely bitchy. I ordered a glass of wine and Shirley Temple for my niece and it was as if I had asked her to drive to Evanston to get the ice to put in the Shirley Temple. Rarely do I forego tips but she didn't get a tip from me because of her attitude.
