I really enjoyed my first visit to this new restaurant. The food was outstanding, better than many restaurants in Barcelona. The service was top notch. It is very pricey and some Americans may be put off by the menu...but I highly recommend the risotto with morel mushrooms and asparagus, calzuela, etc. I liked the ambience and there is a great bar selection. The only strange thing about the place is it looks closed when you arrive from outside. It is all dark...just open the door and you will discover a small bar...head upstairs for the dining room which is airy and has large windows overlooking Grant Park.  The food includes typical Spanish tapas and novel tapa creations...try both!
