We have traditionally loved Wakamono. The sushi is always good. It's reasonably priced. And it's in a good location. But we recently had an experience, which is partly our fault. We did bad math with our group, and left *slightly* less than the appropriate tip on a cash purchase. Rather than say anything, the waitress slammed down the change tray on our table and had haphazardly circled the total. I redid the math, added a couple dollars to bring us up the good standing, and left without bitching about it. It burned me up, though, and I think a mention on Yelp was necessary. The staff can be kind enough to ask. It wasn't as if we raced out hoping they wouldn't figure out the bad tip. There were plenty of nicer ways to approach the subject. It definitely left a bad taste in our mouths and we'll likely not go there for a while.
