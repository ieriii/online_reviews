Horrible service WITH attitude from waitstaff & management! Woo-hoo! Overpriced "farm fresh fare" & beverages! Sticky seats & tables! Over-cooked eggs w/o a smile! Bland as all get-out! Sweet potato fries NOT actually *free* despite advertisements. Did I mention "Cha*Ching"??? These yuppies need to keep tryin'! Maybe one day they'll get it right. They may have the Loyola campus fooled, but those of us who eat more than Ramen will stick to our cookbooks.
