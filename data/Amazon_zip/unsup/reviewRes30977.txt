We've been there once and can't wait to go back. I did get the feeling that I wasn't quite hip enough, though I always get that feeling around hipsters. The food was great. I loved the hummus appetizer and the cake with vegan "cream cheese" frosting was absolutelty fantastic. I've been dreaming about that cake ever since. I tend to get a bit overwhelmed at all-veggie places because I can eat anything on the menu as opposed to most eating establishments having just one or two choices. Everything on the menu sounded super tasty and I was pleased with both my and my fiance's dishes. I definitely want to try more though. And now I'm thinking about that darn berry cake again. Mmm...
