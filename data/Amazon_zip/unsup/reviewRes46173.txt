Grand Lux is a no-brainer. The service and food are both consistent, but neither are ever outstanding. The portions are pretty grand though, so it's a good place to go when you're starving and just want a decent meal downtown. The price is right given the portion size. A foodie might scoff at Grand Lux, but ultimately, it fills your stomach and tastes pretty good.
