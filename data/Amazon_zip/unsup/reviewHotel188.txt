Formally a DoubleTree Suites, the hotel has graduated to Hilton status. That said, to me it still feels more like a doubletree than the big H. You know, a tiny convenience stand located in a small lobby. Decent but not fine furniture and interior.  That said, still a fine, clean and well maintained hotel.  Keep in mind, the locale is very central...close to many ChiTown sites, but also in a sterile neighborhood, lacking character.
