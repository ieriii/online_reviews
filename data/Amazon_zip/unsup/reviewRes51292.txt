My family has ate here a couple times, and yay! we're fans. There is plenty of street parking, although you may have to walk a bit to the restaurant. There may be a wait..but it has never been as long as they estimated. We went once and they estimated a 30 minute wait. 10 minutes later, we were seated. They have free, endless chips and salsa, huge huge portions, and very reasonable prices. I prefer the steak or chorizo over the chicken.
