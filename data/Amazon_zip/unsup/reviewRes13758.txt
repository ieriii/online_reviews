Still going strong, but now you can actually get a table at, say, 8pm on a Wednesday or 1pm on a Saturday. Revolution is such a crowd-pleaser (and was such a David R-pleaser on my first visit) that I sited one of my two birthday dinners here a few months ago. Our group of five had a great time and had nothing but praise for the food and service that night. After a few visits, the regular menu is starting to look a little stale to me. However, there is always something good on the specials menu. Last time it was the special pizza. Yesterday I spied an intriguing little number--tofu "chili dog" with vegetarian chili, avocado, jalapeno, pickled onions, and white cheddar cheese curds. Whoa! Now that's creativity. I was voraciously hungry but couldn't pass that up...and it was effing amazing. It's not a tofu hot dog, but a long slab of regular tofu, the whole thing served on a foot-long hoagie roll and just begging for the knife-and-fork treatment. It was huge and delicious and I loved every bite, and I'm saying that as a dedicated carnivore. Speaking of which, on my last visit, the sausage and ham plate was disappointing. The linguica and the pork rillette were good, but the ham and the other sausage were very bland. I understand the quantity economics of charcuterie, so I'm not asking for more food, but for $14, those meats should display a profusion of flavor. I'm honestly not much of a fan of the Iron Fist, but the Cross of Gold is still one of the best local beers in recent memory. Yesterday they were (sadly) out of the Oktoberfest, which allowed me to try the "When the Sh*t Hits the Fan" brown ale--a B+ beer, unfortunate name aside. I also got to try a few sips of Eugene porter--also a B+. If I lived close enough to be a regular, I could definitely get into their specialty brewing series. As a quarterly visitor, I will stick with the Cross of Gold and try a few new ones here and there. I wouldn't mind seeing them change up that menu from time to time though.
