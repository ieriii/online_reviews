Milk and Honey has a very nice menu and is a cool cafe; however, the service was not good. The staff seemed annoyed to be taking my order. I was with a large group out to lunch from work. Despite telling them we needed to be back fairly quickly, they refused to bring plates out as they were ready and scolded us that we should have called ahead. I was disappointed.
