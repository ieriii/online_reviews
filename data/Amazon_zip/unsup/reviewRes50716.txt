Dear Wishbone, I have been meaning to write you an apology note for some time now. I disparaged your brunch last February, but I had to be honest with myself: brunch is just pretty disgusting no matter where you go. You didn't do anything wrong, you just can't help it. So, lets call it a truce and pretend that review was just my assessment of brunch in general. I have had three scrumptious and cheap lunches with you since then and you have made me, my belly and my wallet very happy indeed. Keep up the good work, I promise not to write any more missives in the future. Your friend, M
