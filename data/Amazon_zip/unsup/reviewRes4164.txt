I've been wanting to try out Schwa since it opened and I thought it was either 1. A hair salon 2. Some weird polish restaurant or 3. Someones house. Then I found out what was really going on up in there and my friend Megpie and I made our rez! We went on a Wednesday I was psyched just for the experience. Small little intimate room reminded me of NYC and Brooklyn, I'm not sure why--classic colors etc. The shwarmy 6 top that I almost punched in the face next to me (one guy was screaming INTO the kitchen to turn up the music, turn down the music, what is this music, hey ladies need s drink??) was the only downpoint. Soon enough they, and the gold coast cloud they came in on left. Then it was down to business. Totally personable service from the owner, wonderful explanations, great pairings or wine to food (they gave us some of theirs because the Merlot I brought would be too heavy) We rocked out, the music was sick (metal, Wutang, Gorillaz) and food amazing too. I had the brains but got a mental block 2/3 through but they tasted great. The Cheddar beer soup was SOOOO good and the antelope even better. Who knew meat and a chocolate foam could go so well together? Cheap it is not, but worth every penny if your a foodie and want to support the neighborhood and the creative types that make Chicago the bomb ass culinary capital. and to the kitchen--thanks for the hook up ;)
