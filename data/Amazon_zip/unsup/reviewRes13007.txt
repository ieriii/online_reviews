We had such great experiences here in the past and on this visit, on a quiet Thursday night, the service was terrible, everyone was pretty unfriendly and the meat was not as good as it usually is.  We may try it again since we have had such great experiences there in the past but be aware that you are paying top dollar and may not always get the experience you want.
