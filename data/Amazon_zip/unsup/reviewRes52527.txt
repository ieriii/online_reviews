In a town loaded with Brazilian BBQ joints (I think there are about 10 of them total if you count the ones in the suburbs), I can appreciate Brazzaz trying to differentiate themselve from their competition. Risotto and raw oysters are a nice change of pace that actually makes me want to make a trip to the salad bar instead of saving room in my stomach purely for meat. Grilled pineapples and shrimp provide a tasty contrast to the typical assortment of grilled beef/pork/chicken/lamb. And undercutting the competition by not only discounting your dinner to a mere $40 but also mailing everyone and their mom coupons good for 2-for-1 dinners -- can't complain too much about that. It was definitely enough to get me to make a trip in for dinner. Having said that, I don't think Brazzaz is going to win out in the long run. Because despite all the little nuances that make them different from places like Fogo de Chao, Brazzaz disappoints in the one area that matters the most to anyone with a hankering for some churrascaria: the flavor of their meat. Yes, I get that salt is traditionally the only seasoning used to flavor the meats. And yes, I'm a fan of salty foods as much as the next french-fries-loving guy. But that does not mean you should go nuts with your salting. For some, like the lamb chops and the bottom sirloin, the salt actually accentuated the flavor. But for most of the other cuts of meat -- namely the bacon wrapped filet and the garlic filet -- the salt was just too overwhelming. Too salty does not equate to an enjoyable meal. I think it was just a sneaky ploy to make me really thirsty and order more beers.  In any case, if they ever figure out how to properly salt their foods, I think Brazzaz will be able to hold its own against Fogo de Chao. In the mean time, I would only recommend going because it's so much cheaper (assuming you have the 2-for-1 coupon) than the likes of Fogo de Chao and Sal & Carvao.
