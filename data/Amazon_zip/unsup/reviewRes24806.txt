After reading all the yelp reviews for Gja's Cafe, I still decided to go there with our party of 6. I didn't find this place romantic. Mostly because of the tables in the middle of the room, strong oil scent and the noise level. In our reservation (2,5 weeks ahead) I requested a table in more quiet area of the restaurant, but instead we were given one in the middle and nothing could be done to change it . The place was getting crowded and there were no other options for group of 6.  Our guest seemed to like the place ( or maybe they're being polite, not sure), but me and my husband couldn't wait to go somewhere else and finally relax. and we did go out the same night to meet our friends and they all greeted us with:" What's that smell??? fried fish? Ehh." yeah..I could smell it in our car even the next day.  My problem with Geja's was, that I expected it to be more classy but fun and the food was lacking practically any flavor ( the main course.the appetizer and desert were still O'k).. Maybe, if I went there just with my husband on a weekday night and we got only cheese/ chocolate fondue and a bottle of nice Pino Noir.... Still, I am not looking forward to this possibility. And it was not even about price/quantity/flavor disproportion . Geja's isn't the first overpriced place we went. It was just absurdly fake, just selling this idea of fondue as some exotic thing, wrapping it all in a "romantic" glaze. And at some point, looking at the rest of the people in the room, you start wondering how many of them actually enjoy their meal and how many just pretend so not to disappoint their friend/date who chose this place, because , again, it's so romantic.
