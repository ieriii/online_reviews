Hot. Am I talking about the sexy stylings of Coast? The sexy presentation of the delicious food? My White Dragon Lady sushi sensei for the evening, Brett D.? Coast Sushi Bar is one sexy spot for sushi in Bucktown, it's a great date spot, good for Girl's Night "In", or for one of those spouse dates when you can leave the kids at home. Rekindle that fire at Coast! Coast can be crowded, and does not take reservations. Be prepared to wait- but not too long. Service was good, and our server knew the menu and specials, and was pleasant. Spicy was on the docket for the dock up, and we kept to maki rolls on the spicy side: Angry Salmon- spicy salmon, jalapeno w/tempura crumb (good) Volcano- spicy white tuna in volcano sauce (v. good) And the much lauded, and highly touted specialty of Coast: White Dragon- shrimp tempura, fresh scallop, with a complex sauce (Excellent. A Must Order) Coast is BYOB, and your beer or wine will be lovingly cared for and given an ice bath. Looking forward to the next hot meetup at Coast Sushi Bar in lovely Bucktown.
