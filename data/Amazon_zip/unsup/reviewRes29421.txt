I honestly don't understand the fuss. It's classic american cuisine that you can get anywhere in the country. People rave about the shakes, but it's just soy dairy temptation with some soymilk. Easy to make for anyone who has a blender. I also don't like the fact that they claim to support animal rights while nonetheless serving animal products. Native Foods and other places have proven a vegan restaurant can thrive. Why doesn't the Diner finally follow suit?
