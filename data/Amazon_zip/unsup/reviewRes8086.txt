A meat place worth bringing a vegetarian to!!! Ive been to the original in Sao Paolo, Brazil... and this place is just as good! A salad bar containing everything from traditional ceasar salads... to sushi and ceviche. Everything is amazingly fresh and well prepared. After enjoying the salad bar... its time for the real fun to start... with my little green button alway stating that I want more of their delectable meets, of which there are 15 different cuts, I am fully prepared to unbutton my pants and park it for hours.... in addition to the meats constantly being served, the traditional side dishes of warm cheese bread, fried bananas, crispy hot polenta and seasoned mashed potatoes are automatically brought to each table and replenished throughout the meal. Simply amazing!!! I cannot say enough about this place. With the $50 price tag, you better come prepared to eat... and word to the wise... wear loose pants and dont expect to go out afterward. If youre anything like me, you will leave in a food como.... All i have to say is.... FOGO de WOW!!!!
