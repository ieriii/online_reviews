The beer selection is awesome but their food is sub par at best. We started with the croquettes and frites- ok, nothing special. The fries were a little soggy for my taste but I like a fried potato so I ate them. For my main I got the montreal style brisket sandwich. Montreal style at Hopleaf must mean dry, rubbery and flavorless because that's exactly what I got. It was so tough that I couldn't even manage to bite into it and keep it on the bread, the whole sandwich fell apart. My brother in law got the brisket plate and didn't fair any better with a knife and fork. My husband had the CB&J which was good- maybe a decent addition to a brunch menu but not what I would serve for dinner and we also had the stone fruit salad which was a joke. It didn't help that we had to wait forever to get our food- dinner took us over 2.5 hours- totally fine because we were with good company and everyone was enjoying their beers but I couldn't help looking over to see if our table was the lucky one when a waiter with dishes walked by. I know we weren't the only ones because the table next to us asked the waiter three times about their dishes and delay. I wanted to love this place because of the beer selection but that's not happening. Perhaps they should stick to what they are good at.
