This place is great! I stumbled upon it walking to a Bears game one Sunday afternoon. We ordered the fondue and we thouht it was quite tasty!!! My husband and I went for Sunday breakfast and enjoyed it equally more!! The breakfast potatoes with the Brie cheese is so good! the fries with the curry sauce was so delicious too! Will definitely be back!
