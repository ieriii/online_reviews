Chicago q is a beautiful restaurant. It is much bigger than it looks from the street. I had a mint julep to start. I love the southern feel of this restaurant.  You feel like you are right at home.  I like the pickles and chips they give you as a starter. I had the ribs which were delicious!  I am not sure where else you can have BBQ in the Gold Coast. I really like this place.
