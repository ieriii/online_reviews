So I was a vegetarian for quite some time, and while I am not one now, I do remember what it was like to dine out and have to order typical vegetarian fare. While it's fine to have veggies on a plate at some places, The Chicago Diner does Vegetarian food quite differently. They specialize in food that mimics food that is typically made with meat, such as a chicken wrap or a philly cheese steak, all made without meat. So even meateaters can appreciate food here while vegetarians can experience a rare treat; non boring food! This place has amazing food (try their sweet potato fries) and amazing desserts, and some of them are even vegan. Some of the whole foods in the area carry desserts from this diner, and all in all it is definitely a place to try for meat eaters and especially for vegetarians to try something completely out of the box.
