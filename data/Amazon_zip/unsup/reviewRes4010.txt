my tasting at schwa in late december was the best meal i've ever eaten. it is worth whatever hassles you may endure. don't go pissed off, just bring a ton of booze and have a great time.  i wore a shirt featuring the iconic image of raekwon's purple tape and they put "criminology" on during the second course. when i walked back to use the bathroom after dessert they popped a few more of the previous courses in my mouth after i commented on how awesome they tasted. these guys are truly doing their thing for love and for creativity with no motivations for profit/fame and as corny as it may sound, it shows on the plates.  we are not industry people, not particularly what one would describe as well groomed (see: raekwon tees), and showed up with two large paper bags full of booze. they still treated us like VIPS and then brought us a bill that was less than half of what it should have been. i admit to being a cheap dude but we still dropped the full amount plus more because the food was so worth it. go. be enthuiastic. be persistent in making a reservation and exceedingly patient and polite when you get through. it will be worth it.
