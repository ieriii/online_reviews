I was in Chicago a few weeks ago. My husband went for work, I tagged along. So on the day he had a work event, I had nothing planned. Sometimes I just love to wander around a city by myself. I had offers from my mother in law to go shopping but something that day just said "Go on a solo mission". I google mapped Hot Doug's after hearing so much about them and got myself to the Blue Line (was staying in a hotel downtown). Got on the bus and got off at Hot Doug's. There was a long ass line around the corner of the building. I went to the back of the line. Wow this place must be really good. So I stood in line for about 25 minutes while chit chatting with my neighbours in line. I finally got towards the menu and I wanted 2 hot dogs but I knew I wouldn't be able to have both since it was Saturday and I intended on having the duck fat fries. I ended up choosing the Kobe Cincy Dog with the fries and a drink. I even got a picture with Doug while in line. The hot dog was amazing. I usually feel ill after eating dogs but this time did not give me the ill feeling. I wish I could have tried the Jerk hot dog. I love Caribbean flavours. All of the specials sounded great. And I spent $11 with tip. Amazing! I love how Chicagoans takes food to the next level even when it's something as simple as a hot dog. Oh and if you aren't usually in that neighbourhood, I suggest calling them to see if they are open. I think they take holidays off, etc. I think if Doug is not there, the place is closed. They are only open till 4pm on the days they are open.
