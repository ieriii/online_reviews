I asked our waiter where they got their buffalo mozzarella, because I cook with mozzarella enough to recognize the best damn product available. His response? Italy.  Although I was disappointed that I couldn't source my cheese from the same place they do, the disappointment stopped there.  Had a miracle experience here, where we arrived on a cold and snowy night with a line out the door - we prepared for a long wait... but we were the only party of two waiting in a crowd of what must have been 20-30 people and we were whisked to our table!!! I didn't ask questions, but rather immediately ordered beer, wine and a bounty of delicious bread cheese, and melted cheese on bread with ingredients just as good and fresh as the aforementioned mozzarella on something called "pizza".  I'm starting to get spoiled by all the insanely good authentic Italian pizza around here - among D.O.C., I Monelli, Antica Pizzeria - Spacca Napoli stands near the top if not the best.  I'd probably try to avoid the crowds, but to be honest it would be worth the wait.
