Have been to Bin 36 3 times in the past few months and it never disappoints. The wine list is extensive and fairly priced. The food is terrific. Each items is a 'tasting experience' in its own rit, from the fantastic fries to the lamb meatballs to any of the desserts. Very creative menu. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly (have been served by Barbara with help from Enoch). Fun place to go for an evening.
