OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH YEAH!!!! My kinda place! Meat fest. Go ahead and eat so much meat you get those meat sweats. I love places where you can just order a heaping meal with a few friends, and pick away with your hands while you enjoy eachothers company and some good drink. Get the grand mixed platter. That;'s not the name of it, but you'll see it on the menu. it basically comes with everything. We orddered some empenadas and a queso type dip as well. All very good.The only items not raving about were the yuca and chicken. Yuca was a little dry and the chicken was the breast. I'd like to see them throw some small drums or thighs on there instead. Those baby octopus are the best I've ever had. Beautifully charred and cooked to perfection. The steak wil undoubtebly make you happy. Bet a nice bottle of red wine and enjoy yourself with a small-large group. Las Tablas is a meat lovers must.
