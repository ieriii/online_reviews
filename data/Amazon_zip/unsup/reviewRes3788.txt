Given all the buzz about this place, I had to try it. The fried chicken with seoul sassy sauce had great flavor. But, it was a little too sweet for my palate. The crisp BBQ sauce was supposed to be spicy, but it really wasn't. This was even after ordering it extra spicy. So that was just a little disappointing. The Foodie's Choice Crisp sandwich was just ordinary (not unlike other sandwiches I've had). So, if I came back here again, I'd probably stick with eating the fried chicken. Although quite pricey, a half a chicken could easily feed 1-2 people. If you're ordering take-out as well, just cook your own white rice and save yourself the extra $2.50 charge.
