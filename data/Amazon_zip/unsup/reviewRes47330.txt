This place has changed since it opened, a lot. I don't mean that in a positive or negative light. Compromise is an issue that we must all deal with. Sure, they were once billed as the Chicago's First and Only Virtual Venue. Those were great days. Then one day, I assume, that the following happened... Three guys were in a desolate bar. Music videos were playing, but, they were the only ones in the bar. All of them were wearing Cubs hats. One of them said, "Can't we get a game on one of those screens?" The bartender, reluctantly, patronized. Then their friend came. Then evolution occurred. Sucks for me, to a certain degree. It went from a bar that caters to music lovers to a bar that loves sports. The menu, though, has continued to evolve into something that I love. Burgers that are fantastic. If you're someone that tries to compare this place to Kuma's with some sort of buttnut arrogance, lick my pooper. I mean my proper butthole. I can go to Kuma's any day of the week that I have three hours to spare, or, I can drop by a place in my own neighborhood that has half-price burgers on Mondays and actually get a burger that will be equally fantastic. Long ago, I would've given this place a lower rating, even though I preferred the old atmosphere. Today's difference: I can go every Monday and enjoy the best burger special in town. The Electric Chair: Blue cheese, sauteed onions, buffalo sauce, and jalapeno relish. Cost? $4.50 Mondays only, of course.
