For as many "to die for" reviews as i've heard, I was definitely disappointed. I've eaten at three other restaurants that were recipients of the coveted Michelin Star and this one was by far lacking. The meal was in no way deserving of the price. Seems like the price was increased by 30% after the star was awarded. $75 for a tasting menu is a given for a great restaurant, but not for what I received. I payed $125 for the tasting menu at L'Atelier de Joel Rubechon at the MGM and was so much more impressed. Not only with quantity of portion but wow factor. The food at Graham Elliot just didn't have the flavors that made me think, wow, this is amazing. I'm sorry but for $125 for 5 small portions and a 1/4 glass wine tasting pairing is just not worth it at this restaurant. I booked a reservation 3 weeks in advance for 10 people for my fiance's 30th birthday party, and managed to get a waitress whose attitude seemed to exude "I'm getting your 18% percent gratuity no matter how bad I am." Waited 20 minutes and had to remind her about a drink order. The bill was over a thousand...service? Where? Zagats was wrong, Michelin is wrong, Good Morning America is wrong. Chicago foodie bloggers are wrong. Or maybe they were right 8 months ago. Regardless, this restaurant has fallen off its course and will quickly loose the star if it hasn't already. Bristol deserves an upgrade from Bib Gourmand.
