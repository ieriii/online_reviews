I love WISHBONE! I have gone to wishbone twice. Once at their location on Roosevelt road (which Closed) and the second time on their location on Lincoln ave. Both times I order the cornflakes french toast, and boy do they never fail. On New years day 2012 we decided to go out for breakfast, however most places were closed, but thankfully Wishbone was open. I had the their seasonal cornflake berry french toast which was awesome and my husband order their Egg Benedict. I was so happy with my meal but my husband's Egg Benedict wasn't that great. I also had fresh squeeze orange juice which was awesome. I think WISHBONE is a nice cozy, comfort food breakfast, lunch, dinner joint you can enjoy with your family. Prices are very reasonable and the food is great. I will definitely come here again but this time I want to try their dinner menu. I want to have some good old southern comfort food.
