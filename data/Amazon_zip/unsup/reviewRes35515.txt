I love this place and I can't believe I never wrote a review for them. We always get the peking duck combo where it includes the duck http://www.yelp.com/biz_, soup, fried rice/noodles and sorbet at the end. They bring out the duck first http://www.yelp.com/biz_ and take the leftovers and the bones to create the duck soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_ and duck fried rice or noodles. The duck fried rice is better than the noodles. Save yourself some time and ask for extra buns right when you order your meal.
