I stop by here on some mornings to get coffee on my way to the train. I think their americano is the best in the neighborhood - my go-to drink. The Alliance blend intelligentsia coffee is great as well, a bit on the sweeter side. I've never felt the need to add either sugar or cream to a coffee drink from here, since it is always perfectly smooth and mild tasting. Great croissants as well!
