I went here for my birthday dinner, and I was happy about the experience. Here is the break down: Food: Pretty Good, had better, but happy with it. Try the Gyro Atmosphere: Cool, the seating is in levels, looks like Greece.  Service: AMAZING! Valet Parking, whoot whoot!!! And....heaters outside Price: Very Reasonable Overall, good food, great service, reasonable price.
