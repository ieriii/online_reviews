I went here with a group to celebrate a birthday. Although the food was super tasty, the wait was extremely long and almost not worth it. I definitely do NOT recommend Irazu for big groups. We were told that we couldn't be seated until our entire party (of 11) was present, but that they would hold a table for us. False. They gave up our table to another group and we ended up waiting close to and hour-and-a-half. With that said, I would like to go back with a smaller group of four or less. I had the Casado dinner with rib eye steak (served with white rice, black beans, sweet plantains, an over easy egg and cabbage salad). It was super tasty, and I love love loved the plantains! The empanadas were great too. I asked for a recommendation so we ended up trying the potato beef and spinach and cheese ones. The spinach and cheese empanada was my favorite! It's BYOB with no corkage fee, which is nice. I'm hoping to go back and try one of their delicious sounding shakes or horchata.
