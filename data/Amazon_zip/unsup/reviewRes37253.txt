Very overpriced due to the touristy location and proximity to navy pier. The food is ok but it takes forever to get your order. I have been there a couple of times and the shorter wait time was 25 minutes. I am usually way to hungry to wait for this kind of fast food. I think I have figured out how to enjoy this. Go there only immediately after you have eaten. This way, by the time you get your food, you will be hungry. Also, I ordered a grilled cheese and they gave me 3 sandwich halves. I was confused because either they gave me an extra half or someone stole one that I should have gotten.
