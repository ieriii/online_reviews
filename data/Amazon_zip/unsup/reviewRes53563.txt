Yes. just four stars because there's zombies. Zombies who are waiting for duck fat fries and anything fried in duck. All those delicious sausages and hotdogs. I don't want to turn into a zombie and wait in line. Its a good thing I read through these reviews before dropping by. I planned by day so I could drop by during non-peak hours. No food is worth waiting two hours to get. Any place that causes a line to build up outside the shop needs to open another branch. Can I buy a franchise? I want to open shop and eat everything before its sold. Your menu to me is what brains are to a zombie.
