Hot Doug's was worth the 45 minute wait. Four of us braved the misting rain for duck fat fries and specialty sausages.  Highlights - I loved my Marty Allen (thuringer that I topped with mustard and kraut) and the Jamaican Jerk. I sampled everyone else's selections, and really liked the Keira Knightly, the Hungarian Pork, the Creole Bison and the Jack Daniels sausage. We ordered a foie gras dog and shared, and I have to say, I was not a fan. I normally really like foie gras, but this was just a little too much of everything. I didn't find it offensive, I just wouldn't order it again. My least favorite by a mile was the Curry. Yuck. I don't like curry though.  Duck fat fries - this has been covered in a million reviews. Just get them.
