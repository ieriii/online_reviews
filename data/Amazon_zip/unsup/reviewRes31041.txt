Since writing my first review things have changed quite a bit ... for the better!!! Nana is now serving dinner that is totally out of this world. Their seasonal menu can't be beat! I can honestly say that some of the best meals I've ever had have come out of this kitchen. I had a pork shoulder with grits and greens that made me weep a little because it was just THAT beautiful and amazing.  They are currently doing fried chicken dinners on Sundays for $22 a person that is worth every penny. I went with one other person and we got deviled eggs for a starter, biscuits, brussel sprouts, jalapeno coleslaw, mac and cheese, chicken and a full size dessert each. We had so much food that I had dinner for the two nights following. They also now have a liquor license and a bar menu and the drinks are pretty great. I've had quite a few "breakfast drinks" and they've all been great.  *For anyone who was used to BYOB here be careful because the corkage fee now that they have a bar menu is $25 a bottle except for on Wednesdays when it's free.
