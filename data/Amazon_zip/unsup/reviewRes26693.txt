This place rules! Maybe it's because I don't come to Pilsen often so I am good Mexican illiterate. Or maybe it was the 30 minute bike ride a friend and I had completed on our way over, but the food was DELICIOUS.  Combinacion platter delivers. Oh it delivers so well: Tamale - spot on Taco - YES Two other items I don't remember because I wolfed them down. - Mm hmmm. The service is also friendly and quick. Food comes out FAST.
