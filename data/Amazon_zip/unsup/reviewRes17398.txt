doesn't meet the hype I had been hearing about.  Expensive drinks that aren't good enough to warrant their prices. It is quiet and is probably a good first date spot (assuming you are trying to convince some chick that you are classy and actually hang out at places like this on a regular basis.)  I think Matchbox has better drinks. Its more of a bar than a lounge though. I won't go back here.
