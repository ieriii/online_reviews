Piece is my boyfriend's FAVORITE, and definitely his go-to pizza. Thanks to him, I've experienced it in many forms - his leftovers, takeout, and dine in. The leftovers were of the cheese-less kind, which I thought was gross. I'm sorry, I just love cheese too much. Pizza without cheese is just soggy bread with random crap on it that falls off when you pick it up. Then we had their standard pizza (sauce, toppings, cheese) for takeout. Once again, I was somewhat unimpressed, when comparing it with the multitude of standard pizza's I've consumed. BUT THEN, we dined in. The wait was forever long, but worth it. We had the white pizza. Not gross white pizza with alfredo sauce or ranch or something, but just the most garlicky, cheesy masterpiece, made with olive oil in place of sauce. Now, I should mention I was a bit tipsy from the 9% alcohol beer I had while waiting for my table, but I'm pretty certain that pizza was a slice of heaven. That white pizza will keep me coming back over and over again.
