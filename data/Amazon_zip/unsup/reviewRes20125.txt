You're going to see the same raves on my review too! I'm going to gush over the scotch egg, mashed potatoes, and their 3-sausage platter. You can always ask for a little more of their mustard seed sauce on the side if you love it as much as i do. I love the scene here - really cute guys! its a great bar scene for the after-work crowd on during the week. And its a great place to hit up on the weekends if you're going to the Art Institute or Ice Skating nearby.  I've not yet had a bad experience with service here, but the people seem so laid-back and willing to please, that if you did bring something up to management, they would be willing to remedy the situation.
