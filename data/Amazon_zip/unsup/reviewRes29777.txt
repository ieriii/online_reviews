Went there for breakfast today. It's a cute place that was pretty full, so I thought we were in for a real treat. The service was prompt and friendly, and we were seated right away. My boyfriend and I shared the Salmon Benedict and Stuffed French Toast. French toast was pretty good- we got it without the whipped cream. The benedict was ehh, nothing anywhere near special. It comes with salsa verde (random?), which was spicy so we had it with the traditional hollandaise sauce, which was pretty tasteless. Both meals were cold. Definitely nothing special. I want to go back for lunch/dinner because of the reviews but not again for breakfast.
