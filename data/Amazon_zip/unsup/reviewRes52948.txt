I first started watching them building out this small corner place to become the grand 90 Miles. I really truly like this place and continue to suggest it to people when/if they're around the Western/Milwaukee/Armitage area in Logan Square. I frequently walk here from my male-friend's house on California and Armitage and the trek, even in the coldest of winter days, is worth it. The patio is heated during the winter and more open in the summer. They provide a variety of seating, patio, outdoor, inside... and the ambience is very old-school 1950s Cuban cafe. I love the artwork!!! Food is not pricey (read: CHEAP), they provide a good portion per individual and they are delicious. No matter what you do - TRY THEIR PLANTAINS! I usually get the lechon or some other pork meat because I love it... once in a while I get the tilapia sandwich... but I saw a couple get the fish... and it smelled and looked fantastic. The next time I go, I am definitely trying their fish entree. I have never gotten anything from this place that hasn't been good... everything is fantastic and can rival what expensive Cuban restaurant you can tell me.
