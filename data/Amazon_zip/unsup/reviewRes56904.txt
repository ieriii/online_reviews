This restaurant is an old favorite and I'm happy to say it is just as wonderful as ever. Our server was knowledgable, pleasant, accomodating, and timely- really good at her job. Our food was absolutely delicous from the appetizers to the entrees. Although the restaurant was packed we never felt crowded or rushed. The sugarcane-speared shrimp lettuce wrap was fresh and flavorful, the skate appetizer was savory and rich. The whole, crispy, sweet and sour snapper took the prize- I highly recommend this dish. We also enjoyed the spicy grilled shrimp entree- just hot enough and juicy and tender. The entire evening was delightful and the perfect romantic experience for me and my date.
