I have eaten here several times and each time have really enjoyed myself. I love the wine list. Several good, reasonably priced options. I have also had the sangria which is also quite good. Some favorites of mine: bacon wrapped dates, all of their salads, lamb chops, flatbreads, and the pork belly. A bit pricier than Iberico or BabaReeba but much better in my opinion.
