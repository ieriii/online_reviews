We have been coming here since shortly after it opened. And we have NEVER EVER been disappointed. The food is incredible, the atmosphere is great and we absolutely LOVE Jonathan. Every time we have been here (and that's a lot) he always makes it so much fun. Regardless of how busy he is or how crowded it may be, he always makes it a point to make you feel welcomed. And he always has a few minutes to swap stories about Italy. Tonight was no different. We celebrated my husband's birthday and after the desert with a little candle, Jonathan came by with a selection of after dinner drinks to choose from with a lovely description of each one. Mmmmm..... Now let's talk about the pizza - remember when you were a kid and you would get excited about having pizza? As adults, we get just as excited about coming here. This is more than just pizza. I can only say it is incredible! The food, the owner and staff, and the location are all really great. And we love the patio. This is most definitely our favorite place!!
