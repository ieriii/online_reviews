If you plan to go to Hot Doug's, be sure to be ready to wait at least an hour or so. I went on a Saturday morning before it opened and still had to wait 2 hours to be served. Its definitely worth the wait because once you get to that counter, you'll order like everything. I ended up spending around $30 for duck fat fries and 3 specialty hot dogs for two people. Definitely try to Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris and Spicy Beef Hot Link with Coca-Cola BBQ Sauce and Applewood-Smoked Cheddar Cheese.
