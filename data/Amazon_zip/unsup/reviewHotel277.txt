My boyfriend and I stayed at The Seneca on New Year's Eve last year. Now, neither of us are fans of NYE--in fact, we *hate* it--but somehow, The Seneca made it so much better. We booked it on priceline or expedia and for $80, we kind of half-expected it to be a little divey, but this place is definately worth every star. It's in a great location, the hotel is absolutely beautiful, the rooms were great, and the best part about them was the little kitchenettes! Awesome! It made for a New Year's Eve fun-filled night of cooking microwave popcorn and baking cookies! I heart you, Seneca.
