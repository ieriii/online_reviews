If one Pho restaurant on Argyle is closed, another one next door will be open! 777, 888, Tank Noodle, all have a little quirk in their hours, but when Pho 777 was closed we didn't lose a step and headed to Tank Noodle, as so many Yelpers have raved about this place. Tank is clean, nothing fancy, and the menu is huge. Pho, Ba, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do! I had trouble deciding between a classic Pho beef noodle soup and Mi soup. So I went with a Mi with cubed beef, because the broth of nutmeg, clove, and other spices seemed exotic! Add in heaps of fresh basil, alfalfa sprouts, a few jalapenos, and this will cure anything that ails you! I have to say, though, the cubed beef was tender and tasty, but there were huge pieces of cartilage and fat I had to pick out of the soup throughout the meal. At times I felt like I was eating on Survivor. A pot of Jasmine tea was the perfect accompaniment to warm my soul, before I went back out into the Chicago night! Service was quick at the beginning but forgot about us, and we had to flag down the check. Still, Tank Noodle is a solid A-Okay, and I won't hesitate to return to try more of their extensive menu.
