My family and I had reservations for this place. When we got there, they showed us the worst hospitality I have ever seen. First, our table was set for 6 instead of 7. 2nd, they did not want to move us to larger table. The owner told us straight up, Sorry, I cannot move or bring another table for you. I can recommend other places to eat if you'd like. Once he said that, we were out of there. Why should he get our business if he spoke to us like we were of no value to him.
