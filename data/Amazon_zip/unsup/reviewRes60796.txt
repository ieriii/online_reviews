Over the last year my husband and I have been on a burger kick like the rest of the world. We have been all over the city and suburbs trying gourmet burgers from high-end restaurants to city bars to chains with claims of great burgers. We have found many great places. Some we have had huge waits for, some were over priced, some we loved, and some we hated. We loved Lockdown and decided to go back a second time before we reviewed it. The first time there was a concert playing, but this time we got to catch the 2nd and 3rd periods of the Blackhawks game. We split two appetizers and the Big House burger recommended by our server. The mac & cheese rocked, the wings were good, and the burger was as good as any of the great burgers we have enjoyed in the last year. Even the mound of fresh cut fries was great.  Our 1st visit about a month ago was equally as good, but I don't remember what burger we had since we chose our own toppings However, each time the food was good and the service was about average
