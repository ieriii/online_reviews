This place is pretty amazing! Since it was compared to Kuma's Corner, I had to check it out to see if the rumor was true! and it was! I had a burger with sauerkraut, bacon, cheese and it was amazing! So good and juicy! And of course, the extensive beer list HAS to be mentioned. I could study that thing for hours and still not try every beer they have. If you need a place to satisfy acquired taste buds, this is your spot! No wait, cool ambience, and great service!
