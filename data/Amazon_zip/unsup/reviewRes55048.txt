Would not recommend this place if you're interested in seeing or hearing the people you are with. It is too loud and dark in the place to have a conversation with others. In addition, service was extremely slow (we began to set timers to see when they would take our initial order, then when we would get check) and food was overpriced and mediocre. The only positive I can say is the busboys were attentive at clearing dishes and refilling water.
