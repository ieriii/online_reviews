Strong choice. The room is handsome and somewhat masculine, with an old-fashioned yet modern look to it. Whatever that means. Service was fine. Our waitress was knowledgeable and really friendly.  The menu is quite interesting. They offer lots of things with antlers like elk and antelope and rhinoceros (ok, maybe not rhinoceros).  And the food is generally quite flavorful. My boyfriend had the rabbit salad, the mussels, and a side of french fries. The salad was VERY flavorful. The mussels were fresh and abundant, with a sweet and slighly spicy vindaloo sauce. A winner. And the fries were delicious. I had a special soup - oyster mushroom puree with duck confit and figs. Real nice flavors. And for my entree, I had roasted black cod with mustard spaetzle and brussels sprouts. The dish had a pronounced mustard flavor, but it somehow worked. Good flavors all around. Nothing bland about anything we had. Prices are a tad high but not outrageous. With two martinis (it was a hard day) and a (big) glass of wine, our dinner for two, with tip, was $150. Without the booze it would have been closer to $100. In an area of the city not known for innovative restaurants, this place stands out.
