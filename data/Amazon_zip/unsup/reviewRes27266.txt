Hmm... First of all, cash only, kind of sucks. We had to hit the ATM, not that big of a deal I guess, still though. The other thing was that I felt like I was on ice, they must have just waxed the floors or something, I almost busted my s#*t, even the waiters were slipping and sliding. The food was pretty good. Definitely authentic, the soup reminded me of the one my mom used to make. The tortillas were really good, I don't remember exactly why, maybe they were bigger than the norm, but I remember that they stood out for some reason. I had the milanesa and it was kind of dry, the service is good, and the good's pretty good. However, being that it's located in Pilsen, I think I have to hold it to a higher standard so I can only give them three stars.
