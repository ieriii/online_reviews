Geja's is a Chicago Institution for a reason! What a great place. I always take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt because every review just depends on who wrote it. Well, I'm in the restaurant business and I have to say they nailed it. Many reviews mentioned the prices and while it's not the least expensive place to dine but it IS worth every penny! I dined there with my wife for our 1st anniversary and we both agree it's where we'll spend every anniversary going forward. It's unlike any other restaurant I've been too or worked in. What an experience from the first course to last. There was never a dull moment or lull in conversation at our table. At one point we tried to be more quiet because we could tell the people next to us wanted to listen to the guitar player but it was just too much fun! (did I forget to mention they have a live guitar player? Well, they do.) Our server was amazing also, she helped me choose a wine flight that went perfect with every course of my meal. After chatting with her we learned she's worked there for almost 30 years...wow! (busboy was good to). In closing, we left stuffed, happy and more in love than when we arrived. Thank you Prince Geja. We're gonna spread the good word about what a great place you and your staff have built over the years. WE LOVE IT!!!
