This is a solid 4.5 star restaurant - that says a lot as I'm not one to give such high marks for a restaurant. I've always heard good things about thus restaurant and have even tried a couple of the sister restaurants, but I don't think all are created equal. With that said, I'm really happy that we made the decision to go there. It wad a Monday night and I was expecting a 1/2 empty restaurant, but I was surprisingly wrong! The atmosphere is very inviting and the kitchen is open to the dining room which can make it quite loud. We ordered the beef carpaccio with shaved peccorino cheese and capers, and arugula for appetizer. It was very tasty and a great way to start a meal! For dinner I got the pan seared walleye and it also had jumbo shrimp on top as if the walleye wasn't enough by itself! The presentation was very appetizing as well with colors of green, red, and white. (Hum.. I guess they were trying to mimic the colors of the Italian flag!) My dinner date ordered the liguine with scallops in a light tomato cream sauce and it was SOOO GOOD!!! It came in a bowl with lots of noodles and as I was taking a bit (or several), I was thinking that it was a good thing I didn't order that because I would have ate the whole thing by myself!!! The best part of the meal was the desert! Of course we asked for a recommendation as the other suggestions turned out great. Our waiter suggested the chocolate peanut torte (not sure of the exact name). OMG, even though I was stuffed, I couldn't stop eating!!! It tasted like a Reese's peanut butter cup on top of a crust that was made out of a Crunch bar! I thought I had died and gone to heaven! I usually don't take deserts home, but I couldn't see it go to waste and asked for the small piece that was left to be boxed up. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Italian food. Although I would suggest reservations or go when it's not their peak hours because I'm sure this place gets packed on Fri & Sat nights!
