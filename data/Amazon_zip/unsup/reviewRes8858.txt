Following the advice of other yelpers, I found this oasis with incredible food and hospitality that so satisfied my tummy and my guests. Smiling servers, very attentive, with the perfect suggestions and even better presentations of well prepared and mouth melting proteins and starches. Oh so delish hummus and beautiful murals along the wall to complement a soul satisfying evening. Right off the brown line, with a small parking lot adjacent to the new location, NOK rawks it solid and is another gem to make Chicago proud.
