The service was not good. I celebrated my husbands birthday here with 12 friends. The waiter only came over in the beginning, and never again so we were unable to order additional drinks or ask questions. We were told he was busy with another table, yet his tip was included. I was very disappointed. The food was just ok, definitely have been to Brazilian steakhouses that were MUCH better. The place is beautiful, and the rooftop bar is nice but the service is HORRIBLE.
