Ambience and presentation is really what this place has to offer.Sushi was good, but nothing out of this world. I do want to give mention to the spicy tuna rolls...they were quality, and different from what I am used to, which makes them good. Service is greatThe place is pricey...and I can't justify paying that much, when there are better places that are cheaper.If your looking for a cool trendy hipster place to go out with your friends, this place will do the job. I wouldnt go out of my way for this place, but wouldn't mind going back.
