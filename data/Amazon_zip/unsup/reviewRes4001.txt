There probably isn't a lot to say that hasn't already been said in the other Schwa reviews. I will say that yes, I had to call a few times and yes, our reservation got cancelled once, but it really wasn't that big of a deal because I knew both of those things were probably going to happen. The meal itself was incredibly fun, and almost more art than food. Everything we ate was incredibly thoughtfully prepared, and virtually without exception completely delicious. I found the table service from the chefs to be engaging and enjoyable, and it really seemed like they were having a good time. Those were 14 of the best courses I have ever had, and I would definitely recommend the experience. The music is really loud, but that is just part of eating at Schwa. Even if you hate the music (I actually really liked their selections), you will still have a good time because the food is special enough to overcome pretty much anything else about the meal you might not like.
