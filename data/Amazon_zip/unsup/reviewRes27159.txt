Spectacular food. Remarkable space and service. Get your reservation while you have a chance. Graham Elliot hosted a great birthday for the wife. She started with the Kobe Tartare with hickory smoked ice cream. I started with the buffalo chicken thigh with blue cheese, celery slaw and Budweiser foam. The ice cream was fantastic, but the buffalo chicken won. Next came the next course when she had the ceasar salad with whole anchovies and a garlic brioche twinkie with parmesean filling. I had the cheez-it risotto with pabst glazed onions and wisconsin bacon. The risotto was good enough to qualify as an appetizer that I would order as an entree. It was amazing. The brioche was also something that will turn Chicago food on its ear. The next course we had the pork spare rib with watermelon chutney, root beer bbq sauce, grits and collard greens. It was an amazingly large piece of pork that was crispy on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside. The root beer BBQ sauce and watermelon chutney were a perfectly sweet counter balance to the rich pork and the bitter greens. We split the chocolate brownie with banana and whoppers and the amazing peach cobbler for dessert. The peach cobbler was a shortcake with freeze dried peaches topped with a dehydrated peach and a quinelle of ice cream on top. It was spectacular. The dinner was great. A relaxed atmosphere. Chef Bowles made his way around the room. A top, top choice and an exciting opening in Chicago.
