Everything on the menu is awesome including the margs all made with fresh juices and no gross mixes. I've been here several times and feel like it keeps getting better! Last time we went it was a Saturday night and Rick Bayless was there, in the kitchen expediting food. That says it all - A celebrity chef who still actually WORKS in his kitchen. He deserves all the praise and more, what a class act.
