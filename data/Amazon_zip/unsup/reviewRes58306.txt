I'm a meat eating fiend, but needed a place to take a veggie friend of mine visiting the city last fall. I love Chicago Diner, because I actually LOVED everything I tried! The biscuits and gravy were killer. And I cannot believe that vegan cheesecake can actually be awesome!I'm sold on the food!That being said, I'm going to have to point out my usual complaint about Chicago Service. Kinda non existent. Maybe it's because I prefaced my questions with Ok, so I'm not even close to a vegetarian.... but I didn't really find my servers answers to my questions to be really.... answers. Maybe I'm annoying because I like to ask lots of questions about food [especially about food I'm unfamiliar with (see my recent review of VOLO for how to answer my million questions successfully)] but isn't that part of a server's job? Overall, there was no snootiness, so the service was just a little lackluster. And it didn't really dampen my experience. I might not hunt out this spot to go on my own, but any veggie friends who visit, are definitely going to be my guests!
