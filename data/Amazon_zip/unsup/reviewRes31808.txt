So I went to Sunda a couple of weeks ago on a Tuesday night with my girlfriends. We didn't have reservations, but we were able to grab 3 seats at the bar. The bar tender was very nice and provided good service. Let me say that the food was great! We ordered a variety of dishes and every single one was delicious. The ambiance was quite nice as well. The only reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars is because it takes a long time to get a reservation, but, if you plan ahead of time, I'm sure the planning will be worth it. Will definitely be back.
