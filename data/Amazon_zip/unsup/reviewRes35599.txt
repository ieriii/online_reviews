Not as good as the old location, the father ran it back then. The new location feels like a big open parking lot, not cozy at all. Beware they offer no parking, to find parking is terrible! sometimes simple is always better then a huge open space. The food has some how changed since they moved, too bad.! Sometimes it is best leaving thing's as they once were.
