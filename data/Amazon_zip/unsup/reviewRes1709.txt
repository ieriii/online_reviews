Hot Doug's is the best! Not to be confused with gourmet restaurants or celebrity chefs, Doug is a regular guy (probably high IQ though) who just wants to provide the best quality product in a unique and nostalgic way. He has done an superb job! I got two dogs, one special and one off the regular menu, duck fat fries and a drink. Total was like $13 bucks. Pretty reasonable i thought. Also met two young men, Andrew and Anurat, in line and shared my dogs with them so in total tried six dogs! The key here is to remember that these are just hot dogs and as far as dogs go, Doug treats them with love and tenderness. Going to Doug's was also fun. It's a little off the beaten track. Had to take the Blue line towards O'hare and then the 52 bus north but the hunt is always half the fun. Got there at opening and there were already 40 people in line but again, all the people were friendly and it was all good. Will definitely be back...
