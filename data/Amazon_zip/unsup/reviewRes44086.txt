Kinzies is a nice place for an evening out. Dress well when u go. The service was great. They took the trouble to explain the different cuts to me ( i donot know much about steak) . I had the Delmonico ...fabulous...and they have a variety of gravys / sauces to choose from. I had the creamed spinach & Broccoli fondue as sides.... delicious... For desert, i had the profitroles... yummy !! they have a decent wine list as well
