Fun lively spot with excellent food and friendly service. Desserts are an especially good value. I'm not normally a fan of "small plate" places because they almost always mean a bigger tab for less food when all is said and done, but this place makes it work pretty well. Creative ingredients and nice twists on some standard dishes. My only complaint was spending $9 for a single ravioli. It was absolutely delicious, and a little larger than a normal ravioli, but it was a silly portion size for the cost.
