Went here for the live band karaoke nite because it sounded cool. The way you request songs is by looking at their playlist, then write down your name and the song on a clipboard. So I wrote down a song as soon as the show started, and went back to our table. A really long time passed by and realized they never called me up! So I went back up there to check the clipboard only to find out they crossed out my song! That was really lame. Next, we were singing a long with the other songs, and were told to settle down or get kicked out.... we got threatened for singing at a karaoke nite, how retarded is that? And to top off the nite, a fight broke out between two people. I think they were fighting over who sang better? Either way they both couldn't land a punch on each other and were pulled apart. SO, the band plays whatever they want, you can't sing a long too loudly, and the crowd is sorta rough if a fight breaks out. Piece..... of shit.
