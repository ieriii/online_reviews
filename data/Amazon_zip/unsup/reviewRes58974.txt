My reservation and everyone else's was not available until at least 45 minutes after the reservation was made! The "Rockit Staff" sat their regulars who had no reservations immediately.... So ridiculous! When we finally did sit down the entrees came to our group 10 minutes (at least) after each other. I think they need to do A LOT of work as there are many other (better) restaurants in the city with the same vibe. I likely will not be back for a VERY long time. GOOD LUCK IF YOU GO THERE!!!!!
