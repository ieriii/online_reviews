5 stars b/c at 10:45 AM on a Wednesday - waited 15 min. Yay :) Went with a large group so got to try multiple dogs (double yay!) 4 stars b/c the food was just ok. Boo :( My fave was the uber garlic pork sausage. It was bursting with flavor but not so overwhelming with the garlic. We also tried the ribeye: after the uber garlic, this was slightly bland until i spread the crispy onion and horseradish sauce evenly on the dog.  The andouille sausage had a mild seasoning: pretty good...like a more seasoned hot dog. The firedog tasted like a hot dog with a dash of spices in it. The foie gras and duck sausage was too gamey for me - but I guess that's no fair to the sausage b/c I'm not too into foie gras The atomic dog was spicier than the firedog. I felt that the habenero jack cheese didn't pair well with the sausage. I don't know how else to describe these dogs b/c there was nothing that truly stood out to me but they were still good enough to enjoy eating. Like I've said before, I'd NEVER wait more than 30 min to eat here. At least the staff is nice :)
