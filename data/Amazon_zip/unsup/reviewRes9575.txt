I really really love this place. The atmosphere upstairs is amazing. Great lighting, very sultry, exotic, good music, good cocktails, great lounge area, just awesome. My only complaint is the price of a drink...$13-$15 for a martini is ridiculous. But when you consider the lovely atmosphere and sexy people, it's definitely worth 4 stars.
