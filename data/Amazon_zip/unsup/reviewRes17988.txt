My friends and I went to the Violet Hour at about 9 pm on a Saturday night. We waited an hour and a half to get in. The man at the door kept coming out when we were next in line to tell us the party we were going to take the table from had paid but they were just chatting. Once inside, the atmosphere is relaxing and a true lounge (which Chicago needs more of). The drinks were okay. They weren't as wonderful as described in other reviews, but different. Our server was very pleasant and friendly. Everything was ok (even the wait) until the end. Three of our group of six had gone to use the restroom. We had paid our bill and were waiting for them to return when another server brought three people over and seated them at our table. We had not made any indication other than paying our bill that we were ready to leave. The people seated with us were nice and probably felt uncomfortable. The server I believe said they needed to make room for other people. We had to wait the hour and a half for our table but apparently we were being kicked out not even five minutes after paying our bill. We are a group of highly educated professional individuals who are smart enough to recognize bad business practices when we see them. We all decided that was probably our last time going there..
