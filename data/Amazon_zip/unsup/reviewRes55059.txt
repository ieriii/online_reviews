Had the pleasure of dining at Wildfire last night with a party of four. We called and made reservations for 7:30 PM. When we arrived we were immediately seated even though they were very busy. Our server Mike Gavin was not only knowledgable about the menu and wine, but also provided us with some suggestions on house favorites. We were enjoying ourselves and can honestly say Mike rolled with the punches and never missed a beat. This was not our first time dining at Wildfire, so we knew to expect a delicious and well prepared meal. The Appetizers were delicious. The Prime Rib, Filet Mignon trio, and Brown sugar glazed Salmon were done perfectly. One of my friends who does not even eat fish tried the Salmon and commented that it was excellent. Desert was decadent and a chocoholics dream. I would say that I have come to expect a quality dining experience from Wildfire and have never been dissapointed, but last night Mike Gavin took it to the next level. Thank you for making our night memorable, your witty banter kept us always anticipating your return.
