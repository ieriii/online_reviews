I absolutely adore this place. We go there for lunch, for dinner and I would even go for breakfast and a few snacks.Servers are the nicest people around. If you go there for dinner DO NOT miss the calamari appetizer. Heaven on an arugula bed. The chopped salad is humongous and their soups should be sold by the gallon.They also have a really large table for large parties which is perfect for our more populated gatherings.The only thing that they need to control is the volume of the music, particularly if you happen to go on a Live show night. I guess it is to be expected but i still have my Latin American inclination to speak with the people I share my meals with. Go figure!. Otherwise this is a cozy, very well staffed and very friendly place.
