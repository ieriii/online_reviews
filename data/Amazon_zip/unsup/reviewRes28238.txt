DELICIOUS. We have been obsessed with going to Frontera Grill for about 3 years now... and it finally happened! We loved it! Great authentic Mexican flavor. My advice for the wait time... i would suggest going when we did... We got there at 10:20am on a Saturday to make sure we could get in the second the doors opened for Brunch at 10:30. we immediately got seated... it was amazing! Love the decor. Love the home-made everything... and especially that they support local farmers by getting all of their ingredients locally. So fresh.
