It was a cold, winter night and we found ourselves craving not only Mexican food but a new dining experience. In comes Mayan Palace. Tamale plate and Mayan enchiladas chosen. When a serving of enchiladas rivals my mother's, I'm sold. None of that "slop on some red sauce and call it Mexican" food. If you think this is poor Mexican food, you probably are used to eating at Taco Bell or perhaps other generic TexMex locales (read: Chile's Bar and Grill). 4.75 stars.
