I had been wanting to make it out to Piece for a long time as it is basically a marriage of my two favorite things, pizza and brew pub beer. I finally made the trek into the city to give it a shot a few days ago. First of all, the parking stinks... I know its the city, but it has to be said, I had to park four blocks away. I sat down at the bar, it was a Friday afternoon, busy but not crazy, I had a lot of empty seats around me, it took 5 minutes for a bartender to get a menu to me and take an order.  Things started to look up though, I got their double IPA, it was pretty delicious and I weighed my options on the pizza menu. I decided to go with the Plain, which I had seen reviewed by Chicago magazine as the #2 pizza in Chicago, however theirs was ordered with artichokes. I'm not an artichoke sort of guy so I got my two favorite toppings, pepperoni and banana peppers. This turned out to be a pretty big mistake. The plain pizza does not come with mozzarella but instead just parmesan cheese which is pretty clearly stated in the menu. I just didn't realize the parmesan would be put so sparingly on the pizza. I felt like I was eating a really quite tasty pizza crust slathered with sauce, with lots of pepperoni and peppers mixed into the sauce. I regret not ordering it just without toppings because I think it would have turned out better for me because I could taste the potential in the pizza. I did have a second beer, their regular IPA and it was just alright, nothing to write home about. I think this place may deserve another shot, but that might be a while down the road.
