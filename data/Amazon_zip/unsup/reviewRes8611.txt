the meat is still as fabulous as it was the first time i went. out of all of the churrascurias in Chicago, fogo is still my favorite. i think the meat is better seasoned here and i like the salad bar--with the same rule in place to not fill up on salad and bread--the last star came with an improvement in the drinks. I tried the caipirinha again and this time I thought it was pretty good like a mojito without the mint...but the star was the sangria...awesome! i was ummm eating the fruit with a fork ...i had the creme brulee for dessert and while it was good i've definitely had better...service was great and we even had a big group. the staff was extra attentive....overall though, it was still as good as I remember if not better..hence the last star
