More like 3.5 stars. Let me start by saying that this was a place I have wanted to visit for years, so I had pretty high expectations. I'm sure dinner would be better than brunch. Ambience: Great Mexican cantina atmosphere. Filled up very quickly after opening. Very little space to wait inside. Service: Definitely a significant point for this place - all the staff from the front desk to wait staff to bar staff were all friendly and helpful. Food: We went for brunch but had made the mistake of seeing the dinner menu online which was very different (much more interesting and diverse). We had two mains with two desserts amongst three diners and it was more than enough. Some interesting flavors, but one dish had what were like nachos cooked in a chile sauce. The flavor was fine but the texture of mushy nachos was a little odd. The swordfish was okay - fresh and well prepared but not Earth-shattering. The desserts were better - a surprising tart with tomatillos of all things, but it worked marvelously. Price: About right. I will try to go back for dinner, but I'm hoping for better.
