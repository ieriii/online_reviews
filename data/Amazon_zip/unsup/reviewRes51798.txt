We hadn't been to Gracia's since before they remodeled the Western location and decided it was time to go back. I remember the service being okay and the food outstanding. This time, I was very disappointed. We were seated right away and brought chips and salsa and water very quickly. Then we proceeded to wait for 20 minutes until finally we asked another employee who our server is. We got our food 45 minutes after we were seated and had to continue to grab staff as they passed us for beverage refills and our check. Our food was very average. Maybe they had an off night, but we won't be hurrying back...
