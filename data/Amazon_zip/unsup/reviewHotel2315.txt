We came here to hang out in their lobby lounge after working the Piven Theatre benefit a few weekends ago for our staff/volunteer after party. First off...the "Very Berry" is maybe the best thing ever. It's a deliciously dangerous drink with real pieces of fruit. I'm not even sure what's in it (some acai vodka, some other random liquor, some juice or something), but it was to die for. I believe it was $13 (not sure...I didn't pick up the tab, fortunately)...not sure I would ever justify paying that much for a drink, but if I were going to this would be the drink to do it. We ordered a variety of food, and some of it was pretty decent (the BBQ chips topped with cheese and bacon) , but others not so much (flatbread pizza...not a fan of their sauce)...probably because it wasn't an actual restaurant (that I'm aware of), but mainly just a bar. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, with some curtains between the long sofas for privacy between parties. We had like 20+ people with us, so that wasn't an issue. It was a pretty nice place to have an afterparty after a crazy busy day/night of fundraising for the arts. My feet were killing me and I would have been happy anywhere I could sit down, but I'm glad they chose the Marriott to host us. Aside from the lobby lounge area, I haven't seen any other parts of the hotel, so I can't comment on that, unfortunately.
