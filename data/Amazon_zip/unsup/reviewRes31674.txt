Chicago Diner is 'Yum-O' as Rachel Ray likes to say. I recently went Vegan a few months ago when I moved to Chicago and found this place. It has amazing food and I was completely satisfied. It's a bit small and always crowded, but if you can handle that, it's well worth it! ***Update*** Okay so I went today and had the Sweet Potato Quasadillas...OMGOD people, these are FABULOUS. You have to try. Their Gyros are also yummy as hell. Be prepared to use lots of napkins for either of these dishes. If you never go to Chicago Diner, I feel so sorry for you!
