The food was good. The service was sub-par. The host had an attituded and had the audacity to seat us in the yellow tent area when the temperature was in the 30s with the heat barely working and the rain coming through the seams. Then the sever spills over a hot sauce bottle, making a big mess under the table and we had to ASK the fucker to clean it up.
