A very seen and be seen place with modern, edgy, Asian decor and the usual, yuppie crowd. I'm just happy to have a sushi restaurant in the neighborhood amidst all the pub fare, Italian, seafood, steak and American restaurants.  I was underwhelmed by the dumpling appetizer. The dumplings were served individually in tiny bowls with a drop of broth making me feel like I was having a shot glass of dumpling. Too strange. The $50.00 plate of kobe steak was disappointing because it had quite a bit of grizzle, and after having cut it away, you wondered if that grizzle was $10.00 worth. I loved my spicy tuna, but you have to suppose any sushi restaurant could get that right. I ordered two plates because one plate wasn't filling enough. A glimpse at the dessert menu let me know where the fusion part is. I have a wicked sweet tooth, but the Asian twist on American desserts didn't sound appetizing to me. I can see why the restaurant is popular, but it just ididn't work for me.
