Oh, Indie.  I didn't realize just how much I missed you until I went back for the first time in awhile on Saturday night. There's ok sushi near my new home, but nothing tops the delectable rolls you always give me.  It was my birthday, and you handled my group of 8 easily. The crab rangoon was a hit, as were all the thai dishes my non-sushi eating friends ordered. And the rolls I had? SCRUMPTIOUS. The caterpillar roll is the best, and the popeye roll ain't bad either.  Your BYOB-ness allowed us all to leave with a nice buzz. What a wonderful way to start out a birthday celebration.  Damnit, now I'm depressed. WHY CANT YOU BE CLOSER TO ME? *single tear*
