This is the kind of food my parents would love, and a welcome treat after night after night of bar food. I'm sorry, but I hate to consider "going out to eat" at a bar, "going out to eat." It just does NOT count. Sapori Trattoria, however, definitely counts. After starting with a (HUGE) mista salad and the awesome bread they bring, I indulged in the pumpkin ravioli, which was mouthwateringly, richly, delicious. (But not too rich that I couldn't finish the entire thing.) It's a lot bigger than you would expect from the tiny front. There are two nicely sized rooms for dining, and a small wine bar. Nice ambiance, pleasant service, all types- young old, couples, groups, friends, dates. I can't wait for my parents to come visit in a couple weeks so I can bring them!!!
