So, I have a killlah Italian accent. So every time I think of Gino's, I starta talkin' in Italiano, capishe? That and the recent obsession I have with a BBC TV show called Hotel Babylon features a bartender named Gino who is half-Italian and half-Spanish and he talka like a real stallion.  That means absolutely nothing to you and nothing to this review, I know. But it does make me laugh. Especially because as I type this, I do the Italian accent. So, my boyfriend has gotten on the groupon bandwagon. I know, I trained him right. So he spies one for Gino's and him loving that whole sausage patty thing? He must buy it. So he does. And me, loving him, despite not loving the sausage patty, say alright to getting it. (Ain't love grand.) Pies take awhile (they estimate at 45 minutes to an hour) so come prepared to order an appetizer, which we did. The pasta salad sufficed and the minestrone was edible (although it's weirdly creamy texture was not what I'd call typical minestrone). And the 'za was just fine. Granted, I'm a l Lou Malnati's girl (great tomato-y sauce and good cheese and LOVE the crust) so I may be a bit biased, but if you're hungry and Gino's is the best available, you will be just fine. Pair it with a nice cold beer and you've got a meal (see, my boyfriend trained ME just right too). We left stuffed with two pieces for later. And so, Gino's, arrivederci. I won't request to go back, but won't complain if it's in the name of love.
