so was my first time going here, i pulled up in front to drop off my friends for dinner. then before i leave to look for parking, a guy across the street asks me if i want his spot. okay, so he pulls out and stops with enough room for me to get into his spot. he gets out of his car and goes to the meter machine and i'm thinking "what is this guy doing, i thought he was leaving??" prints out a ticket and hands it to us. turns out, he's the owner and saw us going to his restaurant. so i have to give 5 stars for service, that's customer service right there. and the food was great, i'd give at least 4 stars. shared a few dishes between friends. as people have mentioned, if there are coupons going around, might as well bring them as well.
