My boyfriend and I went here a few weeks ago on a Sunday when I was craving breakfast food. I'd read some of the reviews on here and saw that they generally have a long wait. We didn't have that problem. We waited 5 minutes and were asked if we'd prefer to sit at a table or the bar, and we chose the bar. He had a cheeseburger and it was pretty good. I guess you could call him a cheeseburger connoisseur, but also it's his fallback food when he can't pick anything else. He liked it a lot and so did I, and he's hard to please sometimes as far as cheeseburgers go. I however, opted for breakfast and ordered eggs sunny side up with white toast. I find a lot of times when I order them that the eggs are runny or the toast is overcooked or just waaaay too buttery. I have intestinal probs, so tons of butter is bad for me. Needless to say, I totally forgot to say no butter (usually foods I order don't have much) and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they barely put any on it at all, which is not only healthier in general, but would allow people to put however much they want to on instead of having a cook do it for them. It's a little pricey for what it is, but that's okay. It was good food and I want to go back sometime as well as go with people who come to visit us.
