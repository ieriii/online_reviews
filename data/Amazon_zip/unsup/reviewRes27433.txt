Honestly, I think Pequod's is okay. I have actually had better deep dish pizza from Jet's... hate to say it. But the crust was very good, and the special lunch price is phenominal. I ordered the special -- with black olives and pineapple. I would have prefered a bit more sauce. I do like deep dish, but at heart, I'm a thin crust gal -- and prefer Coalfire on Chicago Ave.
