This was my husband and I first visit to Chicago and we really did not know what to expect, but we had a blast and relaxing stay. The Hilton Chicago is a gourgeous and elegant hotel. Our room was huge, clean, comfortable, and with a breath taking view. We had four windows in our room with a view of Lake Michigan from each. We also had a view of Grand Park, Soldier Stadium, and the museum. Not only was the hotel a beautiful experience, the staff was amazing. Everyone we encountered was friendly, accomodating, and professional. Although all the staff was great, there were two staff that was outstanding and went over and beyond to make sure our stay at the Hilton Chicago was the best. The first person we encountered when we arrived was Alicia, guest service agent. She is the sweetest person with a welcoming smile. We were so tired after our early morning travel, but Alicia put a smile on our faces that lasted throughout the trip. Words can not describe her beautiful and warm personality. Thank you Alicia. The second person we encountered was Antonio. Antonio is an energic young man who is full of life. He assisted us with our bags and you can tell that this young man takes great pride in his job. That was refreshing to see. I would highly recommend this hotel, because it is truly a 5 star. I have read the other reviews and it is unfortunate that some did not share my experience, because in my opinion a bad experience is not the norm for this beautiful hotel and the warm, beautiful staff.
