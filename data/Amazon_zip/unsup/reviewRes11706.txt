Great pizza, superb beer, yummy Caesar salad, but the huge crowds a definite minus. This is a great place to go on the weekday, but on a weekend not so much. Although the pizza is well worth the wait, especially if you're getting a little tired of deep dish pizza and want something "lighter." (Lighter being a relative term in this case!)
