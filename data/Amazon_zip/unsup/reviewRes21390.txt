I've lived in Chicago most of my life, so I'm wondering how I missed this restaurant. Hmmm... Well, we are in a city with lots of great food options! It was a friend's birthday and this was her restaurant of choice. As mentioned in other reviews, this place appears to be tiny when you first walk in. Follow a very narrow hallway (this might freak out claustrophobes) and you emerge into the colorful and cozy back room. We arrived for an early dinner, which was perfect because the place gets PACKED! Our server was friendly and helpful with drink recommendations. He had a couple of people working with him, so everyone in our group of 15 received plenty of attention. The food was pretty good, but not outstanding. The chips were OK. Salsa was just the right spice and a little sweet - delicious. The guacamole was good - nice to counter the spice of salsa. Being lactose sensitive, I avoided anything super cheesy and ordered the fish/shrimp tacos. Yummy! The mango margarita on the rocks was wonderful. It looked like they blended fresh mangos and added it to the mix. Delicious! I also tried the tamarind margarita, which was tasty but not as good. It was a little too sweet for me. The margaritas are very strong (watch out!), which I didn't realize until we got up to leave! Whoops... While the food didn't totally bowl me over, it was good enough to make me curious about the rest of the menu. I'll definitely be back! :)
