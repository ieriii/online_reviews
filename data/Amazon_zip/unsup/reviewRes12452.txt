The boy took me here for my birthday; a Tuesday night, and although we got seated right away, it was nearly full. Walking through the bright dining room, each table seemed to be having a good time. We did it all.  Pomegranate mojitos that we so crisp and delicious, the Tamal Cubano appetizer that was tender and wonderfully seasoned...I had the Ropa Vieja that everyone has raved about, and it was as good as I could have hoped. The boy had the Pork Chops...yummy, but we agreed that we should have ordered it a big more on the rare side. We asked the servers opinion, and it seemed like he was hinting in that direction, but we weren't sure. I recommend it not be ordered medium.... Our server was lovely; always there at the right time, and not intrusive at all. The woman, whom I'm thinking is the owner, was a delight in her velour track suit and friendly easy going manner. She bade us good night too. I love going places when I don't have to wait, so maybe everyone should just try to hit up this place during the week. The interior is so lovely and has so many windows: I'm looking forward to brunching here some day. Soon.
