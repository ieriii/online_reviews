Came here for a second date, and although the food ranged from fantastic to subpar, the fun experience made up for any shortcomings. Our waiter was very helpful and the new twist on brazilian steak house is great. Besides the good company, going through the night together was definitely experience and would recommend for a fun time. The salad bar was delicious, and had many gourmet offerings that you wouldn't find at your typical salad bar. Afterwards when we sat down the food started to come around. Basically the fish dishes were delicious and the meat dishes were passable. Dessert was great, but was confused when we received fortune cookies afterwards without fortunes! Our waiter did his best but came up with a pretty lame fortune for the date, thanks for nothing bud!Tried to go upstairs but it was closed for a private party but snuck a peak! Would definately come back to the rooftop for drinks! Thanks to Zed451 overall for a great time.
