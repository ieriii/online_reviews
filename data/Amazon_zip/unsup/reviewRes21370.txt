I have so many fond memories of this place. Growing up as a kid I used to visit this place often as my parents used to own the liquor store next door. I remember seeing the glowing hot dog/human hybrids atop the store and the delicious hot dogs nestled in a box with crispy fries. Now that I live in Skokie I don't frequent it as often. However I won a gift certificate from Superdawg's Twitter and while back and figured it was time to use it. I ordered a Whoopskidawg, an order of Superveggies and a strawberry shake. The Whoopskidawg was delicious. It was juicy and had a great snap to the casing and was topped with a nice sauce and grilled onions. This was my first time having the Superveggies and it was fantastic. Crispy perfectly fried breading surrounding a combination of vegetables, zucchini, cauliflower, corn, broccoli and others. Sure it's vegetables, but it sure ain't healthy for you. The strawberry shake was as good as usual, thick and with enough strawberries in it that it actually clogs the straw as you drink. Sure they're a bit pricey compared to other Chicago hot dog joints, but the food warrants the price. A great Chicago institution that every Chicagoan should try.
