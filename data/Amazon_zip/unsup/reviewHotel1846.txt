After a conference in Chicago, I moved to the W to stay the weekend. It was an o.k. choice. It's a great location and the aestetics are very typical for a W hotel.  It's located in a historic building and they juxtapose that with modern design. The lobby and Lobby Bar are nice with lots of little niches for your group to have cocktails. They also have the world's largest table lamps!  The rooms are small, but fine for Chicago. And, the walls are a VERY thin. I had to call security on our neighbors who were have "Dance Party USA" at 2 a.m. But, the hotel sent someone up to talk to them right away and it stopped. All in all, the customer service and room were very nice. We did have a problem when we requested movies for our room...a standard service. They didn't have any of the four we asked for. If they are going to offer a service, they need to be able to provide it.  I cashed in points to stay here and would stay here again.
