I visited chicago this weekend and went out of my way to find this WONDERFUL Romanian restaurant. Having lived in Romania I was looking to recapture some of the tastes that I miss so much. I was NOT DISAPPOINTED. The cabbage rolls were fantastic, the polenta with feta and sour cream scrumptious, and be sure u put some of the garlic sauce over ur French fries. Also the homemade sausage was as good as any I had in Romania. If u r looking for a great ethnic experience, this is the place!!!
