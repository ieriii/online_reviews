Probably the best cafe in Chicago. Like a great French bistro, this place puts the pieces together. The daily menu has varied good choices, made with tenderness and care. The staff is extraordinary, really lovely people. It is not a white tablecloth kind of place, but if you want good food, in a great location with good vibes, check it out. And at least one of the servers knows a lot about music.
