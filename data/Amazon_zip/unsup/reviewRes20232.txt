Have been working at a client just a few blocks from here for a few weeks and have hesitated visiting Xoco for lunch due to the long lines. Decided to try it out after work today and other than nearly being trampled by a pair of middle-aged women frantic to snap a picture of Rick Bayliss behind the counter I was glad I went. Went for the Ahogada with some chips and salsa and my girlfriend had the Cubana. We both loved the food, although for the price ($12 sandwiches) I can't see myself eating here on a regular basis. That said, the Ahogada was excellent, great spicy flavor to the sauce alone. The bread was the perfect texture and soften just the right amount, as long as you don't let it sit too long while enjoying the hint-of-lime chips with guac.
