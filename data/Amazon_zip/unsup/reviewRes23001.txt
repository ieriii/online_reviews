I didn't think I would consume anything that would stimulate my taste buds when I left Thailand and Los Angeles, but this place does the trick. I've walked past it many times when I visited Chinatown, usually for dim sum, but this restaurant certainly sticks true to its ethnic billing - szechuan, which if people don't know, is Chinese for "hotter than hell". I ordered trademark szechuan dishes, which I've done at other "szechuan" restaurants, which I have had at more authentic szechuan restaurants in Los Angeles, and some places just didn't have that taste, that flavor, that heat. This place does and I would go back again, but be warned - when it says "spicy", they really mean it.
