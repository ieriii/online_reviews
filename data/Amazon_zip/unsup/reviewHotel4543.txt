The lobby is breathtaking. It is sooooo beautiful. Coming here as a little girl, I was always in awe. It is a famous and historic hotel in downtown Chicago and has been around since the 1920s. Potter Palmer built the orginal in 1871 but it burnt down. Definitely stay here if you get the chance, especially if you're a history buff. I have always thought that having a wedding in the ballroom here would be amazing. My sister and I also used to really enjoy the pool when we were younger and they seemed to have a nice fitness room. Give it a try, it is definitely a change of pace from all of the other chain hotels in the city.
