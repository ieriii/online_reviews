One year later.... I am compelled to write another review for this place. I've been back a few times since I last reviewed Irazu, obviously I like the food a lot, and the milkshake yada yada, same thing as everybody here loves. My experience last Saturday 8/13 was a little different though. There was a block party going on, and the place was packed, I mean slamming! The street was already crowded with youngsters, hipsters, weirdsters, some plastered on the curbside. Irazu was the closest establishment, coupled with the fact that it was BYOB, some people thought it was ok just to park their derrier with a few bottles of wine and drink there all throughout the duration of the party. My friends and I waited for 2 hours, (we were told about an hour) but we soon realized that the large party tables were not leaving, in fact more of their friends came over, as some left, and they kept on drinking. At that point we decided to split our party to sit at the smaller tables. Which worked out fine. The food was good, and we were glad they were accommodating. I wish we had more time to enjoy our food but they were closing up, and the large obnoxious tables/parties that were there 2 hours before us, were still there drunk and yapping loudly... Even after the staff turned off a couple of the lights. We got the hint and asked for boxes, proceeded to pay at the front, where we saw the entire staff just waiting right there. I felt bad because I've been in their shoes before, waiting for diners to leave. We thanked them as we paid and left. Did I mention that the loud obnoxious drunks were still in the dining room? Can u knock off stars for service that is too nice?
