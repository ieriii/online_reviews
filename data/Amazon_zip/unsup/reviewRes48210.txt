Want their brunch - ate their dinner. Dinner was great - service was not good. Beers were slow to come while the drinks of the party of goofy nerds next to us came quickly. Waitress actually dropped the fuck word at some point because I'm guessing she was comfortable enough around us to treat us like worthless buddies instead of customers. The summer camp picnic table set up is not my thing for dinner - but I think it would be really fun for brunch. We tried the hamachi collar (best), beef tongue, and the fish stew to name a few. Delicious seafood. I stole their pen.
