No bone marrow when I came here, BOOOOOO!!!!!! The only other thing that I can really rave about was their roasted beets with pistachio nuts. It's super duper uber delicious!! It was light and it's perfect for a light appetizer, the whipped goat cheese cream on the top was just a cherry on the sundae! Everything else was decent, the chicken kabob, and the braised pork shoulder. The pork shoulder was very tender and the meat just peels right off, but the portion was a little small. Very cute contemporary place, outdoor tent seating area with heat lamps. Indoor has a bar/lounge area that you can sit while you wait for a table. Very crowded and tightly packed, but prepare to rub some shoulders even when you are seated. It's okay though, make a new friend with your neighbor, you can enjoy some good food with a good conversation.
