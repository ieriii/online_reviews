My favorite place for Persian cuisine. The food is quite tasty, I'm still working on trying the variety of items on the menu all of which I've enjoyed thus far but the Chenjeh (tender rib eye) is a must have, the meat almost melts in your mouth and is succulent with flavor. The humus is okay, but you can find better at one of Kedzie's Ave.'s strip of great Middle Eastern eatery. Definitely a great place for us carnivores and vegetarians alike. It's very easy to get to just 1/2 block from the Kedzie Brown Line stop on the El. My first time hearing about Noon O Kabob was on Check Please! years ago and I've been coming back ever since.
