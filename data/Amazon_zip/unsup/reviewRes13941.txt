CUBA LIBRE! I can't believe I didn't try this place sooner (I partially blame my inability to distinguish Clybourn from Elston). Walking into 90 Miles, the intoxicating smell of mojo, ropa vieja, and cafe con leche instantly brought back fond memories of my trip to Cuba, strolling down the Malecon, exploring quaint paladares, and dancing the night away to afro-Cuban rhythms.  Don't let the small interior fool you, for within lies big flavor and also surprising value. Having sampled Cuban fare at the source and in South Florida, I have to say that this place is legit. I also dig the interior which includes old newspaper clippings and ads from Cuban newspapers plastered on the walls.  The dinners are a great value at $10 and include black beans, rice, and maduros. You absolutely MUST try the lechon (roast pork) here, which is tender, juicy, and will leave your plate empty within minutes.  Try this place out! You won't be disappointed.
