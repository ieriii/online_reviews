3.5 stars, actuallyThis is a LUNCH review. Two, actually.The first time I came here for lunch, I had the Migas - corn tortilla & egg casserole with chilies, black beans, red salsa, avocado, creme fraiche. It had pieces of burnt junk from the griddle on it. I was absolutely disgusted. My companion had a burger which was delicious. This was quite a while ago.I came back here recently for a business lunch. The iced tea was quite delicious and my glass was kept full. I felt sorry the server for having to use the unnecessarily small and heavy glass pitchers that the tea and water were served in.The "cornbread" was amazing. Imagine a corn turnover. Crisp and eggy on the outside, light and fluffy in the middle. It was perfect, except that the butter was unspreadably cold and hard (not that they needed butter). More please.We shared a beet salad. It was a pretty small amount of food for the price, though it was quite delicious. The quenelle of cheese was also a bit underseasoned. My associates both got the gumbo. It looked like a hearty plate of food and smelled delicious. Both seemed to enjoy it. I had the salad with fried chicken tenders. I'm a sucker for chicken tenders. The butter lettuce was fine, but a bit delicate for the heaviness of the rest of the dish. Boiled potatoes were undercooked. Pickled okra was delicious, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't like okra. The dressing was also very good, but a bit rich and too large a portion The chicken tenders were crisp and perfectly cooked - A+.Sadly, we did not order the red velvet cake or any other dessert.Overall, the meal was mostly delicious, with a few noticeable flaws, and a price tag higher than I'd like for what you get. I'd probably bump this up to four stars, but old burnt bits of what could easily pass for plastic lose you the star. Sorry.
