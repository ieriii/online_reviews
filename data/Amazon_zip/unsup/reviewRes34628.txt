FINALLY got here! I t didn't disappoint either. Got the vegetarian combo with rice (they were out of cous-cous) The falafel was awesome. The space is very charming as well. The amount of food for the price is also a impressive deal. I bought two extra little falafel and now I have enough for lunch tomorrow too! Yum!
