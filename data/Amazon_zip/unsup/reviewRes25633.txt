Mercat is the best. I have been here twice and each time the food just blows me away. I can not decide on what to order ever so I always go for the chef's tasting menu and then some. By the end of the meal we realized we had about six different animals for dinner. Lamb, pork, rabbit, duck, ...........     Great value for the price. Service also is fantastic.       The only thing I would say is wrong is like so many other restaurants they remind you that the kitchen is closing soon or do not want to take a late night reservation.  People who like to go out may like a fancy meal once in a wild before hand. I will be back many times. This is a Chicago must dine spot.
