My dreamboat took me here for dinner last Saturday and it was delightful. We eat out quite a bit but always at child friendly places so it was really wonderful to be at a restaurant for grownups only! This place could not have been more romantic AND delicious! The wine list was huge and we wanted to try something new, our waitress described every wine perfectly and made great recommendations.  I have to say I am surprised people complain about the price you get so much for $49 you leave so full! First salad then cheese fondue with apples bread and grapes, the cheese is savory and tangy. Then we got the seafood; the shrimp, lobster and scallops were fresh, as were the vegetables. They serve you about 10 different dipping sauces with the platter, so fun to try them all! Then comes the chocolate fondue with marshmallows, cake, and fruit. Just divine! I would have given 5 stars but unfortunately my darling Geja's loses a star for their potatoes. Why did you change the potatoes Gejas? Why why why? I loved the new potatoes, now they serve plain old baking potatoes and they are not good. It is impossible to cook them through!   PLEASE bring back the new potatoes, I beg of you! I highly recommend Geja's it is really a wonderful little place. They have been around for 45 years for a reason!
