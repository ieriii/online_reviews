Went here with two friends last summer (So this review is done from fairly distant memory) and absolutely ADORED it. None of us were from Chicago, but we set out to find the nicest place we could for dinner and we succeeded. Everything about our experience here was top notch. I can't quite recall exactly what everyone ordered, except one friend ordered a duck breast dish that was absolutely incredible. I do distinctly remember everyone's food was delicious, the wine was spectacular, but most of all the service was just phenomenal. Our waiter was attentive, patient, and full of excellent recommendations. Living in Kansas I don't make it to Chicago very often, but I will definitely make it a point to eat here every time I go back.
