Went there a couple of weeks ago, first time, and I was very impressed with the variety and quality of everything we got. I had the chicken in wild ramp crema tacos to start, which were amazing. There were many other choices on the menu that looked tasty. I cant wait to go back and try them. I also had the chipotle glazed pork back ribs which were outstanding! I could taste the chipotle flavor and a little bit of heat with every bite. I had a mojito which was very tasty. I will definitely go back.
