Excellent for vegans! I am a meat and potato vegetarian, but I still really like this place! My fiance is vegan, so we go here frequently. As someone who is EXTREMELY picky, I really like the gyros, chick'n parmesan, and chick'n ranch. Hint: the ciabiatta bread is awesome! Try either of the chick'n sandwiches on this bread, and you will be dreaming about it later! Warning! If you are allergic to any nuts or seeds, MAKE SURE you check with your server before ordering anything. Vegan food tends to have a lot of these two things, and they are in a lot of different foods that you would not expect. I am allergic to Sunflower seeds, and I learned the hard way that they put these in A LOT of different dishes. (Including the bread, which is why I like the ciabiatta-it is the only bread that they serve that does NOT have Sunflower Seeds in it). The chocolate cake and shakes are good as well. However, the shakes are incredibly pricey. Not a good place to go for ambiance--unless you go during an off-time, it's very likely that you will wait outside a while for a table, and then get stuck sitting right next to the door. If you happen to get a booth, though, it's very relaxing :)
