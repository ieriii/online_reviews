Sonoran dog: Jalapeo and cheese beef dog, jalapeo bacon, jalapeo mayonnaise, chopped onions, sliced tomatoes and pinto beans. Heaven. Spicy and flavorful. I had it in June and was sad because it was temporary. Thankfully, my friend Michael advocated for me to Doug and the sonoran dog has made it return. Even better than I remembered it. Is it authentic to the Sonoran dog? No. But it has quality ingredients and is mighty tasty. I've also had the Chicago style, which is delicious (don't forget the sport peppers). Good prices for the quality of food you're getting. Get that Sonoran before it disappears!
