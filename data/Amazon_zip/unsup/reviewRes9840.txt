My feelings are mixed on Le Colonial. To provide some context, I'm not really nuts about Vietnamese food to begin with, and I was brought here when I had been thinking all day I'd be having deep-dish pizza for dinner. That aside, the atmosphere here is lovely and elegant, though it looked a little cramped inside downstairs. My party sat on the upstairs deck, which was small but shaded nicely with trees (blocking the Starbucks across the street), and the occasional horse-drawn carriage rode by. I had the Sup Ga--alleged to be, as I recall, chicken, corn, cilantro (these are a few of my favorite things)--and it was, but it wasn't much else, including little if any flavor in the broth. I also had the peanut, jicama, and something else rolls with plum-peanut sauce. They were fine, but not remarkable. I went cheap ($6 for the soup and I think $8 or $9 for the rolls), but still didn't feel I got my money's worth. My friends seemed content with their $21-$25 entrees, but no one was enthusiastic, which at that price, I think we deserved.
