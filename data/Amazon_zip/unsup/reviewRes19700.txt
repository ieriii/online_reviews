Dissapointong menu, no personalized service. Stick to fish and chips and a guiness or harp. --server is barely civil for some reason. He keeps stumbling over his specials delivery speech. (I've heard it four times; I and three tables next to me were all sat at the same time.) --bread not made in house. Unable to determine ingredients (check for corn to which I'm allergic) --lively bar keeps the excitement going... It is an "Irish" pub after all ! Restaurant week 2010 dinner prix fix. Starter: lentil soup with lobster and creme fresh. --lobster overdone and rubber --presentation a total flop; runner poured a lumpy gunk over the two pieces of lobster and the result is a disaster --plate was cold so the soup is now barely lukewarm --creme fresh is probably in there somewhere What a waste. Second try: organic lettuces. Boo! --roasted hazlenuts bland (and old?) --lettuces had no spark, not fresh --dressing just weak and slimy --gorgonzola was the only interesting thing. Too bad I couldn't just have some lavosh.  Main:whitefish --greasy, flaky and bland --atop overfired greens and some sort of beef slosh. Was it kale? Ugh. Dessert: apple pastry with spooned ice cream --again with the room temp plate, this felt like something from a cafeteria buffet. This place is huge. There seems to be no end of nook and cranny spots where there are 5 more tables placed. Service reflects the quantity. Buser goes right down the line filling water glasses in a cadence. And they're packing em in, too. Am I missing something?
