Excellent food in a warm, contemporary atmosphere is what you get from Meli in Greektown. Granted it's a bit cramped; tables are placed fairly close to maximize seating, and considering how crowded it was on a Saturday morning, that's not a bad thing. Crowded as it was, our wait was under two minutes. One of the specials was a cornmeal chili pancake, which sounded so good, I went for it in spite of having been determined to try one of the eggs benedict variations. I was amply rewarded. The cakes were fluffy and savory, and really didn't suffer from a lack of syrup or butter (though I was tempted to ask for some honey to see if it would compliment the heat from the chilis.) They were served with very spicy bacon bits, almost too spicy for me first thing in the morning. Tasty, but something I went easy on. My companions both had eggs benedict variations. I don't care much for hot smoked salmon so I passed on trying Jim's breakfast, but Dawn had classic eggs benny, and a bite of hers convinced me that it was the real deal. The egg was perfectly cooked, and the hollandaise was excellent. The only thing I'd fault them on was that it was applied wit h a stingy hand. Eggs benedict should be a lavish dish with a bit of hollandaise left on the plate to mop up with that last bit of muffin. I was impressed to discover that they had a good selection of teas to choose from. I asked for ginger and got Numi tea, something of a premium brand. Nicely done. I didn't try the coffee but Jim and Dawn both said it was excellent. Yes, it's a bit pricey for breakfast, but most really nice places tend to be. And the food was worth it.
