Ridiculous "policies," rude and obnoxious staff. Admittedly, not all the wait staff falls into this category and it's a shame that one or two have ruined this place for me, but that's how it goes in the world of restaurants and service--there's always another place that gets it right and does it better. With a few exceptions, the food isn't all that memorable anyway. Far too much reliance upon meat substitutes. I think this place gets higher ratings than warranted because there aren't that many totally vegan places, and vegetarians feel unduly loyal or don't have much to compare it to. But there are more vegan choices in Chicago, and certainly better options.
