My friends and I were having a Gals night out with four of us. It was a blast at Demeras! Its a VERY good idea to do shared plates as the food is plenty and huge at a great price. We ordered the family style option under the Specials. This is where the chef selects several options for us to try. The platter served was HUGE and we barely made a dent in the meal. In retrospect, we could have had 5 or 6 chicks sharing our 1 dish, judging by the leftovers. Other thoughts - service is nice and helpful. The drinks such as the honey wine are too weird for me - reallllyy sweet. And the beer is too light for my preference.
