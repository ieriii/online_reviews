Oh I really wish I had a better experience to report. Long story short: service and kitchen were both really slow and weirdly-paced, resulting in a drawn-out experience that left some of us thirsty, some of us hungry and all of us a little bummed out. We went with a group of 6, after making a reservation for a recent Saturday night. The reservation-taker on the phone was adamant that we were all there by 7:15. Fair enough. We did this, but still weren't seated until 7:30, despite passing by other empty, set tables. It's a weird combination of byo-wine-only and full bar. We ordered a round of mojitos before dinner, since only one of us remembered their bottle --to share among 5 drinkers. I had the strawberry, and thought it was really good. I might even have ordered another if the waiter hadn't disappeared for such long stretches.  Food-wise, the apps (empanadas, chorizo, and yucca) were really good, and came out really fast. Dinner-wise, our good luck ended. Two of us ordered the fish soup (Saturday special) but were served the catfish entree instead. We managed to glad down our waiter after several efforts, and corrected the order, urging the rest of the group to go-ahead and start. Well, but the time they were finished (15-20 minutes or so) our fish soup was nowhere in site. We decided to cancel it all together, since everyone was nice enough to share what they had--since they give you more than enough food, we were sated, just sort of bummed that we never received what we ordered. Other service quibbles: slow to remove dirty plates, bring new silverware, refill water and it took the chimichurri sauce 3 requests to arrive. Oh well, at least it came out at all. The food was overall ok, but hard to enjoy given the service issues. I'd head to Tango Sur next time I need my tons of meat South American steakhouse fix...
