i went here with a friend because of the reviews i saw on yelp. and it's right around the corner from me so it's very convenient. i'm pressed for time right now but this has got to be one of the hidden gems of the northside. very good food. great service. we had to wait an hour to get a seat but theres a bar to have some pre dinner drinks and converse with other patrons. everybody is friendly. everybody here from the hostess, the waiter, the management, the bartenders, the valet. everybody. loved it. i'll give a more detailed review later.
