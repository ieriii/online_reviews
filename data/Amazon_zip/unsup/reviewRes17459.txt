I LOVE THIS PLACE! Oh, okay... so I don't love it as much as I love Milk & Honey in NY, but still - I have room to love more than one! Great cocktails (well balanced and prepared by tenders who take pride in what they do - in fact, I heard that two of the bartenders won a Saint Germain cocktails design competition). It's a great place to go and relax with friends. Don't forget about the food - the friend peanut butter, bacon and honey sandwhich is fantastic! If you're a wine and beer kinda person, no need to go (cocktails are the way here)... unless of course, you're accomodating the wishes of a loved one begging to be taken there... in which case, yes, they do have a short wine and beer listing!
