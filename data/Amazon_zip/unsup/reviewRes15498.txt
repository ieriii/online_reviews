*** Frequently Asked Question #19 *** Q: Hi! I'm very hungry but I don't want to spend more than $10 on a meal. Can you help me? A: I sure can. Head to Calo immediately. Sunday through Thursday, they offer a full rack of ribs, choice of salad or soup and pasta for $9.99. I'll type this again slowly in case you missed it: - Full rack of ribs (FULL RACK!) - Soup/Salad - Pasta $9.99 The ribs are excellent. You'd assume the restaurant would try to cheat you b/c of the outrageous deal but they don't. The meat easily falls off the bone and is very, very tasty. I had the chicken rice soup and that too was very good. I was shocked when the waitress asked me what pasta I wanted w/ my meal. I wanted to get this $9.99 deal in writing b/c the amount of food proposed compared to the dollar amount made no sense whatsoever.  Order their fried calamari as well. It, too, is excellent. You just saved a ton of money on the rib deal so you can afford it. There's free parking across the street. Go now.
