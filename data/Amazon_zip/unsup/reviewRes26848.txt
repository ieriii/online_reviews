We went here on Thursday night because a very good friend of mine loves Rick Bayless. Knowing that Mexican food absolutely cannot be presented well, I went with an open mind to try different things on the waiter's recommendation. Suffice it to say the food here is a disaster. It's clear that Frontera Grill is resting on its laurels rather than coming up with anything new or satisfying. Let's start with the drinks. The mojito was a mess. I ordered it with Rum, the classic way. It was way too sweet and had far too much lime, so much so that my stomach was tied up with acid after half the drink. I couldn't even finish it, and mojitos are my favorite drink. The guacamole I have to say was excellent, but the tortilla chips that came with them were stale and had an inexplicable softness to them, as if they had been sitting out way too long. The ceviche trio was OK, but not stellar. We also had the pork Tinga, the wahoo fish of the day, and the duck. Each thing was presented slopped onto a plate with no consideration whatsoever for presentation. The duck was tasteless and over-cooked, as was the wahoo. For about $25/entree, I expect way more than that. We skipped dessert, obviously. I'm sure the margaritas may be ok, but c'mon anyone can make margaritas. The conclusion with tourist trap restaurants such as this and places like Scott Conant's Scarpetta is that these guys are lucky that they hit it big early in their careers and have TV shows now, cuz if they came out with this food now they'd be eaten alive by the competition.
