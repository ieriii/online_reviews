When I look for a great breakfast place, a line out front waiting to get a table is always a great sign.  Meli is that type of place. Located in Greektown, Meli is a bright and cute breakfast cafe and juice bar. They have a great variety of classic breakfast favorites and some items with a new twist.  During my most recent visit I had the Fig omelet, with Pancetta, onions and tomatoes. It was amazing. The sweetness of the figs with the fresh eggs and pancetta was absolutely divine. The hash browns were some of the most flavorful I've ever had. I would like some more crispy bits of brown on them, but you can't beat the flavor. The honey butter and jam of the day, quince the day I was there, are that extra little touch that gives Meli 5 stars.  This place is a breakfast staple that I'll visit every time I'm in Chicago.
