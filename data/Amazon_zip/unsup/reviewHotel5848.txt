I agree with all the complimentary things others have said and have special praise for Ken at the front desk. That said, I'm disappointed by the noise factor here, which they didn't adequately address when doing the renovations. Most of the rooms are RIGHT ON Broadway, a very busy, noisy street, requiring that you keep your windows always closed. The problem is that the double-glazed windows are of a cheapish variety and not up to the task. Couple that with the fact that I can hear every syllable of my neighbors on the other side of my bedroom wall and every clumping footstep of my overhead neighbors and it makes for an atmosphere that's not as relaxing as it should be or could have been with adequate sound insulation. The bathrooms are indeed magnificent, but how about those things NOT seen? The renovators missed a chance to make the place genuinely restful and that's a real shame.
