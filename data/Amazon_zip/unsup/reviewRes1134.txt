Lived up to the hype and I'm coming back on my next visit for sure. I came looking for the best Chicago Hot Dog and I found it! If you like pate, try the Foie Gras. I wasn't as impressed by the other specialty hot dogs as I felt they had too much going on...next time will try the corn dog and definitely another Chicago style Hot Dog.
