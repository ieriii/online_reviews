Serious disappointment. I brought my wife here for her 44th birthday. We were given the best table in the house and that's where the fun ended. Our service was slow and apathetic once it was clear we weren't going to spend $400.00. We did spend $200.00 and got two glasses of wine, two beers and the chef's tasting menu of the most disconnected flavors I have ever experienced. When we complimented the one decent dish (rabbit w/ sour cherries) the server's response was yeah, everyone likes that one. We ordered lobster and were served the most pathetic langostine I have ever seen. In short...pretty much everything was over cooked and then set to luke warm..and we both found ourselves being able to make only so much conversation and complimenting of the surroundings between tastings before we felt that we would fall asleep. NOT recommended.
