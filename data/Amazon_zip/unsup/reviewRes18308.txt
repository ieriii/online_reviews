The tortas here are a little pricey but definitely worth it. I've had the Choriqueso (chorizo and poblano), Pepito (shortribs and carmelized onions), and the Cochinita Pibil (suckling pig and habanero). Of those three, my favorite is probably the Pepito but the others are close. The cochinita is very spicy (my server told me to be careful before I ate it). My eyes were watery the entire time (but it tasted so good). The staff is friendly and patient towards the patrons. When I visit Chicago, I definitely try to hit this place and usually go in the morning to try to avoid the lines.
