Imagine if Starbuck's and Denny's had a baby. The product of that happy union would undoubtedly be Third Coast Cafe. Right in the heart of the ritzy Gold Coast / Lincoln Park area, you wouldn't expect this little gem of a restaurant--with its plain, bordering on boring decor--to find its niche, but instead, it's always bopping. Live music in the evenings and a familial-acting, casually-dressed staff add to the relaxed ambience of the place. But that's not why you'e reading this review, so...on to the food! The breakfasts here are standard fare--potatoes O'Brien and eggs in every standard style. Where Third Coast really shines is in its sandwiches. Available in three types of bread, the sandwiches all come toasted a la grilled cheese. Of particular note are the Coronation Chicken Salad and the Smoked Turkey Brie. The Chicken Salad is a delicious number with moderate hints of curry mixed in with the raisins, apples, celery, and moist chunks of white chicken meat. Don't miss this place!
