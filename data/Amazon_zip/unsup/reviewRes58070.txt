Another restaurant in Chinatown with awesome food but terrible terrible service. The food was 5 stars but no star for service and decor. I was working in the southloop and deciced to take home some spicy food. While I was waiting inside the restaurant, I actually heard 'animals' fighting and running above the ceiling...are you kidding me? I was about to run outside. Come on, for being the most successful restaurant in the hood, do some clean-up on your space and management !!
