Can never go wrong with BYOB, I ordered one of their specialty dishes and it was absolutely heavenly. I decided to upgrade and try their special costan rican rice, it was okay, I will have to try their regular rice next time. Service was okay, it was very packed however, everyone was friendly and for the most part attentive. It has a nice low key vibe but def not first date atmosphere great place to go with friends and split a bottle of wine before hitting the city.
