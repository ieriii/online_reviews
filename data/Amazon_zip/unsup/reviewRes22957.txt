I brought a friend here visiting Chicago from out of the country. We were sat at a table where there was spilled water and we asked 3 times to have it cleaned up but they never did. The chips with the green sauce were good. The chifrijo was ok. Certainly not how it looked on DDD but acceptable anyway considering our hunger at dinnertime. Now we ordered the Pepito where the steak was kinda of dehydrated and chewy. Also, the Costa Rican sandwich which was the same thing except slathered in too much mayo and mustard and the lettuce and tomato were wilting. I can honestly say I've had better sandwiches at Arby's for half the price. But the worst thing about our experience was the swinging door on the covered porch kept banging shut every time someone came in or out. We were unfortunate to sit right next to the entrance. Gotta get some bumpers or springs for that door. I had high hopes for this place but left a little bummed.
