BIG FAN of this hotel. Super close to EVERYTHING. In walking distance to Michigan Ave food and shops. 3 minutes from the Red Line. 3 minutes from the little Irish-bar area. Very friendly staff - the airlines threw our 3.4 oz toothpaste away and we got a new tube quickly. We got lucky with an amazing view, as they put us on the 11th floor overlooking the city. The rooms are a bit small, but it wasn't a big deal at all for us, since we spent all our time out and about in the city. And I love any place that has FREE WiFi. Many many thanks for not nickel and diming people. For anyone looking for a great hotel, close to everything - Hotel Indigo is definitely a good one. I'd stay here again on my next visit.
