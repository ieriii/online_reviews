+ great place to try Chicagoan deep dish pizza, - noisy If you are looking for a nice pizza dinner that is easy on your budget try Giordano's. Besides common thin-crust pizza and Italian pasta they also serve deep-dish pizza, typical for the Chicago area. Contrary to the common thin-crust pizzas the deep dish ones are stuffed and look like a pie with the dough formed like a bowl and are as thick as quiches. The pizzas come in different sizes and you should really take a look at the pizzas first before you order unless you like to have a large doggy bag with you. I had a deep dish pizza at Pizzeria Uno before but have to admit Giordano's pizzas are more juicy and tasteful. Please note that it takes 45 minutes for the pizza to be baked! Since the branch close to 'Mag Mile' is a tourist hub allow some waiting time and use the wait to pre-order your pizza at the counter, so it's served promptly after you were seated. + great place to try Chicagoan deep dish pizza, + inexpensive, - noisy
