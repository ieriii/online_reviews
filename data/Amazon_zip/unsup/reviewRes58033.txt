My pleasant experiences at Mia Francesca's have never ended. Every time I go we have a wonderful time and are treated like royalty. The first time I went I had only been living in Chicago for a few months and my dad was up to visit. I made the reservations on the recommendation of my boss and wasn't sure what to expect. When we got there, we had a bit of a wait so we ordered a couple of glasses of wine at the bar. Our drinks were empty and the manager immediately came over and got us two new glasses for free, he then led us to the upstairs more private area of the restaurant. Honestly, the pasta I had that night was the best pasta dish I have ever had. The menu is constantly changing, but I've been lucky enough to get it once more since then. While we were eating I mentioned to the manager that I loved the wine I was drinking and would like to buy a bottle if they sold it. They did not, but he brought us two new glasses of a different wine he thought we would like. After that he sent out free dessert and then when we were leaving he handed me a bag with the two bottles of wine I liked (unopened) and 2 t-shirts in it. He would not let us pay for it and he would not take a tip! He just said come again sometime. I couldn't believe how they were treating us and I must say, my dad had a wonderful time and thought I was a celebrity or something! Well since then, I've gone many times and every time is a treat. sometimes the manager sends out a free app, sometimes he doesn't, but he is always so friendly as are the rest of the staff. The food is amazing and not as expensive as other Italian restaurants I've been to in Chicago. If you haven't been, go. The atmosphere downstairs is busy and loud, but very fun all the same. If you're wanting a more quiet dinner I would recommend requesting the upstairs dining area if there is no private party or going somewhere else. This is still one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, it's a classic.
