This place is obviously trying to live off its name, location, and reputation. But this should be rated based on what you get today, and thats not much. Went to a wedding here and while it sounded so nice to go to a wedding at the Drake, there are far superior hotels in chicago. I am not even talking about decor because that is everyones personal taste. But, when it comes to service, theres either good service or bad service. This was bad service. I even saw the concierge recommend an italian restaurant to a lady asking for a good japanese food. I guess they just have their list of what they like and stick with it without thinking about what you really want. DONT EVER LOSE ANYTHING HERE! SECURITY DOES NOT LIKE TO PICK UP THEIR PHONE! AND IF YOU EVER TRY GOING THROUGH THE OPERATOR TO TALK TO SECURITY, THEY WILL DROP YOUR CALL. I won't go into specifics, but its sad to see one of the finer and more reputable hotels in chicago go so far downhill. Whatever your choice in decor is, thats fine. But a hotel with this price point should have better service.
