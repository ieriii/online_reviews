I'm sorry, but the success of this place is entirely based upon a funny statue and some Food Network specials. They don't use Vienna Beef; the hot dogs have absolutely skimpy toppings; the fries are greasy and cheap; and Superdawg charges--by FAR--the most for a hot dog in the entire city. Chicago is abounding with great hot dog places that do it right, this place is mostly shtick for tourists that don't know any better.
