I've been to Hot Doug's on several occasions and it never fails to deliver what it promises....IN-CASED MEATS!!!! They have so many different varieties of sausages it's hard to choose. And by the time you've made it through the line you are so f'ing hungry that you might end up ordering one of everything. I've had nearly everything on the permanent menu and I can say it would be hard to go wrong with anything you choose.I know many rave about the duck fat fries. I'm not a big fan, I think they are severely overrated. So if you have a few hours to kill (1.5 hours waiting in line) make a trip to emporium.
