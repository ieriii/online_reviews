I'll keep this simple: if you are impressed by fake Italian food that you could easily make at home yourself, a cramped loud space with no waiting area, and a ridiculously rude manager with a Napolean complex who likes to inform people that unless their entire party is exactly, to the minute, on time, you will lose your reservation, then Caro Mio is for you. I actually saw this happen to two groups of people, and the sad thing is the restaurant was less than half full. Oh, and byob? Big deal, your own home is byob too, and you don't have to listen to some jerk up on his reservation high horse.
