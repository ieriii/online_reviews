Believe me when I say I was skeptical on how good Crisp Korean chicken would be when I didn't see an Asian face in the small eatery. We decided to give it a go anyway. We were starved after watching the Cubs beat the Cardinals on an afternoon game during some time in August. I have second thoughts about watching that game now because, being the center of the world and all, I think we gave the Cardinals some much needed JUJU. Yeah the Cubs won that day, but we made the Cardinals win the big one. ;-P Crisp had a $19.99 Whole Chicken Meal deal available and also in the Yelp check-in offers. Great deal! Worth every penny. You can split your order with the different chicken flavors, which was great since it allowed us to try different things. I don't quite remember which chicken flavors we had since it was some time ago, but it was good. Everything was good, kimchi and all. After awhile, I noticed an Asian man lurking behind the kitchen. Woohoo! I'm just saying... Even without the legit creds for the place I still enjoyed Crisp thoroughly. The place has amazing Korean chicken. It's a little pricey but the chicken is great. But most Korean chicken eateries are usually pricey from what I've experienced: from an old friends Korean chicken place in Oakland to the Korean chicken joints in SoCal. But, still, nothing beats the joints in Seoul. Crisp is now our unofficial go to place before and/or after a Cubs game (especially against the Giants). I got a feeling I'll be trying to go to Chi-town a lot since the maestro Theo is in town now. The series should be quite exciting next summer. Go Giants! Go Crisp Korean chicken! And, why not, Go Cubbies!
