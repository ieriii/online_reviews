I love this place! I can't exactly say why, but the cucumbers in the water glass just warm my heart. It's such a small touch, but so lovely and unexpected considering this is a pretty cheap and laid back neighborhood resturant. The decor is lovely with beautiful beaded Algerian lamps, waitstaff is unpretentious and kind, and the crepes are healthy, vegetarian-friendly, and delicious! Just like the little touch of cucumber in the water glass, the presentation of their crepes is awesome- they take fruit garnish decoration to the next level. Each time I go, the garnish/sauce arrangement is a different artistic masterpiece of creativity and funness. If you get the mint tea, it comes in a sweet old style silver tea pot with a dainty tea cup and fresh mint leaves, gives you the feeling that you're experiencing something special. The most lovable part is that they aren't some new trendy resturant charging tons of money for these details- they are super cheap for the quality and kind of experience you receive.
