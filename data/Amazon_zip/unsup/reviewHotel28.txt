I can't imagine paying full price to stay here. We got a deal from a travel site, which made it worthwhile because the location is terrific. The photos on yelp seem to be professionally lit, and very misleading. If I had paid full price, I would have been pissed. But, if you're the sort of person who can deal with a youth hostel, then you'll love it here! The lobby is clean and inviting, but the charm disappears after that. Our room was small, dingey, with blistering walls, painted on crown molding, and worn drapes. No refrigerator or anything, so don't bring home any leftovers. But, on the bright site, the bed and sheets were very clean. The mattress seemed quite new--I'm a mattress inspector the instant I walk into any hotel room. The shower had AWESOME water pressure and got quite hot quite fast, and the AC could pump a lot of cold air in fast. I imagine this place was quite the jewel like 30 years ago. We did bring some leftovers into our room that got a little smelly (before we realized there wasn't a fridge) and my husband took the bag of food (from Frontera, so sad we couldn't keep it!!!) to the concierge and explained he wanted to throw it away. The guy gave my husband directions to the dumpster out back!!! OMG. Even a Ramada concierge would say, "Oh, let me take that for you sir." So, anyhow, if you're looking for a place to sleep, take a hot shower, and have zero expectations beyond a clean, safe place to sleep, this is your spot. It is withing walking distance of a LOT of awesome stuff. But PLEASE go find a deal somewhere on line!! If you're looking for romance, indulgence, pampering: run away!
