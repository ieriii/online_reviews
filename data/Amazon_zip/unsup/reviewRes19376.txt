My friend and I ordered: House Poutine - fries with gravy with vegetables and and pieces of pork. It tasted like a pot pie which was okay. I'm wondering if the vegetables were the frozen ones because it looked like the frozen peas and carrots you get in the freezer aisle. Caramelized Onion Soup - I was really excited because it has short ribs in it but the soup was kinda watery and not that favorable. Caramelized Lobster - the best dish. I would come back to eat this dish again. Fish and Chips - I've had better fish and chips for a lesser price. My friend ordered a local porter which smelled like Guinness and taste pretty good. I order the pinot nior which was good as well. I don't know if I'd come back here again but wouldn't mind trying the other food they have on their menu.
