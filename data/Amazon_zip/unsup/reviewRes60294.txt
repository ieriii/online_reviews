If you are into messed up lines, slow service, big attitudes, eye rolling and pen tapping, this IS the place for you!!!Additionally, if you are into the grunge look, you'd be in the right place. I'm all for everyone having their own style but when you look like you just rolled out of bed, couldn't brush your teeth or wash your face, then that's a problem. The food is adequate, nothing special...The space is cramped, mommy's with huge off road strollers, and a staff that only their own mother's could love!!!!No one, no one on the staff smiles there. The sad troll of a girl at the counter sneers rather than speaks...Take $20-$30 out of your wallet and just flush it down the toilet!I blame the owner, she raised/trained them to be the unhappy, grumbly, eye rolling oompa loompas that they are.
