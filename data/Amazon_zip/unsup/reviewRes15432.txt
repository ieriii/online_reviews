Excellent food, friendly service, good drinks and an overall wonderful time. This was my first time ever going to Calo and I went last night with my parents who are in town. They had been to this place before and recommended it, I am glad they did. We did not order an appetizers, just main dishes. This was ok because they bread they bring to the table is great. They have regular bread as well as something I can only describe as pizza bread. YUM! Each main dish came with soup or salad and we all chose to have the cream of mushroom soup. This was an EXCELLENT decision. The soup was clearly homemade, with the mushrooms freshly cut and the soup was clearly made with real cream. The flavoring was spot on and amazing. For my main course I had the lobster ravioli with mushroom, asparagus and sun dried tomato cream sauce. The ravioli were clearly house made, none looked exactly alike and the filling in each was fresh well cooked lobster meat. The lobster was perfectly cooked, not in any way chewy and was well flavored. The sauce was excellent and although i was hesitant about all of the ingredients, they all went very well together. My wine was chilled to the right temperature and my parents liked their drinks, they were large and poured well. They also loved their main course. My dad had linguini with clams, which was delicious and had just the right balance of garlic. My mother had gnocchi with red sauce. The gnocchi where not the traditional potato ball, these were lovely light pillow of yum filed with cheese. Delicious! A fantastic meal and even better company. :)
