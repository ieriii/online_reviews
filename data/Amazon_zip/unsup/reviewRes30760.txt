So, I really wanted to like Sunda. It was my request to go there with my friends, they obliged. Anyway, I told them I would be about 15-20 min late. They went at 6 (we had a reservation)and I got there at 625 or so and the very snotty hostesses refused to seat them until I got there AND since I hadn't gotten there within 15 minutes, they gave away our table. Now, I don't get the whole, we don't seat incomplete parties because they probably would have had a bunch of drinks waiting for me and our tab would have been way more, but I digress...if that is your policy, whatever. But seriously, giving away our table?? Would you have put a party of 3 at a different table than a party of 4? I think not, there is no such thing as a 3 person table. Rude. So then, we have to sit at the "communal table" whatever, it seems fine. Has anyone sat at this table? Talk about the absolute worst stools in the entire world. I seriously wonder if anyone actually sat on them before picking them. They were about 8 inches wide with no foot rest area. Anyway, once our server came she redeemed this review by adding 2 stars, I probably would have given zero if it was possible. She was very nice and made some great recommendations. The duck salad was awesome as well as the firecracker roll! The mushroom appetizer was nothing special. I loved the rock shrimp and I am not even a shrimp lover. The ox tail with crispy rice was seriously so good. Oh and they had some really good drinks! Overall I just don't think that I would go back to a place like this. The food was really good, but the attitude was just not needed. The chairs and tables were uncomfortable, the hostesses were snotty and the place was super loud. I didn't even have to deal with the whole not seating us thing, so I know my friends were even more annoyed. Good food, lousy customer service!
