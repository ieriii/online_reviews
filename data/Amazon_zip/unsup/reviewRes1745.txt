I hate waiting...you have to wait here most of the time from 10 min to an hour plus.  I will only come here when I think the wait will be less than 15 minutes. I always order their dogs/sausages with the standard toppings they recommend.  I would recommend you do the same. Also, although it seems like a lot of people do take out here, I think the food tastes a lot better if you eat it straight out of the kitchen. I have tried over 10 of their special combo sausages. I would say 1/3 of them I think are awesome and brilliant, 1/3 are good, and 1/3 I am not a fan of.  I am a fan of encased meats as much as the next person, but only willing to come here with little to no wait. (cash only!)
