I debated on this one... I don't wanna be a five-star slut, but this place deserved it. First, it's tiny. Really, really tiny. There are no tables, just a bar with stools that wraps around the wall of the dining area. The walls are papered in Cuban newspaper clippings and all over the places is seething with charm. I ordered the Lechon sandwich (shredded roast pork with romaine lettuce, grilled onions, and sweet plantains) plus a large (16oz) hot chocolate. Delicious. Juicy, tender pork with sweetness from the plantain. I finished with an enormous portion of bread pudding. The sandwich, pudding, and hot chocolate came to about $13. The workers were helpful and very attentive to all the customers. Simple, entirely unpretentious, friendly people, and amazing food... This is what it's all about. .
