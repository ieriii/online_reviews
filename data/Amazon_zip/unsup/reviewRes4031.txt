amazing food, casual chaos. just remember to bring the guys something to drink - the more they drink, the more entertaining they get (esp chef carlson). started with chocolate cherry and shot of makers. then coriander basil soda, amazing. duck. soup inspired by wendy's baked potato. quail egg ravioli (ridiculous). tortellini with apple. salmon roe that tasted like fruit loops. salmon. halibut. pheasant. some amazing ice cream. root beer inspired dessert. sure i am forgetting so many more courses which were equally fantastic. they were all amazing. def an amazing experience, and somewhere i will go again.
