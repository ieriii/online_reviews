great food, and truly unique variety. Super expansive menu and lots and lots of combos. And of course, Doug is happy to lend a helping hand if you are confused about the choices you wanna make. Would recommend you stay away from the fries. Not that they are bad or anything, just keep more room for the dogs :)
