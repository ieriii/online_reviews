This place is good, but not great. Let me start off by saying that the Peking duck was tasty and well worth the price. But being Chinese and all, I know that real Peking duck is supposed to be mostly the skin and VERY little of the meat. As I watched the chef slice, I kept wondering to myself why she was slicing up all the meat pieces as well. I think I've seen better slicing come from less trained wait staff at other restaurants. I believe this restaurant is simply trying to sell the fact that the duck chef went to China for training, but after a brief conversation with her, I learned that she wasn't really trained and "learned" by watching people do it at restaurants. It's decent food, no doubt. But I feel there are far better Peking ducks in the city. Traditionally, the duck is served with pancakes but their buns were tasty and fit the bill as well. I liked the fact that they're freshly steamed. So yes, my review is very mixed on the place. The food was ok, not worth the trip in my opinion.
