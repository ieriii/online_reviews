This was the hotel that we were assigned for our winter holiday in Chicago. Per usual, I used the ol P.line and paid a very reasonable price for the room.  The main entrance is located on Michigan avenue, and it's possible to be stopped at an odd angle, though it shouldn't hinder anyone from unloading or loading people or luggage. The concierge desk is very closely located to the main entrance, and service was speedy. The actual room was in the main tower with a city view. It was amply sized, and all needed amenities were present. This is a convenient location, and includes a few restaurants/bars with a Starbucks in in the building.
