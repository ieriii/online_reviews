Delicious tropical food. Just the maduros and boiled yuca with mojo are enough reason to keep coming back. The tinted squid with rice and the iced coffee with horchata were amazing. Got an oatmeal shake to go, and it was the pefect dessert. Portions are plenty and the food is spectacular. Casual atmosphere and lovely tiled restroom facilities. Clean, and the staff are great and fast! Love it. There was plenty of seating when we dropped by for a very late lunch, but I hear it can get incredibly busy sometimes. Will be back often!
