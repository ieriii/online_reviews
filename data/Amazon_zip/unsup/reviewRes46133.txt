Sometimes I feel guilty for loving restaurants like Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory. Some criticize they're too cardboard cutout, impersonal and average. I don't care! I love them anyway. Big, open spaces, bread baskets that I can literally finish myself, enormous portions and decadent desserts - tell me what's wrong with any of that? Because of its location, Grand Lux gets its fair share of tourist traffic. Lines can be very long, but most of the time, I've lucked out and have only had to wait a max of five minutes (Eat later in the day and on weekdays if you can). My favorite dish here is the Tuna "Nicoise" Melt. Tuna melts have been a new favorite food of mine. I feel its a tad healthier than a burger, but just as filling. The tuna melt had a huge amount of flavor and texture - lots of veggies (think celery, green beans, bell peppers) and they didn't skimp on the tuna. Topped with my favorite cheese - havarti - this sandwich is king! I usually am too full to grab dessert here, but I do want to come back to try their beignets. Definitely come here with an empty stomach. And try to save room for dessert (I need to try to do that!).
