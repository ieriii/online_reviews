Wow, what a pleasant surprise this place was. Bring your appetite because it is sooooo easy to just pig out. I walked out of there feeling like after Thanksgiving where you want to just plop on the couch , unbuckle your belt and just take a nap.  All the meats were delicious and perfectly cooked. If you like your meat cooked well done, medium , or rare, no worries as they'll have differently cooked meats on the skewers and will ask your preference. They were pretty busy when I was there but the servers ran around quickly and a steady parade of meats kept flowing quickly for us. Didn't care for the salad bar. I love a good salad but just didn't like their selections at all. Service was excellent. We were there for lunch which was $25 a plate and that was really a great value given how good the food was and how much we all pigged out.
