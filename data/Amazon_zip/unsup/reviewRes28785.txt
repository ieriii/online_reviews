I've been here twice and each time we've gotten a solid pizza. I love the crust!!! The cheese on the pizza is great, but there is nothing better than caramelized cheese on your crust! Both times we've gotten pepperoni, sausage and mushroom - all the ingredients are quite tasty though I have to say that the more I have sausage the more I don't like it that much, but oh well! Anyway, there's not much more I can add to this place except to say that it's a great place to go after a movie, especially when it's a later movie and you are absolutely famished by the end of it. We've seen some crappy movies recently so the pizza afterwards has definitely been the highlight. The Miller Lite is also always cold and the perfect compliment to our pizza. Enjoy!
