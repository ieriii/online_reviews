After attending a Yelp event here about one year ago, I finally got to come for dinner, courtesy of a joint birthday event.. My friend and I had reservations for 7:30, and we were seated immediately. Our server Jenn was very friendly and accommodating, and she gave us a number of recommendations. The menu has of course a splendid array of pastas, meat dishes and seafood, and there were about 8 daily specials available. We both ended up choosing pastas. I took advantage of the rare occasion to have Lobster-stuffed raviolis, and my friend chose a linguini pasta with rapini, and mixed seafood. I do not eat pasta out too often, but I would say these two items were definitely worth it. Nice large portions, too. Both dishes were bursting with flavor, served at a good temperature and of course, very filling. The dinner salads are a good size, too (which should keep one from eating too much pasta-right!). The dressing was light enough but just a bit too heavy on the balsamic vinegar for my taste. I loved the tongue shui of the shaved carrots, though. We shared a bread pudding dessert which was small in portion, and big, big on texture and flavors. Lot's of things going on there. Raspberry things. Chocolate things. And warm, mushy cinnamon/love things. The wine we had was fine. I didn't labor over the choices and am no aficionado, anyway. Mel and I both agreed that the atmosphere and the people here really make it what it is. Friendly and relaxed. Warm and inviting. Definitely a good date or group place. Great menu. A little bit on the pricey side, but worth it for a special occasion.
