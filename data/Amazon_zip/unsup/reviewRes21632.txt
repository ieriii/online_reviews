Great hotdogs, classic spot in hotdog history. Why 3-stars? Well, it is a bit toooo pricey and the service still needs to "cleanse" up. If the price was a bit lower, it would def get a higher rating. The fries are addicting. I'm not sure what they put in them, but dang... you just wanna keep ordering them again and again.  During the summer, Superdawg is a great place to order a malt/shake and sit while the summersun sets.  Mmmmmm.
