I liked it, we went on a sunday so it wasn't crowded and sat down right away. They were quick to get us glasses for our wine and beer. They we're even nice enough to pop open the cans and pour the beer and keep the glasses filled. I dont' see that usually at BYOB palce so it was a ncie touch of good service. The rolls were generally pretty good. The Peter Parker roll was my favorite and had some kick to it too. The Summer Roll was off, something wasn't right. The Tuna App was good but not great looked identical to Pinp Pong's App. The restaurant was nice and small and the music was good and at a low level so I enjoyed just hanging out and talking there after we were done eating.
