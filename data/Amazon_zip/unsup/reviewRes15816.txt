OMG! This place is full of intensity. It always delivers the best food of my life. Many of the ingredients are fresh and local (some grown on the roof). They can do things to pig that you wouldn't think are possible! The decor is high energy with beat thumbing latin beats. The service is top notch by being a nice combination of hip, connectable, and there when you want not when you don't! The food sounds risky, but its marries things together beautifully. Be sure to check this place out! Attire can be dressy or nice jeans.
