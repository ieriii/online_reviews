Came here last night on a mission. I was finally going to get the CB&J w/ mac and cheese. I got here around 8:00pm - later than I had planned on. This place definitely gets too crowded for its own good, though I hear they are expanding. Anyhow, it was packed so I decided "oh well, next time" and walked out. As I was walking, I thought... wait a minute - I came all the way over here. I don't care how busy they are - I'm going to get that damn sandwich. And I did. And it blew my mind.
