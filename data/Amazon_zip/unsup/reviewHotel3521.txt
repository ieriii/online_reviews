Very impressed by this hotel. We were given a complimentary upgrade when we arrived! The beds here were the most comfortable I've slept on. I didnt want to get up in the morning! Customer service was excellent. The location was great with the exception being that there is a hospital nearby and we heard ambulances off and on all night one night.
