Artopolis is adorable. I love the storied seating and how the doors and windows are all open to historic Halsted on a nice day. Most of the seating seems set for two, and why not - the atmosphere is pretty romantic for a brunch or lunch date. Even so, I've gone with larger groups, and they are very accommodating. There's a very laid-back, European feel to the service and set-up. The desserts are amazing and artful. I've gotten a bunch to go and brought them to parties. They are always a hit! The coffee and espresso drinks are great. The lattes are gorgeous - with the frothy milk poured on top of the espresso - not mixed - so the glass is full of swirls as they combine. The portions are pretty large. I suppose most Greek food gets served in sweet excess, but even the sandwiches come stacked with sides that could serve 2-3. And it's all so delicious, you might forget to stop eating. But don't forget to save room for dessert!
