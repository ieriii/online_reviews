SO good! They have an unbelievable spread of food here! Come hungry because you are gonna want an empty stomach to start with :) Wine and beer selection is excellent. Food to die for (not a fan of the game, but steak, pork and chicken were so well marinated). You must try this place if you are in Chicago!
