Walking down Clark in deep conversation, my friend suddenly perked up, "WHAT did he say?!" I obviously wasn't listening as I have mastered the art of tuning out everything I hear while walking down Clark Street...but this time it was actually worth listening to! We had just walked past a Pasta Bowl employee who was passing out $10 gift cards. We asked him "what's the catch?" There wasn't one. Simply cash fo free. This doesn't happen in Lincoln Park. Seeing as we had no dinner plans and realized we could eat dinner for almost nothing, we went that night. Cute, small space, we weren't really greeted by anyone, but once we seated ourselves, our server was really nice and attentive. We both ordered the ravioli special with seafood and it was pretty good! We both substituted the marinara for the lemon cream sauce that originally came with the dish which made it much lighter. Solid portion, I kind of wish it had come with something (like a salad). Great variety for a small Italian place with very reasonable prices. Inside the restaurant, we had to be careful what table we sat at because the air conditioner was dripping on almost all the booths in front...kind of weird. However, I paid five whole dollars for some solid food!
