This place has exceptional gourmet pizzas! And that is about it, its a small menu. What they do is phenomenal but I just felt they could have add a few more items to their menu. I guess I could have done a better job of researching before I went. So, if you want a great gourmet pizza or you want to have a few drinks while snacking on some za it is definitely worth it. But if you are going with a large group of people or don't know what you want, then it might not be your place.
