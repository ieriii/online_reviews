YUM! This place is fantastic! A group of us went last night and I couldn't be happier with our experience. The restaurant is very sleek and well decorated without being pretentious. Our server was so nice and accommodating and knew the food up and down. The cocktails were delicious and the food was outstanding! We shared the oyster flight, (perfection), the lox & bagel (best-salmon-ever!), the meatballs, buffalo chicken and the risotto. All of which was incredibly tasty and fun! My main course was the pheasant and waffles. I loved it. So juicy and delicious. Everyone at our table just LOVED their food. And the deserts were just amazing too. The french toast was perfect and the chocolate-chocolate-chocolate was heavenly. I really can't say enough good things about this place and can't wait to go back. It's the prefect spot to bring your foodie friends, go on a date, or bring the visiting parents. It is a bit on the pricey side, so, for me at least, this is a special occasion restaurant.
