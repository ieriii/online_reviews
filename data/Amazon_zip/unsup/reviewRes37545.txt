This place is by far the fanciest grocery store in the city. If you want to make a special meal for a special someone, this is the place. The employees are so knowledgeable and nice. I had one gentleman help me pick out wine and cheese to accompany my meat selection, so great. The one area that gets me every time I walk into this place is the bakery area, OH MY GOD!  The cupcakes, creme brulee, and bread pudding are to die for.
