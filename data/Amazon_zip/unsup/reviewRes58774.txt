Can I rave about this place enough? I frequently tell my friends that this is the best Thai in the city. I miss living in Ravenswood--I used to walk over here weekly and get food!The food is excellent. Beyond excellent. I'm drooling thinking about it now. This place is always quiet, too. The service is very hands-off, but they are polite and do check in with you frequently--they just let you have a quiet meal. Highly recommend for a dinner party, date, or even just take-out.
