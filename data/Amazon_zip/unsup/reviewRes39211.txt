On our last full night in Chicago, we headed north to Logan's Square to hit up Longman & Eagle and the Whistler. But we had such a good time at Longman & Eagle, we stayed the night. Their whiskey sour was very different to me. While Seven Grand here in L.A. makes their own sour mix, Longman & Eagle relies on just citrus to give it a slight acidic tinge. Very nice. Longman & Eagle believes in whiskey should be for drinking, not for taking up space in a bar. They offer inexpensive shots of many fine whiskeys and unbelievable prices on their cocktails. I was shocked to see the Manhattans and other drinks going for $8. I've been curious about Makers 46 for a while but have yet to try it. The bartender mentioned a better one to try was Woodford's Reserve Grand Masters. If I could import a bar to L.A., this would be the one. Plus they serve some delicious looking food. L&E is definitely on my list for the next time I'm out in Chicago.
