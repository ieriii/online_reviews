While I'm waiting in line to order my bacon sausage with avocado mayo, roma tomatoes and lettuce, the kid in front of me is standing in front of Doug, talking on his cell phone and holding up the line. "Say hi for me," shouts Doug. The kid ignores him. So Doug shouts into the phone, "Tell Michael he needs to start wearing pants when he leaves the house!" The kid bought a cookie and sat down. Bravo, Doug. Bravo. You're the coolest restaurant owner I've ever met. Oh, and my sausage was mind-blowingly delicious. I normally wouldn't dream of paying $7 for a weiner, but I would gladly pay $10 for the BLT. I keep trying to induce burps so I can experience the flavor again. UPDATE 12/7/07: Waited a half hour in the snow to get inside. Had the ribeye steak sausage with garlic-horseradish sauce. It was amazing. Duck fat fries were outstanding. On Tuesday, I had a regular bratwurst. It also was kickass. Some people wait a half hour, then got to the counter with no cash. Doug's only takes cash. I felt bad for them.
