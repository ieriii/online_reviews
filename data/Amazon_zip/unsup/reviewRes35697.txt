They have moved to their new location, directly off of Broadway now. This place is huge and it better be... to accommodate the amount of people that will soon find this delicious restaurant. You can get delicious Pho at Tank noodle, or good dim sum over at Furama... but if you crave delicious pork and duck... then skip those and go directly to Sun Wah. Right away, you can see a prepping window at the entrance. This place does it right. I started out with some pork, done Filipino style... called Lechon.. it was like i was in the Philippines again.. Then I had the Peking duck.. They cut it right in front of you, and its a 4 course meal. They have the pancakes, the duck/plum sauce, the green onion, and the side of daikon and carrot.. its UBER Delicious. :P The pancakes used are thicker than what I remember eating, when I had Peking Duck in Hong Kong like 14 years ago.. But, i just used half of the pancaked that they give you, and that helps.. You also receive duck soup and duck fried rice... with a small sorbet sampler for desert. For $32 for the duck.. its easily feeds two.. maybe even 3. Its a steal and its done the right way. They also have your typical chinese food, and it looks like they have decent won ton type soup.. They dont deliver ( which may be a good thing..) but they do have pickup. Id go back. and get the duck.... the pork.. id try other things. but the duck is the star ( fyi, the duck is off the menu.. and it would be wise to call ahead to order it)
