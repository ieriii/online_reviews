Hi! I'm a little late to the party here, but this place,The Publican, is pretty darn good. I have a hard time thinking of any place in the city I would rather have a night out of drinking beer and eating straightforward, but amazing food. Fantastic beer list meets mouthwatering dishes - from the simple, fresh-as-can-be oysters, to the porkier selections, to the hearty fish stew. The only downside was leaving the restaurant.
