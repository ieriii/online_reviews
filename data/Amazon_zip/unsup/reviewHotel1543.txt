Make sure if you stay here you specify a renovated room. I booked through http://hotels.com which boasted flat screen tv's in every room. Not ours! We had an old standard definition tv that was NOT a flat screen. The decor was awful, didn't match, looked old, the headboard was clearly the result of someone stapling fabric and batting over a piece of plywood and not very well either.  We're from Chicago and I was looking forward to staying here as a relaxing treat prior to the Rock N Roll Half Marathon since my first choice, Hard Rock, was sold out. It was not the well appointed, modern boutique hotel experience I expected, and to add insult to injury our view was of our first choice hotel! Save your money, our room at La Qunita was way nicer and less money.
