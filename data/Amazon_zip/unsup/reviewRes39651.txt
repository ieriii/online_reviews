Decided to finally check this place out a few months ago at 3 am on a Friday (tech Saturday morning) night. Awesome meal. Cool experience bbqing right there at the table. The portions were very generous and all the beef dishes we ordered were really great.  We were seated right away and our servers were very attentive. I'd love to come back here with a big group some late night soon. It was a fun and filling time. **Other reviewers were right..beware you will smell like Korean bbq all night after you leave here. Which isn't horrible. It just makes you hungry for more later on.**
