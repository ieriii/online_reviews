First thing you'll notice is the wait. You'll have to wait at least some 25 minutes, can be a lot more on the weekends; so go when you can afford the time. The service can be kind of spotty if the place is busy. It is also very noisy, so if you plan to have a conversation be ready to have to raise your voice and not mind the stranger sitting at the table 12 inches away from you hearing your conversation. The check is either brought to you soon after you meal is brought or you'll have to hunt down the waiter/waitress well after you've finished the meal. It's not all bad though. The food really saves this place. My girlfriend really liked the Breakfast Burrito and (for me) the Red Velvet pancakes are great. I also had the French Toast Tower, but it was way too sweet for me. I felt guilty right after the first bite and couldn't finish them. That is just me though. If anything, I would recommend you go just to try the place and then go from there. Ah and I think that a little over $3 for a small glass of orange juice is way too much.
