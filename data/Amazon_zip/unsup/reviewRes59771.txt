I gotta say, I'm shocked that there are people giving this place 3 stars or lower. I grew up in Chicagoland and have tried all of the "Famous" pizza places. It took moving away and coming back to discover the Art of Pizza. Every time I'm in I can't help but admire the diversity coming through the door, everybody loves it! Yes, it's not the place to bring a date or enjoy a lengthy meal at the table, but it's not supposed to be! Best pizza hands down, great daily specials, and no tourist bs clogging up the joint.
