I travel extensively for work, and have had dinner at most of the better restaurants in Chicago. Shaw's has been on my to do list for a while, and my business partner and I finalyl made it there this week. I could not have been more underwhelmed. A restaurant can not hang its hat simply on having a particular product. King crab legs are good, but they are good if I go get them at a high end grocery store and cook them myself. The price-point on the crab-legs was simply insane...and I have had a lot of $200-$300 per person dinners in my life. At the end of the day though, it's their place and they can price how they want.The crab cake that they served me (and charged $30 for) was one of the worst crab cakes I've had. It's a $5-10 crab cake at best. Lump crabmeat? Not a single piece. I'm from DC, and grew up on good crab cakes, and this thing was a mess of shredded meat and too much filling. Sorry Shaws, but I would never send someone to your restaurant given the price and the level of product. Overpriced and underwhelmed.
