I've been here at least a dozen of times so I think it's time for a review. I never had a bad experience here and the portions here are HUGE! This is the restaurant that I went on my first date with my fiance. So it is very nostalgic for me! At the time, he lived right down the street so I immediately thought of this place. They have great drinks, appetizers, salads, bread, pasta, sandwiches, desserts. The list goes on. If you have the patience of the many tourists that come here and the large crowds... you must give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!
