I really had the worst experience of my life at this hotel. Before booking, I checked the ratings on Yelp and they were very good. BUT DO NOT BELIEVE YELP!! I went there with 4 friends and we had booked 2 rooms with 2 queen beds or 1 king bed. But they gave us just 1 queen bed in both the rooms. We asked the front desk employee (Barbara) to give us a room that we asked for or compensate. But she was very rude and said she does not have anything for the entire weekend and we have to accomodate in whatever room we are getting. Then we asked for the manager (Shannon) who was not available at the time. We asked them to have her call us back but she didnt for 2 days. Then again I went at the time Shannon was present. She was ruder than Barabara. She told me told me that she does not want to talk to us and asked us to go back to our room. Jeremy, Shannon's manager also didn't call us after leaving several messages. We were here for 3 nights and for all the 3 nights we ended up staying in the 1 queen bed rooms. Everybody was really rude. To top it, the hotel is really dated with dated and stinky rooms. I WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!
