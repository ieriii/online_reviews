I think that I'm probably biased about this place but it is my hands down favorite Greek food. My family has been going here for years and the first thing we always do is order half of the appetizers on the menu. Taramasalata, cold octopus salad, skordalia, hot lima beans, fried zucchini, saganaki oh my! Seriously we order the largest size of these starters (sometimes we order two I swear we have a huge family) and eat them in record time. Avoglemono soup (egg lemon) is another family favorite as well as the heaping amount of crusty bread. Half the time we don't have room for the entrees but it's not a problem. That said I have not had too much experience with the entrees but I love the beef shish kabob which has tender succulent meat. My mom always gets the pork chops or baby octopus and has never had a problem with either. The wait staff is uber friendly and they have free valet parking which you can't beat. The prices are moderate so expect to spend some moolah. I've never had a bad experience so I say go there try some of the appetizers an have a good time!
