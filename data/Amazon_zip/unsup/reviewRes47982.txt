I love The Publican. No doubt on my top ten, all time favorite restaurants list. I haven't had anything here that was not superbly crafted and surprisingly delicious. If you are a fan of charcuterie, this is your candy store. I've had the spicy pork rinds, a selection of oysters, steak tartare, sweetbreads, boudin blanc, pork pie, pork & foie gras terrine, head cheese, black pepper salumi, morteau sausage, various pickles, and maybe a few other things I can't recall. Do not fail to order the spicy pork rinds! These are not like any you've had before. Light as air. There is always a well curated selection of Belgian beers -- including my beloved Orval -- and local craft beers. Draught and bottles. There are also many great European imports. When the restaurant is full it is difficult to hold a conversation. There is little to dampen sound. Unless you're in one of the enclosed booths, you'll be elbow to elbow with your neighbor whether friend or stranger. You'll share communal bottles of water. So come prepared to be sociable. You'll have more fun that way. If your neighbor is especially friendly, you may end up sharing food. You will spend a lot of money, but not necessarily because the food is overpriced. The problem is you will keep ordering dishes. "Let's try something else." "Hey, we didn't try the sweetbreads yet." "We need more pork rinds to go with this beer." If you are a committed carnivore with no fear of offal delicacies, you must come to The Publican. You will not be disappointed.
