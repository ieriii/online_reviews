Wow they have so many reviews they just open about a year ago. The food is awesome though. I remember knocking on the window and asking them when were they gonna open. Operated by a beautiful husband and wife team (sometimes their at the register). I love their cuban sandwiches. I always get the bistec sandwich with the little fried chips on th side. They also do smoothies. Outdoor seating is available small inside; but the delicious food make up for it. Great hospitality. You guys are gonna need a bigger space.
