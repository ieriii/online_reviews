let's be real people...sushi comes in all types; there's the artificial crab/cheap ingredients hole-in-the wall place, there's the oh-so fancy & expensive joint, and there's the uber trendy and hit or miss quality place with ultra "different" rolls.... Sushi X is a perfect combination of them all. The quality of fish used is very good /fresh & the combo of ingredients on a lot of the rolls actually make sense! I've tried many sushi places from high end to low, heck, I've had sushi fresh from the fisherman's market in Tokyo! This casual place is consistently good. The GODZILLA roll must be ordered every time.  Okay, so the decor is minimal, dark and tries a wee bit much to be trendy but I'm talking about the good stuff here... the food! The service is hit or miss but the food always hits the spot. If I have cravings for good sushi, I'm going to a Sushi X. The rolls are large & you get good bang for your buck when you visit during their happy hour time at the Diversey location. I try to give other sushi spots a try but they never do it like the X does it! :)
