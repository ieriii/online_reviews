Some of the best tapas I've had. Awesome food: the baby octopus w/ potatoes and paprika was excellent, the mushroom flatbread was savory, the diver's scallops were fresh and delicious. The presentation was beautiful as the portions left you wanting more. Our service was impeccable. My only complaint is that the wine prices are a bit higher than average (about 3.5-4 times markup over wholesale) but for a restaurant on Michigan ave it's not a big shock- restaurants have to make money somehow. Overall an authentic tapas experience and I'd go back in a heartbeat, except next time I'll order the full chef's tasting menu to see what other culinary treasures they're hiding.
