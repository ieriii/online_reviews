I ate here again the other night. I JUST finished eating the leftovers.....and I'm already craving it again.  Why do you deserve 5 stars? Well....... I love the fact that you notice the marinade is getting too burnt and clumpy on the grill and change it with the blink of an eye. I love how you give us so many sides we have to build a pyramid in order to make room for everything on the table. I love that you do not bother us while we are eating, but are only an "excuse me" distance away just in case we did need something. Your meat is so damn tender and flavorful it's almost disgusting.......  I already miss you. I miss the smell you left on my hand that I continued to smell the rest of the night, and the burps that I forced up just to have the taste in my mouth......SSGS, Tea.Tea.Why.El.....
