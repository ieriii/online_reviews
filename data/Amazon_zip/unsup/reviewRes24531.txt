I left my hotel in Greektown to search for a good, cheap, gyro at a casual restaurant suitable for a solitary person in a strange city. I'd previewed the menu for Artopolis online before hitting the pavement to explore eateries in the neighborhood and had crossed it off my list because they didn't have a gyro. However, when I saw the place from across the street, after passing greasy dives and large, expensive iconic establishments, this place looked just right. And it was. The menu consists of mostly lighter lunch-like fare, or so it seemed. I was actually impressed with the heft my sandwich, the Mediterraneo: sliced roasted leg of lamb, dijon mustard mayonnaise, tomato, green leaf, mint, on rosemary bread. It came with a potato salad that was perfectly dressed; not too many ingredients and not over seasoned nor too "saucy". The lamb was tender and warm, but not so much as to wilt the lettuce or turn the tomatoes into ketchup. And the bread! Chewy, European style bread with rosemary? Awesome. After I started eating I decided that it would be nice to pair it with a glass of wine ( I know, it's just a sandwich but...). The ever-attentive server was there like a State Farm agent. She even suggested I taste a few of the wines to help me decide. I'm no wine snob, but I think the house Greek red wine went well with it. I want to order something at a restaurant that I can't make (easily) at home and that is exactly what Artopolis delivers, especially in the dessert department. There were at least 30 desserts on the menu and all of them looked good. I can only attest to the delectability of the dark chocolate mousse, however, because I was completely stuffed after consuming it. I rarely get dessert and am not really a sweets guy, but wow! It was delicious. And the Greek coffee I ordered was its perfect companion. Really the only thing missing was MY companion. I'll have to find a way to bring my wife here some day.
