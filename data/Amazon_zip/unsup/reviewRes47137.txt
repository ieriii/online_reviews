So I went back... I try so hard to like this place- I swear I do. It is so Meh. I got a cob salad that was OK. Soup that needed salt and I asked for it and by the time they gave me the salt the soup was cold and why can they not just put salt on the table. I mean I like things saltier than others. You are not so awesome that you must force people to ask for salt if they want some salt. The person I was with thought her food was good but was annoyed with our waiter being so slow to bring salt and the bill. I still want to like it but ohhhh. The deserts were OK too. I got the icedcream and at $7 it was a good value and the chocolate and vanilla were good but the peanut butter was awesome. It was so so salty but great! The smores dish was pretty good but for $7 not a real value as you could hardly share it. I am sorry and feel bad and want to like it but I just gotta give it a 3 and hope no one wants to go there again. It was 54 dollars for two soups, two salads and two deserts.
