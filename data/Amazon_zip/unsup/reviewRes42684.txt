Came to Gilt bar for date night and had a wonderful experience. We started with delicious cocktails at the bar and were seated within 10 minutes. The place is gorgeous! Dimly lit and overall delivers a romantic vibe. Our server was pleasant and gave great recommendations. Started with the roasted bone marrow with red onion jam and toast- delish! sweet n' savory wins me over every time. The coal fire rib-eye and smashed potatos did not disappoint. We finished with the heavenly warm milk chocolate brownie. This place is on my top 5. Great for a romantic date or a night out with friends. Curio is downstairs, feels like you're drinking fancy pants cocktails in a library, but not Harold Washington library because it didn't smell like a urinal. It was a bit too dreary for a night cap.
