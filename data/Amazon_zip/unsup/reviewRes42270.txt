I have been going to VN town for the past 30yrs and places change from time to time. Tank Noodle used to be my favorite until last week. I had ordered 3 dishes including their pho and the portions have greatly been reduced by a drastic amount. I was so surprised I asked the waiter if they had changed cook and pointed out my disappointment. The attitude was pretty much "oh well". I will no longer revisit this restaurant. Pho Xe Lua is now my choice for pho when I need my pho fix. By the way, 777 quality in food has also diminished. It seems to me, the more popular a restaurant gets, the stingier they get.
