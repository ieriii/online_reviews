Love, love, love this place. Great looking place, serving yummy organic food. This family really has put there heart into this restaurant. I want to mention how awesome the chilaquiles are... can you say mmmn. My mouth waters at the thought of them. I also enjoyed a nice carmel latte, which puts starbucks to shame. This family is something from Nana herself right down to her grandchild, whom I believe calls her Nana. I waited a bit for my food, but I suppose that is to be expected being the first week. I must say that I didn't mind the wait... I had the beautiful sister as my server who was very accommodating. She certainly loves her brothers and actually cares about any feedback to help them succeed. This is my new favorite place. Bravo to the brothers and keep up the good work, I mean food!!!
