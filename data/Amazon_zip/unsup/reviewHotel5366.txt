I booked my room through Hotwire, so the hotel staff refused to give me a king size bed. I was told the rate guaranteed me a room, but not a specific bed type. It wasn't until Hotwire phoned the hotel, that I receive a room with a king size bed. Also, I called and requested a bottle opener. I was told I had to come to the front desk to use it. The room was very warm because of the outdated ac unit. The walls were paper thin. The pool and location was nice. You get what you pay for.
