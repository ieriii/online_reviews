Love, love, LOVED my room. I got a standard king bed, but the room was very spacious. I think it might have been the floor-to-ceiling windows...even if they did face a high-rise condo building. So don't walk around in your undies, ladies and gentlemen. The shower was uh-mazing with a rain showerhead and see-thru glass wall into the bedroom. Again, don't forget to pull those shades :) Every night while I was gone to dinner, they came and did a turn-down service and left these adorable chocolate-dipped fortune cookies. Me likey! And the gym has the coolest equipment I've ever seen. They have two treadmills with TV, Ipod and Radio options (and personal fans), an elliptical with the same options, and a stair stepper. I think I saw a stationary bike or two. They also have free weights, exercise balls and these wall units that looks like a bow-flex machine. Oh - and they provide ice water and towels so don't worry about bringing your own. The only thing that bothered me during the trip was the elevators. You have to put your card in to get to your floor, and I'm all about safety, but you literally have seconds to do it before the elevator doors shut and you're sent off to whoever pushed a button on their floor. Very frustrating when all you're trying to do is get to your room. Other than that, I'll definitely be back to Dana...the location rocks for getting around.
