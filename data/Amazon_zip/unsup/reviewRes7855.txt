Been here twice now with my S.O. and both times the visits were nothing but amazing. Today marked my S.O's b-day and He choose to celebrate here at lunch time. I think you get the best deal if you come here for lunch. The dinner and lunch menu's are the same but lunch is cheaper and not as crowded which really makes the experience more awesome. The layout is so awesome, exposed brick walls, soft lighting, lots of space so you don't bump into your servers and other people...seriously you just have to see it to understand. The energy here is wonderful as well. You just sit and relax and eat and they run around bringing you food for as long as you have your little disk thingy flipped to green. The other staff are attentive as well. They asked us several times if we were waiting for anything in particular. The food...is...so...amazing. Seriously. The variety is daunting. I don't even remember every item I tried but I remember ti tasting just out of this world. My favorite items had to have been. The fillet minion, the lamb chops, and the bottom and top sirloins(.I also really enjoyed the garlic beef even though it was on the fatty side). All cooked to perfection with the right amount of seasoning and smokeyness. In order to understand how perfect it all is you really have to taste it for your self. The salad bar is also good. They have some excellent cheeses and the smoked salmon is just some of the best that i have had. Also they have a huge selection of desserts. Since it was his birthday my S.O. ordered the flan and it was simply fantastic. (They even put a candle on the plate and spelled happy birthday in strawberry sauce on the plate) Again I cannot emphasize how awesome this place is. The staff seriously do whatever they can to make you feel welcomed and comfy, the atmosphere is wonderful, and most importantly, the meat is more-than-amazing!
