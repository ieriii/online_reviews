This place was delicious, even for someone who was flu-stricken. My dinner companions luckily knew beforehand that there would be a wait, so we were, at the very least, forewarned (as you are now, dear Yelp reader). Even on a random Thursday night at about 9pm, we had an hour-long wait. The waiting area is not huge, but Bevi Amos is conveniently across the street and an ideal area to wait. We opted to wait in the front of the restaurant and "feasted on eyes," to be lame, on the lovely rustic decor. For dinner, we ordered in groups of 2 or 3 since the plates are "small." Between my dinner partner and myself, we ordered 3 small plates, shared a great deal of it with the rest of the group, and still ended up arguing about who had to finish the dishes. I have to say, Davanti is NOT stingy with the good stuff. Someone at my table ordered the pate and it came with a really generous amount of it. The sea urchin and crab pasta that we ordered had big CHUNKS of crab -- not fake crab, not shredded crab, but great big chunks of crab that looked like it was removed straight from the crab and placed into our pasta. There were also various dishes involving pork belly, which is always a huge plus in my book. We got the appetizer of crispy pork belly which made me want to wriggle around in delight like a happy piglet (ignore how disturbing this sentence actually is, please) and our dinner companions got the pizza topped with pork belly which appeared to vanish fairly quickly.
