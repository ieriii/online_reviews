First off, the prices are great and the owner is incredibly friendly. We tried the Chicago Dog and a fancier sausage. The Chicago Dog was tasty, and only $1.75, but the toppings were a little light compared to other places I've been. The fancier sausage we had was good, but it was hard to taste anything listed in the description except sausage. We went on a Monday, so no duck fat fries. The cheese fries were ok, nothing to write home about.
