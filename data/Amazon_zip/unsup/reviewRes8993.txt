The best pho in town! Unlike other pho vendors, Le Colonial does NOT give you options, but serves a perfect bowl of pho. The appetizer Ca Bam Xuc Banh has generous portions paired with a seemingly Thai Crispy cracker. Vietnamese-Fusion dish? Ha Long Fizz was a nice variation to Mojito. Excellent service and friendly.
