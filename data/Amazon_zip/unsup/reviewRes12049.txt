This place is amazing! We had a 9:00 reservation so we pretty much just missed the rush. The drinks were delicious, the best mojito I've had outside Puerto Rico. We started with tostones and baked goat cheese. The tostones were really visually beautiful, crisp, and tasty. The baked goat cheese was flavorful, and perfect on the toast it was served with. For our entrees, my boyfriend had one of their yellow fin specials, and I had the cuban chicken from their traditional menu. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and served with traditional black beans and rice and sweet plantains. The presentation was beautiful, and the combination of flavors reminded me of some of the best restaurants i've been to during my travel. For dessert we shared the Mexican chocolate mouse, which again was presented beautifully and absolutely delicious. The amazing food combined with the friendly service, makes this place a must. I will definitely be returning.
