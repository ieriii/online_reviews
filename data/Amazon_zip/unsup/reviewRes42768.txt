Ordered from Seamless last night...really disappointing pizza! The garlic knots were decent, although not really traditional garlic knots. Also ordered the house salad and was disgusted.. brown lettuce, overwhelming amount of cheese, and things that looked like somewhat like they might be mushrooms but tasted terrible. Boyfriend thought it was ok, but I will not be ordering from them in the future. I equate this experience to flushing money down the toilet...
