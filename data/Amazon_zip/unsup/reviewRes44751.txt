My first experience with Giordano's was when I was just out of college in town for audit training with Arthur Andersen out in St. Charles. Of course, a group of us took the obligatory party trip to Rush and Division. After a few pops, we decided to get a slice of pizza. The doorman at the bar, when asked where we could get a bite of pizza, whistled a cab, pushed us in, and said "take these boys to Giordano's!" We were shocked when the server would only give us a medium pie. Little did we know what we were in for. What a great new experience! That was 22 years ago, and I always go to Giordano's when I'm in town. OK - Gino's East as well!
