This review is a month late, but hey, I still need to review it. Came here for the New Year's Eve prix fixe menu, which ended up being $125/pp for what I remember to be a 5-6 course meal. The price annoyed me a bit because I distinctly remember seeing on one of the NYE websites that earlier seating was only $75/pp, so expecting to pay $50 less was not the best part to start the meal. Anyways, not a big deal since we were already here. No amuse bouches and I suppose on NYE, everything has already been made in the back, which is a bit lame when you're paying this much. Some of the dishes were awesome - like the lobster with tapioca dish, but others were unimpressive (some type of fish wellington). Overall, the service was decent - a bit of a rush since they were trying to make the late seating, but we got a tour of the kitchen which was a nice finish to the night. I probably won't be back, but don't let my review discourage you from trying this place out. I can see the potential - it just didn't shine on NYE.
