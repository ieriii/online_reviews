The atmosphere is particular but I love it. Right from the outside the place looked "shady" with the wooden door. Once you get in the small corridor makes the place even more mysterious until you get inside. I was surprise how the place was actually trendy with the dimmed red light, tall nice chairs, funky tables and the big bar. The drink and snacks selections are great and offer original/creative choices. It's one of my favorite lounge in Chicago, more interesting than the fancy lounges located downtown and more sophisticated than regular neighborhood bars.
