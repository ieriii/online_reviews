What can you say about a place that's already been reviewed so many times? Well.. The risotto and tortellini in the salad bar is really good. That's something I always have to get a little of when I'm there. Oysters are huge and fresh.. really good.. Everything else is okay. Some of the gauchos took forever to come to the table. I wanted some shrimp, but a big table took all of them and it was a long wait to get more.. Ah well.. The meat is really good here though I think the beef ribs were the best.. Speaking of which.. it seemed like some meats came out more than others.. Desserts were good especially the papaya and ice cream blended together.. Banana creme brulee was also really good.. Chocolate mousse was good, but one person at our table said it tasted like jello pudding which it kind of did, but was still good. Only 'eh' dessert was the tiramisu.. Overall with the service and the food I'd say this place is more than just okay. I've had experiences here with great services to times when it was pretty ridiculous for the sub-par performance.. Price is hefty at ~50 pp, but I would suggest only going if you have a coupon.. If only yelp let us give half-stars. This place is a solid 3.5 in my book.. It's a place I wouldn't think about going to myself, but would if people really wanted to. It's just not worth going to more than occasionally even with a coupon... Go to Fogo de Chao if you want to pay a bit more and get a better dining experience.
