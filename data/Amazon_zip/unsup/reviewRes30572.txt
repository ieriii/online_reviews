I took a few clients here for dinner last night and we had a great time. It is super dark inside, but very elegant. The decor kind of disappears into the darkness, very cool. We got a drink at the bar first where they had a guy playing piano which was fun. They pour a nice size glass of wine I have to say too! (Always a good sign!) They remembered my name when we walked back up to the host stand to be seated, impressive. Everything about this place is top notch. Our server was great, super friendly and not overbearing at all. We got there a little early (6:30) but the whole place was full by 8. The menu actually has a ton of seafood on it, I wasn't really expecting that, but it was delish. We had the crab stuffed mushrooms and a burrata and tomato salad to start. Both were amazing, the mushrooms were huge! (A continuing theme throughout the night) I had the halibut (my fav) but all my dining companions ate steak, which they said was amazing. The portions are enormous! The garlic mashed potatoes were great and we had asparagus as well. We also ordered the 'colossal onion rings' which were, in fact, colossal! They were sooo good though. I had to try the butter cake based on all the hype I had heard. It lived up to every expectation I had! It was to die for and probably clogged a few of my arteries, I'll have to hit up the gym today! You must get this if you go here! I'll definitely be back, a great place to entertain. Your bill can run up fast, but I wouldn't say it is extreme compared to other places in the city. I also loved how at about 9PM they open all the curtains in the dining room so you can see the city. It totally changed the look of the place! Bravo!
