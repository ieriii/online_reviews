The Gage elevates the Irish Pub to near epicurean levels. I brunched there with a group of five today, and we were all very pleased. The atmosphere was buzzing and the staff very friendly. I enjoyed a bloody mary at the bar with the bartender who hails from Ireland. Later I had a bloody caesar, which was perfect. She showed me the extensive libations menu. In addition to an amazing selection of wines, hard liquors, beers bottled and on tap, The Gage offers some really fancy custom made cocktails and alcohol-free sodas. There were great lunch specials (smoked pork sandwich served with an egg on top), a REAL irish breakfast with black & white puddings, broiled tomato, homemade rustic bread and baked beans, and a fantastic prime burger served with carmelized onions and brie. Don't forget dessert! We enjoyed a selection of their homemade ice cream (peanut butter), gelato (malted milk), and sorbet (grapefruit) as well as a white chocolate creme brulee. Lunch prices are a good value for the location and the quality of service and food.
