There are several places that I always take friends to coming in from out of town. The Bad Apple is one of those places. One of the best beer selections hand picked from around the world, hand cut garlic fries that taste like they're straight from Gilroy, CA, and the kitchen is open till 1am. Such a great spot for when you just have to get out of your place for a fun, relaxed night with friends. Added bonus: Game room with shuffleboard.
