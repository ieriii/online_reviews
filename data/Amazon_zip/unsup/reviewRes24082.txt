Whenever we are in town we meet the whole family at Greek Islands. They can accommodate large parties, the food is ALWAYS good, free valet parking, does that exist anywhere else?!!! the butterflied lamb chops are my favorite as well as the okra which I will never eat anywhere else. It is bustling, noisy and always fun!
