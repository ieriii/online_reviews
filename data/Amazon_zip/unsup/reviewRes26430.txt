Gawd I hate this kind of place that tries to be special event romantic but is really just a too dark subterranean cave that isn't secure enough to let the light shine. The menu is all but unreadable in the dim conditions, but when you hold the candle up to its pages you discern a pretty wide array of combinations for your fondue-inspired palatte. My most recent visit was a three-course fondue fest that progressed from cheese to oil to chocolate fondues. We dipped breads and fruits, then meats and veg, then marshmallows and fruits. While the platters appeared somewhat light on quantity, we were full-to-bursting at meal's end. A nice South African Rose Cab was especially appreciated. As a value proposition, this is pretty ridiculous. The food ingredients do not tip the quality scale and the prices are Benihana-stratospheric as befitting the special event status it conveys. The space is long overdue for a facelift, the ventilation system is unevenly distributed (you will be as warm or cold as your proximity to a vent), and the service is uneven, which is surprising given that you will provide most of your own service in a fondue restaurant where you are cooking your own meal. But while I might complain I keep going back to Geja's, although mostly with a child in tow because the fondue cooking is a form of entertainment. I see plenty of first dates there, which I suspect is a safe decision because if conversation lags there's always cooking that needs to be done; in this way it is very Benihana insofar as conversation lulls will be filled by other draws on your attention.
