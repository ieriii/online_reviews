First and foremost: Don't sleep on their espresso. I believe it's toward the end of the menu, and they do many good things with it . . . sweetened shots or a cafe con leche. I have been here a couple times and have tried their bigger entrees (more expensive) and have also tried their sandwiches too. I absolutely love their food, and I really dig their concept. Totally worth it. But I should mention their site has different prices posted. Note: Although I am a stickler for such details, this place is not loosing stripes, I mean stars.
