Violet Hour is a dark and trendy lounge. They offer small plates and overpriced drinks that have unique flavors.  They have a small room, and a long room, both with long bars and lots of cubicle style seating islands. The front entrance is ambiguous. There is an impressive and constantly changing mural painted on the front of the building, but you really need to know where you are going, because the type of business is not obvious from the outside.  Violet Hour is busy and usually has a line once the pretty people are ready to come out and play (10ish). I would recommend coming early to get a seat, before the dance music begins, but it is so dark inside that you might fall asleep if you are there for any amount of time. In fact, they want cell phones off, but you need them to read the menu. Overall, my impression is that violet hour has a certain amount of appeal, but I can't see myself being a regular here. Unless you are seated at the bar, the set up is fairly antisocial and would put me to sleep. They do a nice job with the limited food menu and the drinks, and the mural is cool. That's why I give them four stars, even though it's not for me. If you are looking for a trendy place with a dark corner to make out with your not so special someone, this could be your spot ;-)
