just got back from the pig a couple of hours ago. overall, my reaction is: good food, way too expensive, crowded and cramped. i'm not yet crotchety and ornery, but getting shoved around in a cramped space and ignored by bartenders gets a bit old while doling out $100 to still be hungry. in the time it took to try and get service at the bar while we waited for our table, we were seated (still drink-less). according to the hostess, that was 30-40 minutes. we waited for a good 12 minutes before our waiter made his presence be known. once we ordered, the food came quickly, and it was very nice food. we ordered the purple pig platter, $39 for seven different types of cured meat. two scant pieces of grilled toast, and a cheese we'd selected. we had also ordered the shredded brussel sprouts, which came in a ramekin-sized container. still hungry, we ordered the grilled octopus with smashed potatoes and summer beans. very tasty, but i believe we dropped $15 for three scant pieces of octopus? my friend and i had one tentacle each, then split the third. my advice? if you absolutely must have the gastropub experience, take your butt to bucktown and go to bluebird. the pig is nice, but the experience really takes away from the food.
