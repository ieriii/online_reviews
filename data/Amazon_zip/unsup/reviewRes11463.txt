I wish people that I know would settle down about this place! The food is good, but damn, slow down. I'm from the area, and I'm a pancake junkie. So with that being said, I'm kind of impatient and have no need to wait forever to go here on the weekend. To me, I'm satisfied with a nice, fluffy short stack with syrup and butter from the local diner. Most of the dishes that I have chosen here are good, but in reality, I appreciate the simple pleasures in life and don't need pancakes or french toast with so many ingredients on them. So many are so complicated and so sweet. I guess I'm biased. The service is average, not bad, but not overwhelmingly wonderful. Its sometimes tough to park in the area, but close to public transportation. Again, be prepared to wait on the weekends. Try it out if you like, maybe it will be more your style...
