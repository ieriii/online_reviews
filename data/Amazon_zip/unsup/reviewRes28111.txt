I've had the luxury of eating at Graham Elliot on several occassions and every time the food was stellar. My favorite is the cheez-it risotto. It is salty, it has cheez-its after all, but the sweet/tart play of the apple is perfect with it and when do you ever go wrong with bacon? I don't think it is the prettiest dish but it is the tastiest! I think the restaurant is elegant with a bit of whimsy. I felt like there were always surprises on my plate and around the corner with the popcorn, the music and the presentation and pairings of the food. Plus, the general decor is comfortable, playful and anything but pretentious. The restaurant isn't cheap but it isn't expensive. Cheez-it risotto, hot wings with budweiser foam and pop rocks with foie gras are not created in my kitchen but I am ever so thankful that they are created at Graham Elliot.
