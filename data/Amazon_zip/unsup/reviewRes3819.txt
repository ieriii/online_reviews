Heard through a friend that Crisp made a mean wing so decided to give it a shot. The guy at the counter was very helpful with explaining the menu and it's option. The wings were HUGE, so only go if you're super hungry. Everything was very tasty. This place would get five stars if they were a BYOB, because wings and beer are a match made in heaven!
