I ordered the wrong thing. After having several mexican meals throughout the week, it wouldn't have been my first choice to come here, but my husband heard such wonderful things so we went. That's why I ended up ordering the wrong thing, because I pretty much overdosed on mexican the whole week. After a week of eating tacos, guac, chips, beans and rice, it really was the last thing I wanted. So, being adventurous and not picky, I opted for the menudo. Now let me start off my saying that tripe is an acquired taste. I grew up eating it in Chinese restaurants during dim sum, but I had never had it in menudo. I figured that since I liked tripe in chinese recipes I would love it in mexican dishes. That's where I failed. The broth was quite delicious, but the tripe itself wasn't seasoned and the horrible odor was over powering. I guess every form of menudo I had ever seen (ie: Food Network or Travel Chanel), looked to have more than just broth and tripe. Unfortunately, this one had just that...broth and tripe. It wasn't my favorite and after a few bites I wanted to give up. Luckily I ordered a side of rice which is was kept me full, otherwise I would have been running for a cheeseburger after leaving. My husband had tamales, which were okay. Every tamale I have ever eaten has been filled with flavorful meats and wrapped in the softest corn masa, but this was a little bit dry which made it flaky. The good thing about this place is that it's cheap and serving size is huge. Between my husband's tamale meal, my menudo and a side of rice - it came to $13 total. However, I don't think we'll be back. For the amount of time you have to wait to be seated and the food that's just "ok" - I'd rather go somewhere else that's more memorable. My husband even said, that although slightly different menu and offerings, Cemitas Puebla is a better option.
