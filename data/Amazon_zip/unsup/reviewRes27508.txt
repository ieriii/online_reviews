I went to Pequod's in Lincoln Park tonight with Windy City Pizza Club. They took our reservation because we had a large party and honored it with a nice table in the upstairs area. The tables were nice, but the lighting was poor. I suppose the building is just old though. The menu was pretty good with a basic amount of pizza which was expected from places that specialize in making good crust. I ordered a Pan Sausage 10 inch which is a pretty awesome size wise as it feeds 1-2 people with 4 giant slices. I really like burnt crust and this was awesome stuff. They caramelize the crust to a dark brown color and crunchy texture. The pizza itself was good, not great as it had way too much tomato sauce. I really liked the crust and sausage! Obviously, I was with a group of 20 people which usually results in semi slower service, but shouldn't have been this slow. I am not sure if they didn't have enough servers on, but it was pretty terrible. By far the worst service I have ever had at a pizza place. Don't get me wrong, our waitress was sweet and nice and helped us out, but it was extra slow tonight. The pizza's took almost an hour to come out, and some pizza's got screwed up in the kitchen and came out even later than that. Water service was slow but not important as there were no bus boys on duty. Again, the pizza was definitely good, not great, and our waitress was nice, but the actual service wasn't good. The check actually came out with just a bunch of numbers on it. We had no clue what they stood for until we had it clarified for us.  I would go back, but not with a large group. 1-10 Stars would be a 6. Till next month...
