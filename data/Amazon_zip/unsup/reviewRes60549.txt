I love the decor and interior of the restaurant, it's huge! But it screams Cheesecake Factory..I'm not sure who's been around first?Service: The wait was short about 15 minutes (lunch and dinner)The hosts and servers were really friendly and helpful. Though somebody could have cleared the plates off our table faster. We almost got full on the bread before our orders actually came so service was a little slow.Food:I had a little of everything. The pasta tasted undercooked and the sauces were bland. The chicken parmesan was the only dish that I couldn't go wrong with.I would go back to try more stuff since it might have just been a bad first experience.
