Imagine if you will... You sit in your car, order your dinner from the speaker outside. A girl on rollerskates delivers your superdog which is packed in a cute little box on a bed of krinkle fries. You roll down your window and she hooks the tray onto your window. (Even if it's below 32 degrees folks. We're talking Chicago here.) The relish is a shade of green that is not natural and it tastes delicious. The pickle and tomato top the thing off to make it the best hot dog in a box you've ever had. Don't you dare put the ketchup on your dog if you'd like to live to yelp about it...
