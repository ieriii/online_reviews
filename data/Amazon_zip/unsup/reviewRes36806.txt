Best breakfast place I have ever been to--hands down! The omelettes are huge, potatoes are yummy, juices are fresh, and atmosphere is cute! I just wish everyone else didn't know about this place--the waits on weekends are horrendously long and they have practically zero space to wait indoors. Even that won't stop me.
