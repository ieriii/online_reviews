Somewhat of a last supper, I had been working in Chicago for the past year and spoke with colleagues on several occasions about trying this infamous Peking duck at Sun Wah. The reservation was made (I am told a reservation is good practice if you plan on ordering the duck) for about 5 people. On arrival (Wednesday night), I realized that the place was mostly empty and questioned myself as to why I needed to reserve in the first place. In any case, we ordered the duck meal (there were 6 of us in fact) and supplemented with some additional sides (Roasted Pork, Garlic-fried green vegetables and an additional noodle dish). I'll focus on the duck meal - Perhaps my expectations were set a little too high. Being from Toronto (Canada), I am proud to say that I think we have amazing Chinese food. The one thing about the duck meal that was perhaps my sticking point was the buns they used. I am used to the larger, thin and flat rice paper skins that are used to wrap the duck and condiments; so when I saw the buns used here, I was a bit sad. I found that with the thicker, smaller wrap, you couldn't get away with stuffing more duck in your wrap due to the smaller size of the bun - and subsequently, when chomping down on it, you don't get that overwhelmingly delicious taste of duck - it is taken over by the thick bun. Otherwise the food was good - duck tasted very well. Chinese restaurant service is.. well, as expected - so no positive or negatives to mention there.
