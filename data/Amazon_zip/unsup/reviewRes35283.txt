Shaw's had a solid 4 stars in my book until my lunch experience this afternoon. Service is big in my book and the waitress I had today has just stamped a "do not return" notice in my guide of fav's. I've realized that everything is still better at Joe's, yet the prices are higher here. Not understanding this. The place is really cute on the inside, and they have live music there on some nights (which is pretty awesome) but I would rather have an overly exceptional experience at Joe's every single time. Came in this afternoon with a friend to grab a bite before our movie. Our waitress, a frazzled frizzball in her 50's, must have forgotten to take her crazy pills because she was rude, loud and not attentive the least bit. It's almost as if she was neglecting our table because we just ordered soup, salad and diet cokes. She never once asked us how things were or if we needed anything and we had to flag her down every time we did need something. I should have tipped the bus boy instead of her because he did a majority of the work. My friend wanted an order of Large Stone Crab, but they only had the Jumbo at $56 an order. So in the end after our meal, she ended up order 1 Jumbo Claw. After about 10 minutes, our waitress storms past our table and slaps on the table while walking away blabbering "Your thing will be up soon" referring to the stone crab...This is what I'm talking about. What kind of service is this? Joe's Stone Crab all the way. Every time. I'll skip all of this nonsense next time.
