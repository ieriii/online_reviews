Salty Steaks, Bad Service, Over-the-Top Prices Our waitress was somewhat hostile, chanting her lines rather than creating a warm atmosphere. Then she left, and for over 15 minutes I sat there waiting for her to return to take our order. I requested one of the waitstaff to find her. Another waitress came over, said she could not take our order, but if we knew the name of our waitress she would look for her. The dining room has such poor lighting that everyone at the table needed to use a flashlight to read the menu although only one was supplied, then two, for four of us. If this restaurant continues to light the room this way, they should distribute a flashlight to each guest with presentation of the menu. My porterhouse steak was overly salty. The sauteed spinach had way too much garlic. The mashed potatoes also had too much garlic and unusual spicing. When I asked for a spoon with my meal, the waitress put four teaspoons on the table in front of me. Bread was brought late, and the roll was a little dry.
