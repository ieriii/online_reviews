Went about 10pm on Friday. It was still pretty busy in there, but looked like most were eating already. We got sat in the middle of the room. We were looking over the menus and a lady brought out tea and water for us. Then we just sat for 10-15 minutes waiting. I notice the table next to us was asked were they ready to order, but they said they ordered already. Then a table of two that sat after us already was eating a appetizer and had beers on the table. Still no one came by. We even closed our menus at one point, but nothing. I did notice the manager (I think) was on his cellphone in the corner. As we got up to leave he was standing at the table talking to some customers. The waiter came to the table after we got up and he just watched us leave. I looked at him a couple of times when I was outside. I wouldn't have been as annoyed as 10-15 minutes isn't that long of a time, but it was like we were ignored as they were walking by us and servicing everyone else. I'll spend my money elsewhere that appreciates it. Besides, he's trying to monopolize Chinatown. Hopefully, he can keep it consistent.
