I LOVE this place, it's my new favorite go to! I've been there 3 times in the past 3 weeks and haven't been disappointed yet. The place is always packed no matter what time you go.... only downside is if you have a small party you may have to sit and share a large table with others... not my thing, so I always wait for a smaller table. Servers are knowledgeable on any questions you have on menu items. My last server on Saturday knew I had a list of things I wanted and even though he didn't like my personal choice, he said if I have a taste for it to get it, which I did, and I wasn't disappointed at all. The food is fresh, extremely fresh, made to order and the menu has a lot of photos to help you make your choices. Don't go there for the ambiance, the noise level can get quite loud, but if you're a foodie like me, you won't care.
