I went here with colleagues from work because one of them raves and raves about this restaurant. It's just ok. I had the ropa vieja, guacomole, arrachera, and sangria. The food was good, but pricey. The place was very, very noisy. I don't like screaming through dinner. The wait staff were very good. Would I come here again? Yes. Anytime soon? No. If a friend says, "Let's go out," would this be my first choice? No. I think I like the atmosphere at Rumba or Nacional 27 better. The food all tastes about the same to me.
