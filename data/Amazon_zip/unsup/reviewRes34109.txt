You better come here hungry! The portions are HUGE, and I'm not complaining. But if you're not a big eater, among two people you can definitely share a plate. As we walked in we were greeted by a good looking hostess who showed us to our booth immediately. The place is big and looks really new. The staff friendly and our meals came fast! I ordered the Texas omelettes with egg whites. I think they put a little too much chicken, usually I'm all for the more meat the better but it took away from the taste. I could barely get a taste of the grilled onions and green peppers that were also in this omelette. And also when I order an omelette I want to taste eggs. It was just stuffed with grilled chicken that I felt like I was eating a plate of chicken. But the potatoes were tasty and the coffee really good as well. I would go here again but not order the Texas omelette. I do really like how you can substitute for egg whites with no extra charge.
