I heard so many great things about this place so I decided to give it a try. I came over on a rainy Sat evening as me and my lady were hungry after doing some all day drinking. I heard the margaritas are the biz here, but we didn't do any because we had been drinking beer & champagne all day. We were taken down a narrow hallway to a separate dining area from the front main bar area. They brought us chips & salsa which were just ok. For my meal I got the enchiladas and my girl got the steak fajitas which made her sick. Sh was also upset that the fajitas did not come on a skillet. My enchiladas were ok as I have had much better. Im giving three stars because the staff was really nice. Not sure if I would come back as I was not impressed by the food.
