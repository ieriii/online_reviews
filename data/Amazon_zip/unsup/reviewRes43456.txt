This is THE place for GOOD well priced true Chicago style pizza. There are usually 10-15 different pizzas available by the slice at all times. Stuffed, pan, and thin crust pizzas with all the imaginable toppings. It's a place tough to be on selection alone but add in how truly delicious the pizzas is, and it's clearly #1 in Chicago. I would shell out 5 stars if the dining room experience was a little more organized and clean.
