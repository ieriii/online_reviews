Based on the reviews of my fellow yelpers, I finally checked out this spot last night and split a thin crust half-cheese half-mushroom with a gal pal of mine. For a 12" and two diet Pepsi's, it was approximately $15, so not a bad deal. The pizza was great - really stretchy cheese, really flavorful, and the sauce was great, too. I appreciate that it's cut into squares rather than triangles (I don't know, I just like it better that way). Probably the first GREAT thin-crust pizza I've had in Chicago. I mean, sure Giordano's is there for you whenever those out of towners come calling, but I don't want pizza lasagna, I want pizza, and my exemplar for pizza is something between Tombstone and Domino's, given that I grew up eating that stuff pretty regularly. Art of Pizza delivered (so to speak - we actually ate in) a pie that was hot, delicious, and everything I could have possibly wanted out of JUST A PIZZA short of going to New York and getting that coal oven goodness. Sure the dining room is crummy looking, and no one so much as batted an eye when my friend took out a make-up case and started giving herself the whole nine yards during our 20-minute wait. But there's something to be said for a spot where you can primp (or, you know, pop pimples or something, if you want, although, eughhhhhhhhh) before you eat. The pizza's damn good, so just go eat some already!
