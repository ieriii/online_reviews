Creative, extensive cocktail menu. Very reasonably priced at $12 a drink. The food I've tried has been good, but not great. Sometimes service is great and friendly, other times it's absent and aloof. Intimate, dark atmosphere with cool high-backed chairs. Makes it feel a little like Alice in Wonderland.
