I rave about this place to ANYONE from the burbs who wants to eat out somewhere that isn't a chain. I always take them here. The waithelp is okay, just takes our order and leaves, which is okay, but takes a while to get a water refill. It's also BYOB which is nice to bring a bottle of wine to have with dinner. The seasonings on their meats are TO DIE FOR! I couldn't get enough of the steak!! Just writing about it makes me want to eat there tonight!!
