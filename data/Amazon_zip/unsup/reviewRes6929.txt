Went there last night after playing a bit at Dave & Buster's. Found the place on Yelp so went in without a reservation. Sat at the bar area in front and watched the Hawks game during dinner. The decor inside was super cute, nice place for a date or girl's night out. Free chips and pickles were AWESOME. So delicious. I was really hungry so I totally ate too many chips in the beginning. I got Kobe beef brisket sandwich + poblano cornbread. I thought the beef was so melt in your mouth yummy. But I wish it was warmer. Especially the cornbread. Bf got the half slab of baby back ribs + regular cornbread. Dry rub on the ribs, good, not great. Also could have been warmer. Cornbread was huge on his plate, but it also could have benefited from being warmer Mac n cheese appetizer. Creamy and delicious with a bread crumb crisped on top. Good stuff. We were too full for dessert.  Service was really good, even though we were sitting in the bar area.  On our way out we saw their little private room that would be great for a birthday gathering. But I just wish all the food was warmer =P
