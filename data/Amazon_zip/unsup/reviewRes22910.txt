Just a great place for one heck of a big hot dog, nestled in fries. Don't use the drive-in part, so can't comment on the wait staff, but never had a problem with take out or eating in. Never had a cold dog, lukewarm fries, and all the condiments were fresh. They have other items like the burger and other fish fares, but haven't had them. Sodas are standard, and shakes are quite good, better than McDonald's and not quite par to your local endangered candy/snack bars. Save that ketchup for the fries!!!
