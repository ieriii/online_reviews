So I'm looking for a place in Chicago where I can get a SLICE of pizza, not a whole pizza, just a slice. In New York and Jersey there are places on every corner that specialize in slices of pizza. Not in Chicago. So I read the rave reviews about this place and they sell slices so I drive down to try it out. Can you say MEDIOCRE? BORING? NOTHING SPECIAL? I truly don't understand what all the fuss is about. It has the same old too-thick pastry-dough crust that all Chicago pizza has. Poor, silly midwesterners. You don't know what good pizza is. LOL.
