Category: Indulgent - 3 stars Food: B 1) Empanada Combination Plate: B- Maybe it was an average night, they were a bit bland & the meat was mushy. Texture was like overblended spicy tuna roll insides 2) Entrana (Skirt Steak) & Calamari Combo: A- Calamari had great flavor & cooked perfectly. Skirt Steak was good but wasn't marinated like your typical SAmer SS. Kinda like American steak meets South America blend. Requested Med Rare, got med rare, so that's a plus.  The chicken is pretty good too. Grilled shrimp was the best out of the 4.  The yucca & potato were hard, dry & awful. Sweet plantain, awesome.  Drinkypoos: B 1) BYOB M-Th: A!!! 2) Didn't go on a weekday. Booo. Got the 1st Malbec on their bottle list. It was better than average. $30 Atmosphere/Service: A- Cool place, weird life size poster on wall. Service was decent Price/Verdict: It's not over-the-top pricey & I was def. full. But for $45 bucks, I'd like to be "satisfied". Beyond the 2 main "meats", I was left wanting. Wouldn't be opposed to going back - Next time, I'd do the calarmari/shrimp combo, only not sure if that'd be enough food. : ( Tip: For Great (traditional flavored) Skirt Steak try 90 Mile
