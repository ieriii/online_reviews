I loved Sunda. Got: -Pancit Canton (Filipino dish - noodles) Reminded me of home :) - Lumpia (Filipino "spring" rolls) Reminded me of my Filipino parties - Chicken breast Bahn mi - so fresh & light. The bread could've been thinner and not as hard - Tempora Walnut French Toast - SO GOOD - Braised Pork under a poached egg atop pan fried rice cake - Rice cake was WAYY too hard but pork was made perfectly - Indonesian Rice - So good! - Raspberry tea - beautifully displayed. Came in it's own tea pot and honey - Mango Mimosa - So gooooodd We went on a Sunday afternoon and there weren't too many people there. Staff was friendly. Ambiance and decor was beautiful. I'd go here again. It's a bit pricey, but worth the display, environment and food.
