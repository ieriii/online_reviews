I feel strange writing a third five star review for Glenn's. I love Glenn's. I could go on into a long and deep length about how I always enjoy the atmosphere, the friendly staff and the presentation of everything at Glenn's. I could further go on about the depth of the menu and how everything I've ever tried here has hit the spot. I could also mention how every time I have out of town guests this is where I like to take them and we've always had a great meal. But I'm not going to mention those things. I'm going to talk about the last thing I ate there. I was dead set on having my Crab Cake Eggs Benedict but a recommendation from the waiter sounded so disastrous that I just had to try it: Seafood Strudel. Seafood Strudel? Strudel is a desert? One I typically don't care for... how are they going to merge that with seafood I love? I read the menu description:Shrimp, crab, hardboiled egg, cheese, pastry, topped with mushrooms and hollandaise sauce. "This could be terrible... Why am I considering this?" I thought. I order, it arrives. You know what happens next right? I mean you saw the 5 stars above right? It defies all odds. It's wonderful. It's one of the tastiest things I've eaten in months. Savory, complex flavors and filling. Mixed with a side serving of spinach... it's just tremendous. My girlfriend asks me "Better than the Crabcake Eggs Benedict?" My pause to ponder this surprised her... "I don't know. All I do know is that before this weekend is over I'm writing Glenn's another 5 star Yelp review."
