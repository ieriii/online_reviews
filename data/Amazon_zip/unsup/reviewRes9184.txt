So we decided to try out this place and the first thing that impressed was the range of delivery. Between the Lake shore and the Pulaski and I no they deliver as far south as Diversey. Second was how fast they were able to get our order to us.. Loved the skewers and the Aash soup along with the Lamb shank which was very tender and literally fell off the shank. great spices and flavor in there meals as well.
