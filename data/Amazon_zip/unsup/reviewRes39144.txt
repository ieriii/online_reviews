One day something strange happened. I had a management directed day off and didn't know what to do with it. Well a few of my coworkers, who I'll refer to as my friends from now on, and I went to play some basketball. Tired, in need of more water, and HUNGRY, we decided to take a little trek to San Soo Gab San. Now, I've had Korean BBQ before, but this was my first visit to SSGB. Luckily for me, one of my friends is Korean and knows how to do a little talking. We ended up getting Kalbe, squid, and octopus. All of the little dishes with it were great and we had so much food. As far as the meat goes, yeah again, very nicely done. The marinades on all of them were great. Service was semi slow, but overall a great place. I have been back a few times since and everything was the same as the first visit. The last few visits, I took some other friends who had never had Korean BBQ, or even heard of it, before. Well, they are pretty huge fans now to say the least.
