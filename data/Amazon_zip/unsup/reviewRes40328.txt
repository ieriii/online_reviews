Amazing! Went here with friends in from Miami.....amazing dinner/evening! Great food, great service. Only downside- it is popular and they don't take reservations. We only had to wait 40 min.- well worth it! Highly suggest the meatball apps, the duck confit app and the duck as an entree. Meat heavy menu.
