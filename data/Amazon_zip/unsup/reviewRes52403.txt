Cholest-O-Rama! After having a go at the lavish salad bar, we were beset by an endless parade of skewer-bearing carvers, offering us various forms of beef, lamb, chicken, shrimp, and sausage--a total of 17 different items, according to the hostess. Wonderful stuff, which should no doubt be followed by a Lipitor sundae.
