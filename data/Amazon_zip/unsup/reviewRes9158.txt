I guess I was expecting something different when I picked this place - I thought it would be "divier" and on the inexpensive side. Instead, it ended up being kinda fancy and somewhat expensive. No more than other nice Persian restaurants, but more than I was looking to spend at the time. With tax and tip, dinner cost something on the order of $50. The food was fine but probably about the same as other Persian restaurants in the city. I just don't think it's worth a trip to Albany Park.
