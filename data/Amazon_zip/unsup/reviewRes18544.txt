I really really wanted to like my experience here. I saw a snip of the restaurant on TV saying how romantic and cozy it was and I knew it was where I wanted to go for my special night with my boyfriend. I visited yesterday (valentines day) with my boyfriend for a dinner with reservations made a month prior. Admittedly, we were about 10 minutes late but had called and they said it would be no problem to get our table. We walked in with no host to greet us and a large group of people wondering who to talk to be checked in. We ended up being told they overbooked the restaurant and ended up waiting an hour for our table along with another couple. We were asked to move so they could make a table by the drafty front door? (we declined). The minestrone soup was fantastic, tasted so hearty like grandma made it special. We split the spinach gnocchi with gorganzola cheese sauce which I felt i could have made at home for way cheaper. The tiramisu they said is homemade and tasted like it, delicious! Our server was hardly hospitable, rarely came to see if we needed anything. I I had to ask several times for more bread and finally received it when i was finished eating. Though they did give us a tiramisu for having us wait for the table, I was left disappointed with the overall experience, wondering where my romantic dinner night was.
