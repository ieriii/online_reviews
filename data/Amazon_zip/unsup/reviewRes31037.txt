This is exactly what Bridgeport needed. A perfect little breakfast, brunch, and lunch spot within 5 minutes from my work. The service was outstanding from beginning to end, lots of smiles and everyone happy to be there. My lovely dining partner and I enjoyed a nice quiet table with semi-alfresco dining since the doors open out for a great street view. Luckily, it was a perfect day out and we got the optimal amount of enjoyment. I got the grilled cheese with veggie chorizo and home fries... both were outstanding and I finished every last drop. I want to go back again but a little earlier so I can check out the breakfast menu that I've only heard great things about. I think in one more dining trip this place will be getting the official 5 star bump.
