After our meal, we were presented with a check with prices higher than listed on the menu. The server pointed to a type written piece of paper taped to a condiment bottle that said, "due to rising prices we are raising our prices from 25 cents to $2.00 per item, please bear with us until our new menus are printed." Not wanting to cause a commotion I paid it since I was the host. Is this legal, there must a law against this? Increasing prices on a new menu is one thing, but adding a surcharge to every item is tacky and hopefully illegal. On top of this insult, the food was average, probably because they are now too busy and now more expensive. I suggest going to Chinatown South were the food is better and more reasonably priced. a former customer of Sun Wah
