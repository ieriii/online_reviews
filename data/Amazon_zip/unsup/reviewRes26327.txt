This is by far the best fondue restaurant in Chicago. The atmosphere is dark and romantic, the service is wonderful, and the food (and drinks) are divine. I suppose my only criticisms are that, when the restaurant is full, you can literally be back to back with the people at the next table, which is annoying. Also, I wish Geja's would offer different chocolate fondue options besides just dark chocolate. The best chocolate fondue I have ever had was at a place in Indiana (I know, random) that offered milk chocolate and white chocolate raspberry fondue, which was AWESOME. Admittedly, though, I am just being nit-picky. Geja's is amazing. My husband and I go there a few times a year when we are in the mood for a special treat.
