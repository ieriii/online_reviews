My wife and I went to Longman and Eagle Saturday night for her birthday, and thankfully the experience lived up to every positive review we've read. First, we arrived at 7pm, and, as they don't take reservations, we were told that the wait would be two hours. As luck would have it, a spot at the bar opened up and we were able to sit down after 45 minutes. My wife had the burger of the day, which was excellent. Great, fresh french fries. To drink, I tried the new local distillery, Kova's white flight. Excellent whiskey. I had the In any case, well worth the wait.
