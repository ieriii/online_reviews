By far my favorite pplace to grab lunch. While a sit down restaurant I have never had to wait for a seat (I don't recommend going on the weekends if you don't want to wait). The wait staff is cordial and checks in but pretty much leaves you to your own devices which suits me fine and I've spent time there doing studying for class. Everytime I go I think about ordering something different but I never do. I ALWAYS order the eggs benedict and have never been disappointed. The poached eggs, whcih can easily be overcooked, have always been cooked perfectly and the Hollandaise sauce tastes fantastic. Their potatoes are a perfect complement to the meal. I get a side of bacon and a coke and spend about 15.00 before the tip so I don't go to often due to the fact I'm a poor college student but it's by far my favorite spot to grab lunch between classes.
