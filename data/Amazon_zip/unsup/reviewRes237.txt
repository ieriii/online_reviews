Some people just go to dinner for food and drinks, but I want a complete dining experience and that's exactly what I got at Alinea. Alinea is unmarked from the outside, except for a valet parking sign. Once you walk through the doors, its like entering a fantasy land. The entryway is lit with hot pink lights leading to a steel sliding doors that reveal a sleek, modern but welcoming restaurant. Our table of four had the 13-course tasting menu with wine pairing (about 3.5 hours). Each course was an artistic, incredibly constructed masterpiece that catered to all your senses with varying textures, flavors and smells. The custom-made serving instruments went beyond functional utensils, but were engineering feats in and of themselves. And the creativity that went into each dish was absolutely amazing. One dish required you to pop a balloon of clarified butter in order to douse your lobster. Another course began with a pillow of smoke. Once the platter was placed on it, the smoke released so you could enjoy the aroma as you ate your meal. The food service was well proportioned and well paced, and the wine pairings were perfection, enhancing the dish or cutting through the flavors as needed. This dinner was hands down the best meal I have ever had, not just for the food but for the entire experience. One of my dinnermates even said it surpassed French Laundry, often regarded as the best restaurant in the world. All-inclusive Alinea cost ~$300 per person, so this is definitely not everyday affair (although I wish it could be) but if you want to go on a true culinary adventure without leaving Chicago, this is the trip of a lifetime.
